[12. Fragrance of Vedanta: Narada Bhakti Sutra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE56ifpZGzg)

namaskar dear devotees and friends hope you are all keeping well after the recess of two months last january 22 and february we thought we'll be able to start in-person class in the hindu temple of lemmon bibekan of the spiritual center but because of some construction work is going on in the retre uh spiritual center so this month we will uh also do uh this the class from the online class so god willing we shall need to read the scripture in person from the next month the title of our series that we are going on uh giving for last few years is the fragrance of vedanta and the last few years we have already started the famous advaithic many of you have attended that it's still there in the youtube and and also a very well-known devotional book dwaythic book scripture we can say that is narada bhakti suhotra we have completed the narada bhakti sutra and the and from the next april we are expecting to start another wonderful vedantic knowledge the scripture kapila upadhyayisha is the son's advices to his mother so that in the next month we will take up today we shall recapitulate the excellent teachings of the narrative as usual let us begin with this yes yes the visnu the lord visnu i bow down to him at his feet is a great lord whose mere remembrance makes one free from the bondage of birth and death yes yes what is this mukti mukti means free from the bondage and what is that bondage desire desire for what desire for the worldly objects these a very simple thing now what is the religious life of spiritual life only to understand this and to pursue to overcome that so why it is so difficult because it's the power of maya the power of god that is binding us so obviously we are going to reach to the god and we have to subdue the power of god how it is possible by taking refuge at the feet of god so when we are fighting with the power of god it is not possible if we separate ourselves from the god and then fight no it is not possible very very difficult and that is the reason the devotion is the best way why we surrender to god and we say that i am at your feet now naturally the all the power that the god was using to bind me and i was going on circling round the birth and death that will be removed so this is the way the teachings of the narada devar shinarada it says devashi brahmarshi rajashi these are all sanskrit terms raja plus rishi rishi is the seer raja is the king he's an administrator though he's an administrator still he's in seer similarly deva rishi is a divine soul at the same time he is a seer so this is the way we are going to understand that narada is a divine soul and this divine soul this narada he is going to teach us about the devotion of god and this is unique now what is the speciality of the narada bhakti it clearly a clear understanding of the teachings of the narada will surely take us to the lord's supreme if we can understand the teachings of the narrative that he has given in the aphorisms aphorism means sutra and sutra we have already discussed it the sutra is a perfect way of teaching in a very small one or two lines and few words and you get the complete idea and philosophy they go on explaining but the sutra that gives the hint now you have to understand that that's why the basic is necessary the way we have developed the basic of spirituality and then it is easy to understand this type of scriptures in the words of bhagavan sri ramakrishna the best path to union with god is to follow the way of divine love as taught by narada bhagavan sirama krishna advocated that in this modern age it is better to follow the path of narada why it is the combination of knowledge and devotion it is very very difficult to follow the pure path of knowledge and also the pure path of devotion so when we are combining these two it becomes easy so the best path to union with god says bhagavan si ramakrishna is to follow the way of divine love as taught by narada in the narada bhakti sutra we have already discussed and in the bhagavata it is very clearly there the in the beginning of the bhagavata when the narada is coming as a ambassador as a messenger of god and asking the vedav vyasa uh emitting the veda beyasa and the hearing that veda bhasa is not happy at all in the bhagavad gita we know so veda basha was complaining to narada see i have categorized the veda and then i have composed there's so many uh other books like mahabharata and also the puranas but still i am not happy why it is happening like this then the narrator said see you have given the abstract idea of god but that is not acceptable for the ordinary people what they will do you understand what is this and you understand what is that because you are a very a pure soul as a person but what about the ordinary people what they will do so when you are asking them to meditate it is not possible for them to do that they cannot control their senses when you are asking them to a discriminate that is also not possible for them what to discriminate how to discriminate and their mind is constantly attached to the worldly things how they will uh judge that what is good what is bad so all these things are there so they are suffering the more you are away from the god the more the suffering and seeing that suffering god himself the creator himself has sent me to you to solve this problem and how to solve this problem you better write about that god and his divine play i think that will be very helpful for the ordinary people do that so the narada was inspiring and that time he said that only taking the name of god is sufficient to go beyond this suffering only taking the name of god of course with faith of course with devotion and i am that pramana i am that example look at my life i committed mistakes in my life and i was fallen and from that fallen stage i have overcome all that only by taking the name of god so what it needs is a strong desire that i like to go beyond these bondage bondages of suffering the january the sixth continuously changing that we feel oh this is wonderful we are enjoying but we are not every moment we are suffering the physically mentally and and social ways so much of pain pain and pain what to do then the narada said i took the name of lord and i was fallen because of my mystics and from there the god has lifted me now i am the son of that param brahma the brahma he has accepted me as his son so it is possible so there is no eternal condemnation so one can if wish and try sincerely can overcome so narada gave that example his own life to inspire all other people so this is narada we know narada he himself is the example and he was in difficulty and he overcome that and that we know the life of narada and it is in the bhagavata now that narada is teaching us the bhakti and what is this bhakti or the devotion is the continuous conscious effort to love god the devotion is nothing but continuous and conscious effort to love god so when you are trying to love god that means in the beginning we can't see god we can talk to god only we have to have faith on the words of the realized people like narada like bhagavan si rama krishna and sirama krishna he is saying with great confidence there is god you can talk to god you can see god so hearing that those words when he believes those words and then we try to realize god the first thing is you have to have faith you have to have shraddha in sanskrit they say what is this means the complete faith in the words of the scripture and the words of the guru and who can be the guru the opto the after another terminology in sanskrit what is that after a realized soul he himself has realized like narada narada himself realized that and he followed that path now he has come to tell this is a valid path i followed i practiced and this way i have realized you can also do that it is possible only in the beginning we had to have the faith narada also had that faith he heard that there is god and god can be seen can be tucked with so obviously he followed that now after realization he is telling after the realization bhagavan sirama krishna is also asking us there is god the first step is having complete sra the complete faith in the words of the realized people and also faith in oneself i can do it i shall do it i must do it if not in this life next life but i am going to achieve it without that i am not going to sit down so that is called sarta atma so narada he is inspiring by telling his own life the bhakti and devotion is nothing but the continuous and conscious effort to love god is a loving god realization means is becoming one with that and loving means there is an object and that is god and it's so lovable when i hear about him when i talk to him when i see him every time i get great joy and in the ordinary life we have that experience in the mundane life if we love someone we like to hear the voice we like to hear about him or her we like to see and get another company also all these gives us the joy the same way the divine but the what is the difference in the conjugal in this uh the worldly love it is temporal because after some time it will all break down but in the spiritual love it is continuous the process is simple the narada is a realized one then the bhakti is a continuous and conscious process to love god and that requires faith shraddha then it says the process is very simple and why they repeat the holy name of god that's all you need not to do anything else in the gyana yoga constantly you have to go on analyzing i am not the body i am not the but i am leaving i feel pain and in the winter i see where i need the warm clothes but at the same time i am thinking no i am not the body i am not the mind you can imagine is very difficult you have to go to the root by that way of course all paths are difficult but comparing the devotional path is easy why just take the name of god if you take initiation the guru will give you the name of god just repeat the name of god that's all and you are you are having the faith on the words of the guru if i am taking the name of lord all that is within me that will go away my mind will be purified and i am going to realize god and what is that god love is an embodiment of love the process is simple the holy name of god and sometimes perform some simple rituals what are the rituals as we are inviting some other guest the honored guest we first prayed the seat then we asked him to request him to sit over there then in the olden days it is accustomed to wash the feet because they used to come barefoot mostly and naturally the dusts and all that so that was the system that developed in the eastern country washed the feet and then afterwards offer him some sweets some the water and all and then give a girl and decorate him burn an incense stick and the lamb and then talk to him this talking with him means the taking the name of lord and then one when you are talking with him you are intently looking at the lord you are meditating so the simple process the someone whom we are inviting so ritpadma asanam that dwaad i give the my heart i imagine my heart is a flower and that is a lotus lotus is a symbol of love and i invite the lord to come and see to her there and in sanskrit they will say please come here oh my lord please come here yatishta yatishta please sit on that and allow me to give you all my devotion so that is the way the process is very simple and now this speciality of devotion what happens it says sana kamayamana niro the and the seventh aphorism of the narada we have read it says there is no desire this is the specialty that there is no desire at all i love god for love's sake swami vivekananda again and again he said love god for love's sake i just love i don't need anything from you suppose i am suffering even then it's okay but i like to see you i like to talk to you i like to feed you i like to express my love my gratitude my all this way i am always with you so it says there is no desire why after giving away all desires only you get the love of god nido the rupa niroda means we have given up all other desire and then only the devotion the love of god comes when we have already given up all the desire to achieve to get to realize this love of god so there is no desire at all because we have already cleared cleaned our mind from the desire sana kamayamana nirodharupat so wonderfully the narada is mentioning that there should not be desire friends again and again when we discuss about the vedanta again and again we always repeat that there are two things are there if we say it thing one is god another is the creation of god now the god has created human being also every being everything but he has created human being and he has created human being as in the uh the in the bible we find out of his own image very nicely they have expressed it out of his own image what is the image of god image of god means god looks like me or god looks like you god looks like him god looks like heart no that is not the image image means the quality what is that quality is the clear understanding and the clear understanding and on the basis of this only the tantra another branch of hinduism it developed it is the heed it is the thinking is the capacity to understand that is the power knowledge is power they say but from the knowledge comes from the understanding so this is called from the this is the image of god the one man only can discriminate man only can judge man only can understand what is good and what is bad man means human being the man and woman both and that is the specialty the other creature to some extent they can do but we can do in a great extent and when we are utilizing that capacity to realize the creator that is called religion we are utilizing the capacity to understand and we are utilizing that capacity to understand the world it becomes science and we are discovering so many things that we are discovering things for the comfort of the human being and also to destroy the human being how from the nature studying the nature concentrating on nature analyzing the nature who are the scientists they're only doing the great analysis of everything cause and effect the same way same power same analytical power which the god has given to us and about which they say is the image of god there's a special quality so if we apply that to god the creator what will happen the great joy if we utilize the power that the god has given to the humanity human being to understand his creation we will create the different things for the human society it may be good it might be bad also it may be for the comfort it may be for the destruction but if we turn it towards god that is called religion and there is nothing the science and religion they always going to they try to compare the science and religion the science is for the external thing analysis for the external thing religion analysis for the internal thing it is only analytical capacity that god has given now when we are analyzing then we find why we are bound to this world to this life why we are taking birth again and again desire so when we cannot fulfill the desire we come back again that is the analytical way they have realized they have they understood so desire is the bondage so always they say bondage bondage bondage the bondage is these in the christian world the jesus said the blessed are those who are pure in heart what is this purity free from desire when there is no desire that is pure when there is desire that is impure so when the desire is there what type of desire different type of desires in sanskrit it's called asiana in asiana sometimes i like to be very popular that is also desire i like to be wealthy i like to have lot of power to control others to rule others all desires and individual desires are also there to satisfy these and that all desires and when we give up that desire then what remains clear mind as if the tranquil water clear tranquil water calm and you can see the bottom of the water you can see the bottom of the mine and what is there the source of joy and that is god so no that the god no no there is no desire should not be there through desire you cannot reach there to god why this now it is devotion it is free from desire sa na kama yamana that this the god is free from desire that devotion is free from desire now when the desire is come the devotion is completely free from desire to naturally nero the rupa because when we give up the desire then only we develop the devotion so this is the way we have to understand devotion is free from desire how because it is gained after controlling desire now definition of devotion we are just recapitulating because we have already started all these and it is better to recapitulate because it goes in the point by point we have read the whole scripture and so many months we have spent on that now we come to and just in one page and we put down this special the traits of this scripture and it is easy for us to remember what is there in the narada bhakti sutra one two three four like that it says definition of the what is that definition of the devotion according to narada parama bakula [Music] we give up all activities to whom to where to go and when we forget god we feel really pain that means the love what is devotion love of god love for god and how you'll understand whatever we do we just give it to the god suppose i love someone then whatever i earn i get i like to give it to him or her because i love i like to see him or her happy so whatever i get a fruit a flower some money some these i like to give it to him or heart in the the worldly love we always see they like to exchange the different type of gifts why they like to give and when we are loving god when we are attached to god so what we will give everything everything and what will happen then accept god there will be nothing in my mind and that is devotion suppose i forget to do that then really i feel pain why oh why could i forget that how could i forget god before eating i am remembering god before going someplace i am remembering god after reaching over there i am remembering god and then suppose i get something good some as a gift then i remember in god constantly i am remain because i am in love with god so that is the system of love that is the specialty of love the symbol of love constantly thinking about the beloved and that when we are doing that what happens so how we will understand that we have reached to that god that that supreme this way in devotion three becomes one and the hinduism they always say triputi veda and they give that to the sheba the shiva which is trident he actually destroyed three demons so three pura tripures all this name came from that tree three means three what are these three in devotion bhagavad bhakta bhagavan this is the coinages bhagavan si rama krishna he said bhagavat bhakta bhagavan bhagavata is the book bhagavat is the scripture so bhagavad is that love and bhakta he's the lover when he read that book when he started that book when he heard about that bhagavat he generated love for god and what is that god bhagavan beloved so bhagavat bhaktha and bhagavan when these three become one that is the final stage of devotion once bhagavatam krishna he was listening that bhagavat the holy scripture of the hindus so most of the people they'll be studying the bhagavata srama krishna is to attain to that classes and he used to listen to that and you know he was a great another his mind was so pure whenever he was thinking of anything immediately the concentrated mind is to go to that particular object one day when he was studying that along with others the one gentleman who was reading that scripture bhagavat suddenly saddam krishna saw a light came out and it touched the tree first it came out from the book the bhagavata the holy book then it came and touched his own heart the devotee and how a devotee should be pure mind free from desire again what is purity without desire when the mind is completely free from desire that is purity so the pure soul because bhagavan krishna was having no desire so from the bhagavata from the scripture one light came touched him the devotee and then went to the god the krishna the krsna's temple they were studying to the god so bhagavat bhakta and bhagavan it became a triangle the three became one that means the knowledge gyana and the student after achieving studying that then he transformed himself into the ultimate goal that knowledge the god the bhagavat bhakti bhagavan this is called the triputi veda of the devotion so this three should become one otherwise it is not complete if the god is separate and the book is separate and i am separate i am regularly listening to the book and then worshipping god but not realizing within myself the transformation the purity then it's a try good try but that is not the achievement achievement means it goes away all desires goes away and those who are bogged down into that desire they cannot imagine this how can you give up desire desire is natural desire not they'll be arguing like that but those who have understood it from different analysis it is the desire that is binding me and i am coming back again and again in different form in different life in different situation different places no i like to go beyond this and from there only the journey will begin the spiritual journey i like to get liberation and that is called mumuksuta in the terminology vedantic terminology mu means the desire to be free and desire to be free comes after understanding the futility of this life and then analyzing analysis is the basis of understanding and when we understand that develop that then the only desire is god realization then all other desires goes away the name fame this that everything goes away slowly slowly not that we become lonely no we we are with the people among people talking with them mixing with them visiting them inviting them all we do but at the same time completely detached way we are not bound by anything this is the understanding and the devotion makes a devotee very humble why humble because the ego goes away what is the ego the wrong conception about oneself re-ego is the wrong conception about oneself and when i put my hand on my chest and say i what i mean this body what i mean this thought what i mean so this if we analyze then we'll understand no there cannot be any i that this it goes away the devotion means very humble if a person with ego he is showing up with the dress and these that i am a devotee i'm a devotee he's not a devotee at all it must be the very humble that is the symbol of a devotee and because truly he has and sometimes some people apparently they will show they are very humble but at the back they are again the biting others criticizing others planning against others no they are not is a true heart very pure they won't do any harm to anyone so these type of people the humble people but they have their personality caitanya mahaprabhu was so humble the he used to sweep the road so that the chariot of the lord jagannatha should go and that was the tradition he created even even today the king of that place he comes and sweeps along with the other ordinary people to that road to show that i am humble and sometimes it has become a ritual and he will come with good grace and all that and with a good number of cameramen reporters and that is not the devotion devotion means very harmly he will do and he will do why because who am i this body the structure of bones and over that some the the all this blood and the is that is this me which will be burned after some time or buried after some time after my death this cannot be i am not this so if someone start telling that this dress is me it will be that foolishness when you say this body is me it is the foolishness like one when one says this dress is me it is not we are changing the body similarly we are changing the mind also constantly so this analysis it becomes he becomes humble and there are three stages of devotion we are just let us remind three stages first is the beginner's devotion it's called in sanskrit beginner's devotion what is the beginner's devotion so they will learn that you should first you should bathe you should change your clothes then you should come and do like these and keep the plate like this keep do this do that everything should be proper way why do they do that slowly slowly it becomes discipline if it is not with that you have to get up early morning you have to beat then you have to change your clothes and you have to go and sit for meditation and taking the name of god when you are taking the name of god you should feel that you are becoming pure your thoughts are completely free from desire and then you get up and go and prepare some at the sandal paste and it is so difficult to prepare the sandal paste there are some wood pieces you have to go on rubbing on the stone and whatever that comes out you have to keep it then you have to plug the flowers you have to plug the special type of leaves to decorate that then you have to clean that image then every day every day 24 hours you have to be very very careful about that then what happens in this training slowly slowly slowly slowly he feels as if the god is looking at him or heart talking to them and also eating sometimes the devotee they feel the god is truly eating and that way the badi bhakti slowly goes to raga bhakti devotion is a systematic another like a routine the bd bd means the system that that way we start and slowly slowly we reach to that we feel that god is listening to me and when i am talking he's smiling he's listening he as he blinking he's as if taking food and when i say it is a time for you to go and take rest he will go and lie down and i am with him it is the love it is the premade is the devotion so they're so wonderful it's a great joy for the other won't be able to see they will think oh it's a playing with the dolls no it is the great joy the devotee forgets our his or her body consciousness and they are all the time eager when the god will get up i have to give these i have two days and then talking with god and different type of in the relations are there sometimes they will relation will develop as a friend sometimes the mother and the son and sometimes the friend like these different type of devotions five different devotions bhagavan sri ramakrishna added with that five is that god is my father i am the baby i am the child so that is the way shantana bhava so this different six the way we can love god and when we can't do that when we can do that that is called prema bhakti and ultimately the bhakti the object of worship and the worshiper they become one when that is done that is called urjita bhakti if you can remember the sanskrit terminologies and finally it becomes urjita bhakti urjita means the two become one there is a beautiful song is there in bengali i've forgotten who has composed it there there's a song one line it says the forest there is a small patch of the forest the different trees are there that is called niduvana very famous in brindaban still it is there there they say the devotees they say they have seen the radha became krishna himself the radha the devotee going and merging in the person of her beloved sri krishna radha krishna means the body then there is no difference sometimes people they will project it as a worldly love as a husband and wife the lover and the beloved no it is not like that it is the individual soul jivatma going and marching with the paramatma if we can somehow understand these the jivatma is going and merging with the paramatma that is a tiny a little spark it was going around here and there then it goes back to the fire the main source it is like that the small little the drop of water then it comes down and mixed with the ocean and becomes the ocean to some extent we can understand in that way radha krishna the radha the devotee devotee is so pure and that is why the color of the radha is very fair very fear complex almost white why because that is the color of satwa and in the sattva it is all good there is no raja there is no tama there is no ego there is no inertness so these pure soul there is no desire it goes only to the god and mixed with the god and who is god purity itself because the god has no desire at all what he will desire is everything is his so obviously that is the ultimate is teaching and can anyone say about it no because it is a self-realization it's a subjective realization like the brahma-yana the ultimate bhakti also cannot be expressed so the narada said mukha sadhana that means you have to realize that in that way muka asadana a dumb person when he has realized something so he cannot express it but narada he said if you like to realize these if you like to start the journey on this path you must avoid the dusanga sarbathriba do sangha means those who constantly think about themselves very selfish type of people they cannot think about god or good or the high moral values that is very difficult for them they are do sangha sangha means the company do means bad they're very bad complaining this sangha sarva-triba but in every way you should avoid the sangha otherwise it is impossible then why if we are there what happens they are our friends and their colleagues we cannot avoid them if you are with them for just for the time being somehow it is say hey and hello that is okay but if you are constantly with them what will happen in the 44 that verse the narada said kama krodha mohas it increases karma the lost the company of the bad people unholy people increases lost in the mind of the people anger when that desire is not fulfilled anger then delusion they start loving the very fill the things also they think oh this is so good they'll be doing that smriti pancha the forgetfulness they will forget what happened or their father their grandfather they are great people and he is belonging from a very highly respected family they forget everything they will go and chew these then smoke then drink and they'll do all this smriti pamsha then buddhi nasha all the discriminative capacity also destroyed then ultimately everything is destroyed the human body it becomes a liability for the family for himself and for the society so yes now it goes on the time is almost very short i'll just remind you those who are regularly attending this class you know it or it is available all the classes are available in the youtube you can search over there this is truly so wonderful you can read the book too and it says in from the 40 46 all they will go on telling that these are the maya maya is the power of god we started our discussion with that the power of god to bind the people and it says the one who is giving away the bad company and then having the company of the great soul mohanu bhabham sebate to go and serve them they listen to them little other things also they do they'll be cleaning they'll be arranging they'll be doing this that but with a very humble mind and that only they will get the purity yeah nirimamo bhavati this is mind this is mine they should not do and by that way ya biviktasthanam sevate who can live in a solitude then keeps no relation with the worldly things and then yeah nist who goes beyond the three gunas so who can overcome the maya so beautifully narada he went on given the the hints the 47 48 49 say he going on giving it's a few four or five verses that you have to give up these these these in the 49th verse it says even scripture reading also go on reading only the scriptures and never imbibing the knowledge then some of the places if you go they only read scripture they will open the book they will look then they will chant that there's a great religious forward it's good but afterwards what is the result there's no transformation then what as a student young student i am going to school and going and going and going never learning anything then what is the result then similarly when we are developing the devotion for god going to the temple reading the scripture listening to the different type of talks then the result should be there what is the result i myself become that and what is that pure love love for everyone there is no selfishness out of selfishness rather it is service because the knowledge and the devotion it clubs together that transform the personality what is the religion is the transformation transformation from the ordinary human being to divinity to divine to god that is the goal so we must cross this otherwise it is of no use so that is the way and then when he himself can realize that he is always happy and he's always full of joy he's always positive he never feel the any way the selfishness then that person can help you to overcome he becomes guru saat tarati sa tarati salokan tarayati now this person has really crossed that ocean of samsara he has crossed the ocean of samsara and he can help others to cross the samsara so this is the way the narada is giving us the teaching is so wonderful so simple but at the same time is really really very effective so shun the bad company and try to seek the holy company what are the bad companies those who only think about the physical comfort and naturally all selfish attitudes and holy company exactly oppose it always try to teach to love others to serve others to understand others to become broad-minded and to give up the bad habit of jealousy the jealousy is the vein of our nation swami we began to say because the when we are go for something which many others are also competing then we always feel jealous so i must go i must grab that is all right to some extent in their worldly life but when we are jealous for each and everything if i am a singer somebody else is singing nicely i feel jealous if i am a doctor some good other good doctors i feel jealous so in every way if i feel jealous somebody is saying something good about someone and i feel jealous that means it's a very bad mental condition there is no chance of developing the devotion so today we have recapitulated the unique teaching of the devasta and keeping that in mind and also practicing that regularly one day we also can go to god like narada and also can become one with god like him thank you very much friends any questions there devases is asking during the time of meditation how to go beyond the stage of dreamless state by not going into sleep mode a dream dreamless state is that is a example is giving then when you go to dreamless state that means in the time of sleep sometimes we slip into that without knowing but when we come up we feel that i didn't dream that means the mind was absent and of course i am sleeping so body is inactive so what was there that is the condition that the vedantin they used to uh this example that the consciousness is there the consciousness we always associate with the body and the mind and how to understand the consciousness is beyond the body and the mind then they give the example of this and meditation it is knowingly you are i can understand that that is the way you wanted to ask this in meditation knowingly we like to go to that stage where body consciousness won't be there now if you have got any instruction from any teacher follow that or otherwise if you like to practice you can try to practice a lamp within your heart the candle that is burning within your heart and you can see the candle holder the candle and and also the flame continue to see that and slowly slowly there is no candle holder the only candle and the flame then after some time we can when you can very clearly see the candle and the flame and nothing else then abolish the candle also and try to concentrate on the flame itself and when you continue seeing the flame within you then slowly slowly march into the flame and become that light and there is nothing you cannot imagine anything this need not to imagine just you are inside that light so that is the way they try to reach to that vedantic meditation merging with the supreme self and what would be the feeling after that is a great joy full of compassion these are the effect most of the people who talk oh yes yes i have crossed all those now any other state in the yoga chatroom that is the ultimate but anyway they go on asking we have already completed those things no they are wrong because the effect is containment after that if you feel the containment that means you are in the right direction thank you vishwa das is asking it's a incomplete question are three qualities represented in tridev oh that is uh you are asking the sattva tama that no that sometimes the people they wrongly interpret no this is sattva rajatama is the quality of the maya the power of god not of god the three deva brahma vishnu
