[1. Fragrance of Vedanta: Narada Bhakti Sutras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcq-zimIAJ8)

dear devotees and friends today this saturday the first saturday morning the hindu temple of greater chicago lamont we are supposed to go over there we don't know when we will go maybe after four or five months everything will be normal by the grace of the divine mother but now we are giving the discourse as we are supposed to give over there the last 20 20 we have studied a great book and the astagra that you know that that rishi the great rishi he took us to the path of knowledge and in a place where we felt that we need not to bother about god washing and praying nothing is only me and me and nothing left over there there's a great teaching and this is the specialty of the hinduism so many people he among the hindus also some controversies are their doubts are there misunderstandings are there thinking what is this hinduism suppose you go and you feel you see that a person is worshiping a stone and he'll be saying with great devotion this is my god this is the shiva or the krishna and sometimes they'll be worshipping the animals or the trees or the big hills like that the sky the sun so like that they'll be worshipping then there are so many varieties of gods and goddesses the images and the same god having different types of forms also the goddess durga in the eastern part of india having retained hands and the same goddess durga known as sheree wali in the in the northern part of india having six hands but the hindus is okay for them they will go to 10 hands durga they will go to six angel god but there is no problem so this is the way they are all the hinduism so there is a lot of confusion the hindus they start worshiping a stone thinking that is god and the same hindu ultimately reaches to a place a point where he says i am that and he never says that i am god he says i am that that is the consciousness the consciousness that is everywhere so this is the way we have to understand and when there is a knowledge is we call it consciousness we call it brahman and the same thing when another approach is there through devotion we call it visnu the god all pervading god are all pervading consciousness friends from the beginning of this year 2021 and i should say happy new year to all of you and let this year we begin with devotion baby as a another great personality in order you'll be teaching us the bhakti the devotion and we will study narada bhakti sutra i will mainly follow the book that is by narada bhaktis and this has been published by the advaithasrum calcutta these copies of the books are available from our the vedanta society bookstore online you can place order and slowly slowly page after page apparition after person we will go there mainly 84 apparently are there not much but it will take long time to explain and this is the devotional path we will follow that was the path of knowledge and this will be the path of devotion and before starting every time we will chant this mantra yes [Music] i bow down to that great lord the visnu the great god just be mere remembering his name remembering him one become free from all the bondages yes yes just remembering and matra immediately the moment you are remembering immediately you are free from all the bondages janma samsara vandana janma and samsara janma means the birth and samsara that which is constantly changing but if we are having that constantly changing means birth and then it goes for six changes and ultimately it is death sabbath and death the two ends and there are so many changes in sanskrit it says and briya day is the date then it is the growth then the decay and all that six different changes and this changes because of the change there is no true happiness it can never be but by mistake all the time we are thinking that we will be happy if i get this if i achieve that if it is possible to reach over there and so many ways after coming over here in america and coming in contact with different people as because we are monks so obviously we see the every works of life all people and i find the people the very highly qualified people and they were so successful but still not happy after coming reaching over here in america but in other places the developing countries are under developed countries they have if you go and say that it is america they think it is the heaven even after reaching to this so-called heaven and after completing and when we come over here particularly from india they are all after sucks successfully they have to complete some of the courses then only they are coming so they are not taking the asylums they are coming as a student as professor and after the different positions but even after coming over here i have seen the many of the indians are suffering why the achievement we think that if we get the achievement and and we will get joy no why this is samsara this is the system whatever we try to get and it is going to sleep out of my hand that is called samsara and that is the reason this religion why religion then suppose i am very happy i have started i achieved a job at our business i've got money or everything that people they need i'm having those things then i'm supposed to be happy but still people are not happy why that is the question and from that christian religion begins only and only realization of the god if it can give us the happiness of nothing else and how to realize god that according to the aptitudes according to the temperaments the hindus have given the four paths it's not only one way the only one quote is there whether it fit you or not you have to put it on not like that this is a path of knowledge and we have started the whole 2020 is all in the youtube if you are interested you can go and many other xiaomi's are also given the talk on that ashtavakra meter the great path that leads us through the path of knowledge and we cannot imagine this the vein there in the scripture it says why should i have to pray why should i have to meditate why should i have to do puja oh my god is this any religion denying everything and that is the highest spirituality because then you have merged with that consciousness the disciple the janaka he was a king he had to maintain the worldly attitudes also because his kingdom means the administration but at the same time that janaka that person he reached to that point why the most of the time they say if it is a monk he gave up everything all attachment there is no bondage no responsibility maybe it is possible for him and that is why they gave the example of the janaka the janaka there was a one who was having the great responsibility of the king but at the same time his mind was completely withdrawn from all the same subjects and he reached into that highest so these are the points these are the things that we should learn it is possible for anyone any moment any time to reach to that and what we achieve after reaching over there two things one fearlessness there is no end so why should i be free afraid there is nothing that i am going to achieve or to give nothing to afraid of the completely fearlessness at the same time full of joy full of please not depending on any object anything of this world for that joy of the pleas so it is within constant joy and that fearlessness and the joy gives complete satisfaction santosha in sanskrit they say santosha complete contentment i am very happy and all the time you have to say like that i am very happy so this feeling of containment i don't have anything to achieve i don't have anything to get i don't have anything to do nothing is there but that way he is completely contained and he is happy and that is the ultimate of the spiritual life the most of the time we think the spiritual life means is it sort of a security it's a sort of insurance that after the death we will go to heaven and there will be a comfortable place for me and whatever we are having over here and ten times hundred times more joy and happy happiness and all merriment will be there in the heaven it is only the temptation that the scripture they always offer for the ordinary minds to go like that the parents always say to their children and if you are studying well going to the school every day then you will get this you will get that that young mind is not very aware about the about the knowledge he doesn't know or she doesn't know what is going to happen in the school and only because of that that their father told if you are attending these and become fast then i will give you a bicycle and for the temptation of the bicycle they are studying and slowly slowly they develop the love for knowledge and they understand so then they those people become professors teachers scientists so this is the way it goes in our ordinary life and the same way also they'll say if you are doing good work and slowly slowly you will reach into a place where you will get all the joy and that place is known as heaven in every but ultimately what and they say ultimately you have to merge with that ideology that is called god that is called the holiness so friends we will study that path of devotion how the path of devotion will take us to that and we will at this part different there are many other teachers also but we will follow the steps of the not other aphorisms of the teachings of sri narayaga bhagavan srirama krishna said in this age particularly yoga in this age when our minds are constantly running outside if you have noticed each and every place if you go where people are waiting they're not talking with each other they're not looking anywhere they're all looking to their palms because there as the smartphone is there he's going on chatting talking listening hearing the mind is always outside the in the father has asked the children to go out because he is not happy with the children they are not listening to him he said go out of my house paranchikhani bhattrinod sayonggu who is that sayonghu the self-created sayonghu and that means the supreme lord supreme god the brahmana and asked the children that is all our senses the i the nose the taste and the touch go out of my place the father said and all these five children they have gone out as if they can't come back to their home so that is the way the description it mentioned that the father has asked him to go out but some of them those who are very contented very calm very composed have understood the foley of this world they close their eyes they closed their eyes to see within battery they only go outside and see the other objects of the outside not inside but someone questioned sometimes someone will sit in one place close his eyes withdraw the senses and go to that place and that is withdrawn and he understands what is the truth so that is we have to withdraw our senses since organs to the path of the devotion that we will do so bhagavan krishna said that in this age that narada bhakti is the best application if we have to realize god try to follow the path of narada why because we will come to those the narada is teaching us all the three together devotion knowledge and action karma and the dhyana and bhakti all come together of course you have to have the yoga otherwise how can you concentrate your mind you have to make all your injuries one pointed and you have to go over there so dear friends their devotees we will continue in this way and as swami vivekananda say i am you are the maker of your own destiny we are the makers of our own destiny and we have to choose a path backup knowledge okay but very difficult very very difficult and mostly we always try to depend on someone sometimes we need the support of the people support of someone maybe parents maybe teacher maybe god and also like to go and say to someone that these are the things happening so this this is the normal easy way but the path of knowledge no you cannot depend on anyone and you cannot blame anyone you cannot everything is only you this is really really typical only few people can do of all the the disciples of bhagavan sirama krishna swami vivekananda was the perfect aspiring for the student for the gyana bhagavan salam krishna taught him the gyana mali but all they were exalted characters but even then they were they taught that you should go through the path of devotion it is easy very natural normal so we will develop that and we will study this narada bhakti-sutra and this is the sanatana dharma we will follow what is the specialty of the kali yoga it says all speed and grabbing if you see that the kali is sitting on a horse is it this is my explanation kohli has different explanation and swami vivekananda said was born from that very day satya yoga the dawn of satya yuga has come slowly it will change it takes long long time to change it's not just our the morning and evening it's a yoga yoga is a long period of time so naturally it will take but slowly it is going to change but the at present is the speed because the symbol of kohli is the horse and then is going on the knowledge tremendous knowledge is going on cutting the ignorance but the difficulty is grabbing it wants everything i want this i want that i want to reach out there i want to reach out there and everything now the businessmen previously they were so happy doing little business in a small group and then slowly slowly they started visiting the next city and the next country and now all over the world some of the companies they are having everywhere i wonder who is the owner of the company they are everywhere they are and grabbing the whole market not completely unsatisfied all the time i have to get everything that is the kali everything is too bad exactly opposite we have to go and that is god everything giving up i don't need anything to realize god only thing that we need is to the capacity to give up everything i don't need i don't want anything the worldly mind means i want i like to possess i like to grab i like to have and the spiritual mind means i like to give up everything in swami vivekananda said give everything whatever best you have and in return never ask anything so that is the way the spiritual life that is the spiritual life but practices may be from the gyana from the bhakti from the karma or from the yoga there are four paths that has been offered by the hinduism by the sanatana dharma that will take you to the goal you can practice one or you can club all the four ramakrishna mission particularly swami vivekananda bhagavan sirama krishna is clubbed all the four paths jana bhakti karma and yoga if you see the symbol that was drawn by swami vivekananda himself he will find that all the four yogas are combined there and it is taking us leading us to the goal of spirituality now who is leading us at this moment it is narada this three narada and where from we get the the idea about the narada it says the chandragunisha described the naruto a young man he is going to the sanat kumar a great teacher and this young man is going to the teacher and telling him sir i have started everything but i am not at all happy i don't know why i have started the art the science and the philosophy the scripture the music but how come that i am not happy the knowledge i am having still i am not happy this is a wonderful question what is the goal of human life to become happy but most of the time in particular in india and the eastern country they always say that you have to become somebody in the society so become a doctor become an engineer become a professor become a scientist so they will always inspire the children to become someone like they will become someone then afterwards no joy no happiness so we have to teach the children try your best whatever you can learn but the goal is to be happy the boys and girls they should learn to be happy they should develop how to live together how to adjust with others how to accommodate others otherwise the ego conflict and suffering and when there is suffering then only the psychiatric people their earning and the lawyers because the breakage so that is the way is this the human life no the wrong thing that we are doing the religion means it takes our mind to your correct and right directions and we have to teach our children the happiness is the goal of life and that happiness you may get from some of the external thing of the world but sometimes you have achieved some success little happiness and you have got that little happiness but the ultimate happiness will come from within so that is called religion don't have any misconception about the religion what we do in the temple in the churches in the synagogues in the other places religious worship places is external but real religion means it is joy and happiness within so that external things we should not take that that is the final thing and we should write no that would only help me but ultimate thing is the joy that we will learn from the narada and in his life we find in the shrita shrub the narada is approaching to his teacher and he's a great teacher sanat kumar the four kumaras many of you know again and again we have discussed about that these four kumaras these four kumaras they are the great teachers not other is going to them so we can say this is historical not imaginative narada is a character and it is there in the chandragupta is going and asking the teacher all these when we listen when we read all the references leads us to that conclusion narada is a historical personality and this nada of course when he asked what happened did they say that there are two ways there are two types of knowledges and this is not the answer of the when s another person is coming and asking this question then he says there are two types of knowledge then it gives the list of all this is secondary knowledge it won't continue even the vedas even the knowledge of the vedas there are so many things we have read a time will come and the old age nothing will remain you won't be able to remember even the name of the person standing by your side the time comes but uh experience the spiritual experience the god realized experience it will never leave you so then the highest knowledge is they say yaya by which that akshara which never decay that means the brahman the ultimate god the supreme god the vishnu who is all pervading it is always there it will there so these two types of narada he had the first type of knowledge and he said i have started art science music philosophy scripture religious scriptures but why i am not happy then the other sanat kumar will give him the teaching so this is the again we hear the bhagavatam and it narrates a brief account of narada's child narada's mother was a maid servant and she used to work in a brahmana's family there many holy people used to visit narada's mother couldn't say that in the brahmanas family the maid servants they used to leave but narada never could see his father hard about him the mother never said anything about the father but it wasn't it was no problem so this is our society it doesn't matter to where you were born the witch family it doesn't matter at all but sometime afterwards some people because they'd like to keep the brahmin thing in the highest so they say no that was the past life of the narada in the next birth he was the son of the brahman we need not to bother about that it is not the birth it is the achievement is the knowledge the narada was born in that and this is hinduism we should not try to cover up this is the truth it doesn't matter anything the brahmana means one who has achieved that brahman that is brahmana and that way the brahmanas according to their the working capacity it's not by birth again and again it's said in different scriptures and here it says naruto said that i was born of a lady who was a med servant i never knew about my father but i had a great opportunity over there because that gentleman that the family where my mother used to work as a med servant they used to invite holy people learning people and mostly almost every day there would be the discussions debates so i had the opportunity to go and listen to those discourses i had the opportunity to go with to go very close to the holy people to serve them and i used to listen to them to what they are discussing and slowly slowly i develop faith in the existence of god and i develop love for god that is the narada and then he was very young one of the and who is that narada didn't mention one of the great soul who was visiting there gave the mantra diksha and initiate initiation to the naruto not other was placed like that and when this was the narda wanted to go out but the mother will cry the naruto failed that i should go and sit somewhere and consented completely on the spiritual development but the mother was there the how to leave that poor mother so when this was happening then one day his mother was going to the cowshed and when she was going into his dark night and suddenly and fortunately unfortunately she was bitten by a poisonous snake and she died over there everybody said what will happen to narada but narada understood that god has taken away the last bondage so i were tied down over here because of the mother now i am completely free i don't have anything at my back so after the doing all those final rides for the mother then the narada went into the jungle sat under a tree and started meditating praying and repeating the holy name that is received from the rishi and because his mind was completely free from all the attachment the mind become pure it become pure what is the purity the spirituality spiritual thought what is the impurity worldly thoughts that is the two difference only so when the mind is completely withdrawn when the mind is not going to any rupa russia the form or the smell or the taste nothing it is coming so the mind is completely tranquil the mind is not agitated so that is called withdrawn so in the yoga also they say when you have to meditate you have to withdrawn your mind practice that withdrawing the mind the word they used in the yuga you say it goes and collects the information and there sometimes we think that the word means eating no it is collecting and the collection maybe through eyes maybe through smell maybe through sound maybe through touch so these collections goes to the mind and that is called ahara of the mind and of course of the to the tongue to the taste when those who are not there what the mind will do calm and composed very tranquil and in that tranquil composed mind the reflection of the holy self came but god he saw the dead god and after seeing that god narada was very happy but it says that god said to him o narada you are you have now my vision but you will not see me anymore now that you have my vision your life will be full of joy go about singing the glory of god so that people become free from the miseries so that was the life purpose of the narada see that we we all know that narada is having a beena a one type of musical instrument and with that taking that bina is going over everywhere and he's going on playing and singing the glory of god and this nada in the bhagavata also we find now the narada who has realized that god the illumined soul is meeting another great personality vyasa the vyasa who arranged the vedas who composed the mahabharata and narada is meeting him why those who have break that we have heard that we have discussed those things many a times after even composing mahabharata it seems and also arranging the the vedas the vyasha was not satisfied he was not feeling joy and he was sitting by the side of a river near to his heart and suddenly narada appeared over there and the narrator told him what why was the venerable said he was sitting like this what happened to you the question that the narada asked to his teacher sanat quran the vyasa asks the same question to narada he said narada i have done so many things i read so many things i composed so many things but still i don't feel joy within what is the why this now from here the devotion begins the devotional path narada didn't say meditate on yourself narada said you better compose srimad bhagavatam the wonderful based on the life of sri krishna the bhagavan sri krishna so the bhagavata is a full of knowledge but the taint part of the bhagavata is a sri krishna and the question they are asking the arjuna's family the pandavas family and the uns christian answer goes on bhagavata is a pure thing and there the person who is describing is the shuka deva the sukadeva was the son of the vyasa and he heard those from the his father and he went to spread that message suka was the gyani because he was not having any body consciousness and shuka was completely free right from his birth but at the same time when he heard the story of bhagavan sri krishna and about the bhagavata he went and told to a person who was getting ready for the death but so who composed the bhagavata we are say again why to get the satisfaction what is this satisfaction because it is a god's love this love is a wonderful thing it's a one pointed love i only love you and i don't want anything else from anyone in it and not even from evil god even if you don't give me anything it doesn't matter only i like to love you and love for love's sake but there's the swami vivekananda said this is a love for love's sake bhagavan's krishna mentioned about the two great soul many a times and he said one is sukadeva the shukhadeva he was the ideal of the gyana maga sugar deva was not having the body consciousness at all you're completely free so that is sukadeva another is narada and he is the ideal for the bhakti marga narada never even stopped taking the name of god or singing his glory he was constantly used to see the same god everywhere and when he used to go around he used to serve people help people guide people completely engaged always busy not that sitting in one place and then going on taking the name of god nothing like that so the narada's bhakti is a combination of the knowledge and the work unselfish work and why because i only should realize god and other people let them be in the dirt no that should not be so the narada was carrying the mission that was given by god to him o naruga you have seen me now you should not have any doubt about the existence of god and you know how to realize god because you have practiced those now you are having all other knowledges of the world that could not give you the satisfaction at this moment you have realized me the god the supreme and you have having that satisfaction and you know the difference between the external knowledge and the spiritual knowledge so now you go and teach this to the world people of the world not of the deep there that means the world unselfish work the monks are supposed to do that dharma dharma i always say that what is our duty dharma and dharma shiksha we should try to practice the dharma and what is dharma keeping the promises and what is the promise of a monk i am not going to harm anyone in this life rather i like to see that supreme lord the god in everything there will be no friend or foe and there is no worldly thing or this divine thing all the same all the time that is called the dharma of a monk and we take the promise we take the oath and we have to keep that promise keep the oath constantly burning within our mind and we have given up given or given up that is the karma of a monk we should not have anything of the worldly like the possession or doing these or that no in neighbor in no condition so that is the dharma of a monk and then that is and what is that dharma now we are describing trying to read and analyze the path of bhakti as we did the path of ghyana so this is the way we always try to reach out to the different people i am very thankful to the authority of the hindu temple and though the constantly they their officials are changing officers are changing but they are continuing these things this is the wonderful way they are continued the great service that they are giving i am only reading and trying to analyze and telling but they are helping me to do that to reach out to the people the same way the many other devotees groups are there they do not friends narada bhakti shooter with that you will study so three parts are there first is narada now we know who is this narada though he was not a great in the family he was born of course and of course he was a brahmana because he always then laid the truth he realized the brahman is the god so he was a brahmana by that sense though he was a very humble birth and family background so it proves that it doesn't matter where you are born what type of language you're using and how you're growing up but the thing is anyone can realize god if there are sins here this is fast so this is narada then bhakti what is bhakti the bhakti is in one word it can be said bhakti is love of god we all know the love of god is not a big big journal as they always say it's not a big matter we can love god no it is not so easy we love our parents we love husbands and wives love we love our children we love our property our country our nation our language our religion we have love for all this but the love for god is completely different completely different the love for god means is only one way love we may not get any return we may or may not it doesn't matter i love you god that's all so love knows no water swami become the same i only love you and i don't care whether you love me or not i don't care whether you satisfy or give me blessings and fulfill my prayers or not i love you so love knows no barter it goes one way anna swami vivekananda he was a very young boy and he used to come to bhagavan sriram krishna krishna was then a very famous personality uh all great people and the very well known people of the in society they used to come to srama krishna naren also started coming slowly slowly he developed love for this his master bhagavan sirana krishna and srama krishna showed the great concern for this young god when all others are there and like a mother and then he will say if this is a very good sweet keep it separately for nothing other people jokingly say why this that we are also here so why you should not give no no this is a separate thing so we i will give you sweets other sweets are there but this i will keep on knowing like that you used to love knowledge everybody knew that krishna loves knowledge and sometimes in the night also you will get up and ask the people can you go and ask how is he how that young boy why he's not coming so great love and so much of azib attachment then suddenly just to take the examination now when you are loving then the children are very happy but suppose you are not loving when the children will come to the same way to you no if you are not loving your children the children will also slowly go away if you are not loving your husband and wife the husband and wife is also will separate the same way all religion depends on exchange i will send a card in your birthday and you should remember my birthday also otherwise they'll be fighting this is not love naren was going on getting so much of love and attention affection from that great souls rama krishna and great people used to come to sudama krishna to get five minutes time a little glance a little touch of the blessings and all that and here not in used to get so much suddenly whole months ramakrishna is not looking to that boy you stop talking about him you stop any no conversation and when he used to come suramar krishna will turn his face and it is com very very prominent that i am not liking you his body language proved it but even then that boy is to come and he'll be sitting over there sometimes half lying and listening to all the discussions see ramakrishna will talk with other devotees but not with that boy but nothing will continue not one or two days whole month whenever there was a chance northerners to come and sit over there after the month or so then krishna asked him hey i don't talk to you nowadays i don't like you also that you have seen then why do you come here you know the answer that young boy he say sad i love you so i come it's not that you have to love me not that you have to recognize me not that you have to give me these and that i love you i like to listen to your words i get inspirations from your words so i come that is called divine love the love in one way so this is the love that we are going to learn and what about the sutra what is the sutra it called one is narada bhakti now the shooter and sutra in patmo purana it says who a statement that contains a vast philosophy within a few words panini with the yoga shooter that that it says and in the book that is suggested on the g you will find this sloka and it's a sutra few words and it explains everything without any ambiguity and there is no repetition and this contains this the sutra means a trade also that's called in simple one word it will give the whole thing that is called mantra in the mantra is nothing very simple word but that mantra contains everything and that mantra mantra shakti that is they say it comes down from guru to the sisya the disciple and if we are repeating that mantra every time all the time that goes on manifesting the sutras the aphorism if we read immediately a vast knowledge a philosophy only half a line that will help so this is called the sutra the narada bhakti i think it is 84 aphorisms and we'll be reading the very fast sutra we will just read that and we will conclude for today in the next month we will take up the book one sutra after sutra we will read and try to explain but here is a bhoktin biakya syama i am going to explain about the bhakti the devotion now the why this now after so this we will explain slowly so thank you friends and if you have any question then we'll be answering so there are two questions first question is from tanya goa she's saying thank you for the beautiful talk my question is that it is shree vedavasa who composed gita then why do we say that gita is lord krishna's advice is it not sage vyasa's advice no dania this is a very good question a very important question but you know the whole mahabharata that vyasa he composed he wrote that's a history sometimes some people they say the tanya's question you must have heard that she is telling it is the vedav vyasa who composed who wrote the bhagavad-gita then why we say that it is krsna's gita that's a good question but actually what happened veda vyasa only could hear and note and write but it is not his original it's all krishnas and all about the mahabharata the bhagavad-gita is a part of the mahabharata and they're all about the mahabharata krishna collected all the information and then he has composed those things it is the etihasa mahabharata is a history of the india but somehow the europeans came and they told it is like the great book that the our uh the two that were there the homers the two books this is like that no it is not it's a history the history has a totally different now your question veda biaser heard the krishna is telling like this now you can ask how could he hear you know the yogic knowledge the power of the yoga one can hear even sitting in a very far place bhagavan sri krishna sri ramakrishna also heard these the people are talking like this sri ramakrishna was so sick he was in a shampoo body and there sitting in that condition in the sick condition he heard that the one of his devotee is talking like this and crying why sirama krishna should not come to me today because i have arranged this puja the sudan krishna told the devotees who were attending him that day you please go to him he's crying when they went they found it is true so this is the yogic power vyasha was having the yogic power to listen now whether you believe it or not it is a totally different thing now if after a thousand years the people will write swami sharpened was giving the talk sitting in the chicago and tanya whistle was listening it in india and the people will say after a thousand years oh that is all blasphemy all useless it is it is not possible how someone is talking in chicago and some good like that only the yogic power they could reach and they could hear but it was the whole gita was saved by krishna and arjuna it is a their their dialogue between the krishna and arjuna not of vyasa that's why gita is shri krishna the next question is from user by the name of top 10 he's saying path devotion and knowledge both tell about forgetting self of ignorance devotion tells up to hirano garbha where no individual intelligence does not remain reach up to hirano gerber means salvation bhagavan krishna he said that you are telling that the knowledge path of knowledge takes us to the ultimate and path of devotion takes us to the brahma or the hiranagar and not or we can say the saguna brahma that is the conception but up to that only but said it takes us to the root and we can merge into that if we want that is the god there is a supreme god he has adopted his own knowledge his own shakti that is his maya and then he is doing the creation and sustaining and the dissolution he has all power now if we go and pray through the path of bhakti we go and pray i like to see the your form that is the brahman all-pervading consciousness can't you show it he can like the arjuna when he was asking you are telling that you are the beginner you are the maintainer is it possible krishna you are just of my age you are my brain can you show me that then the vishwa rupa he showed and arjuna believed that same way sri ramakrishna said even through the path of bhakti you can get brahma-gyana thank you the next question is from srima biswas she is saying parents love their children but when they grow up they can't understand why no they understand but the thing is that by that time when they grow up they are connected with so many other things previously the children's love was a very close association they will be holding the hand of the mother they'll be running around her they'll be constantly having the company of the mother because there was no other thing then slowly you are asking the child to grow to go to school to go to college university to go for the job then you are asking the child to marry and settle and how can you expect that boy or girl will come and behave like a baby and even if they do do you think you'll like it no so the love is there children they love i have seen the children over here in america they are literally crying for their parents now this covet situation i cannot go how the my mother is they are really really crying trying almost regularly keeping touch with them but they're busy their job they're compelling them to work for 12 hours 14 hours and if you oh every moment of his mother it is not possible and mothers also the parents also should not expect that they should be happy that my son my daughter my children they are now standing on their own feet and i am very happy so they love but the expression of love is a little different thank you friends thank you for attending this class let us say
