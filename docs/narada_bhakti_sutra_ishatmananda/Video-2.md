[2. Fragrance of Vedanta: Narada Bhakti Sutras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SLsYjiaL7Gs)

namaskar today the saturday morning and as the arrangement of the hindu temple of lemont we will be studying the naradiya bhakthi sutra that's a we are studying the fragrance of vedanta and we have already completed the ashtavakra you are studying and today is the second discourse let us begin with this mantra yes yes i bow down to lord visnu the great god whose mere remembrance makes one free from the bondage of birth and death said lord visnu is the conception of the ultimate reality which is all-pervading everywhere but when we try to concentrate on that it is really difficult when god is everywhere but i need as a human being a place where i can go and sit and pray i need something to concentrate so that is the reason the hindus they have imagined lord vishnu the word vishnu means all-pervading all pervading and what is all pervading consciousness but at the same time we have given a form and in that form we can concentrate and yeshua's maranamar trainer when we just remember him that the lord is all pervading everywhere and it is the consciousness which is also within us which is in every being immediately the narrowness the smallness it breaks it goes away and one can become completely free friends we will be studying the narada bhakti sutra we have completed the first uh we can say introduction and in the introduction it is the sutra that we mentioned what are the sutras what does it mean by sutras is a in a very simple very small way al-paksharam akshara akshara means the words very few words only they have used but that is having the excellent wonderful philosophy al paksharam or samdikdam and there is no doubt it's a convincing complete sarabath bishop we discussed it in the last class this is the sutra that only very simple small or two words and it gives the whole meaning as a complete philosophy and we find in our january discourse we touch the points like different ways to realize god sanatana dharma prescribed the four paths why because the if we analyze a person we'll find that we have four different type of temperaments one analytical each and every one wants to know why these what is going to happen this is the way they will be asking constantly so that's called analytical this called knowledge and in the path of knowledge saying karma the selfless work then we like to do something for the service of others that is called selfless work control of the senses the dhyana and love of god the bhakti the devotion each and every individual is having these four different temperaments four different paths has been laid for them if you see the ramakrishna mission swami vivekananda understanding that this four can be together and it will be very powerful but very useful so he made the path for the ramakrishna mission the monks and the lay devotees and the combination of all the four paths so that is if you see the symbol you will understand of the ramakrishna mission symbol the four paths one is knowledge second is the karma third is the control of the senses the dhyana and also the bhakti the devotion to god there are different teachers of bhakti also we discussed and among them the present one that we are going to follow is the narada we discussed about narada also who is this narada is a historical personality and he passed through as a very humble at the beginning he was born in a very humble way he was not knowing who is his father why all this this is a great sage then why this because it doesn't matter in which language that you are speaking or the the birth or the low or high of the education it doesn't matter at all the spiritual life is completely different and sometimes in the and particularly in india they made a wonderful system those who are very intellectuals for them they call the brahmana we call now the intellectuals they used to call them brahmana then those who are very courageous they like to protect the people they have that capacity shatriyas they're the military class then those who have the capacity to earn money in different ways like the business the business that that is called the bashers and the workers the shudra today also in every modern places these four categories are there very ancient time india developed these four categories and who did it in the bhagavad-gita it says krishna himself said i i have done it chaturban my own system now as because the long process went on the thousands of years passed so all those systems little corruption came misunderstanding came misinterpretation came and now the people think that brahmana means as a the birth the father is a brahmana the son will also be brahmana it is not like that it is a capacity to understand intellectuals are the brahmanas so this is the bhakti the narada he was born out of a we can say made servant his mother used to work somewhere and he was not knowing who is his father but he became a great sage why because he developed that spirituality he realized that truth and the whole society now accepting him as the greatest brahmana and bobbing down is the sage so all this in the introduction we studied now we will start the sutra the great sage narada now beginning is teaching with the aphorism and very now you see apparism means the sutra only this what now if you go through those books there's so many swamis so many intellectuals they have given the all pages after pages why he said ata and why he said when these two words come together now i shall explain you what is devotion explain what bhakti the devotion but now why he said now two words only ata that means an uttar means now why is telling now before that he was judging whether we are capable to understand the path of devotion or not what whatever we like to learn we have to acquire some qualities otherwise it is impossible to learn that each and everything we know that sometimes some people they want us to become scientists the mathematics and science subject understanding and that knowledge that capacity is necessary but some are very good in painting in the craft and all that they may not understand the mathematics of science so capacity to understand are you capable to understand the devotion so sometimes people they think devotion means nothing we have to go offer some some fruits and sweets to the god and then ring the bell and show the light and that is devotion not at all first and foremost you have to have the complete faith in the existence of god there is god and if you don't have the faith don't have the belief and whatever you do you are going to the temple you are going to the mosque you are going to the churches and whatever you are doing it is futile is of no use why first and foremost is the faith i i go because the whole society is going i go because all that is the practice of course you can do that but you are not getting the benefit of spirituality the spirituality it is the truth and spirituality is a science and for that what we need we have to develop that quality there are people who like to follow the path of knowledge they may try to understand what is this devotion but they won't feel attracted to this path that is different because there natural this thing is why this why that why i should do this why i should do that but in the devotion they have already completed all those after all those analyses all those understanding after all those examining now they have concluded that god is there and god can be seen one can talk to god so this is the way it goes the devotional path the bhakti the path of the bhakti is really really very difficult only advanced people can do it in the bhagavata itself bhagavata is considered as their book of devotion in the bhagavata also says those who have already realized god but still for the joy of the company of god they follow the path of bhakti so therefore the law here the narada the great sage he says now now what are the con conditions that are necessary to follow the path of bhakti then we can the requisite qualifications we can say i was just listing is 5. first is the faith in the existence of god second strong desire to realize god third not interested in worldly pleasure fourth confident that no problem or difficulty can stop him or her that's called sincerity and fifth love for the path of devotion so i am going to follow this path and i love it those who are following the path of karma they love that whenever the heart that somebody is in trouble immediately they feel that they should go they should help and they do that so that is their nature many people won't be able to do that even when we are hearing that something is happening outside usually we won't go of course in the western world in america and europe mainly america you are not supposed to go the citizens are not supposed to do in that way that's the job of the police and other people are there the advanced country they can afford it so when we see that somebody is in trouble we call the polish and that's all that is my duty is over as a good citizen i can do up to that then afterwards it is the police department and all others they will take care but the country like india and in that indian peninsula all those even the government they want that people should come forward to help because the government they are not having that capacity to reach out to each and every corner so the citizens they should also come forward to help the authorities so here there we have seen when there is a fire break the people in the locality also coming and helping the fire brigade people like that it goes that means the karma but does it mean that in america we cannot practice the path of karma of course we can there are many other ways like people are suffering here the suffering is a little different type when the people are suffering means not only the economical psychological because they're all alone the support of the family is not there in most of the cases only the 17 18 years boy and girl they go out and they stay all alone and they are studying they are earning they are developing their life is a very good thing but at the same time we have to understand they are very very alone and the company is nothing but their friends and they are also immature they do not know how to solve a problem so that is different type of problems are here in this advanced country because of the tremendous freedom and the system is like this but i have seen the people are suffering because they cannot take the decision and when they were supposed to get a proper guidance with love and a real sincerity they couldn't get then they experienced all bad things in the life when they understand though this is the path i should follow it's too late so here the the path of karma is also possible by helping in that way there are many other different ways that there part of knowledge of course it is possible but the path of devotion when we are taught this and the path of the the meditation of course it is possible now the path of devotion in the path of devotion after practicing all those having the experience then you can feel there must be someone somewhere whom we can call as god or allah or jehovah or bhagavan ishwara must be there we give the name because we cannot think anything else without the name and form so we think oh this god must be like this hindus have given the complete freedom so so many millions of gods and goddesses are they all gods and goddesses no it is your god because you are imagining god is nothing but love and unselfishness and that is the tremendous power everywhere that consciousness is there and i try to concentrate on that consciousness as durga or bhagavan krishna or kali or sheba or whatever i like but the fast and foremost thing is faith how the faith comes through experience how the faith comes having listening from the others sometimes something happen look at us we are surviving is it not very miraculous so many people of our time they have already passed away they have died the different reason maybe but i am surviving i am getting the protection of my family i am getting everything is just because of me no there must be something someone protecting me so one should be thankful the christians they always teach the children before going to bed issued pray the islam they always five times in a day they will be praying to god the hinduism is also there but at the same time freedom is there in the religion sometimes some people they do and sometimes they don't it doesn't matter but we have to understand this faith one gentleman came and he was telling swamiji this is the difficulty with me i cannot believe the just because someone said god is there i have to believe why should i i told no you need not to but the thing is our whole life is depending on the belief the faith the you have traveled by ear and you have seen this two gentlemen sitting over there in the cockpit and you believed that they are capable to fly the aircraft you didn't go and check their certificates you didn't shake anything you just have the faith on those two that they will fly and take you to your destination successfully and without any problem isn't it so life is like that everywhere we are believing having the faith but at the time of god then we doubt why i can't see god even if you see you will you be able to understand what is what sometimes even our sights are also deceiving us our we are listening but that may be something else so all our indriyas our senses are not bringing the correct information so we have to have the faith and the faith in the existence of god and this god narada is never mentioning about the god he is mentioning that there is a power and that power is the consciousness but for our first thing to start our journey towards the path of devotion is the belief that there is something someone which is all-pervading all-powerful all-compassionate and that is we give the name god the faith in the existence of god bhagavan sram krishna practiced and then he said to the devotees i am telling you and in my experience i have seen god i talked with god i live with god and believe it then we judge the life of bhagavan siddharama krishna is a wonderful life he's not having any selfishness anywhere only his compassion is love for us that we should not suffer why we suffer because we don't believe why we suffer because we are not going towards that that particular goal from where we will get the joy happiness peace eternal we don't know that but all our effort all our energy we are utilizing to get the joy the happiness and we go to the shop purchase so many things we think we'll be happy for a few days for a few moments again we are unhappy we do each and everything you just sit and count each and everything in our life whatever we have done is for the happiness only oh i should do this so i'll be miserable anybody do it no no no one will do it all the time we are thinking that we'll be happy people are driving with their family going to picnic they're thinking they'll be happy but sometimes there may be mishaps there may be a terrible accident but they were driving they were going for the joy not for the accident or that condition so that each and every step every action that we do is for the happiness but we do not know where these happiness is and look at the life of jesus look at the life of the lord buddha look at the life of bhagavan si rama krishna they are the meters they show us that it is possible without anything they are so great so happy all the time and they are coming and trying to help us so believe the faith in the existence of god directly at this moment we may not have but indirectly we can have the inspiration by seeing these great souls the fast is the existence of god then the strong desire to realize god when the lord put the left and his father's friend and also the very good advisor of his father he was driving the chariot and afterwards when the buddha at the in the the almost in the border he got down and he will enter into the jungle and all alone he will go inside the jungle he said goodbye then he said can i ask you a question sam you were having everything you are a prince you will be the king you have a queen you have a son everything you were having in this world and you were going for something about which you don't know anything whether you will realize god or not you don't know why you are taking this risk the reply of the buddha was great he said i have complete faith that there is something after achieving that realizing that understanding that i'll be completely free from fear and i will be always happy that conviction i'm having if i cannot achieve that in this life i will die with this thought that my effort some mistake was there i could not completely dedicate myself for the realization but the truth is that is there so we should also have that strong desire to realize god and no doubt at all about the existence of god we sometimes try and then we feel oh that we have tried a lot now that we have not realized sometimes some people after taking the initiation after four five months they will start asking swamiji for five months i am practicing this now i have not realized god though within five months you think you will realize god one can realize god in a very moment but the preparation you should be a very good student and then only it is possible but you have to continue that decision should be there the strong desire that's called mumuksuta third if you are going to god you have to give up the world so there should not be any desire to enjoy this worldly life name fame and physical comfort and all this and at the same time god no it cannot be swami vivekananda in one of his lecture in america he said i am having so many things in my drawing room and i am having a god also a this is not devotion devotion means complete surrender to only to god so third not interested in the worldly pleasures and it doesn't mean that i have to give up everything and i have to be homeless no not like that whatever i am doing i should be there and in my position but mentally i should be detached from that if i am not getting these i am going to die nothing like that i am all right i am happy so this is the way slowly slowly you have to develop the detachment and this detachment towards the world why because it is temporary i have seen that my grandfather passed away my father passed away i have seen so many people known to me they have all passed away in the history when i am reading i i read the about the kings but whether those and their castles are now ruins that shows that everything is temporary and the only permanent thing and that is god which i am going to realize so i should have to give up what we should give up the worldly pleasures whatever is necessary that is sufficient for but our main concentration should be the god realization fourth confident that no problem or difficulty can stop him or her that is called atma sratta swami vivekananda said again and again atma if we are not having that self-confident that i am going to realize god at today or tomorrow may be great souls they realize god in this very life maybe it will take for me for a long long time maybe hundreds of lives i have to leave but i am going to realize god the stories are there to encourage the people when narada he was all the time he was so pure that he used to live with god so one day he was going the two the sannyasins they were sitting by the side of the road they looked saw the narada is going to say where you are going to god yes i am going to god the will you please ask the god the supreme lord when i am going to get this get the liberation both of them ask the same question now they're told well i will ask them and at the time of return i will give the answer he went and after some time when he was coming back maybe a few days they they were eagerly waiting and when the narada came they the first the swami first sannyasi asked narada did you ask the question and what was the reply for me the naruto told look at this tamarind the tree i don't know whether you have seen the tamarind tree or not the small small leaves and the millions of leaves are there so he showed the tamarind tree and told look at this tamarind trees as many leaves are there so many times of birth you have to have then only it is possible for you to realize god the man started dancing he was so happy he told oh that means some limit is there the tamarind tree may be one million but okay after one million i am going to get the liberation but the second one when the naruto told oh only another birth you have to continue another birth and he broke down oh my god again another birth again like this and he lost the faith so this is the through the story we have to understand we have to continue whatever happens i am going to realize god bhagavan sirama krishna gives the example of the the cultivators sometimes some people will be there the moment there is no rain they will leave leave that and go for to become they will take another occupation but the true one they will never leave they will go on continuing the working on the field and one day again they will raise the fruit the way that is the way one should be sincere i am taking the name of god and it is surely purifying my mind and i am going to get the blessings of god today or tomorrow that faith should be there sincerity love for the path of devotion because the people they are tainted though the other day a couple came to meet me i saw them many times in the hindu temple lemont and when i saw them here in our vedanta so sometimes some people they make mistake they think that i live over there the the many of them they know me the swamiji i went to your place there's a big temple until yeah that is a our place of course all hindus they go over there but i don't live there i live somewhere else and our organization is vedanta society but anyway these two couple that came and then naturally i told you came to visit the hindu temple no we have stopped visiting that place and how come what happened why you have stopped visiting that place no we are now following the path of ghyana so not going to the temple that this is for the path of devotion for the bhaktas for the devotees they go this is wrong that it is completely wrong and that doesn't mean that i have to denounce all these places there also we can go and can think or the people are trying to go to god and god is this this is the way the love for the path of devotion means i love my god i go over there but doesn't mean that i have to criticize i have to denounce the other paths not like that i should understand what is god i should understand how the things are working and what will happen after realization of the god what is the transformation that is coming to me when i am proceeding advancing in the path of religion in the path of spirituality what are the changes coming within me physical changes no only my thought will change my conception will change idea will change so if we don't know then it becomes very narrow every time we go to temple or church or mosque and we do something some of the thing that then we come out as i was the same thing i carry back to my home no changes no transformation so the love for the path of devotion means understanding what is this devotion understanding what is going to change in me and where i am going to reach so this is the way it should go the most difficult is the first that is that develop the faith and here it says like this prathaksa anuman upoman and shabda you know how do we understand things it says fast for the direct then anumana the inference third is the compare and fourth is shabda there are many say the sixth time six are there five are there but these four prathaksha the direct not everyone will have the direct anumana of course as i was giving the example by seeing the great soul we can understand how wonderful life they are living that means there must be something we can imagine we can infer that there is god and after realization of the god these people they are changing in such a nice way upo mana when you compare the one is the president of a great country another is a humble monk but look at this two person we are comparing and when you compare we find this person is so good so compassionate and he is always thinking positively for others never criticizing anyone then whom will choose of course this person so this is the through the comparison we always find that when the kings are there they are completely different but the holy people are different that means holy people those who are concentrating their mind on the realization of god after advancing towards that realization they become so good people that's why when people are suffering they come to a holy person and what is this holiness it is nothing that that person is also eating sleeping talking moving everything just like normal but only thing he has developed love love for each and everyone and he has developed unselfishness that's why he can love he can pray he can feel the pangs of others the sufferings of others and can pray for them so this is the upon and shabda because of the scriptures they say in this way and we have already discussed about the mumuksuta that is the desire to realize god shankaracharya says this quality is very difficult to achieve only by the grace of god one can have i am having everything this beautiful world but still i know that these are all temporary things everything will go away and one day i'll be all alone so only god will be with me and nobody else when he look at us we were the big family the grandfather mother these that where are they now and in the school so many friends where are they now and in the society where are they now slowly slowly we are becoming lonely alone a time will come all everyone will go away only god will be there so if we can understand it when we are young and can in completely utilize our energy for the god realization that is called mumuksuta and shankaracharya only because of the god one can have that and the when we are we can give up this world as i was discussing bibeka means understanding the nature of the thing and then the strong mind to give that up this is the nature of things so i should give it up sometimes some we make the mistake because out of compassion we get a test out of the sympathy we get attached and we suffer nothing like that if you are with the good people good ideas if you are doing good i am with you or otherwise whoever you may be maybe my brother maybe my friend may be my relative but if you are supporting the bad things i am not with you that is exactly this teaching we learn from the bhagavad-gita that is called bibeka and bhairav means giving up viveka means understanding through the bichara by judging this then comes the self-confidence atma bishwasha in the atmobishasha different types of obstructions come first is the doubt shall i be able to do it or not first this is the doubt comes seconds the criticism from the relatives and friends now the moment you are you have started practicing the spirituality you are visiting the holy people you are meditating you are going to holy places then your friends and the relatives will start oh my god at this age you are doing all these things no no when you are 80 then only you should do like that all the time they will comment and sometimes they will be very aggressive to stop you but you have to continue the doubts and this criticism third is dangerous accepting the moment you are continuing this life all around you they will come and say oh you are a blessed person please bless us please pray for us then you will feel oh i am somebody i am holier than tao that attitude destroyed the person who is traveling towards god holier than thou don't touch me i am holier than thou don't talk to me i am holier than thou and you will find each and every one after making little progress in the spiritual life there they get stopped that is the barrier they cannot cross the srama krishna he was a brahmana he was a pujari the worshipper and he removed his upper beater to clean the bathroom of a low-cost person why otherwise the ego will come and that ego will never allow me to go towards god the first is the doubts second obstructions from the society from the friends and relatives third acceptance and there you should be one should be very very calm and constantly prayful and he'll con continuously pray to god oh god it is you that you are doing it is not me it is not me it is not me so that is the way we have to overcome and the fourth is the temptation the name and fame when one is progressing in the in the spiritual life then many of the people they come in india have seen because the country is full of the devotion even the prime minister is coming and touching the feet of the swamis or the brahmacharyans and if that particular person think the oh the great person he has come and touching my feet is a great mistake it's not the person that they are coming is the ideology the person is following and if the moment i think that they are coming to me and the ego boost up it is me they are coming immediately i am falling from my ideology and the ideology is love for god and the love for god makes one very humble so this is the way and finally love for the path was chosen now this is bhakti friends look at it we only read one aphorism the fast apparism and in the fast aphorism itself yamaha in a very limited way this much we can say so many things now about the bhakti what is this bhakti devotion it says bhakti is having two stages one is premature stage we don't understand why we are doing but our guru said you must do it so i bathe i put on the washcloths then i take some one plate with sweets and fruits and incense things and flowers i go and kneel down before a god and offer those things i'm not understanding what i am doing just because the person whom i respect said asked me i am doing it this is called premature stage of devotion and if we continue that slowly slowly it will be a mature stage and in the mature stage whether you are offering the food or not it doesn't matter it is the love and most of the time in the modern society we express our love by exchanging gifts i don't understand that love doesn't need that love means the feeling i feel for that person i feel for that god it doesn't mean that i have to offer fruits and sweets and these and that of course it is good those who are giving so that other people can get the prasad they can share that but the love is completely different but we start we begin with that as a child is going to the school it doesn't know what is knowledge what is education but the young the kid is very happy that going and having so many friends and they can play over there so many other activities that they are very happy going there this is the pre-mature stage the first we go to the temple and church and the synagogue and the mosque that is the first and then say do like this do like that slowly slowly we are doing and then understanding why we are doing this second stage come up the premature means the subordinate the gov and that is also bhakti and raga bhakti are praying so this is different two only but different names are there aspirins of the path of divine love bhakti go on performing as per the instructions of the guru or as per the injunctions of the scriptures we always say that when you are cooking you should not talk because it may defile the food so you cannot offer it to god and after cooking something for the god as a little portion you keep for yourself and then the balance you give to god no you should not you should not do that because that is a insult to god and when you are giving it you should cover so that the fly or the dust should not be on that so by this is the way we are teaching and the best flower we should offer and the fruits that you are giving it should be properly washed i have seen in the bilirubal temple i i got the duty as a brahmacari as a novice to clean that image of bhagavan sirama krishna there are two pieces of clothes there small pieces and they told take this one and then do like this the one that you are using for the face should not use for the feet and when you are using the feet that should not use for the face like this so but the image only stone image i went and i did and i was very careful of the left hand is for this purpose right for this purpose so i did that then after doing that not that the last dust is there it's all covered but still you have to do it very carefully and when you are touching the face you should be careful that you are not putting the finger on the eye as a as a leaving person if you are putting the finger the naturality is painful and you should be careful you should not give them much pressure because sudama krishna and he was a shwathika body and obviously very soft you should be careful you are when you are doing i did that then i washed those two pieces of clothes and then i kept hanging for dry then the senior the swamiji came and told oh you did it and yes swamiji he was observing how i am doing and then you told after cleaning the feet you do little massaging takur is sitting for a long time in that position you must be feeling tired too little messaging so but i was massaging the stone image the what should i do but anyway when he said i did like that a little this is called the beginning of the devotion we don't feel but the swami is feeling that he is a living person sitting over there when he's offering the food the way they give as if to a great the guest has come or someone very respectable so by that way only they are giving and then fanning when he is eating that they are fanning so this is the way slowly slowly from the growth you go that ma sharda muni devi she said in a nice way she said when you are handling the flowers all the time then after some time your fingers your hand become the all the smell of the flower will be there in your fingers so like that only we are developing our devotion towards god from the vadi bhakti vidi bhatt bhakti and according to the this way you have to perform when you are giving the food usually in the indian system they give the separate separate the way you should not mix the whole thing and offer to that same way you should give but if you think whom we are giving to a picture only to image no here the if you are thinking that it is leaving you can talk to him there are some experiences are there it really happens and there are some stories bhagavan sirama krishna said the one father he used to offer the food to the god regularly and he was a brahmana so that was his job then one day he and his wife both were supposed to go somewhere they asked the young boy his son to offer the food and then he said when the god will finish his food then only you should eat because thinking he will start eating and then so he said when the god will finish his food then you should eat not before he was sincere he told okay then he offered the food and he was sitting before a picture then nothing happened then he closed his eyes and he told god i have closed my eyes i am not seeing how you're eating but come and eat nothing was there as it is then he started crying if you don't eat then what will happen the father will say that i have not done my job and he will beat me he'll be very angry with me come and take something and moreover i am very hungry unless you eat i won't be able to eat please come please come please come devotion because of the love because of the devotion he truly saw the lord krishna they are god their how family deity krishna he came and sat over there and told let us now both enjoy so they have portion this boy ate and a person krishna himself and afterwards the father came he saw nothing is left on the plate and immediately he became very angry the where is the other food the portion krishna ate and happened me and you you say the krishna is eating half of it you and and you're the you have eaten everything now his father became very angry with the son son started crying and he told no believe me the krishna truly came and you told that unless he eats i won't be able to so he narrated everything father was not believing it so we can go and do a thing every time but we if we don't have the faith the faith like a child we won't be able to realize god so the bhakti the the divine joy has an intoxication effect this is also there those who are practicing the devotion the bhakti they go on merging into that they go on taking the name of god and singing the glory of god and they are in great joy and slowly slowly the bhagavata it says devotion generate devotion so friends we will conclude over here the first aphorism where the great sage says what is this means now the why now because we we should be prepared to understand so now he's explaining again the other that is the god and finally it comes to that there are the devotion the bhakti there are two types of bhakti one is the beginning another the end but if we don't begin how we will reach to the goal so let us begin and in the beginning complete faith so maha let me explain and in the next the month how he is explaining he is never mentioning god that is very interesting we will read that and try to explain in my own way in next month so there is one question uh the username is top 10 he's asking without sannyas can we can we realize the highest truth brahman which is formless without attributes and why sannyasi takes only om question mark without sannyasa when you are asking sannyasa means samyak means complete nyasa means giving up so what we are giving up in the bhagavad-gita it says no him as a as a monk who not dweshti is not the aversion or attachment nothing is there how it is possible i don't like that person i don't like the ego i like that person i again so when the ego has been given up when you leave the ego then one can become a monk a true monk by giving up the ego that's why bhagavan sirama krishna said ami moly gucci be janjal when i die then only all the problems will be solved so top 10 with your question is the sannyasa means giving up giving up means giving up the ego then if i give up the ego what remains only god not me not i it is thou it is you and then when i am working i am not getting attached to this and the one that you say om is considered as a very pure sound and that is they said that it is like the brahman om ithi brahman that is said like that the brahman means one which is eternal we do not know who created it it is all it is self-created om is also like that so om is the symbol of brahman sannyas is not only sannyasins all the hindus they chant the omkara as the purity of the world thank you then oh [Music] foreign may you all be happy may we be safe the pandemic is still continuing but have the we can have the faith that everyone will be saved because the medicine they are developing and i pray to the divine lord that all of you be happy and safe thank you
