[11. Fragrance of Vedanta: Narada Bhakti Sutra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf2y_gGgTnw)

namaskar their devotees and friends today the first saturday morning as per the arrangement the hindu temple of lemont the xiaomi vivekananda spiritual center they organize this talk the fragrance of vedanta and in that series we are we were reading the narada bhakti sutra and today will be the last class on the narrative so let us begin as we usually do yes yes in that uh we have already in november we have studied and in the december today the last class that we are going to complete a second january 2021 we started this narada bhakti sutra this narada bhakti sutra is having 84 sutras up to 50 every sloka every sutra we have studied we have explained now from the 51 to 84 mostly we'll touch but little and because it is mostly the repetition of the same thing in the scripture the repetition is a must because in repetition that through repetition we always get the ultimate knowledge because sometimes when we listen we forget sometimes after listening we misunderstand misinterpret we can't remember so it is always the tradition in the hindu scripture to repeat narada also did the same thing and we will complete that in the coming year to 2021 because january and february it is too cold over here in chicago so we usually suspend all the classes most of the devotees also go out we also try to visit but this time we don't know it's so difficult to go out even but january february we won't have any classes from march onwards we'll start again and at that time as uh the the they were asking uh what the book that we may announce at the end of this class today the this fragrance of vedanta this is the vedanta the ultimate in vedanta you know there are three schools that is dwayta vishishta dwaita and we have already started it to some extent not the complete uh that is the vibe the wonderful book on the vedanta monastic vedanta now here the narada bhakti sutra there is a book of devotion the dwaita again and again they're talking about the god the supreme lord and to develop the devotion so we will have this and the narada he said in the 46 from from the 46 to 50 this verses this the aphorisms he said who can cross this ocean of samsara and can develop the devotion for god and merge with the god and all those list in the last november class it is there it will be there in the youtube also if you are interested once again you can go to over there this is a practices that if one is doing then the lastly in the 50th the aphorism narada is telling with the giving all the stress on that satarati satyarathi salokan tarayati this is a great statement is it he is going to get the success he is going to develop the devotion and going to merge with the god and going to go to god realize god not only that he will be able to help others to do that when twice it is mentioned in the scripture means is the great and the stress is given on the talk he is authority just in the world not like that he is and he is going to realize that now friends from the 51 if we see we see the narada is clarifying what is this the the devotion anita bhachanyam prema sarupam we know the beginning he gave the definition again almost at the end he is giving the same thing the repetition the definition why because what is devotion most of the people they are confused about that the devotion means when you can cry devotion means when you can emotionally sing or we can uh do these that no devotion means prema sarubam anirbachanim beyond expression that love that love beyond expression the that our one of our great swami the swami bhutan and the jimaraj he gave a wonderful example about it when he was giving the initiation you know in india when the initiation means a group of people they come and they take the mantra diksha from the guru naturally there will be 25-30 people together so suddenly they could hear a baby crying outside and the young mother got up and she wanted to go out to nurse that baby her husband is telling there are people our relatives my mother the grandmother of the baby she is there now you don't pay any attention to that late baby you better be here listen to the guru and take the diction afterwards you will go out she simply brushed him aside no no no my child is crying and this is the most important thing for me to go to him i don't care about god the one brahmachary the maharaja is telling he was observing and the brahmacharya also went and wanted to tell this is an opportunity you are going to miss he said i don't care my baby is crying so maybe some other time i will take the blessings of the mother maharaj but this time the baby needs me afterwards the swami said there was swami bhutan and the ji see this is the love never care for anything never care for heaven never care for anything of this world forget about the world even the heaven or the blessings of god i love so that's why bhagavan si rama krishna mentioned the mother's love for her child so that way we have to develop love and no one can feel no one can and the mother also cannot express it apparently she was adamant apparently other people may be saying look at it she's a foolish lady not getting the blessings of the great guru she is running up then she can go after one hour but the swamiji appreciated sri ramaswamy buddhism and the maharaja appreciated that love so this is the way anirbachiniya is a love and the love unexpressible is so much inside and love means joy the only joy that then he's like then he's giving an example in the 50 second aphorism he says how it is example muka asadan a dumb person cannot express suppose you give a very tasty dish and he eats that after that how he will express that other people those who can speak they will say who is wonderful etc but he said just expression you know that you can see the whole body his eyes his gesture posture trying his best to give the expression of joy that he has received the muka asada nabat as a dumb person enjoy the similarly the joy within and it is unexpressable oh it is so wonderful you know i was crying for one hour and these that many people this way that means that it's not the pure love a little love of course they have and that is good crying for god is really really good but even then the narada they were she the about the love of god what is expressing it is not like that can anyone get the experience that is the question no only if is a purified mind can realize it anyone can realize that love love for god so many millions of people everyone is going to their own respective religious places the churches the synagogue and the gurudwara the mosque the temple all of them are developing the love no only the purified mind he said means that particular person who has developed the purity and the true love though love for god is subjective but still one will feel it now the moment we say that it cannot be expressed then obviously some people will say oh you know so much of love i cannot express so here they're saying no not like that there are some expression what then narada is giving gunarahitam kamuna rahitam pratikshana bhardamanam abhi chinnam sukhmataram anubhava [Music] so this is called the scripture the in every way it will give you the clear idea the sastra the shastra means up to realized soul realized people they are telling you there'll be no fault and you cannot find out oh it may be like this it may be no nothing like that very clearly they will mention those who have realized the divine love for god what will happen they won't be able to express it by words like a dumb person cannot express the joy or the feeling this the through words now but here again only those who have purified their mind whatever purification what is the purification of mind it says is the beyond attributes what are the gunas satya raja tama tamo we know all worst the anger all these things are there don't forget about that raja is a mixture of the the other two and sattva-guna even the love the affection and all that even then if it is there that person also won't be able to realize that so guna rahitam beyond that guna says the guna rahitam without any attributes bhasana kamana rahitam no desire at all no no desire we cannot think of no i like to help those people i like to do these and that sometimes one gentleman came to bhagavan si rama ramakrishna and he was telling if i realize god i will say give me much more money so that i can help others the poor people serve them salaam krishna never liked it he said when the god is standing before you will you ask oh give me some money i will dig a well for the both people no and in the language of sirama krishna are you going to beg for palm king when you realize god god is standing before you oh god give me a pumpkin it is nothing like that the one should be very very there is no desire except you friends time is short then one after another in the bhagavata if you read or one after another stories they'll be telling in the bhagavata why to explain this then the dhruva he was a prince but the mother and the son they were banished then afterwards dhruva wanted to go back to the that to become a king and to go to his father the mother told only vishnu can help you he is the powerful than your father the king then he started praying the narada came to help him as a guru the guru guided the person then afterwards when he realized that when the lord vishnu appeared before him and said what is your prayer he never said that i like to become king i like to go back to my father father should recognize me never said that he told i want you god hey you sat over here for some other purposes i have forgotten that i don't need that no desire except the realization of the god so goona rahita kamu narahita it never decreases the love for god goes on increasing and increasing unbroken it never breaks oh last year i had a wonderful love for god this year i am taking a break and next year again i will start it is nothing like that shukshmataram it is so subtle the love is always subtle when there is a lot of expression of love that means it is the depth is very soluble very less the expression of love is completely different the suk taram taram the word they are using is the ultimate subtlety of this love for god and anubhav [Music] the lord caitanya mahaprabhu he used to go to see that jagannath prabhu all people are trying to go in the front the temple in the you know the hindu traditional temple inside is very small so those who have visited you can imagine there's a big hall is there it's called not mandi and all people will be standing over there somehow trying to see the one glimpse of the god craning and that way but jagannath ma prabhu is there if caitanya dev goes he will get the first seat but he won't go he'll be at the back he's standing over there and somehow on his toe he will try to see the god he'll never give the expression all people who are gathering over there not comparing with caitanya mahaprabhu's purity and his love for god but the caitanya mahaprabhu will never go in the front he'll be at the back so this says in this way that a sukshma taram anub rupam only feeling only feeling oh so many people have come to see my lord they're so happy most of the time the devotees become jealous no you cannot come you shouldn't do this i should may cook for god i should dress the god i should do this i should do that they do have not developed love they're trying to but those who have if they see see that somebody else is coming and doing it they'll be so happy oh they are coming to my lord they are trying to serve my lord they will be praying so this is called anub after having that that love for god only he or she sees god and nothing else tada sunnati only listen to the words of god that thakur's mother bhagavan sadam krishnas the mother she used to live in the nation at the old age ramakrishna brought him over there and when there will be a sidon in some factory then she will be telling oh now krishna is blowing the that for her everything was krishna siren is going on all people are disturbed but for her it was the wonderful the music of the flute of lord krishna she was never part of disturbed she liked it so that's why it says tadiba srinoti that's why friends again and again i say if you don't read the biography of bhagavatam krishna and don't know all these things you will miss actually the explanations of the narada bhaktri and other scriptures everything has been already demonstrated in life if you read the biography of sudama krishna all these incidents when you come across you can even feel oh that is this tadeeva only hears the god's call and nothing else speaks only about god and nothing else and in his thought it is only the god and nothing else no confusion no ambiguity no imagination who can attain divine love how to achieve that and what happens after attending the divine love narada makes everything very clear now in the 58th aphorism he says the path of devotion is much easier than the other paths anya 58 verses says why for the others we know it is very very difficult for the gyana marga the part of knowledge every time you have to go on discriminating that i am these i am these like that but for the love it is already there so one can the anya smart sula that that is that devotion is already there love is already there unselfishness is already there that's why swami vivekananda said each soul is potentially divine what is the divinity love and unselfishness and then he said you have to manifest it the goal is to manifest the divinity within you have to manifest that what that love and unselfishness it is already there but i love only my keith and keen i love only those close people don't like that like that that love should break the boundary and embrace each and every one that is the love of god unselfishness is there sometimes some good the food i share with others even sometimes we have seen the mothers and the grandmothers after completing all the cooking when they are just going to seat for the food after the almost the whole day work they are hungry they are tired if sometimes that very moment any beggar comes and says mother i am hungry they used to offer the whole plate to them they will take a little recipe water and go and take rest so that is also that sacrifice is also there so that sacrifice there love is there only we have to manifest it the anestho the love is already there so naturally just increase that love brahmanan s best among other paths you know in traditional hinduism there are four paths path of knowledge path of devotion path of uh the meditation and then part of karma the four are there but here the narada he is telling devotion is easy bhagavan sirama krishna wants to say it it is easy others are also taking you to the same goal but this is easiest path why then he is giving the because for the love when it is increasing that is the proof that you are proceeding towards god but for the knowledge path of knowledge you do not know whether you are truly having that realization or not you are judging you are discriminating and constantly trying to think but still that feeling is not coming the realization is not coming even after practicing for 60 years when you ask that person oh i am trying to realize that it will be telling that and the meditation also very very difficult today is a good meditation next day there is some anxiety some problem they can't concentrate and for the work also if you are doing then some people will misunderstand some people will criticize and that breaks your mind and you lose the uh the intention to do that all difficulties are there but the love for god is just within you and the more it is increasing more you are feeling no i must have to go now it is so cold and have i increase the heat in the shrine you get up and you go and you shake yes now it is okay but it is so cold outside i have increased the heat into 70 72 in my own room is that sirama krishna or the lord they are sleeping are they having that you need not to tell anyone that is automatically if you feel that there's a great example of ramakrishna nanda jee's life and there's a direct disciple of bhagavan sirama krishna these unique souls if we know about them we know about religion and there will be no confusion about religion religion makes each and everyone very confused they are constantly thinking whether we should be with race or without dress the bare body or the marks are all these and shall we chant the whole day nothing like that that is helping but the true religion is in practice what is the practice love for god what do you know one day it was the drizzling it was raining we can say and suddenly that this ramakrishna nandaji he noticed that water is dripping or near where the surama krishna's picture was there i said srama krishna's picture in the shrine he didn't remove the picture from there no if for us we would have just gone and removed the picture it's a dead night lord is sleeping it is not the picture it is the lord sleeping over there how can i disturb you sleep whole night this swami was holding an umbrella over that picture apparently people will see what is it looking at that see that he is protecting the picture like that he could remove the picture that's all next morning he could but the love for god is so he can't see it's a picture he sees the original the real god is sleeping that proves his spirituality the love is the easiest path why because it is already within us why because the more it grows more it gives us the proof that i am proceeding towards the right path then how we can know the growth of devotion again the question and the 60th aphorism the narada is telling shanti rupath parama anand the rupacha the more you grow in religion in devotion more you become calm and composed and you never fight with others never criticize others and by that way you are always in peace and happiness in joy and whoever comes to you they also feel that there is no aggressiveness these are the proofs that i am really developing neighbor what are the proofs of the love for god again they are asking never care for public appreciation when you are asking well i am feeling that i am developing the love for god but how people will understand is there any that yet stick the measurement that that they can understand yes apparently even first is the shanti he is very calm and he's composed and always peaceful and at the same time he always enjoy in whatever condition they are and very happy anand the roo part and the it says that the proof is never care for public appreciation now why in the 61 aphorism narada said that because it is a subtlest bondage the other bondages of the attraction for the worldly things these that it may one can overcome but the subtlest bondage is the appreciation of the people the people who are appreciating they don't know but whom they're appreciating he's in trouble another he starts feeling or she starts feeling oh i'm a great person doing great job in the world and he she forgets that even the lord buddha tried to do good to the world but the world remains in same way the krishna the rama each and everyone came and the ultimately swami vivekananda said you should work work for the betterment of others and you should die i want to see you dedicated dedicating your life like that and saying vivekananda afterwards said that is the truth you can never change this world because it's made up the lord's maya and swami vivekananda's language is a dog's curly tail and if you try to straight it as long as you are holding it straight the moment you remove again it will go and curl so what we should do then he is telling no public appreciation it will be always simple and never ever cared for anything when two persons when suramar krishna was alive the two great person in the calcutta in those days they started talking about sirama krishna one was the great dramatist and another was a famous doctor suramar krishna hindi heard about it and he became very angry he said one who doesn't know both of them doesn't know anything about the realization of god and they are talking about me in those mainly people they'll be talking about you know that person is so great so and if you go if you just touch you then you'll be blessed like that they go on telling that's a brand that person also start feeling oh it must be like that this public appreciation is dangerous does not stop normal behavior with others look at it friends these are the points that we should understand so when we are trying to judge a holy person how we will though he doesn't talk he doesn't eat he opens his door only once in a year and we think that's the great thing here devarus is telling he behaves just like a normal person first never care for the public appreciation does not stop normal behavior with others always avoid intimacy with the other sex do not crave for wealth do not mix with worldly people worldly people miss selfish type of people they always think about themselves the way they used to come to visit sirama krishna they'll be talking only about them about their wealth about their health when there is to go away sadama krishna is to say can you please pour some ganga water on that particular spot there he was standing so these type of people one should avoid gives a pride vanity and other vices and divide all action devote all action to god that means whatever he is doing at least mentally he is thinking oh lord you gave me the intellect so i could do this i was successful because of your grace in the canopus and the last part of the kingdom punished it speaks about the story there in the devas including the indra the god of gods then they were boasting after defeating the asuras then a gentleman came a yaksa in between man and god they he came and told hey where are you people then they came agni came who are you he said i will tell about me but who are you i am ugly i am the fire god you don't know me so like that he said okay can you please burn this straw it was an insult for the fire fire god he could immediately understand either this man is an insane or he must be someone great but agni because of the eagerness to prove because he was so much pri proud about his power he wanted tried to burn that straw he couldn't burn he went back hid hanging on his chest then came the the bayou the same thing when the indra came he vanished he never wanted to talk to indra even then ultimately the what happened they saw the the one the oh on the sky there is a wonderful lady that is uma himabati and the uma rimavati explained that this is the brahman he said you people are boasting thinking that you have won this war it's the power of the brahmana so that is the story in the canopunishad so he says he devotes all his dedicates all his work to god they talk about god with other devotees in choked voice kantabarudha when they talk about god they become so emotional emotional in love cantabruda then in haripulation their hairs and the body stood an end it's so joy romantia astrovihi and they'll be shedding tears the moment of their life they became pure because every single moment of their life become meditation of that god every single moment they're only thinking about god and narada used that thing that condition of the devotee in only single word it says the seventieth aphorism only one single word the narada used and that person become god himself when a person when talking about god and thinking about god constantly meditating on god and cannot think anything else but god he becomes god she becomes god so that is the way tanmaya if we break this single word it becomes in that that means in that god maya merges so this just simply merges with the god see friends then the person leaving as a human form but in reality he is god the narada is appreciating that condition and it is possible again one can merge with god only when there remains no ego in the person if there is an ego it can never go to god because we are separated from god because of the ego and nothing else so bhagavan si ramakrishna gives a wonderful example he said if a trade is jutting out the small little then you cannot put that into the eye of the needle it should be straight otherwise it won't pass through the eye of the needle so that is the way one should understand if there is any little ego no i cannot realize god when i am going to realize god when i am going to realize god many people they will be asking maharaja i have taken 15 years this uh the initiation but what happened nothing that we cannot because of the ego i like to realize god i have taken initiation i am doing meditation the full of ego then that is the reason one cannot realize god simply say what does it matter there is nothing but god again and again the scripture is telling i must be there so i let me be humble religion is nothing but developing wonderful qualities religion is nothing but wonderful qualities will conclude with that friends and we should remember that because lot of time we are giving right from our childhood holding the hand of our grandma grandfather we go to the temple and from then onwards we help our children to go to the temple whole life we are giving so much of time so much of money so much of energy but we don't develop spirituality you know why because we don't have the idea about the spirituality about the god realization so this narada bhakti sutra that we are reading and going to conclude is a very very important book to give us this idea some people are there they're eager to complete as if you know in the colleges in the university they complete the course and then they'll be examined it's nothing like that when we're going to complete when you are going to complete that means you are not reading you have to understand that each and every aphorism you know swami turiya nanda ji maharaj is a great direct disciple of bhagavan krishna he used to read only one verse from the bhagavad-gita in one day and he'll be meditating meditating meditating on that all day he will meditate only one verse and when we are reading the bhagavad gita the devotee is a maraj today are you going to finish 15 words so that we can complete this chapter and we will go to next chapter as if hurriedly if we complete oh we have completed the bhagavad gita so happy but what you have learned from that scripture nothing so this is the way we are wasting our time religion means developing the qualities god realization means those qualities now he says like this how can we how we shall know that blessed person who is that blessed person as he says that means he the whole personality he is thinking and his behavior he is talking everything nothing but god he merges with god everything every moment nothing but god how you will know that person he's in a human form human body behaving very normally with everyone not that he is just flowing in the air without the airplane or he is walking on the water and doing these all miracles nothing like that so normal he'll be in the crowd only and when all the crowd trying to see a holy man or god he will also be there he is also trying to see the holy man like that so friend again i will say read the bible of your siram krishna don't think that i am only saying because i am the follower of ramakrishna is really really all these teachings in the leaving example you will find so humble but all is that god how we will know look at it nasty means not there na asti not there the issue in them in that person those people those who have realized brahman realized god and they are in human form they are living gods they never talk about caste never talk about learning never talk about beauty never talk about family or wealth or profession nothing nothing nothing is it not so easy to understand that those who are talking about those things suramar krishna never asked anyone who ever used to visit him he will be talking with and if that person is little worldly minded is oh sad i have heard that you are a holy person please please me so that i am having a litigation in the high court i become don't they say hey this is nothing this is not the place but if they went can you place that talk about god who is god how to realize god sram krsna's door was open for them he never asked are you a brahmin are you a shattriya nothing like are you a rich person and some people they say it because when narendra not the and the other people they went like the rakhal maharaj he was the son of a rich man jamindar not very far from dikshitar narendra's father was very famous and very rich in calcutta so naturally you know the worldly people used to and they say to surama krishna you love those young boys because they are from from the very aristocratic family and rich family you like to impress their parents so that they give you some donations ram krishna became mad immediately he went to that the dhaka national mother kali you know for us it is only a statue as a stone image but for suramar krishna is a living mother and what the child will do when it is in trouble like that sudama krishna went to the mother and said mother do i love these young boys because of their parents wealth then the mother told him no no no no you love them because you see the purity in them he came back like a child and with and with all another boastfulness mother said i love them because they are pure i'm not going to you rascal don't talk like this i'm not going to listen to you so that is the jaati but if you go to the religious people and i went to visit it i visited a religious person and there they were giving me the food i'm a monk even then they were throwing food hey what is this why you are throwing the braids like that we don't know what cost you are can you imagine they're very known famous and these people bare body and all prospering i was really not liking their the way they were giving the food but still that's because i went over there and this is the way they behave and they think they are religious we think they are religious we go and pour everything to them understand what is religion and if we don't then it is our laws the narada in 72 aphorism very clearly says oh he has studied from this university that university and his teacher was these this teacher was that if they say like that know for sure that there is no religion there's nothing about god then rupa is so beautiful looking the one gentleman told me one day then at that time i was a brahmacharya maybe i was a little he liked me that way he said i like to take initiation from you from me i mean brahmachary but anyway why you were taking interested to take initiation from me now you are so good looking like the netaji you know that in bengal there's a in india there's a great personality the netaji subhash chandra bush a little maybe little some similarity in those days in the younger days i told in that case you better go and take initiation from a cinema actor in the in that time in our time there was a great cinema actor he also still he's famous uttam kumar you may not be knowing many of you but was very famous because of his beauty so i thought you better go to uttam kumar and take a decision if you want to see the physical beauty is a worthless he said no cool rupa or cooler on the family he is from sacha and such family no one should dhana and kriya the neighbor then he said yata yah for them everything is nothing but god bhagavan sirama krishna used to love one boy who was a servant in in in the calcutta very rich man and then he became a great not only scholar but a realized soul lord to maharaja it's a very famous name in ramakrishna order swami advoca the name was a wonder he never knew even a single later but he realized that brahman so obviously those who are realized god have realized god for them no discrimination and yata yaha because for them everything is nothing but the god now they worship giving advices to those who want to develop supreme devotion now what are the advices he was going on giving example and explaining these this then now he is giving some advices and he said do not waste time by talking and debating about god this is the first advice why because it has been proved by the great soul the god is there bhagavan sirama krishna he said god is there and in his inimicable bengali original language he said myribalchi i'm taking the oath of my mother and i'm telling you there is god you can talk to god you can see god now again i go and start reading and debating to prove that god is there or not is the wastage of time don't do that read those books and perform those works that will help you to develop devotion in the 76th aphorism that he is telling only read those books that will develop your devotion some people will be writing so many people will be they don't know anything about only they have the command over the language and they will be writing wonderfully and from here from there some idea and they'll say oh this is a yesterday i opened a book and i found some people asking a question to a gentleman he is giving the reply the first question and the reply was completely wrong i closed that book and kept it because this is the way to people they think they can do they have not realized anything that's bhagavan si ramakrishna also said that sometimes some people will remark in a very wrong way the this is the you have to understand that some uh one person was asking in the stable how many cows are there he's not having the idea that the cows don't don't stay in that cable stable it's the horses only but that way the surama krishna mentioned see these people are so ignorant and they're talking about god so one should be very much careful choosing the books as a guide and then perform those works that has been asked for by the great the scholars to develop devotion you being free from worldly attention attraction use most of your time in prayer in 77th he says now that you have realized now you have released yourself particularly those who are retired from their jobs after the retirement they become frustrated oh now what i'm going to do that is the time to utilize after the retirement you are completely free and as because you have walked all through your life some reserve is there so you name don't to worry about the money in that way now you use your time for realization of god because time is short that he is telling the as because you are free from worldly attraction use most of your time in prayer then in 78 eighth aphorism he says these are the qualities you must develop first is non-violence when there is love that is non-violence i am not killing animals but i am criticizing others hating others sending another wrong messages about others to damage their images that is also himsha so non that is also great violence that's why shankaracharya he gave the definition of non-violence that one should not disturb others lifeline by that way so this is the way we have to understand ahimsha non-violence so i love each and every one so i'm not going to heart i'm not going to criticize so this is the first satya truthfulness whatever is there i must practice that i must tell that that is the satya and shocha cleanliness that sometimes some people the thing as because we are religious people we must be little dirty walking all bare food and not shaving and these there so sometimes people look at that the great the devotee of god he has no time to even to be there's nothing like that it says is a very pure cleanliness socha bhagavan surama krishna was very very particular about that if the body is not clean the dress is not clean mind is also going to be affected by that is the reason they always say in the hindu temple when you go they always insist that you should go after bathing and wearing at least to wash clothes that is the reason in every spiritual place if the compassion is is not there for others so i am surviving in this world because so many people helping me right from my birth the nurse the doctor those who help the mother to give me the birth and then they gave me the medicine i don't know them at all i don't remember them at all almost all of us we don't know we only know our mother but all those other ladies the nurses those doctors and other people the hospital staff then the polish people all around they are in this cold they're outside to protect protect us and the soldiers they're in the border protecting the whole country and there are teachers there are business men they're bringing food each and everyone if you just see it and think oh yes true each and every one helping to me to survive shall i not be grateful to them so those who are fabulously rich people it is their duty to share their wealth with others those who are unfortunate by that way only you are paying back the debts that you have received from others that is called daya not throwing a coin to some poor people not not like that is that feeling i am indebted to each and every one so that is the austic and ultimately it is the faith faith in the existence of god and faith in oneself that i am going to realize god yes why not what's the problem with me nothing if the lord jesus could realize god if caitanya mahaprabhu could realize god if buddha could realize the truth why not me i can also do that with that faith it is not ego is the complete faith that faith will help you i am going to realize god maybe their great soul they realized in this life maybe i will have to wait another two three lives no problem but i am going to realize god today or tomorrow so by that with the astika aadhi then charityani these are the virtues so what we learn friends ultimately the religion means developing the virtues what is the religion give us virtues and that's why each and every one if they understand religion whatever the religion they follow there is nothing but the wonderful virtues and now think of it if we truly practice religion whatever religion you follow but truly follow that you develop those qualities like this non-violence truthfulness cleanliness compassion and faith in god the whole world will become heaven we need not to bother about heaven we need no i am going to go to heaven nothing here itself will be the heaven so that we have to understand that's why swami vivekananda said religion is a process that makes a brute unto god god makes a burden to man man unto god i'm sorry religion is a process that makes a brute unto man man unto god brute means selfish man means a compassionate person and from there to god is a process why should he fight with religion my religion is good your religion is bad and why just follow your path and show that you are truly a compassionate person a loving person is every day and night you should go on taking the name of god that's why in the vaisnava they introduce the initiation process that's the easiest the people they go to the holy people they give the name of god and they go on repeating and when everything you are doing you are just going on repeating by that way the name of god is god himself that if you are going on repeating that name you are constantly in company of god now the narada says don't think that i am alone telling this the kumara this is the narada himself vyasa you know the great name in the past shuka his son shandelia a great muni garga vishnu in the rama and famous bibishan they all they taught the what is this religion so whosoever believes in these auspicious description of the divine love by narada and has faith in these teachings become a lover of god attains the highest benetude and reaches the supreme goal of life thank you friends and i was thinking as a you know that the chairperson she was asking me again and again to tell the name to disclose it i was thinking we will now in the next session from the march we will read kapila upadhisha it is a dialogue between a son and the mother usually the mother they give advices to the children's son but here opposite the sun is giving advices to the mother it's a wonderful scripture and again that will be on the basis of the advaita vedanta so i think we should stop over here is there any question so takadi dash is asking the love for god is it not love for oneself if we believe that god is in us so how can that love be selfless now i think if you think the myself means this body and mind then it is selfish no and when you think this body and mind belong to god of course it is love for myself so this mind should be a bigger mind when the lord jesus said give up everything and come to me when the lord krishna said sarvadharman paritta mommy comes this mom is not the body it's not that particular the person the krishna that we see in the pictures and all that with the flute it is not it is all pervading consciousness so if you think that you have developed that love for god and the god is within you and then it is your loving yourself is the same love for god thank you mr rook is asking is mantra able to develop bhakti to god of course bishop of course because when you are taking the name of the lord the god the guru has given that itself is sufficient you have to have the faith and just go on repeating the name of god and if you go to check like the growth like a boy who planted a small other a small you know that sapling and every day his father told just go on little water you give and it will grow and he will give the water and take out the plant from that and then you'll see how much it has grown again you will put every day by that way he killed that plant it is nothing like that just have faith in the words of the guru and guru has given the name go on taking the name of god listen to the holy people develop love by reading also as we are discussing and see all the good qualities are slowly slowly developing within yourself and know it for sure you are developing love for god thank you devashish is asking as you said don't waste time by taking and by talking and debating about god then there are people who never agrees with the truth behind and following superstitions year by year for example people doing fasting for 24 hours before offering prayer to god then what is that to you if if you are sincere don't go to for others you are thinking that's good but after fasting maybe they are feeling that there are everywhere all these things are there when they are fasting they'll be walking all these things are necessary for that particular person but here it says you have the complete faith in the words of narada that god is there and if you pray to god and take his name his holy name then he says it is there god is there and don't waste your time fasting of course is a wonderful practice to develop the spirituality you know but you are controlling your senses then why should you criticize let them do it so that by controlling but the thing is sometimes some people will go on arguing there is no god i don't see god so don't i don't believe like that wasting of time that that narada mentioned so the next question is from arubdas he's saying is there a necessity to live social life in this ansar is everybody should everybody marry aruba these are all you know that it depends on the person person to person it all depends on them whether they will marry whether he will be alone these are all depending on the person's mind his thoughts even if you are married even if you are having the family so many millions of people they are householders but i have seen among the householders that are so good people so wonderful people the religion that helps the person to grow so obviously and i have seen among the monks they are monks not that bachelor only their monks even among them that growth is not there so it is the growth love of god as we have already discussed you will feel that each and every one is nothing but the manifestation of the same god so there will be no hatred there will be no enmity so that these are the qualities and you know it is all personal experience spirituality is a purely personal experience because your father was a great soul you will get the benefit no nothing like that because your guru was a wonderful person of course that helps thinking in the good qualities of the guru but at the same time it is your own effort is mentioning in the bible it is depending on the person who is trying to realize god and the student maybe the professor is excellent professor but the student is not that capable to understand the professor you won't get the benefit of his teaching isn't it the same way i should say we should not go and see what the other people are doing the time is short so i should think that can i do it within this period of life let me go and if i feel that i should marry i should have the family the great desire it is better to marry and then have that family not no problem because you are going on repeating the name of god within yourself praying to god secretly you can practice there will be no problem thank you friends thank you for listening to this talks and again i thank the the spiritual center vivekananda spiritual center of the hindu temple of lemont the lemont is the next village so they have arranged it and from march onwards if god will will be all in person and let us complete by saying shanti three times o mishandi [Music] see you after two months you
