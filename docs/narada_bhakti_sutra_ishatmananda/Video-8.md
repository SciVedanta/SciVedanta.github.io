[9. Fragrance of Vedanta: Narada Bhakti Sutra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65RvqStG_dQ)

morning dear devotees and friends today is the first saturday of the month and our hindu temple of layment they organize this study of the narada bhakti sutra the main the theme is the fragrance of vedanta and we have already completed some of the great the scripture now we are studying narada let us begin with this mantra yes yes [Music] [Music] i bow down to lord visnu the great god whose mere remembrance makes one free from the bondage of birth and death so now we are studying how the narada he is going on giving the different definitions of the devotion and he is encouraging us to follow the path of devotion this is the beautiful way that the hinduism developed it has different paths according to the taste aptitude likings people can follow and the teachers will always encourage naturally when he is studying uh to teaching the devotion he will encourage his students to follow that particular path like a chemistry teacher will say oh there is nothing like chemistry you must study chemistry the physics professor will say physics is the best thing you must study physics like that each and every teacher they will promote their own subject but all are leading to the same goal and that is the knowledge here also as because there are different type of temperament different type of mentality uh there are people who are very uh an analytical so for them the path of knowledge emotional devoted for the path of devotion very active part of karma a very contemplative the path of dhyana and now this way of course swami vivekananda and his guru bhagavan sirama krishna they have prescribed the combination of all the four yogas so that is so it goes like that now we are studying the vedanta and tomorrow again in the morning we will meet and we will study the pure advaita gyana so that is yoga vashishta that's a pure advaita ghana will be there and now this is we are studying the bhakti and in the bhakti the last month we completed 30th the sloka of of this narrative now the brahma kumara means the narada himself as we have already discussed he said and then very beautifully he said bhakti is the cause and and bhakti is the effect now when we are practicing the path of knowledge we get brahma-gyana there are different type of uh practices are there like the sravana manana nidit dhyasana those who are practicing the path of knowledge they don't meditate because on whom they will meditate and who is going to meditate so they don't worship because there is no god conception in that path so they are practicing only bicharan ultimately they are reaching to a knowledge that everything is nothing but the one whom they have named termed as brahman the all-pervading consciousness is the brahman but the bhakti is a different thing when you are practicing bhakti you have already achieved that this is the beauty of the path of devotion so when we are practicing the devotion path of bhakti then slowly the narada says that this is the way you can understand swayam follow rupa fella rupa ta swayam that path itself is the result the cause and the effect are the same what is the cause practices what are the practice devotion what type of devotion the god is everywhere he is within my heart and he is everywhere and practicing that and when i am practicing that ultimately follow rupatha i see the god only and nothing else the practice and the result are the same in the verse 31 and 32 the narada there's a direct experience and not mere knowledge the idea of the guard it for example naruto says just by seeing a palace can you make the king happy now we completed up to 30 or 38 words last month this month we are beginning with 31 and in the 31 narada is continuing giving the example you have to develop the love for god you have to realize god you have to become god and and obviously he's telling suppose you go and see a palace i'm not reading that aphorism suppose you go and see a palace can you make the king happy by that no that is not possible so obviously you have to go and meet the king you have to stay with the king you have to develop relation with the king king will start liking you then only it is successful the ultimate goal to visit the palace to develop the relationship of with the king now when we are going to the temple just by seeing the beautiful temple architecture and the he was the architect and this is this this is that so many things externally and we are so happy and people will be telling some of the volunteers will be there they will be telling you know this is the whole thing that you see it's just curved from one stone and the stone came from italy so they will say like that and you are very happy but what about god when you are going to a temple it is not of course beautiful architecture that gives the joy that is okay and those who are doing they're also getting happy that for god we have made a beautiful temple that's also good but what about the person who is going over there to realize god unless he reaches over there unless he sees the god feels the attraction for god it is of no use so narada says giving that example that suppose you go to a palace and see the whole palace but don't get any acquaintance with the king it is of no use some people used to come to bhagavan si rama krishna they were worldly minded people they were not very much interested in spirituality religion and sudama krishna very humble looking the very ordinary person apparently so they never took interest in that and when they went over there salaam krishna himself he could read the minds he himself is to say you better go and visit the the flower garden over there by the bank of the ganga the flowing beautiful river and the flowers go over there and there are so many temples shiva temple all the 12 shiva temples go and visit those then another side there is this temple that go and visit but those who were interested them used to say sit over here and let me talk to you so this acquaintance when we go to a temple and then only see here and there and don't get acquainted with the god or listen about him hear about him read about him what is the use of that so he is telling in 31 words just by seeing a palace can you make the king happy no then in the next the sloka he says just by seeing food can you satisfy your hunger he is giving more practical example the friends this is the teaching our goal is to develop love for god so when we are going to visit the temple because this is the study that we are the the book that you are studying and the hindu temple of uh the greater chicago lehmannt they are organized it's a beautiful temple many of you must have visited and it has so many gods and goddesses suppose you entered into the temple and you first see the majestic statue of swami vivekananda and by the side of the the statue there is a hall where different type of cultural programs they organize and then you climb and you see that the first temple of the goddess durga and other gods and goddesses then you go to the rama temple krishna temple so all this now if you are not interested in that you just go over there and there is a of course a very interesting place is there that is the kitchen if you go over there and there you can get the very tasty food and you take the food and come out you are not getting the benefit of visiting the temple of course you will be satisfied with the food of but you are not getting the the benefit of visiting the holy place so this is the teaching of the narada when you are going to the temple the first thing you must go to the temple you must remember god at least from distance you should bow down and should remember god and take his blessings then you go to other places and meet your friends and whatever so the purpose should be that bhagavan srama krishna again and again he used to say and in that we were reading in the gospel he was mentioning look at these ladies they have come to bathe in the ganga it's a holy deep that they will take but instead of thinking about that the holiness of the goddess ganga who has come from the the the feet of the vishnu and from the head of the sheba and all these great people they have been in that right from the lord buddha and the shankara and everyone so we are going to beat into that holy river and it is coming down from the himalaya if you think in that way only that deep will make you happy because you are thinking about that but if the thought is not there it will be just like dipping in any water and they are going on chatting discussing about their worldly things what is happening in the family they will go down over there and rubbing their body cleaning their body discussing other things they came up and we had a ganga bat they will go and announce to the other people oh we went over there the holy place with 2k but in that holy river by effect zero nothing because you didn't thought about that it is not the body it is the mind and in the mind the thought that is going on that is most important now friends the 33rd diaphorism the narada is telling the smart save the smart means therefore sa is that that means the bhakti here the reference is bhakti eba only should be accepted the seekers of liberation as because narada is teaching the devotion so he is naturally as i was telling all teachers uh they will always say that my subject is the best subject you better come and join in my class then not other is telling like that but of course the bhakti is very easy and anyone can try over here gyana very difficult very difficult another other also activity and and meditation but the bhakti as because we have the love inside our mind we are having that love and we love the association we like to give the gift to the others all those temperaments all those uh our mental feeling if we offer to god that will take us to god so it is telling it will be better the tasman therefore the bhakthi eva only devotion graham should accept who the seekers of liberation mumuk should be if we are not mumukshu if we are not interested in getting the liberation enough is enough this world that we have seen we have enjoyed now it is time for me to go out of this every day you have to pray to god god you have given me this life so many experiences that is enough now please take me to your abode that should be the everyday prayer and they are called mumuksu mumuksu means those who are hankering for liberation liberation from what we are living in a free country america is a free country and we are all free people but then liberation for what liberation of the bondage of our desire we are bound by our desires and desires we're not satisfied anger and when anger is there i go do something for which again i am suffering so that is this circle goes on and everything because of our ego i i i me and mine so i have to understand that and the prayer should be oh god you have created me you have given me all this my ego my desire now take it back i don't need it i only need you and what is god is nothing but love love and love love that encompasses all love that knows no boundary it is not the little love that i love my children or my country or my these are that is love that encompasses all how because i see god in everything i see my god has created all these i cannot hate anyone so this is the beauty of the devotion it generates love and that love for each and everything this is the beauty and and he says mumuk should be therefore the seekers of liberation should accept bhakti and bhakti before it generates you have to have the faith the complete faith in the existence of god how you will develop bhakti bhakti is a path some of the practices but the very first thing that the faith the god is there if you don't believe that god is there and then how can we so if you are going to love someone there should be someone at least some ideology some ideas maybe a country something must be there so it is dualistic the either the god or something it is better to have the god or goddess should be there and i believe the god is there as bhagavan si rama krishna after the long practices after their realization then he declared i swear in the name of my mother god is there you can talk to god you can see god can you imagine now this is called the proof who is giving the proof a person who is so genuine who was not having any selfish motive why he will ask people to go towards god sometimes some people in the name of god they are satisfying their own needs sometimes political sometimes economical sometimes then previously the kings used to say we are the representative of god and they will have very good relation with the priest and they will both the priest and the king hand in hand they will go on torturing the ordinary people and they will utilize the name of god that's why the people have lost faith in god and also the religion because of this misunderstanding and the misuse the god is nothing but love and god has created each and every one he has created that our priest the king and also the peasant the ordinary people why there will be difference from the sight of the eye of the father whether one son is very intelligent and he is a doctor or an engineer or an officer and another son is not that intelligent but the love is same for the father they he will love both the children both the sons equally so but same way when we are thinking of god god is there and god has created me so naturally he is my father he is my mother and i have every right to go back to my father to my mother the complete love and dedication for the god and what i need i like to go back to my abode that prayer father you brought me over here in this playground i have enjoyed it and the children sometime in the afternoon they will go with their parents their parents will be sitting on a bench and the children will be playing outside and there will be different type of games are there they'll enjoy this one that one and when slowly the dusk come it is evening they come back to the parents and say we are tired we like to go back home the same way we are having this experience in this world those who are still want to get the experience of joy happiness money and the name fame is different for them it is about the mumuk shoes those who are tired of those some people will clap some newspaper will publish your picture and some article about you and for that the next day that newspaper will go somewhere no one will read that rather they may be using that paper with your picture for cleaning some dust and all that so naturally it is not that good isn't it so it is better to have the joy the happiness within if we discuss in this way think in this way ponder in this way then it's called bichara and that bichara that discrimination that analysis will detest your mind from the worldly things and then you turn towards god this creation there must be a creator and he is god scientists are trying to find it out and they are approaching from the externally and external and internal there are two things are there the mind and the body they are also analyzing the mind and at the back of the mind behind the mind there is a self the consciousness almost there they are trying to reach the moment they will reach over there then they will stop no more search they will say chit dante sarva-samsayaha all my doubts are now gone i am free there is no doubt there is god there is consciousness who is there and i can call him as a father or a mother or a friend or whatever relation i like to develop in that way but it is there so first is the faith and second is complete love and dedication when i am loving someone i am expecting something in return no that is a different type of love here the love is only one way i only love you whether you like me or not love me or not doesn't matter i want to see you happy that's all and nothing else there are beautiful stories are there and sometimes some of the places a direct disciples of bhagavatam krishna they used to visit they found those type of the love that is unthinkable so that love completes sacrifice i like this person and for that for his joy whatever he wants no problem but if you love one human being the result will be only suffering because that human being is not having the capacity to give you anything else and he is selfishly utilizing your services all your devotions no that's why it is better to love god the god means nothing but the love and unselfishness so that is the purity what is god purity what is the purity love and unselfishness so these are the two qualities if you find in someone that is your goal bhagavan sirama krishna is nothing but love and unselfishness so that is the reason we are accepting him as our goal as our god he is there if you pray he is going to answer the first is the faith the second is the love and the love means dedication you have to give give and give when this supreme love arises one becomes illumined sees the god or atman in all beings his heart becomes filled with eternal joy how we will know that we are proceeding towards god heart will be the mind will be always in full of joy the one person came to a sadhaka he wasn't he was practicing austerity and that man came and went on telling or criticizing him and every day used to criticize and whenever he used to calm the critic to insult him unnecessarily but this man will offer him a seat a glass of water and he will see it as if he is listening to a holy discourse and well please if do you like to say something about me like that two three days that man god what is happening i'm coming to insult him and he's behaving like that when the other people who is to like this person said why don't you tell him not to come you are not protesting no no no he's my great friend he's coming and criticizing me and immediately i can identify oh these are the loopholes these are the things that i must have to pluck i have to stop so that whatever the spirituality i am earning is not going out nowadays as because i am not aware so whatever i am earning it is going out it's like a pitcher if the pitcher is having two three holes may be very tiny still the water will go out and you are filling the pitcher again the water is going down so if you close those then the water will retain so we are taking the name of god we are visiting the holy place we are listening to the holy talks we are reading holy books so many practices we are doing then why then we are not developing because in our mind there are some holes and we are not aware of it if someone comes and says you are so egoistic you see it why why you are telling like this or these this this this oh yes yes he say that's true i must be careful from now onwards you are plugging the holes that you are very greedy there was this thing and you have ate you never thought about others there were other members we you could share yeah that's true that's a great mistake i have done from now onwards i will think first about others offer that to others then anything left over then only i will take so you are plugging and your ego is going out all these things are and that is why it needs the great mind why my goal is to realize god and if people are criticizing me it is good because my egos are heart and heart and heart and it crashes it goes out and i go and cry to god you are my only refuse my god and there is no one no friend tamiva shakasha you are the only shaka you are the only friend i don't need anyone's company please help me so when all other peoples are there people are appreciating you forget god so that is the reason it is better for those who are mumoku in god never care about the criticism or the praising of the worldly people so constantly the goal is to reach to the goal and he says how can one attain the this capitus condition narada says in the 34th averaism aphorism so this is the the we can say the indian tradition these great teachers they're very humble they never say i am telling you no they always say others say that when gentlemen he went to another teacher and said can you please teach me at that particular knowledge by knowing which i can understand everything then he said i am not telling those who are knowers of the brahman he himself is the noah brahman but very humble the neighbors say i i i the moment you say i sometimes we receive letters it's a seven line letters and five times i i i in the 7 line there are 5i they're great so this is the way we have to understand and we have to understand that all these things have already been done some great speakers and there all the time you cannot look at them they are constantly what is it what they are telling like today i am reading the narada bhakti sutra what i am saying not other's words this is not my own realization and composition narada already said it and so many great teachers have already expounded it this is my turn i got and i'm giving that's all so he says means to achieve that supreme love sadhana in the practices gayanthi explained why the word gayanthi sang the ghana ghana means the it's not english ghana sanskrit god ghana means the song gayantha means they explained in such a beautiful way as if you were listening a music a song gayanti acharya acharya means those who have already realized it so they are the great teachers acharya not others study not that i am telling i also heard i also read i also practiced and then from there only i am telling the humbleness if there is no humbleness then it is very difficult to realize god why we are already god but we can understand it because there is only only and only cover is ego self-confidence is always good one should be self-confident but at the same time no ego so these the difference are self-confidence and ego is very very important so it's narada says the practices sadhanani by which one can achieve the supreme love for god has been taught by the great teachers acharya and one teacher know many teachers it's not a single the plural why only y can say and no one else something wrong the some of the the the philosophies are there or the religions that they're only one teacher and no one else no one else will be able to get that that is wrong very wrong why if that person whoever may be maybe krishna maybe srirama but he came as a human and as a human he was practicing something like the lord rama like the tradition at the age of six he went to a guru griha he studied over there stayed with the guru served the guru learned of many things then at the age of 16 he came back that is normal of course rama completed that little early so at the age of 12 he came back to his father krishna also the same way and his brother balarama elder brother both of them they went to a teacher they got the training and lived with all other ordinary people that's all but they are gods the krishna was the god but when he is in human form he is behaving like that same we find in the life of sri ramakrishna very ordinary person people are coming and bringing food to him way the brahmin not having furniture give the food sometimes the clothing sometimes little these help than that and he is accepting that recognizing that very happy and people are thinking we are giving him but he was the god he created the whole universe but he was so humble so different teachers at different times they realized the same knowledge and giving if we practice the same thing whatever the practices they did we are also going to be same like that maybe ordinary person can never become an avatara because avatara that is the incarnations of god it is god only taking that form but we can reach to that height that god hate we can mix with the god we can be with brahman why not if not then what is the use of it someday i will go to heaven then there will be someone and he will open the oh this is your record and then some of the pages of the record are missing then i will go and argue sir i did some good work why it is not written over there so is it like this it is not like that we are acquiring the good merit good result over here and of course we are getting the same result if not some wrong is there something that is called scientific way if you are boiling the water and then putting some rice in that it will be the cooked for food for everyone the same process if you follow anywhere anytime same result if not there's something wrong so this is the way the lead religion also so the narada is telling tastya sadhanani gayanthi acharya and what is that sadhana the very first teaching all the acharyas all the teachers narada said is telling the very first thing you should practice to develop the love for god supreme love for god so objects all these things in the name and form that is called visaya any name and any form is called bishaya why bishaya bisho means the object it has been created and if you like that you attest to that and you feel that without that i am not going to survive then it is not god realization the development of love for god is not for you you enjoy those things it's no problem there's some people are there that's why in the our the very famous upanishad ishapunisha it says first the first is the mantra in the upanishad it's it'll say everything you should give up who's the thing that you are going to enjoy everything is nothing but the temporary isha bash you better try to think that the whole the world everything is nothing but that consciousness the very second verse is say well if you can't do that okay you enjoy but keeping in mind that this is temporary so have detachment and then enjoy it's nothing no problem and by that way even if you are surviving for 100 years then slowly slowly you will get detached oh enough or this car and this house i have seen rich people they are coming and donating their car swamiji that was my very favorite car i like to donate to you now it is enough i have driven i have used it's okay now and the houses also they're giving money they're donating why enough so you enjoyed now you're giving it back to the society and you are getting freedom against that immediately the moment you are detaching from the object your mind that very moment you are getting becoming pure and you are developing love for god this is as simple as that if you are going for the world then god is far away going for the god you have to leave the world the both is necessary both i like to keep it's difficult so it will be very very difficult that's why it says supreme love of god can be developed by renouncing objects of enjoyments and attraction towards them sometimes some people will give some old couches and chairs and when they will visit they will come and say oh these are the chairs i donated isn't it for me are you utilizing it are you liking i forget it why if you are not forgetting that you gave it then you are not getting the benefit of that the donation and they will be going on telling see if you go over there all those things we we donated from our family we donated and you must keep a plug over there and in the in block letters he wants to write that i donated and it is in the name of these and that i donated i donated and then they'll be taking the photograph of that blog and sending to all the friends we have donated well you will get all the people who say who a great donor you have donated so much money for that but do you know you will never get benefit of that you will never get the love for god but that donation it goes as if you are giving the taxes to the government like that only why give the taxes to the government do you go and telling like that everybody is giving so to leave like that so these are the small small thing that if we can understand immediately the holes that is there on that picture will be blocked and you are getting a beautiful result and that's why the jesus said that your one hand whatever donation he is giving the other hand should not know it that means you should not go on telling people like that suppose some people out of the the temple they say okay we will announce it because that is also necessary for the society the people will doubt where from you got so much of money and you have constructed so that that temple authority they will put your name on the wall and they say we are grateful to these people they helped that is okay you don't want it but they have given it that's okay but if you go on insisting and then you are promoting and going on and advertising i don't know whether the good result will come or not god and this creation is the object it's the bishaya so tattoo bishoya tiago means giving up what is the vishaya object and how you will know name and form anything having the name and form anything right from the sun the moon the himalayas that these oceans name and form they're all vishaya including our body our relatives everything and if you want god you have to give up his creation the god has created this loving the objector like loving the shadow of a person instead of the person himself now you study when i was reading this i was feeling suppose i i have created my shadow and this is my shadow but someone loved that shadow oh it looks so beautiful and will he get that shadow ever no because it is always changing according to the position of the light the shadow will change so the man is running after the shadow instead of the person whose shadow is that it will be like that even if sometime when the person is standing and you get in full complete shadow and you go and embrace that hold that oh i got that do you think you'll be happy no after some time it will vanish it is just like that if we are going to get the world the creation of the god it is nothing but imagination god imagined and it has just manifested like that like the the magician creating he creates so many things and we truly see those things are there but indirect it is not there he's cutting the body of a girl and in two parts and all people will close their eyes they can't see that terrible thing but after a moment the girl will come out and say how are you so like that so it is all we see but unbelievable things it may happen and if your ordinary person a musician can do that mesmerizing thousands of people think of the power of god and that is called the maya that is wonderfully he can do it so we have to give up that's why shankaracharya he is mentioning in his bible churmani 69 verse he said the very first thing moksha if you are interested to get the liberation the the god realization to go beyond the circle of the birth and death then the very first thing that you have to start practicing means attitude to give up what bust you all these objects because on it it's all temporary so very strong this desire to give up so this is the way we have to understand all these things that we see are all temporary so we have to give it up whether we want it or not so the no one wants to die right but everyone dies we want to hold our all those whom we like we love but one day or other father mother grandpa grandma one after another they go away and we get adjusted with that again someone we love again that goes away it goes on and on and on not that there's something very peculiar we are saying it is all the time it is happening every moment it is happening but still we think oh this is the important thing if you go and open the page of the history the two kings are fighting they want to capture the land where are those two kings but another two kings have come they are doing the same thing and they are also thinking that their names will be there in the history so both of them are fighting again they are gone again and again again and again the same thing going on repeating how many times the same thing you like to see but that maya the wonderful power of that god it goes on giving you the same idea the next it will be good next it will be good it goes on like that that is terrible so we have to understand then you have to say enough give up and what is this giving up sometimes some people will say no we should not wear this we should not eat this we should not drink that we should not visit no not like that simply association if you get a good food enjoy it don't no problem other something ordinary okay today it is okay the good grace okay if not okay so everything whatever comes that's why the great soul our first president of the ramakrishna order swami brahmananda ji said if you get the opportunity to go and live in that or sleep in that palace go no no no that is a palace i am a monk i should not go over there don't bother about that that balance belongs to somebody else he is offering you go and lie down okay this is the palace next day nobody is there you have to spread your own mat under a tree and lie down no problem that is called bhairavakya constantly jumping oh i should not put on the shoe and the bare foot is walking and then some the something developed and the doctors will have to take care a lot of medicine you're creating problem for many people because of that it is nothing like that it's so simple don't get attached to that don't get associated with that in the beginning of course you should be away and as the bhagavatam krishna is telling when the sprout is coming up you have to give the slowly slowly only then only you can develop otherwise not so when the sprout is coming up be very very careful so this is the way you can otherwise it will be very difficult so so this is the way only we have to understand shiva shambhita again it says association of worldly people and things must be avoided otherwise no chance of liberation so no chance of liberation why because of the sangha sangha means association some worldly peoples are there when they are mixing with you they will be talking about the worldly things so naturally it will be constantly in your mind also that type of thought will come and you cannot go beyond of that so this is the problem you must give up the association and association the lord shiva is telling us in the shiva shanghita and this way everywhere we find next let us go to the second teaching the first teaching we have to give up how we can give up we're analyzing how we are analyzing everything is temporary so we don't need it but that is the way second ab now it is a negative we give up give up give up but something positive should be there otherwise what we are going to do don't mix with that person don't go there it's okay but what do i am going to do so i need something to hold on because it is my mind it needs something to think so the he says the narada says the second teaching is the 36th aphorism very simple because the aphorism is small ah all means negative means stop non-stop non-stop work bhajanath so if you go to the uh let's call that the some people who are practicing uh that only devotional path will find that the five times in the whole day they will do the bhajan bhajan kritana in 24 hours the kirtan is going on because they think this they practice this ab constantly you have to go on practicing supreme love of god can be achieved by the continuous practice of worship continuous practice it says it's like the when the water is pouring there may be the bubble of air in the water but when you are pouring the oil no question of bubble of the the ear so they say but not the the water but the the oil so that means there should not be anything else but the name of god constantly so this is the second first give up the objects second engage your mind constantly by taking the name of god thinking about god and the third it says bhagavad-gita one must listen even while working the divine play of god and sing the glory of god while working so sometimes some people think the morning i have taken the name of god that is sufficient no it is not evening and morning i am taking of case that is good but you have to take it 24 hours how you are working you are thinking you are driving how it is possible not that you are too well while you are driving sometimes you are playing the music or the radio listening to the news instead go on taking the name of god or put on some bhajans some good songs or some of the discourses that you are listening and going but you must be careful and when you are working in the offices sometimes you can just think about god or read a page one doctor i know is a before the operation used to say swamiji before the operation i used to take out some pages of krsna's or the swami vivekananda's teaching and one or two teachings i will read i'll keep the book in the pocket and i'll start operation and while i'm operating because so many years i am practicing so it becomes so normal so at the same time i am thinking about the suramar krsna's teaching and that is the way i concentrate so this is possible bhagavan siram krishna gave a beautiful example suppose you are having toothache you are doing everything you are talking to people attending the operation all but every moment god forbid is very terrible that having the toothache but if you are having that problem that pain constantly you are remembering the toothache is there pain is there so you are working normally same way keep a part of your mind at the feet of god go on taking the name of god remembering god and doing the work i have seen the swamis and when they're talking with the people they're going on taking the name of god they'll say oh how are you then the man is answering and he will keep the hand under his and the cover this the chadr and is taking the name of god the constantly they go on doing like that this is the way we have to practice thank you friends so the next month again we will analyze this and let me see if there is any question we'll try to give the answer lots of questions uh diversity is asking the first question if a person in this birth believes in god and prays to god on a daily basis is it something because of his good karma in the past of course of course of course they were sheish so this is because of the good karma of the past otherwise that thought will never cross in the mind you know they're two brothers one is thinking about the god and helping others all these good things other brother no so why because of the past karma your two sons suppose that they are getting the same schooling same growing up but one will think in one way another will why because of the past karma and you are correct the name of god that is coming because of the good work that we have already done in our previous birth so from this life again we have to try to reach to the ultimate goal thank you arubdas is asking the next question is ego increasing through ages ah no not like that the ego is increasing because i like to utilize that the around people are there they are going on telling something so i feel i should also behave like that but if you are listening to the great soul and analyzing i have the self-confidence i can do all those things but it is not necessary that i have to go on bragging about that so by that way you can reduce and bhagavan's ramakrishna he gave the wonderful uh another suggestions to uh develop i mean to get ego free he said i am the son of god the ego is there but by telling that i am the son of god i can do it that is not the ego you are associating with the surama krishna or the god by that way also you can control but it is not that growing with the ages of course a child's ego and the grown-up man's ego are different but not like that the old age also it will go grow more not like that so thank you the next question is in indian scriptures many sages say that brahman cannot be realized by logic in bracket turkey why only only logic you know that because it's a brahman nahi tarkena and is also it is there and the cut open it says that means you have to prepare your heart you have to otherwise everything you are doubting you are questioning you are not accepting you are so by that way you are reaching nowhere so that's why they said the means you have to you know that again they have analyzed what is bittarka and all that so slowly slowly you have to understand that sometimes some people will come they will ask some question when i am going to give the answer in the midway they will ask another question let me complete this you have asked this question so we have to understand that otherwise why this question the similarly the taka if you just for the sake of the debate if you do that that is not you are going to reach to the goal then tarka will help you the analysis will help you the doubts will help you questioning will help you but you have a goal to reach and when you get the answer you must have to accept that too thank you kalyan is asking the next question are the philosophies of bhakti and gyana opposite to each other now bhakti ghana are not opposite to each other they they are actually helping each other they are not opposite at all the gyana means the knowledge about god what is that the god must be there otherwise who has created this where from the etc all this questioning is the gyana and then you are utilizing your devotion your love your affection your services for the realization that is the path of bhakti so gyana and bhakti goes hand in hand it is not different thank you amit is asking the next question i am confused is bhakti mentioned anywhere in the veda or upanishad or it came much later due to puranas the bhakti that way yes you can say uponishas they are not giving you any any way they are they are only they say this is the truth that's all how you will reach over there they don't bother about that next you have to develop now they say sana these are coming then that is the reason the philosophy developed the to explain those things the brahma-sutra first is the opponent then the brahma-sutra all those upanishadic dictums the brahma-sutra brought in one place and analyzed over that the acharyas they explained so obviously different type of the paths that came afterwards of course the upanishads they only give the truth brahma brahma uh like that they go on and they talk about some of the stories and but the truth they give but if you have to follow the philosophy of course afterwards they develop that so rupees asking the next question what is more important renunciation or self-surrender you see they are the same if you can there's give them a self you surrender yourself then no question unless and until you are convinced that there is god there is the supreme being to whom you are going to surrender yourself obviously so when you are sure that there is god and all these things around me the worldly objects they are not true they cannot give me the true joy how can you self surrender yourself to god so both are same amit is asking you second question swamiji people say that the vedas does not allow the worship of idol or deities is it true no no no no again some people they are explaining in that way you know problem is not the teaching of the veda problem is the analysis of the veda it is nothing like that of course god is there in the beginning they used to worship only in the veda they used to only worship and the slowly slowly the philosophy the brahman it is a much later development so if you read that history slowly find in the beginning there is to wonder where from this is happening a gusty wind uprooting the tree and carrying it must be the god so bayou devata the sun scorching sun surya devata then the rain and the thunder indra devata it's all in the rigveda then they started questioning who is the main god of so many gods you are talking about who is the main the same people their younger generation they are asking question so they again they started then much afterwards they analyzed the whole thing and then came in conclusion hinduism is a step-by-step development that's why it is no founder it's just analyzing understanding again on the basis of that they are again proceeding like this only the new turn he discovered something and the present-day scientist based on that they're advancing much much so the same way the first generation they did in some way the first days to worship and then slowly came the philosophy then again so many varieties of paths according to the aptitudes of the people but the goal is the same thank you asking again in bhakti philosophy we can say that god created everything but in ghana philosophy the theory of and non-creation has been postulated so isn't both concepts contradictory see the gyana not only ajata bada ajayatuba one concept the gyana if you study the our shankaracharya to what he is telling the gyana is also saying that there is a creation and the creation is a shankar philosopher this is also knowledge but they say the purusa and prakriti the purusa is all knowledge it came close to the prakriti which is the power and immediately things started happening and in the vedanta they said that maybe one day as if that supreme being which is all one all consciousness he thought he i am one i like to be many and the creation came ajatabad only one part of that he said actually it has not been created that is true but if you say that then you need to understand anything else if you can understand that it is true that nothing in reality is there nothing in reality you have to reach to that height only otherwise if you deny all this and go for that instead of without attaining the primary level of the education if you go to the university what will happen so if you can understand ajatova nothing like that that is wonderful follow that or otherwise come a step or two and then you say no this is also possible thank you vishwaroop is asking a two two part question uh he's saying there is diversity in ashtavakra samhita bible chudamani and narada which speaks which speech relates to unity part one part two please repeat the story of shankaracharya about a speechless 14 year old boy and the moral behind it so this is already late we won't be able to repeat this this question so the different scripture they speak about the same truth in different way there is no differences so try to understand that in the different way only the expressions but the truth that they are propounding that is the same thank you very much the last question is sumit is asking can you please help me understand samarpana samarpana means giving up you have to surrender yourself that's called samarpan now now if you go to the god and say god i am yours but to me this is very very difficult why because in the ego is there so obviously i am yours we can say but somebody said something immediately that pinches my mind somebody praises immediately i get the happiness but i am not supposed to because i have already submitted the whole thing at the feet of god i have no right to become sorry i have no right to become joy and so how i i will be there only god and god that is called samarpana but that is a beautiful the condition of mind you know ultimate and one if one can do that then final that's why bhagavan si ramakrishna said be like the kitten the kitten it doesn't do anything it's completely depending on its mother wherever the mother will take that is called samarpana thank you thank you very much thank you friends wonderful questions and i am so happy that you are listening very carefully noting down and asking question that i really am very very happy and thankful to you all let us say shanti three times and we conclude oh foreign
