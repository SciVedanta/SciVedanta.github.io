[Who Am I?" according to Mandukya Upanishad-Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F0dugc4TrlE)

I will learn all of em once again in the attempt to discover ourselves our true nature we become in the summit II has been organizing different events and this particular program of the electricity's and workshop on vedanta - family selfie analogy has been absolutely absorbing for the last two days and we have all learnt various aspects of concentration how to develop the concentration yesterday we went to how to what is the basic identity based on the Mundaka Upanishad we continue on the same thoughts same ideas in the morning here seen how to manage our day-to-day stress using the techniques of Jana Vedanta basically and the yoga nidra as you have seen this video we become of the sanity has been organizing different events in the areas of self development and social awakening with this objective year organized several talks seminars workshops on skin development leadership time management stress management from time to time we have cell phone ringing hours discussions on Indian scientific heritage and its knowledge systems we also do community service activities like icons and cams contribution drives distribution of food articles we request all of you to please come forward support us activities join us in our team and help us propagate the message of Vedanta and samehada today as we already mentioned so from continuing from where we had left yesterday we again d-doesn't recapitulate some of the aspects I and can be really established ourselves in this our true nature with this I did night to last good evening and Namaskar back yet again for the concluding lecture on a portion of the mandu key open assured the subject is who am i I was warned by some of the students that the audience might be very negligible because there is apparently a cricket match which is very attractive but surprise we have a fairly large number here and you are to be congratulated for turning up or something like Mundaka Upanishad mandu cake Erica choosing it over the cricket match and other methods of relaxation on this Sunday evening I'll just quickly recapitulate what we have done the position where we are in at present before we go ahead these are what's in your hand are the Caritas the verses written by go deposit Arya explaining the seventh mantra yes yesterday we studied the seventh mantra and these are the caracals explaining the seventh mantra which we will study today with the name of deeper understanding of the seventh mantra a deeper appreciation of the answer to the question Who am I remember okay one one point here just like yesterday there are a number of typos here actually not typos certain Mark's have not come on the paper especially the bindi and the wizard guy does not come I will tell you when we come to the carica how to correct it some spelling mistakes are there okay where were we the question we are facing is Who am I and the smallest of the opposition's and maybe the most powerful of the Upanishads the Mundaka Upanishad they say that man do kamehameha alum moo moo shu nama Mukti for the liberation of those who want liberation moksha for them man Duke itself is sufficient and the seventh mantra which we studied yesterday is the core is the heart of the Mondeo condition what did it tell us it said look at our lives throughout our day we passed through three states now we are awake later at night we will dream and maybe have deep sleep also so one one one of our states is I am the Waker and the next one is the dreamer and then deep sleep let's call in the sleeper these are not three separate persons it is one and the same person we you or I we all go through these three identities and we will call this the knower what does this person know the known unknowable are they known or the knowable it is the waking world making world means not that the world is awake it means the world we experience when we are awake then there is the dream world the dreamer experiences the dream world and the sleeper experiences deep sleep we can call it the sleep blankness so this is the known this is the knower and the known what we experience in the waking reading dream and in deep sleep and what is the stage called this is the waking stage dream state stage or state better to call it the state breaking state dream state and asleep deep sleep and what we learned was by an analysis of these experiences all of us have these experiences nothing very spiritual about it it's our day-to-day experience the open assured says take a look at these experiences the Waker and the dreamer are different dreamer and the sleeper are different they're different from each other because what happens to the Waker is not remembered in dream what happens to the dreamer is falsified when you wake up and to sleeper is somebody else I mean it's there they are exclusive just as a bangle is not a necklace a necklace is not a ring they are separate from each other as bangle necklace and ring so apart from this there is a reality how do you know there is a reality apart from it because though they are exclusive they are separate separate we all say I am the Waker I who was awake I who was dreaming I was in deep sleep and I am awake again so I claim all these states for myself who is that I who is that I common to all these three yet they are being different from each other there is something common running through all of them and that is pure consciousness and that is what we realized as the turian the fourth the to diem or Turia the fourth one there is something apart from the Baker the dreamer in the sleeper which is our true nature the pure consciousness and that is that does not exist apart from them that actually exists in then through them just as gold there is not found apart from the ornaments but it is the very nature of the ornaments in the same way it is the pure consciousness which appears as the Waker is a pure consciousness which appears as the dreamer it is the pure consciousness which appears as the sleeper just like a gentleman who who is who opens his shop and conducts business during daytime so is the businessman and the same man shuts down the shop and go to his room and watches TV relaxes in the evening and then goes to his bedroom and goes to sleep now the man is the same but in one case in the in the shop he's dealing with the external world buying and selling and you can call him the shopkeeper the one who has transactions with the world in the second state the same person he has no contact with anybody else but he watches a movie on the TV and after that he goes to the bedroom and goes to sleep three rooms three types of activities three names and we can call him the shopkeeper the relaxer and a sleeper and three three rooms are there three types of activities are there and three names are there but the person is one and the same it's the same person in the same way it is the same consciousness dealing with the external world like a shopkeeper buying and selling with the external world with a body and mind is the called awake err and when he goes to sleep imagines a mental world world created from his own samskaras in the mind and we call that same theory of the dreamer and then nothing blankness in deep sleep we call the same theory of the sleeper and again he comes back again in this form now what God apart Acharya will do he will explore this concept further and make it clear to us and son terms are introduced this terms you must learn to understand these carry cos the terms are to be understood waker he gives the name vishwa waker is given the name Vishwa who is Vishwa who is this strange person nobody you right now all of us what we are right now God upon Acharya calls Vishwa then the dreamer rod Apothecary gives the name is a Kannada technical names are given with shortages so these are from the open nature itself we have not gone through the mantras the earlier mantras were there in that the names have been given by the opposition one who is dreaming is called ty Jessa and there is a reason why such names are given we will not go into that when you are dreaming you yourself your name becomes tiresome when you are in deep sleep the name given is Praga Praga who are these strange people you you are wish for now when you dream you the same person you are called digestor when you are in deep sleep knowing nothing blankness you are called bronchial so who am i in waking state I am wish in dream I am Thai Jessa in deep sleep I the same person I am bragging and these are the things which we experience throughout the day what the opener tells you is you are none of them you are actually in reality in yourself you are toriel toriel literally means the fourth number four not one not two not three but the fourth it is the Turia alone who appears as we schwa it is the Tauri alone who appears as a gesture which is the Tauri alone who appears as bragging okay these are the certain terms we must learn and then the state itself is called our stop I was the state and the waking state is called geography in Hindi also we call it Jagran the dream state is called swap Konoha and deep sleep is called sushupti so ship T these are the names given their standard names in vedanta in sanskrit also waking is called geography dream is called Sapna and deep sleep is called sushupti and what do you see there the known object what you see in the geography is called jaagruth preppin cha this world in dream you see Sapna proppant job created by the mind and in deep sleep you don't call it soup tea prop ensure there is no per punch are there but the blankness it's a potential state these are the terms we need to know now we can go ahead what he will tell us in these verses let me sum up very quickly then it'll make more sense a fundamental idea of Advaita Vedanta see ignorant causes error there is a rope in the darkness a standard example you have do it away run the stock example a rope in semi-darkness I don't know it is there I see something and the next moment it may not be a rope it might be a computer cable and the next moment I think it's a snake the Sanskrit term is Raju Raju means rope and the term for snake is Serpa so reduce the reality which I do not know not knowing that reality I suddenly mistake it for a snake and I say there is a surah Mohammed is delusion mistake what caused me to see the snake there is no snake but for a moment I actually saw a snake you know a mistake it's a mistake what caused it it is an ignorance of ignorance of the rope the reality I am ignorant of the reality I don't know what it is therefore I mistake it to be a snake maybe because of my samskaras somebody might mistake it to be a Garland thrown away somebody might mistake it to be your crack on the earth in Sanskrit they say Serpa who should draw ma la reserva culpa these are the culpa the various types of mistakes we might make but the truth is that it is a snake and it is a rope and my ignorance of the Rope caused me to see it as a snake so ignorant of the reality causes me to make a mistake about the reality this is a fundamental concept just as I am ignorant of the rope and I see a snake similarly the claim is you are ignorant about to do and what do you see right now you are seeing with sure you are experiencing yourself as Vishwa Who am I Moop Anisha tells you that your Turia but what do you feel what do I feel I feel I am this person limited by body and mind this is what I am this is called visual why do I think I am visual because the open Isha tells you you do not know your true nature because you did not know the Rope you saw mistook it for a snake because you do not know yourself realize yourself asturias pure consciousness you think of yourself as a body and mind this is the basic idea now see how he uses this when we have awake we are seeing this world which is actually too real the world is also Turia I am also Turia but I am seeing it as a limited knower called Vishwa and I see the world as a geographer puncher so I have an have an ignorance here about my true nature and I'm making a mistake by seeing this Turia itself as Vishwa and as geography okay now let me go through this first second is a third prong and the fourth the reality itself is to do what happens in which you are in the waking state right now according to the Upanishad is we are ignorant of our true nature and we think we are this body and mind is Vishwa and we see this as a world distinct from ourselves so we are making we have an ignorance about our true nature and we are making a mistake what is actually one undivided reality called to reom or Brahman or whatever you call it we see it as a multi Farias divided world what is actually a do item we see it as a waiter world I am separate from you these are separate discreet independent entities that's what we experience the world us but this is not true the truth is that it is one undivided reality which you are so in this waking state my point is we have ignorance as well as error according to the initial we are ignorant about true reality and we make an error what is the error I am this body and mind these are all separate from me I am the Vishwa this is my jag recover stop this is there which means let us make a table here the Wis chew up the Waker right now do we have ignorance according to the position yes I don't know my ignorance about what you would say I have lots of ignorance about about my maths and about my physics and about my mechanical or engineering drawing not that kind of ignorance I mean ignorance about our true nature Who am I that question I don't know that I don't know the correct answer to it because I do not know that I make a mistake what mistake do I make that I am this body and mind so do we have an error in the waking state yes so Vishwa has both ignorant and error what about tides are in dream in dream just consider our dreams what dreams you have do you ever feel I am pure consciousness in dream we don't feel that we just have another like a like this waking world we have another world we are constructing in the mind so in dream also we do not know that we are pure consciousness we are ignorant of torria in dream we have ignorance do we have error in dream yes we have error because we are seeing a different world which is apart from us we are seeing a dream body only after waking up we think it's a dream but there it seems to be pretty real Aradia very interesting what do we have there I am a sleep and is a blankness I don't even know that I'm asleep I don't know anything I don't know myself I do not know the world also nothing just blank face now in Prague where do I have ignorant yes we have ignores because I do not know gap I don't know myself Who am I remember ignorant about what I do not know myself so in prandium we have ignorance do we have error no very good we don't have error in Pragya we do not have error in deep sleep the error of data that there is a separate existence apart from me that error is not there the knowledge of our do it is also not there but the error of data is not there no error is there in deep sleep but ignorance is there I do not know anything let alone I do not know who I am I do not know in the world also so there is no wrong knowledge but there is no knowledge correct knowledge also there is nothing blankness in deep sleep and they say God about the Acharya will mention in Korea there is neither ignorance that's neither ignorance nor energy when we realize ourselves as Turia then there is no ignorance anymore I know that I am pure consciousness and there will be no error anymore when I see this world waking state will come again I will see everything but I know that it's not different from me I am pure consciousness what I am appears in front of me I am one with all of you I am one with everything that I experience that knowledge will be there that is why great Saints and all you know they have an instinctive identity with people and they sympathize with people they feel that sense of oneness with everybody with everybody in Gita again and again you will come to this this term some other Shoshanna they have you know Mithra and rapoo friend and enemy they have some other tional towards all of them deep inside they know I am alone appearing in these forms towards wealth and poverty they have some other Shoshanna sri ramakrishna stories that taka mati he's throwing marty that means soil into the young guy and also money some other stone in what sense right the one reality alone is appearing as marty and as taka not that everything will disappear it will continue to appear the way it is appealing to you or to me for the Gani also same thing appears and but he knows the underlying reality so in the for the for Turia there is no ignorance about Who am I and there is no error also there is no error he knows that I am all of it when one realizes the to diem alright one more thing ok some more terms let me bring before you then we will go on to the vs and we will be able to understand very clearly there are certain terms which God apothecary uses for ignorant and error the terms he uses I will just write it out for you ignorance he calls it agraharam acronym Granum literally means grasping here it means grasping in the sense of understanding so ignorant is agraharam not grasping not understanding in in class also when your professor teaches he leaves once in a while he says have you grasped it it's Granum is there or not our honda means it not trusted so ignorant is a Granum about what about my true nature Who am I and error he calls a near homonym an unneutered Rehana means not only has he not grasped who am i he has grasped something wrong he has not only understood the true nature of the Earthmen is not understood but also he makes a mistake about it from ignorance comes error so what what does he grasp he says I am this body and mind if you ask him who are you I am this person it is only acronym an EHR means otherwise so this wise and otherwise yes otherwise grah grah hanim he has understood something wrongly so in the class some students may not understand at all I don't get what he's saying and some students may say I get it but when you ask them is got it completely wrong so this onion avocado that's an error and that comes from agra hanim from ignorance another term go departure you will use is carnem Guardium car IAM karana means cause Guardium means effect cause effect ignorance is the cause and error is the effect I don't know the rope that is the cause cause of what seeing a snake how do you know it is the cause the moment you know the rope that it is a rope immediately what happens the effect also goes away you no longer say it's a snake you see it's this rope okay so carnem is ignorance ignorance is carnem and error will be karyam another thing another term he uses go to Pondicherry will see is be jump you can understand vision means seed so ignorant is the seed and what is the effect the sprout the plant he does not use the word ancora we can just add it he means this uncle means a sprout seedling so what comes from ignorance the seedling of error what comes from are not knowing the pure consciousness the seedling which is some sarees not even seedling it's a huge whatever rickshaw is samsara we have got huge banyan tree so many problems thousand and one problems all of you just come from the small seed ignorance ignorance of what I don't know this and don't know who am i okay and the fourth term he uses is quite shocking he says neat dra and error he calls Swapna Indra means sleep and Swapna means dream karappa Dodgers is not knowing the true nature is sleep you are asleep and the error you make that I am this body and mind and is limited individual these are my friends these are my enemies this is my goal in life this is my failure happiness sadness I have to do this I cannot I have not done this all this is enormous samsara net which we have got in front of us that error he calls it a dream remember the interesting thing is in that case both our waking and our dream both of them got a pod Acharya would call a dream our dreaming is error and that corapi watch area calls a dream our waking is also error because we don't know the true nature in that case what about that sure he also says that one is also a dream in fact this is a source you know wave anointings supposed to say that your life is like a dream Sapna what it comes from this daughter pod Acharya says both your dream is it's also a dream and the waking which you have got that's also a dream that's also a dream there's a beautiful story about the Buddha after getting his realization he was walking towards Raja clear I think and for the very give the first sermon I think sadhna towards are nothing and their story is a shepherd boy saw him and he was so amazed by the appearance of the Buddha he asked him what are you Houston Smith in his introduction to Buddhism he writes many people have been asked who are you very few in the history of mankind have been asked what are you what are you are you a David our God but I said no are you an angel a Dave Ahdoot or something like that Buddha says no are you a human being but this is know then what are you but this is and with the awakened I am Buddha the awakened meaning thereby we are not awake we are in the sleep of ignorance making the dream of error we are in the sleep of ignorance we do not know who we are and we are dreaming all sorts of dreams that we are this individual bodies and minds we are born we are happy we are sad we are struggling and will soon die and it's all over all the time we are the consciousness illumise this entire drama which is going on in front of this consciousness so this is these are the terms God apothecary uses acronym and yatra Haram not knowing knowing knowing wrongly carnem because ignorance karyam the effect error Beecham recede ignorant ankara he does not say we are riding nidra sleep of ignorance Sapna the dream of error and now we will go into the car Iike and then you can see we can easily follow with this background number 10 these are the carica is written by guru Pathik Arya explaining the seventh month of the Upanishad Mundaka Upanishad expanding on that mantra clarifying the meanings first number 10 I'll read it out and I'll tell you the meaning in in brief never a tazer rubadoux carnem jana prabhu Rabia adwaita Serova bob davis story yogi boo spirit AHA there you know sir Bob hominem that dot you should add it's missing there never eat a server do kaanum Jana so there are some research grant dot which is missing there what does it mean he says Turia Turia you see the word Toria he called studia this to do Jana Jana means Lord Pergamon what we normally call burger one he says you are Bhagawan you are each are you are God in fact this is the meaning of the muhabba kiss that Thomas see you are that this is God God in what sense Jana literally means the powerful powerful in what sense never eat a service O'Connor he is beyond all the curse he means you in your true nature you are beyond all suffering when right now right now you are beyond all suffering in what sense suffering belongs to the body or to the mind suffering belongs to the in the physical world suffering belongs to your nightmares and dreams in the dream world and potentially it's all hidden in the deep sleep it's not you cannot experience it but it's there again when you wake up the suffering will come but this Turia is beyond all that untouched by the suffering of the waking state the dream state and the potential in the sleep state untouched in what sense it is there it will come the pain in the body also will come to us and to the journey also the difference is we think it is I am in pain I am suffering but cursed have the Gani feels I am the Sakshi of this pain the pain is there in the body mind also cognizes it is pain and I am researching I am not affected by the way he's not using willpower there I am no pain I have no pain pinched him and then ouch not like that he knows I have no pain it's just like the light falling on this you know if the same sunlight falls on the ditch falls on the Ganga falls on the Himalayas it is not polluted by the ditch it is not purified by the Ganga also it illumines your consciousness you illumine the suffering of the waking world you will you mean the nightmare of the dream world you will you mean the blankness of the deep sleep you know some people say deep sleep there is no consciousness why are you saying the consciousness is illumining the blankness I will tell you an interesting story in Institute of culture ramakrishna mission instead of culture goal park in kolkata about 10 years back there was a conference on consciousness studies so there was this neuroscientist philosophers finally in one session a philosopher Indian philosopher he asked a neuroscientist who had come from UK he said doctor according to neuroscience in sleep or our you know in in deep sleep for example in this deep sleep is there consciousness or not and the neuroscientist said no in deep sleep there is no consciousness according to our definition of consciousness there is no consciousness in deep sleep and this philosopher replied this is the difference between Indian philosophy and modern neuroscience because according to Indian philosophy in deep sleep there is only consciousness in neuroscience there is no consciousness in deep sleep in from the point of view of Advaita Vedanta there is only consciousness in deep sleep what does it mean it means this imagine there's a vehicle it's a very good example climbing a hill a car and there are the headlights of the car with beams and in the headlight of the car in the dark you can see insects flying past if you have ever had that experience you'll know raindrops are falling you can see in the headlight of the car and you can see the beams of the car headlight as you come to the peak of the hill there's nothing in front the lights shine out suppose the sky is very clear moon moon moon last night sky is very clear the lights shine out to infinity there is nothing because atmosphere is clear the beams will not be defined I mean you will not be able to see the beams of light nothing comes in front also because just empty space ahead it will seem as if the light beams are not there because there's nothing to reflect the light but the light is there or not of course it's there the powerful headlights are on the beams are shining out to infinity but there is nothing in front to reflect it so the light is there nothing to reflect the light so you do not see the light itself in deep sleep what happens is Turia is there pure consciousness is there but there is no sort no body nothing is there which is illumined by that pure consciousness physical things are not their hearts and feelings and emotions are not there nothing is there in in deep sleep therefore the pure consciousness does not reflect anything you have no experience anubhava comes when there is a thing which is illumined by consciousness then Anubhava comes in deep sleep it is not there yeah they're not yeah yeah yeah yeah I'll come to that absolutely they don't speculate now there's a very interesting thing I'll come to that the scientist takes the reductionist approach say that consciousness is generated by the brain under certain circumstances and we have the experience of consciousness and they studied objectively so he will say there is no consciousness because first of all the patient or the person does not report any consciousness nor do we see the brain activities normally linked with consciousness if you do fMRI you will not see that therefore we say there's no consciousness that's the objective view of the scientist now what they are saying is you take a subjective view what is subjective you take a look at your own experience if you say that there is a brain generating consciousness what these are dwellings will say that all that is also within consciousness that you are seeing a brain and you are making an fMRI study and that is giving certain patterns which you say is linked to consciousness all that is illumined by your own consciousness they're saying that and not only that it's not that they do not establish this they say it has to be self established by you they are showing you a technique what we are doing is the waking dream and deep sleep States are non-controversial they're just repeating that term is a Nevada they repeat what is our day-to-day experience they are repeating it to you now one stepford that they go he say they say see these features of these three states from this something comes out interesting the waker dreamer and a deep sleep they are exclusive in a certain way because the experiences are unique to each the makers experiences are forgotten in the dreams dream state because there nobody who dreams will at that time will not think that i am sleeping under a mosquito net there otherwise they cannot dream do you forget the waking state so they have an individual experience apart from the waking state and then really a deep sleep they have an experience of blank which objectively might be interpreted as no consciousness but consider this as a fact when we wake up again what do we say I the Waker I was the one who was dreaming I was the one who was sleeping now how do you know that you just we assumed it we never said there was somebody else who asleep that there was somebody else who was dreaming and they were I was not there during sleeping we don't really never say that it would have been logical to say if I am the conscious product of my brain it would have actually been more logical to say right now I am there now my consciousness shuts down when I am in deep sleep so I was not there during deep sleep but we that also seem sort of strange to us we normally don't accept that we say that I was there during deep sleep how I was there I cannot explain now they say that it is this pure consciousness which is shining through the body and mind in the waking state through the mind in the dream state and the blank no experience of body and mind in the deep sleep state now this has to be thought about I'm just presenting it I'm not saying this is conclusive because that's why they say it cannot be established by argument by argument you can only present the possibility you cannot it's not a mathematical proof when you have to come to this a mathematical proof demands your acknowledgement right if you are following reason you cannot say it may be this but this is more like a court you know lawyers argue and try to convince the jury that this is possible so the you can take it in this way a possibility a possibility okay now near it they serve adieu carnem jana prabhu obviou of the I am changing the Waker dreamer and sleeper come and go this is unchanging you remember the example of the station master trains are coming and going stationmaster watches similarly you watch the coming and departing of these states Advaita serve Abraha a very important sarvabhauma Nam literally means all existing things Advaita you the consciousness you are non dual with respect to these things non dual means they do not exist apart from you advaitha not data there is no second independent reality apart from this pure consciousness that alone appears as the knower and the known in these states so Advaita serve of homonym you datoria you alone are appearing as all these bodies and minds and you are identified with one particular mind this like we do in a dream this is the claim next in eleven to fourteen to 2:15 eleven to fifteen what God upon Acharya will do he will compare and contrast Vishwa digesta pradya and Turia to establish to show you that it is possible that you have your independent of these states there is something within you which is independent of these states he will compare and contrast now using these terms so get ready keep these in mind you will easily understand what he does eleven Gardea karana but dodo a she ate a wish for the aegis Oh Raja karana but does to rotatory anus it deity dodo story anus idiot ah what does it mean Vishwanatha are associated with Korea and karana you see Korea carnival dodo which joint adjusted the Waker and the dreamer are associated with Karen and Karen Karen um ignorance Korea error Vishwa has ignorance does not know that he is Atma this Toria and he has an error he thinks that the I am the body and mind experiencing this so there is error here and there is ignorance also that is the cause cause and effect are both there for the wish world even in the dream state Karia karana the error is there and ignorance is there do you follow this what we call error and ignorance ignorance is carnem cause and its effect is error that is there in the waking state and in the dream state Praga Karen about gusto do you remember that table which we made the deep sleep the pradya the one who is the deep sleeper he is associated with ignorance only there is no error it just like if a rope is in complete darkness you don't see the Rope if you don't see the Rope you will not mistake it to be a snake also it's only when you partially see the Rope you will make an error about it and say it's a snake similarly the deep sleep in deep sleep there is ignorance does not know that I am Atma but or I am Turia but there is no error he does not think that I am body and mind going through so many troubles in deep sleep there is no Duke Earl so very interesting in deep sleep there's no Duke Earl so there's some interesting characteristics of deep sleep the worst patient who's suffering the great pain which may be which may be cancer or something about to die when that patient in the ICU is in deep sleep does not have any problem at all from his point of view of course my body is dying but from his experience phenomenologically speaking he does not experience anything and none of the Duke also that's one interesting characteristic the second characteristic is my experience and your experience just now are different you are experiencing in one way I am experiencing another way in our dreams also your dreams are different my dreams are different but your deep sleep and my deep sleep are exactly the same not only that definition says if there is a deep sleep of a mosquito a lion a tiger and a human being a PhD and an illiterate person all of them they are the exactly the same type of deep sleep the nature of deep sleep is same for all because it's ignorant its complete darkness there is no speciality no differentiation there yeah we don't explain Cynthia the blankness but they are saying you know that's very interesting the common we have thinking we have we don't experience anything but they are saying do you not experience the lack of experience otherwise you know what is the common experience when we have after we get up I slept like a log of wood I did not know anything so come a swap sama knocking tear away addition I did not know anything now you would not say that the correct feeling would be I was dreaming now I am awake I feel fresh in between I did not know anything what does this statement mean and there are many arguments on this some say that you infer it after you see the clock okay six hours have passed so I must have slept deeply but it's not an inference it is a direct experience that is what they are pointing to it is a very subtle thing but what these other things are telling you you please consider that try to see it from their point of view you will at least see something mysterious happening there an experienced illumination of a blank fist is to question just I will come back to this one gentleman there yes we don't know but remember here we are not even a condiment talking about those things that is at an objective level you see a physical body and a brain going through so many changes and you ask what the patient is reporting and try to come to a conclusion here there is a subjective approach what are you experiencing and they are saying if you experience anything as a separate reality it is Error and that is because of you do not know yourself Astoria that is all they are saying what about near-death experiences what about coma those things are to be worked out no problem what they would say is near-death experience or coma those are all illumined by thorium you are the consciousness their only thing is here you don't think in deep sleep there is no thought that I am sleeping throught again starts when you wake up okay No Deal exactly there is no realization also in a way he will say that there is no realization in the in deep sleep also it is complete ignorance it says here froggy occur on about the stool the deep sleeper is associated with ignorance no realization absolutely no realization yes yeah okay I'll tell you one thing what does n techniques all of them they try to do in all the schools they try for an Enlightenment called Satori they call it Satori they try to short-circuit thinking stop the rational mind and they expect an Enlightenment will burst forth what what Advaita Vedanta does is don't stop thinking you are in the waking state now hopefully in this waking state you reflect upon do which are upon reason upon your experiences of dream and reason upon your experiences of deep sleep waking dream and deep sleep just now in the waking State think about it what has happened to realize this you don't have to go into deep sleep in fact you should not go into deep sleep otherwise you cannot realize they say realization is possible only in the waking State through which our Advaita Vedanta says this what is then closer to that would be Patanjali yoga where they try to attain Samadhi by suppressing the modifications of the mind but advaitha Vedanta says they do not agree they say without any thought if you want to exist deep sleep is exactly without any thought that has not led to any realization so far daily we are going into deep sleep then today we have not realized that we are tore iam so just going into thoughtless state will not help but here it will by which our it will help let me give you one more example that will clarify the difference between the two I've given this example some other time some very senior monk used to give this example a child in a village who has not seen a movie cinema and nowadays of course you will not find such a child you will not find such a child who has not seen a cinema but suppose there is and the father takes him to a city to show him a movie and on the way the father tells the child bata you know what is the movie there will be a screen which was there just now and they'll be light projected on the screen and you can see so many pictures on the screen per day per watch OBD kg of coke and that is the movie the child says ok then they go into the cinema hall now imagine he the interesting thing when they entered the cinema hall the movie has already started so when the child first sees he already sees pictures so he first sometime he enjoys the movie like all of us do and then he asks a question to the father Papa is screen consign screen calf never Tata you had said the daily there's a screen on which the pictures are there he asks this question spiritual question we enjoy the world after some time after a lot of enjoyment and experience in the world we come to Manduca class so it's basically asking the same question where is the screen you talked about a screen and the father says in front of you something there is a screen in front of you and the boy sees maybe some Kurukshetra war is being shown Mahabharat saw something and see some day so that krishna arjuna that is the screen nenene behind them was kpj behind Krishna and Arjuna behind Krishna and Arjuna was a rough head the chariot that is the screen lanius kV PJ escape eto Kurukshetra you dictator a war screen a semi PJ taka say which they repeated a car CPC mclubbe kuznia Rakuten na is subconscious scream o Krishna Arjuna rat Akash Kurukshetra dude is sub could screen any new subcultures of nickel kato rahaga was cleaner sub court I think because we need I got a screen could be near this is the problem of the father what will he point out to as a screen because wherever he points there will be a picture there will be a picture I say this is to DM you will say or this guy's to reham know the background history him now there is only one way one way the child will understand is when the movie stops for the interval the pictured stop the lights come on remember when the picture stops the lights are off darkness so neither the screen is seen no pictures have seen their Hall is also nothing is seen that is sushupti deep sleep when the lights come on he sees the screen he understands he understands that is Samadhi where you stop the pictures completely and you get an intuitive realization this is what the reality is but what Vedanta tells you is you don't have to stop the movie stopping the movie takes a lot of effort you don't have to stop the movie isn't it possible here when I show you the screen and the pictures isn't it possible to get an appreciation of what the screen is in spite of the pictures remember the little boy when the movie starts again he will never ask the question what is the screen although the pictures are there he knows very well what is the screen now the screen is completely covered with pictures but the boy understands what is the screen similarly in Advaita Vedanta what happens is in this waking state when we think ourselves as which two eyes this body and mind by vichara we try to understand and appreciate what is the background reality what is the screen here if you can get it right here then you don't need Samadhi but Samadhi is very powerful salam krishna stays in one place ramadi now holy tick tick Hina unless you have that experience you will never get a firm conviction about it so what you realize by this may be may strengthened by Samadhi but the realization is possible here in this waking state through this process that what are the way the Vedanta claims by reasoning alone you can at least learn to appreciate that there is a background consciousness which you are that's the point let me go and finish let me finish these other karakasa now we come to what exactly what you are saying there is no realization here number 12 not Manappuram Jeeva NASA team na pitch on rhythm Raja in China some BT to reattach sir Roderick Saddam the program the deep sleeper does not know itself as Atma or as the pranky also it does not know the world also it does not know the truth that I am Torian it does not know the false unwritten the false world which is appearing that also francium does not know knock ingenuity it does not know anything that is the state of the deep sleeper and how is tree are different from it Toria touch server Rick Saddam it always illumines everything it is self illumina bout itself and about the world it is like the movie where the movie hall where the lights have come on it knows okay 10:13 do a test shot grana to acronym to Liam O'Brien - yo yo B John it ryuuta spraga Sartori llena be deity the 13th one tells you basically do item a separate reality error separate reality is not seen by the pranky and by two dolls the Praga does not see anything Nothe something separate from itself does not see just as we see in the waking state in deep sleep we do not see anything dorium also does not see anything separate from itself but the prague de prague gia is associated with nidra with this one ignorance blankness whereas Turia does not have that language is the difference between Prague and Turia rakia also does not see the waiter Torre also does not see the waiter but Prague guy is covered in darkness where the Turia illumines everything it sees everything as itself swapna neat dra youto audio prog just broadcast pragya to a swapna para guest to Swapna need drea a Swapna drea no need

the false snake you see the snake a rope is seen as a snake mistaken as a snake how do you remove that snake clap driver waste it chase it with a stick it will not go it will go only when you see the rope as a rope you see the snake that it is actually a rope when you see the totem realize that optimum the error also goes away so what you have to do is remove the ignorance how will the ignorant be removed my knowledge ignorance is removed by knowledge when ignorance goes Ripper is a toy auction a when the ignorance in these two states is reduced is removed how it is removed by knowledge then what happens you realize yourself Astoria man what about the error when the ignorance goes error will also go when you realize the rope as rope the snake will automatically go away actually there is no snake which will go away it's just an error then number 16 question always arises there how did this ignorant start after you talked about advaitha in any class anywhere somebody will ask the question okay we are in ignorance but how did it start so here is it look at the answer go to father sure he knows that 1200 years ago his return this car Iike a now the Maya suebdo yada Jeeva Prabhu Tati Adam on it from a swap tanam Adam but dirty tada so there was a datum it should be this Jeeva we the individual who and I'm thinking of myself as wish you are the Waker one in ignorance an are the miii a septa asleep in ignorance due to Maya since when on are the beginningless beginningless when did it start no did not start beginningless and that's illogical how can ignorant be beginningless but actually it's not illogical in fact all ignorance is beginningless let me ask you if i ask you sir do you know German no you're ignorant about German yes since when are you ignorant about German since my but also before your but you knew German no your ignorance about German is another beginningless but it has an end when does it end when you take up a book on German and start learning German a little bit of German you know to that extent your ignorance about German goes away so ignorant is actually an RD beginningless but it can end when knowledge comes it ends he says an RD Maia a Supra you cannot say when since when we are in ignorance yada Jeeva Prabhu deity when the Jeeva awakens you look at the words Buddha from that Buddha has come when the Jeeva awakens then what does he realize the next word is so wonderful he realizes I am Adam Adam means unborn on it drum the sleepless does not mean insomnia it it means and without sleep as flop numb without dream now you can understand you can immediately map it the big fact about the physical world is the body and it is the body which is born he says I am never born he realizes when you when he wakes up penny to knowledge he realizes I am Adam Adam means I am not born when a journey healing him the body is born I am NOT the body there's a funny story about this one of our Swami's he had long discussions about punar janma whether it's logical or illogical it is possible or not possible then he went to an observe a thick sadhu then uh knit drum no sleep also pradya sleep means ignorance so on each drum means not de praga he is never de praga also then a swapped number not d ty just not the dreamer also then what I am i apart from them yes and at the same time advaitha advaitha means non-dual there is no waker dreamer or sleeper apart from me I am the only reality these are appearances it is not that there is a shopkeeper and there is a person watching the TV and there is a sleeper in the bedroom three persons are there and there is one more real person there is only one person who appears as the shopkeeper and the person watching a TV and sleeping in his bedroom only one person and that is the thorium you are the thorium next another big question comes after realization Swamiji will this world disappear big bursts of light will be there world will disappear a body mind nothing will be there when people ask this is a silly question but people ask will will the body live after aggregate realize Brahman of course the body will live what you will go on as it is the world will also go on as it is when you realize the sky is not blue after that you open your eyes and look at the sky what do you realize what do you see you see the sky is blue the experience will continue to be the same but your understanding will be completely different your understanding and your realization your feeling about it will be completely different that's the that's the point he's making now very interesting verse will the world go away after realization what does he say prep enjoy yadi with Geetha never tetanus am shia maya Mottram madam do item to item Parramatta beautiful verse you know what he says he's being humorous here will the world go away when I realize Brahman my body mind everything will go away I will be light to DM he says if the world was there in the question of it staying or going away would have come there is no such world at all will the snake run away after I realize it is a rope the correct answer is there is no snake to run away at all no snake will go away what snake is there will the snake died when I realize it's a rope no why not in stupid still remain it will neither remain normally die because there is no snake if there was a snake the question of it's going away would have come when you realize it is a rope will you say will the wildlife people say there's now one less snake in the world no number of snakes is still the same because that snake was not there at all prop enjoy Adi with theatre if the world existed never Tate an assumption no doubt it would have gone away when the world does not exist so what happens my imatra madam sarvam it is an error just like the snake was an error it is an error my imatra madam serve 'm add weight impaired amar theta it is one undivided reality advaita non dual reality you are all this there is no world separate from you which has to be driven away but will this all exist you exist this will continue to appear earlier it was appearing as something apart from you now with no doubt at all you know you are one with everything this is what will happen then this question a gentleman you asked yesterday who knows them who learns all this if I am koream then who is listening to all this who is in error who will get realization so the next last verse here we call Pavini what deta culpa Toa DK energy opah they shot I am wardo gotta do it immediately he says all these differential differences would disappear just like the earlier words all the difference is guru shishya knower and known and the Afghani was realized now - Liam these differences would disappear if these different differences where they're in the to begin with he says Upanishad I am bada all these distinctions have been set forth by the opposition for purposes of instruction because we feel it this way open issued says ok you are sure it is a guru here is Manduca they read it get realization after that what happens today in the verse we saw near warner/chappell come now guru inner system Ramanujan Mahna Mahna Mahna Mahna guru dinner system chewed on and Rupa her shivoham shiva oneness comes to the guru of Janaka raja he told him I will give you advaitha Jana but first give me guru Dakshina why because after advaitha Jana there'll be no guru in sheesha you will not give me realization so first you think you think this was actually then I will give you advaitha gala this is joking but the point is these distinctions they will continue to appear but you know in reality there is no separate knower and known no separate guru and shisha to give a even deeper analysis your question is not wrong if you see this philosophy that question is a fundamental question that who is the knower in this case in the thirteenth chapter of bhagavad-gita in the Shankara Basha there after a long discussion the pure Paksha asks this question who realizes this who gets Mukti curium is the only reality to reom is ever free to who gets mukthi who realizes this truth and Shankar Acharya gives a very interesting answer he says why are you asking why are you asking then answer is that the question was who is in ignorance who gets knowledge that's the question Shankar Acharya says why are you asking because I don't know I want to know if you don't know you are in ignorance yeah when you are in ignorance then Who am I it's come to come to this I am explaining this to you it seems paradoxical and it in fact this is the mark that there is something wrong here not in the philosophy Derry it is Maya and this is a sign of error that if you logically probe it at one place you will come to fault lines in fact all these philosophers Nara Arjuna for example even Shankar Acharya also you examine the world logically you will come to endless logical inconsistencies they're known in by can't you can't call them anti noemi's of these reason you push it even the question of an example small example I'll give relation father and son guru shishya knower and known a and B relation always presupposes two terms a and B guru and shisha suppose father and son or knower and known okay relation between two terms so here is a one term B is another term R is the relation between them okay now when this is both Shankara sorry raises the question is this real yes this is real yes is the relation real yes in some sense relation also is real then if these are two terms then what is the relation between them what is the relation between a and R what is the relation between R and B you will again have to posit one more relation here isn't it if this is one entity these are two entities there is a relation between them then what is the relation between this entity and the relation itself you have to posit one more relation here same problem will come here and you end up with a regression with the regression regresses as infinitum the kind of logical inconsistency so this can be argued about but what they are saying is this is a sign that there is some kind of problem with our view of the world it's some inconsistency do you come up when you probe deeply enough you come up with in consistencies Western philosophers also Bradley the book appearance and reality can't also they all come up with this and in our ancient times Shankar Acharya Nagarjuna the Buddhist Sunni Avadi sri harsha a greater drayton they all come up with these ideas that if you probe deeply enough it turns out to be very interesting inconsistent there are deep inconsistencies in the and that shows that we do not understand something fundamental about the world in any theory in science also if you come up with several inconsistencies fundamental inconsistencies it means something more fundamental is there to be discovered you have not yet you know come to a complete understanding ok so these are the carica in explanation of the Mundaka Upanishad mantra number seven I have spoken enough more than nearly one hour more than one hour will conclude here I'll take questions if you have patience yeah questions yes a question yeah do you need the mic ok yeah in the dream state yeah lucid dreaming you don't get what is called lucid dream that means you don't generate the dream it's not like a movie which you're directing it's not like that it's given to you yeah because you experienced the dream isn't it just as you're experiencing this you experienced a dream I'll give you I'll give you the logic here instead of looking at the things experienced look at the experiencer looking instead of looking at that side look at this side of the equation look at it this way you are now looking at this Swami now you look at the table now you look at the wall there are three objects you see one after another your consciousness plus this name and form is your experience of this Swami your consciousness plus this table name and form is your experience of the table through your that your consciousness plus this wall name and form is your experience of the wall table Swami wall they are different from each other but what continues through all these experiences of yours is your consciousness the objects are different and that is happening throughout the day isn't it throughout the day a consciousness is continuously illumining different objects giving you experience of the objects normally what do we do we focus on the object here is Swami here is a table here is the wall here is suka here is dukkha but in all of them one consciousness is flowing through that the objects keep changing the consciousness does not change you see now I have one thought and I have different thought how is it not changing the thoughts have changed the contents of the thoughts have changed but the light the consciousness which illumines these thoughts has not changed this is what they're saying next extend it to the dream the waking state completely goes away you are in deep sleep or you go to sleep you forget that you are in a bed and in under a mosquito net is sleeping but what is your subjective experience many things are happening you don't even know it's a dream people are their animals and birds and buildings are there you are also there in a in a body there in the dream now those objects are changing but that consciousness the same consciousness which was till now watching the waking state is watching the dream state also after sometime everything stops this blankness neither these objects nor the dream objects nothing that that including your mind even the thought I am somebody that also disappears and that blankness is illumined by that consciousness this continuous consciousness throughout is what they are pointing to that is illumining all experiences in in deep sleep according to the weight of a tanta mind is in a potential state body mind everything is the potential set from your point of view not from the objective point of view objective point of view the person the fellow is sleeping on the bed under the mosquito net and snoring maybe but from the person's point of view it's just a blankness and mind is in a potential form from where Advaita Vedanta point of view from me Patanjali yoga point of view deep sleep is also one of the width T of the mind mind has several rip T's so the deep sleep is also taken as a width T of the mind so mind is very much there in deep sleep for yoga but on Japan gel yoga philosophy Advaita Vedanta does not say that innovative a Ranta only ignorance the program only consciousness plus ignorance is deep sleep No so you have to so they advaita vedanta speaks about a car inertia reader which is ignorance itself you can say that the mind the ignorant aspect of the mind alone is there you can say that yeah what let me tell you in advaitha Vedanta you see we have not done the sixth mantra we have gone straight to the seventh month in the sixth month it says in deep sleep you are this project associated with your blankness ignorance that what we experience in deep sleep I am pragya with blankness nothing else this is individually now says you think about the totality of all beings consciousness titanium this consciousness with total ignorance ignorance of all beings it is called each for in fact the word Ishwara is used in the sixth mantra what is this this is the Torian plus this is Maya the consciousness with the power of Maya is called eshwara consciousness with the power of Maya is called Ishwara in Vedanta pure consciousness without the power of Maya without reference to it if you see pure consciousness here Ishwara and you are one and the same Ishwara is called that you are called to UM so tuck to a mercy you are that you know what that refers to here Ishwara you know what term refers to hear you now if you say you are Ishwara it does not make any sense how can I be sure I am NOT Ashura from the point of view of the Waker of the dreamer as an individual body and mind I am Not sure certainly not I am an ordinary being I have no idea who is Ishwara but if you disrupt disregard the bodies and minds if you take the consciousness alone which is the same be that same consciousness with the power of maya creates this entire universe is called Ishwara in our religion the same consciousness if you take the individual car under Sharia and individual sukshma sharir is called one Jeeva if you disregard these is a call to bodies if you disregard Izu bodies take the consciousness itself you and Ishwara Veda one and the same this is the meaning of that trauma see you are that is the meaning of the maha vaakya and Upanishads dr. Amma see you are that a humdrum ask me you must be in what sense ah-hum I the individual Brahman saguna brahman there's a whole technique he knows Lux on eyes taken and it comes to the pure consciousness this pure consciousness is the essence of God is their sense of you one Sufi poet put it very beautifully Advaita Vedanta but the Sufi poet says from an Islamic point of view such a wonderful thing he says he says when I searched for Allah I found only myself when I searched for myself Who am I I found Allah so beautifully it is stated when I search for Who am I I found Allah God when I searched for God I found no God I found myself both ways its leading to this this to do any other question yeah yeah it's coming up yes universe made of Akasha and prana all the universe made of so many more hundred and certains and number of elements or particles or strings or whatever all that is nothing but an appearance of Turia and I'm not saying it just like that the opening shot says it into a 3d opening sure he said the smart y8 a smart man aha arkasha Sam Botta from this Atma Akasha was projected Akasha via wire agnya agnya Appa at the Opera TV so he says the opening shot says from this Atma arkasha was projected projected projected means what from Atma - Akash how does it come it is Atma alone misunderstood error as Akasha and from Akasha why do you agree the gel HIV and the combination of this world so in modern science you might say various particles or you might say super strings or whatever so it is the Atma alone appearing in all these forms and when a very interesting article has been written this one around Subramanyam he's a professor of physics in IIT Mumbai I think I around Subramanyam he's written an article which another researcher concept of Akasha in Indian philosophy philosophies and modern science space so very interesting and here consider various aspects but the basic idea is you yourself the consciousness you are appearing in all these forms let me give you an example if I keep a mirror here if I keep a mirror here what will you see in the mirror you will see all these young boys and girls and the gentlemen's ladies sitting here you will see the tables chairs fanlight everything you see the whole room reflected in this mirror but actually what is there in the mirror there are no human beings no table light chair for nothing what is there in the mirror glass that glass is appearing in all these forms now you might say because it's out there it's being reflected forget that aspect just take the glass or you take the computer monitor in that inside that you can see so many things whatever you want you can see in there but actually what is there there is no cars roads people stars and planets nothing is there in that it's just glass it's just a monitor TV screen similarly in pure consciousness all this is projected swami vivekananda puts it very poetically is a song of the sannyasi he says one alone exists in him is Maya dreaming this dream one alone exists in him interior is Maya dreaming this dream dream of what body is mind samsara Jiang mom with two cyka cyka everything but actually it's realized as one reality if you say what is the use use is in fact the greatest possible use what anybody is seeking we are seeking only two things we are seeking overcoming of suffering and getting bliss and happiness in life that's all we are trying to do not only human means even an animal is trying to seek happiness and overcome sorrow or suffering and all of us in all all that we do our highest research to the to the the most erudite erudite scholar professor in his laboratory to a beggar on the street all of them are simply trying to avoid unhappiness and trying to get happiness the objects in which we put our efforts are refined or gross now what Vedanta tells you what is the goal the first question they ask what is the use of all this promotional team problem what is the use they say uses a tentacle to connect the paramon and the practice ciao complete cessation of sorrow and attainment of bliss that is the goal there can be no higher go there can be no higher cool yeah let me to finish this yeah yeah permanent happiness is not the happiness of the Waker your happiness the Waker the happiness in the mind what we talked about my about do ki ho to opera Duke Ajanta do you experience your misery then you are not miserable you are the knower of the misery in your mind right so that su can look up the happiness which comes and goes in the mind that's what most people are chasing when you realize the two reham it is not that you will go go around with her you know like a permanent smiley not that you'll go around with a big smile on your face what happened ever realized to reom know what happens use you transcend the mind you realize yourself as something apart from the body and mind the reality which by nature is happiness which which by nature is joy that that is bliss that's why they use the term bliss instead of suka that is beyond so current dukkha you remember today in the morning we did that Nirvana shutter comes Iran and the Rupa shivoham there he says na sukham duhkham neither suka nor dukkha okay then what chewed on and then uses the word Ananda I am Ananda and what it's it's the difference is like this experiencing suka and beings Ananda what's the difference it's like I have a face and a seat in the mirror when I see it in the mirror it's my face is reflected in the mirror here what happens is when the our innate Ananda is reflected in the mind we get what is called suka and we changed that that's what we normally understand as happiness but when you realize yourself is to reom you are no longer dependent on the mind it's like I know that I have this face I don't always need a mirror to keep on looking at my face if the mirror goes away my face is still there the mirror goes away my face is still there so you are you realize yourself as onon the super Swami Vivekananda puts it very beautifully when he says what is the meaning of such Ananda it is not that the Atman exists it is existence itself it is not that the Atman knows it is knowledge itself it is not that the Atman is happy it is happiness itself that takes some time of time to explain but you can understand in these terms okay leave it at that question to you know true true that is good question what do we know what now you say that knowledge will remove ignorance ignorance will and when ignorance cause error will go away now the question is what knowledge what knowledge isn't this knowledge yes Advaita Vedanta says this is called parochial Jana parotia means indirect knowledge not direct so what is my direct knowledge that I am this body and mind what is the indirect knowledge I have read in a book or a heard in a lecture I am NOT body and mind and something called pure consciousness within quotes now the principle is indirect knowledge can never cut away direct ignorance it has to be direct knowledge I must actually feel it so otherwise it will not go away it must come directly how will that come how will that come there is a process they call it Shravan or mono non it is d assalam num-num when the number needed the asana homonym hearing literally means hearing mononym thinking reasoning the asana meditation what what happens this very rough way of putting it but precise meaning is this I will just tell you in one sentence is what is it Shravan um is systematically listening or to these truths or studying these truths systematically when is Shravan um complete when is it successful at the end of Shravan um you must be able to claim that I have understood what they want to say I have understood what they want to say what the Swami was trying to teach I have understood it I have grasped it agraharam I have grasped it at least intellectually have grasped what he is trying to say that is the end of shabanam isn't that enough no that's not enough what will happen after this is okay I get it what you are trying to say I studied it systematically what the opposition is trying to say I get it but I don't believe it I understand what you are saying but I don't believe it why there are so many doubts now unless you understand there can be no doubts if I simply don't get it what is Turia what is Vishwa all this is completely confusing then sternum is to be repeated you have to get it clear once it is clear okay they are saying that I am pure consciousness well I don't buy it I don't believe it why don't you buy it why don't you believe it take up your doubts one by one and those doubts are to be cleared away at this stage called mallanna and there are whole books devoted to this every possible question you can imagine and though many which you cannot imagine also they've been asked and they have been answered I mean I still have not faced a question which I have not been able to think out to my satisfaction at least so mononym at the end of mononym how do you know millennium is over at the end of mononym you will say I am convinced I believe it at the end of Shravan um I get it what you are trying to say at the end but the doubt is I do not believe it at the end of mononym okay it is possible I think this is true I think this is true I believe it is true but again what is the problem I don't feel it I still feel I am this body and mind I don't feel it it's not a living reality it's something that I have understood and I believe it but I don't feel it yet it's not living for me if somebody Pierce's my hand you know pinches me I say oh this is it hurts now this truth which you have understood and now you're convinced you have to drive it deep within you through meditation so I mean we awaken Allah says tell yourself again and again I am he saw him until the truth tingles with every drop of your blood you are convinced about it if you start here it will not work it will be brainwashing only you have first have to study it properly I have to understand what they say work it out logically so I haven't you have at least you personally have no more doubts about it there is every possible question and then you have no more doubts then you drive it deep if you are not convinced simply repeating it will not help it will not be it will not be helpful then at the end of this process comes an intuitive grasp that yes till now I was thinking I'm this individual separate individual from all but now I realize I realized the scream I realize myself as consciousness in which all this is shining one unbroken unchanging consciousness that is to reham the fourth okay and one more question they will stop you can carry this outside the hall because it's already late yeah yeah yes yes okay can look at it that way actually in Vedanta they say the mind is independent of the brain when they say Atma you say punar janma and all that so consciousness plus the mind goes from body to body so when the body goes the brain also goes with it so unless the mind is in some sense independent of the brain it cannot go from one body to another so pollution won't be possible any of but that does not affect this discussion mind is an entity a material entity it may be a subtle material entity which is a material entity now see the problem here is ignorance where is ignorance ignorance cannot be in my thumb any knowledge and any ignorance must be in the mine only see the Toria is perfect just now itself - yes perfect you are perfect as it is but a problem is you don't know it and this don't know is called ignorance where is this ignorance in your mind now where does knowledge have to come knowledge can come only in one place it cannot come in my thumb or it cannot come in the air it can come in the mind only and the principle is where there is ignorance their knowledge must come about which there is ignorance about that knowledge must come two principles the a shreya and the V Shia of Ag Jana and Jana must be same the a shreya and wish' of Jana and a Gianna must be same for a Jana to destroy a Jana what is what does that mean a Shriya means where there is ignorance there only knowledge must come so my gurus IANA cannot destroy my organic because ignorant is here and go to power the acharya Shankar Acharya gana cannot destroy my Agana Jana must come here itself then only it will destroy my organic it is in the mind it's not in - dear now the second point the wish I also must be same I have a gana about physics if I learn biology my Organa about physics will not be destroyed because the vision of that organ is physics so I must get knowledge about physics the V shy of the gun and a Gianna must be same they must coincide so the V shy of the Adriana here is myself Who am I I don't know myself so I need knowledge about myself that will destroy the ignorant about myself and both of this must come in the in the mind only ignorance in the mind knowledge must also come in the mind there the ignorant is removed the problem is now it's like your grandfather has left you a one crore rupees so you are Kuroda thie but somebody asks you why are you begging for money it is true that grandfather left me one crore rupees but which bank it is in where is the passbook I don't know anything so you are cut off but you but you have to beg similarly you are Toria you are beyond some sort of no to cut and touch you but you are miserable some sorry I feel horrible I am suffering from day to day even if I am Turia it's not available to me because it's clouded by my ignorance I don't know it that's all yeah true true in in Vedanta the position is a good question in Indian flow in Hindu philosophy also the Yogi's say this when you study all this Yogi's say you are just distracting your mind distracting don't distract calm down your mindset quietly you will get realization don't read so many books or attend lectures that's the flaw same philosophy what you are saying but in Buddhism there are other schools there is the Magnum acre school the Tibetan Buddhists there for the month America school the entire thing is based on reasoning now adroit the Vedanta what it tells you is Shyvana manner and it is the asana here these truths grasp them reason then meditate upon it what are the way the Vedanta discourages you simply sit quietly that will not help just as in common sense I want to master mechanical engineering or something now I'll say okay I'll sit quietly won't help won't help you'll be in trouble deep trouble within a few days so you have to get back once Swami put it very beautifully you know nobody say no one intuitive feeling will come so once Swami put it very beautifully say we don't believe in intuition we believe in tuition yes so in Vedanta meditation is important very important but you grasp the truth be convinced about it then stay there that staying meditation at that level meditation is helpful then you stop reading books and the truth which you have grasped try to assimilate it by staying in the truth that I am the thorium I have understood it I believe it now let me feel it there meditation is helpful it's coordinated the asana that is the approach of advaita vedanta but in a Hinduism Patanjali yoga will say no no what you said is correct it was hit only quietly in meditation okay we'll just leave it here should we wrap up now it's eight o'clock thank you very much I had a wonderful time here and I hope [Applause]
