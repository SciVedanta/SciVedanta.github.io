[68. Yoga Vasistha -  Behavior of a Brahma Gyani](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpAhhy7FVMs)

Consciousness is the goal for The Path of Knowledge so that is the goal we are going to reach ramachandra was going on asking questions and his Guru bashishta he was giving the reply now the question is how we will understand that who is a Brahma gyani what will be their behavior the brahmagyanis so that last time also the Consciousness without mind is illumine state that we discussed then when we are sleeping and the deep sleep when there is no dreams even that is a beautiful stage very peaceful very joyful state when we are conscious with the body and mind and there is a mixture Sometimes good sometimes bad in the dream state also Sometimes good sometimes bad but when the dreamless Sleep stage we go into that that is a unique state where only joy only happiness and nothing else every one of us almost every day we are experiencing that so that condition and transcending all the three stages when we go into the fourth stage that is the permanent experience that is called brahmagyana because there we find nothing but the consciousness and feeling is only joy we find the Consciousness but that feeling is only joy the happiness and the goal of human life is happiness though we sometimes say the goal of human life is Dharma Moksha they say but ultimately it is the joy it is the happiness so obviously when we come to that and those blessed few who have realized Brahman or undivided infinite consciousness how would be their behavior by leaving so that was the question in answer the bashishta is giving the reply doshu Buddha ubaya means child he doesn't do anything considering this is just go on doing like that the children very young people they don't consider if I do this then the only when they become five years six years old then they can understand because the parents are liking this so I should do this so they will appreciate me like that but much below maybe two years three years old they don't consider in that way similarly a Brahma gyani he is doing some work not considering by doing this I will get appreciation all I will get all merits no or I should not do this because these are all bad work just believe like a baby child so that is the way they are trying to giving us an idea though after the realization that everything is nothing but the Consciousness how they will survive how they will live this is the way as an innocent child is beyond all rules and regulations similarly a person of knowledge do not do any action thinking this will bring good Merit or do not do some action thinking that this is all prohibited actions that is not considered action which you perform merely with the organ of action but without attachment of mind the mind is not there it is not we are not thinking in that way but just some action is going on so that is not considered as action someone who is going into that treatment and maybe they have injected so he is losing the consciousness but holding the hand of the doctor tightly it cannot be considered that he is purposefully doing it no the doctor will not consider oh this man look at him he is giving me pain he is holding my hand so tightly they won't so slowly they will help him to open the that is the way it always works when the mind is not attached with the work that is not considered as work so this is the it that goes in this way so pleasure is attached with mine desire is attached with mind if we can free ourselves from the desire then there is nothing about the behavior of the Brahma gyani it is a great book in the pirantha it says in a person of perfection Divine qualities like the freedom of aversion like the fearlessness friendship compassion free from the attachment egolessness all the Manifest in the bhagavad-gita the 12th chapter in the from the 13 to 19 all these qualities the God has listed that is why bhagavad-gita is the gist of vedanta there all this it is listed [Music] Etc so again and again we have to understand the religious life is nothing but developing the wonderful qualities good qualities and nothing else I am practicing religion at the same time I am not having any good quality that cannot be it can never be so it says the Indonesia a person is the freedom from aversion abortion I don't like these I don't like this nothing like that it is okay so this aversion is completely free it is not there in the mind of it Brahma gyani then the friendliness is the friend of all there is no discrimination or this person likes me so it should be a friend or belongs to my group so it is nothing like that anyone coming to this Frame in compassion karuna it must be there always every time so much of compassion and free from attachment near Mama the mama is the my me and mine that conception is completely absent in the Brahma gyani there is nothing like that it cannot be so these are the qualities of Ibrahim again see here there is no ambiguity when Sometimes some people they are claiming that their brahmagyanis or the god realized people there are some ear sticks are there we can judge doing bhagavan srama Krishna he was behaving not the normal people They do so there is a lot of commotion among that group and they started telling how is it that he is eating fast and then offering the food to Mother Kali that this is sacrileged we should not allow it then there was a naturally the jamindar mathur Babu came the landlord but after looking at him and seeing his sincerity he said it's something special he's not doing as a mad or like this something special then give me a lady and she was very you know learned in Tantra so she told no no no no all these things that we see in the behavior that shows that he is an avatar because she all read all this then she challenged in those days a lady saint challenging can you cannot imagine in India in those days the ladies were all inside the garden behind the cartons they were not supposed to come out there but this lady brahmani she challenged and two three very learned people they came with all the scriptures they sat in one place a lot of people also attended that a debate was going on the sudama Krishna himself was present but he was not bothering at all about that he is going to be selected as a Avatar but he never cared about that and sometimes he was telling how long they will continue for him it was like that he was behaving and this lady gave one after another if you find these this this quality this is and this type of qualities we have already seen in the life of caitanya so he considered as an avatar the God incarnated these are the qualities the here is the brahmagyani these qualities must manifest otherwise we cannot consider as a brahmakyani so this is the debate is going on ramachandra is asking that some people may claim that they have brahmoganism apparently how can you judge you cannot judge in that way so what to do so he is telling in this way and he said this thing comes normally naturally not that they are practicing it automatically it comes because when you are practicing religion obviously you should be truthful not that you have to practice that when you are practicing you are not a religious person when it has become your own character that you are not telling lies and not behaving in in the other way that is natural linear character nature so that he is telling over here this type of things will be there are present by default it is they are not practicing it you know sometimes some people very courteous very gentle when you are going and meeting them they are very courteous the companies comes it and all that but you have to take the nap ornament then only they will be courteous and suddenly if you go no they won't meet you and after the time is over thank you that means we have to get up so this is not the behavior no that cannot be so this is in the society it is okay but for a religious person it is not like that it's natural love is there and all normal behavior they need not to practice for these qualities it's not necessary they have already done it all sadhanas are over then it becomes natural now the painter if you ask him to paint then oh I need these I need that just something you'll be there and you will say if you are supplying this type of quality paint and the brasses and canvas I can draw okay now I can teach you in this way well he knows how to do it that I was I was seeing a movie a two three minutes movie the one gentleman going to the remote part of the India and to the classrooms all poor kids are there then he will say hey whatever you like just draw over here I really wondered all the kids they came and someone was doing these someone these the different type of cross and triangle and round and all that then they were sitting and that gentleman connecting all those things made a beautiful picture he knew we had the confidence whatever you do I am going to give the shape and that is called the artist otherwise no I cannot do this and all nothing like that so this is [Music] sometimes I am I am good and sometimes I am not it won't be all this comes in his character by default it is there that's why he is realized person automatically there so when the ramachandra is asking the beautiful answer the guru is giving we can put it in this way suppose a swimmer is a great swimmer can we go and ask him hey can you float on the water he's a swimmer if he can't Float On The Water how can he swim that is the basic thing so we can now now he he is not practicing how to float because all the all those things are already there after the Brahma gyana we need not to go and remind him you are supposed to be kind you are supposed to be these you are supposed to be there it is automatic natural guidelessness very simple and he used to go and behave in that way but other people for them it is very difficult so his nephew who is to be always with him and he used to go then he suddenly heard that there is a great personality in those days the keshav Chandra Shane is in this building is in this area he said keshav is here I like to meet him now he was scared you are going to meet Keisha why what is your business because he knew that sudama Krishna may not talk in that way the keshava and all that very dignified and struck at people so they may not like sirama Krishna he is wearing that type of dhoti and he'll be the bare body he will go and talk how they will like and in those days the Bengali Babu culture you know in Bengal the Babu culture was great you should always be well dressed when we are going out you have a turban and chatter like this otherwise they won't consider they don't talk to you look at you so that was the way ramakrishna never bothered but no he was insistent I should go I should then he said well the condition is you should be a properly just go and one or two words and then we should come back because he is a very influential person which cannot make him in this behave like this as you usually do agreed okay okay you don't worry about me it will be all right and he the moment he went over there naturally he got and he went and told that my maternal Uncle he wants to meet you but how he will introduce because he is not a an educated person or a rich person or a socially at something some position nothing so he told my Uncle always talk about God and dream and meditate on God that is his only quality and nothing else this is okay bring the Kisha was that way broad-minded sirama Krishna entered and he said okay sure your till has fallen and that is the first sentence okay naturally how everyone became angry including sirama krishna's nephew so I told you he whispered not to say this type of words what you are meaning but sidama Krishna was looking intently with the to the keshav and keshav immediately folded his hands and asked his people wait wait he must be saying something very serious he is a different type of person so what about it he said sir can you please explain what about it so you didn't see that the baby frogs they are having the Tails they cannot come on the the earth I mean come out of the water but when the tales have fallen they can be in the water or at the same time on the dry land also so you have developed that spiritual quality now you can be in the world and also can be in the world of spirituality so that's from that D onwards Kisha became his followers and he used to go to sirama Krishna all the time is to listen to him slowly slowly his mind changed synonym Krishna observed him when all people are meditating sudama Krishna told out of all these people that I see only one person's mind is concentrated at his Kisha this is sudama Krishna and this is so natural supper I go to meet some person and behave like that what will happen to me they will beat me so obviously you cannot come into my house and swaying but when this type of people the Brahma gyani is the Avatar they talk they are not considering suppose I tell like these then what will happen nothing like that very straight way so this is the Brahma gyani sadhana Rubina because they are so Lobby so much within them Purity is so much within them the moment they go and talk immediately if a person is having little quality spiritual quality good quality immediately they will understand it so he saw the Kisha and immediately understood yes but he went to meet many other people he never be it like that he never talked like that he went to meet the father of rabindranath tagar he was also practicing meditation he was also considered as a spiritual Guru but SRI ramakrishna went and met and talked with him and came back and told okay he is practicing that's good that much so this is the way they could see that is the reason the one person was employed by a another a lady used to come and to see ramakrishna she was a widow and she was having her house little property but her brother was scared and he was thinking oh my God if my sister gives all the property to this Brahman to this priest then what will happen so obviously planning that you to stop the sister but sister won't listen she was very devoted to the sirama Krishna so he hired a in the strong man and told you have to go and terrify the sudama Krishna and ask him not to come to our house and and he was a very strong person and after is now even the famous part of this type of people and when he hired this man was waiting for sirama Krishna usually this ramakrishna used to trouble with many devotees that he was alone and he was doing this man came stood before him and he said oh you and they have hired because it's a costly then they have hired me to beat you oh it is any of my channel could do it chela means my followers could do it but anyway the moment he wanted to touchners one finger touched his heart and Sudan Krishna went out the moment he touched the heart of that person was a Gundam the rafian immediately he changed for a long period of time he was standing over there like a statue then afterwards he left all those bad works and he used to sit on the Terrace and looking at the Sunrise up to Sunset and that is called throttle means looking at an item and the cyst maybe anything constantly without blinking so that way he control his mind and he became very famous man in those days in that area the people started coming and paying respect to him he became a very old so this is a different type of people the brahmagyanis they are different type of people because sometimes he will go and ask for food won't you give me some food I need it you have to and sometimes when the people are offering you know I won't take because then they could read the minds of the people so when they are telling so we cannot go on asking whether you are a Brahma gyani or not whether God realized or not because it is automatically automatically get all the special qualities of the Brahman in Arab Brahman cannot make any spiritual mistake you will never make any mistake spiritual Mystic when normally there may be something that in his behavior why Prada so we will just come to that discussion the Paratha is there means those who have already done something in your past life and that if it is continuing that will continue so that is always there even for these people even after God realization it may be there but ramakrishna said if the God is holding the hand of a child it will the font false state will never be he will be all the time saving the child so similarly when a person is brahmagyani the he steps spiritual steps will never fall and you all is correct upanishad is there and the bharthika at that Sahara Sara means the gist so that they will be writing on that shankaracharya wrote on that and it's mentioning reminds us that the past Impressions continues even after the enlightenment that is there the past impression will be there like the mannerism even after the brahmagyana the mannerism will be there the one lady was telling that she is from India from far away place and she was telling I like your talk and every talk I listen to you and I know when you are going to correct people this the topic the head cover you know I had a habit of drawing like this she noticed when I am going to do that the moment my hands are up going up she knew that I am going to do it so I was not aware about my mannerism and when she told then I came to know this is my mannerism so I have to be careful about it anyway so then this mannerism is always there foreign liberated soul is influenced by the past actions effect this is always there one of us swamiji was there and still he is there I am not mentioning his name usually people they start when a complete the sentence with Etc these these these these Etc usually they write etcetera but he used to State the state and start the sentence with etcetera [Laughter] but he's a very knowledgeable person if you listen to him he will feel like continuing the listening to us so much he knows about the geography the history the science the about the music a lot of knowledge but you have to understand his mannerism and in Bengali they say itadi means Etc and all this this is Italian this is continuous and he will start the sentence then you have to be at that mannerism then it is very good otherwise some people you have not started the sentence after the completion and he got confused why you see because that is his manner he doesn't know that he is doing it so this is the mannerism even the mukta purusha it will be there foreign [Music] soul is influenced by the past actions so when someone is behaving like that who how can this be he is a religious man it's a brahmagyani why should he be like that no it is not like that it is this outwardly behave it maybe it is like this so that's why he is there mentioning in the birthday the shankaracharya himself is mentioning that means when he is completely enlightened person what is branti accepting this world as true accepting all these as true that is called pranti Nasha you know the British ruled our country for 200 years in India and we went on even we were born after the independence even we went on hearing the grid between is a great place and naturally they talked in that way as if the Great Britain all the roads are made of gold and everything is good everything is good everything good when I visited London I was excited Great Britain I am going the London I am going and I saw it is more narrow lens than in Calcutta necessary and then I was wondering when I was traveling over the people root 200 years so how this is all imaginative things we do because the impression always there the branti nasheopy then the branti the wrong conception about that was lost so sometimes people will be telling like this and if you go over there oh this is only this much and nothing else devotee they came and told we have visited that we got excited is it that we should also go there and what is there then we saw in the picture oh my God you have to climb so much and these and that we heard about the Great Wall of China you know how difficult it is if you go over there once you go then you will say enough is enough I am not going to visit again and you have to climb you have to go you have to climb you have to go terrible place miles after miles it is there but the tourists are going thinking who are on the Great Wall of the China they're going taking the photos and all when they're coming down they are so tired next time if you ask them can you please like to go you know enough we know what is there so this is the with branti Nasha kranti means all the wrong conceptions are destroyed nausea destroyed this world when we see and we think God is so good so good so good my friend my family my relatives everything is good then slowly slowly you understand it is nothing like that everything goes away everything goes away the wind we were thinking we are great friends the time comes the friend may also be a completely different way cheating and all that so then what will happen you will break down oh he is also cheating me and this is the world it happens like that so this is the way you have to understand pranthi Nasha but the samskara will continue the samaskara that will continue what is that samaskar I like to help people that samskara is there so obviously I will go on helping people I cannot stop that that sometimes different type of sanskaras are there they will always it will remain in that way one young boy joined in our order as a to become a brahmachary a novice and I noticed I was a senior ramachari that time I was going to get the after the nine years almost eight years completed after the nine years on Tenth year we get the sannyasa but if your behavior everything is all right then the seniors they will certify is so I saw this new boy he came anywhere any music you will start dancing you know he that steps will be completely different then one day I asked him did you learn dancing oh yes I was a student of keluchar and mahapatra he was a very very famous dancer kelucharan mahapatra I told my God you have completed three years training over there and then you have come to become a monk over here no it will be very difficult for you we singing is allowed over here in ramakrishna Mission but the monk dancing like that classical dances I don't think it will be allowed and you will always feel afterwards when you when the grown up then you will always because it is already there some mascaras are there impressions are there any music immediately you will feel like dancing it will be very difficult to go to you so I think you should consider you better go back practice that be successful over there because the it is in you and the monks are completely different type that is different type of temperament they know singing but they don't care for singing They Know many other things but they don't like to show it so that type of things are there but the dancing will be difficult you cannot control it you're in your mental Impressions it is there samskara so this the branti nasheop even if you have realized the Brahman you have it that all these practices that will continue the one of our Swami asked me and he liked me very much when I was very young and he liked me and told see I will give you a routine I will make a routine for you if you practice you will develop in spirituality very quickly and realize God then I I was very excited so give me the routine he gave then I it is impossible to practice for me I like to talk I like to mix people and he said should not talk to the people don't look at the and we were only five monks over there in mayabati in Himalaya only five and that to the in charge you cannot see him other fold some is there some is there only sometimes at a time of lunch or the food if I were there so we used to talk like that it will don't talk even that time and afternoon only 45 minutes was the free time then we made a little that was not a proper ball some of the papers and some the clothings old clothes we make it we made a ball and we used to play with that little bit exercise and excitement that also he told you should not do that that time you should go to under the tree and see it and meditate then oh my God it will be difficult for me then after two days I went and told swamiji I don't have any doubt about this routine but it doesn't go with my character as my nature I like to talk I like to sing I like to mix with people I like to cut jokes make fun and play that is my nature and if I forceful stopping it I don't know what is going to happen to me most of the time you lose the mental balances if you are imposing something which is not natural with you so allow me to grow in my own way that he embraced me and said you are correct you better grow and then I asked him had you friends in your school days or no he used to meditate all the time and he was not having the friends and that's the I told some started almost near to the summit and I am in the base camp now I have to learn how to climb the hill and then I will go to the base camp allow me to start from the base camp and in the past life he has already traveled that path completed it is a really really great soul no one can live in that way all alone but very happy and if you talk to him his words are so sweet that is the expression of the Brahma gyani but suppose I try to practice that without the proper preparation what will happen to me so that one should understand that how to develop at the same time one should know that when you reach over there Ultimate Place my behavior will be like this only because it is in the my behavior I cannot be grave I cannot be like behaving like that and he cannot be like me even after the brahmagyana was very talkative he was very fun loving you know that we become this and here the people when he used to cut jokes and all that the people is to ask him you are a great religious person but you are not quite hmm when you're all the time making fun jokes and all this that when you become creep why when I have the stomach ache I become great conductor because even then his nature was the boyish nature all the time used to be up like that so he saw the people they are here in Chicago then the summertime people are boating boot drawing and all that he started telling I like to go do like that too he never knew then that the family where he used to stay this hour the the what's called The Hill Family and they told okay so they arranged a boat for swamiji to do he sat without removing his coat and all the shoe everything he sat over there and he toppled and he was in the water somehow they dragged him out there he told no I had a great experience no more [Laughter] so now you cannot say how a Brahma gyani should do like that though whenever you will see some things of some food or anything what is that is a new type of thing I like to eat I like to taste just like that but he was a problem once he sat on alone immediately we went into the nirvikalpa samadhi here in the Lincoln Park in Chicago not in Himalaya in Chicago so that mind was so pure the moment he is concentrating he is going into deep samadhi forgetting the whole around but when he is awake he will be behaving like that so the why it is because it is they see it is the samskara the great debate is there why they should be able like this though the Noah Brahman but his external Behavior may continue even after the knowledge any foreign the sometimes someone will be very raggy and sometimes will be irritated people sometimes krudda is the angry and shantiman very peaceful you know due to the result of the past action the prarabja as they call the external behavior of a person of wisdom may be different it doesn't look like the sometimes their behavior doesn't look like the wise person in a Psalm may be attached he was very fond of Pain any type of pain the people used to keep the pain then they used to go to meet him if he sees the pain in anybody's pocket first thing what is that pain I want that I want that he will be going on and he will have to give the pain to him and he was having so many pains full back full of Prince and he was very happy and he won't give to anyone he'll be keeping that pain but he was a Brahma gyani tomorrow I think on 7th so he was by profession he was a an engineer and he constructed the Prelude mod can you imagine the balloon but the huge Temple he did it and he was a Brahma Gyan he used to live in one place in India and he used to go for bathing he used to see the ganga yamuna and godavari and Saraswati ganga jamuna and Saraswati these three like sisters they're going and he he could see that all the three they are going together and their hair was like that all these knowledges were there he saw everything in that way he was very fond of hanumanji used to talk to hanumanji he used to sit with the hanumanji can you imagine the person like that and he will be dressed like that in a huge coat with lot of pains in every pocket he'll be moving the people used to call him the hanumanji and he was so happy when the people will be talking like that now I am the disciple of Hanuman he used to say like that his behavior was like that when he became the president of the ramakrishna order then the our swamis to make him please suppose you know this is an organization we need sometimes something so they used to go to the president and if the president say yes that will be allowed so they used to go with the pain and then they will give to swamiji and then swamiji I have a prayer oh yes it is okay because he has got the pain he was very happy no where you are going now I'm going to make the president marriage now any pain is there with you keep it there then go so like that how he will explain it that they say in the scripture that in the Brahma gyana the brihad arunak the bharthika it says even after the Brahma gyana these past action is continues and irritated vishwa Mitra was very irritated anything a little thing happened he will be irritated you know that famous story the after all this thing was over the ramachandra he conquered that and killed the ravana and came back he became the king and naturally there was all celebration was going on the Puja was going on vishwamitra was one of the uh we can say the purohitah those who were organizing the homo and are there many others were there like bashishta vashishta was the guru vishamitra was there other kings they were coming to pay the respect as ramachandra is the main King the other small small kingdoms they used to come and pay the respect and one of them he didn't notice bishamitra is sitting over there there's so many other monks are sitting the great monks and doing the Performing the Homa and because of the fire they were walking other side of the fire they didn't know he didn't notice the vishamitra but he paid his respect to the right hand side Monk and the left hand side of monk of the brishamitra ignoring vishamitra apparently immediately we communicated and he called ramachandra you invited me and now your guests are insulting me you have to punish that guest inside that cannot anyway who was he then find out that is the person then immediately ramachandra told okay I will ask him to come and pay you respect no no no no that is over now you have to go and cut his head and bring it to me foreign [Music] immediately went to that person and said hey what you're doing no I just came back from that Oma a ceremony I am going to take rest rest you are going to die why who is going to kill me ramachandra is going to kill you but why because you have not paid respect to the boshista and he's angry and he claimed that your Aid should be opportunity no no I like to go and no no no don't don't go over there you'll be killed by the Rama because what to do Rama has no other option then how can I survive this Narada told you you better go to hanumana and don't go directly to Hanuman go to hanuman's mother everyone's mother is a very kind-hearted lady go and tell mother please help me and I like to survive someone is coming to kill me and mother is naturally very happy my son is anumana so this man went and told the mother mother someone is coming to kill me no no no don't worry my son is there Hanuman you be here with me no one can touch you I am giving you the world of protection the mother told and hanumano was passing through that he overheard and said mother what happened whom you are giving this protection that this person has come somebody wants to kill him so I told my son is there no one can touch you then Hanuman actually understood here in the Kingdom of Sri Rama who can do it no one then he asked me come here who is going to kill you oh my God why you didn't tell it to mother I am going to meet him now then how can it save you from ramchandra but the hanumana immediately understood he said there must be some reason and who's he who asked you to come to me Narada that means something is there then the hanumana said mother since you have given the word I am going to protect him and he took him in one place and made his body huge because he had that capacity the yoga capacity and with the tail the long tail he made a round place like a well and kept him inside and sat on that so from every side it was closed here hanumana sat over there and he was taking the name of srirama now Rama came out to such that man to cut his age because they had to offer Narada even told why unnecessarily you are walking in this sun it is not necessary you have your that one type of the arrow if you tell the name of the person whom you like to kill just shoot that Arrow it will go and kill and come back yes that is true I forgot then he took that Arrow told on no name of that King and he should Arrow came back without any sign of blood the Rama properly pronounced the name maybe some wrong type 2 was there so he properly threw it again shot shot it and again it came back third time then he turned to the Narada what is that why it is happening you know he must be knowing and others are told you cannot kill yourself how can you kill yourself myself your disciple hanumana has become Rama in his meditation right from the hate until the top and up to the tail it is nothing but Rama hanumana has completely transformed into Rama in meditation so when your arrow is going it is not finding anyone and that man is inside the body of the Hanuman that you cannot touch him so this is the story it means the irritation though the Brahma gyani but for little thing he was so irritated but through this we learned that the name of God is more powerful than the God himself if the disciple is taking the name of God and slowly slowly meditating on him and becoming himself even the God cannot harm you the name of the god is more powerful than the God himself it says so this is irritation and they say angry durbarsha you know most of you heard about him he was the any little thing he immediately will curse and the p is the the Soma Psalm are very peaceful people Swami Maharaja he was a very peaceful was the embodiment of Shiva so he used to become angry sometimes and he was he knew that I am going to die within 39 years there was not much time so organization she was going on telling this says Swami sarada that you should do this you should do that why you have not done this and Sharad Murad was very quiet he was looking at it and listening it was only he could we are that anger of Swami Vivekananda and he was going on rebuking him and in the very harsh word he was using then suddenly he saw from the distance some devotees are coming to meet Swami Vivekananda he then he said will you continue now because the devotees are coming or you will meet them and then afterwards this is okay let me first make the devotee then then I will again devotee scheme and he met them after 10-15 minutes when they left is reminding him then swamiji forgot what he was telling what I was telling now you were actually scolding me that you came up to this swamiji was taken about what type of man is he he was so composed so calm and never irritated Swami sarada he was a Brahma Kiani because friends that when we are discussing it is truly there and if we go to the the Rishi bisha Mitra we may not believe but when he quote the lives of these people who were only 100 years before so naturally it is true it is possible so this it is possible and if we accept the effect of the proud of karma the effect of the action done in the past so the Brahma gyani but how to reconcile and recognize that they are not a Brahman that he was the question this there are so many behavioral all these defects are there but how I will understand that he is a Brahma gyani then we will read these words and conclude and it says as the Brahman is the same way means the one who has realized Brahman the one who was realized Brahman he has become Brahman itself and what is that Brahman swatma sakshina the Brahman is nothing but knowledge means that special knowledge and that after having that special knowledge of Brahman and what will be there in him Behavior may be different but his knowledge about Brahman is very clear there no no doubt no question so how we will understand that he is a Brahma gyani then it says that it will be completely different because of the knowledge if you go and ask him do you like to take this whole world you'll say no I don't Swami vivekananda's Behavior those who were there and the very old swamij used to say now you are telling Vivekananda Vivekananda you know to live with him he was so difficult but little mistakes you will be scolding so hard tax Master is very difficult now that Swami Vivekananda after doing everything and he was so much popular whole India you can imagine everyone all the national leaders this to come and visit him all those kings at the time they used to come and pay respect to him but he gave up everything after doing all this then he said now my task is done my Guru asked me to do it I have done it that is up to you he made that organization and brahmanandaji became the first president he never became the president and in the beginning only just one or two months acting and then afterwards when it is registered legally brahmananda became the general secretary all that he was completely free and he used to play with the mataru there was a goat he used to play with the goat and then some swans were there and there was a dog and he used to be just like very ordinary person xiaomi Vivekananda there is no at all any desire for worldly things because Guyana that knowledge is this this world is temporary I don't want anything from this world that is always present so this is the way we have to understand thank you friends if you have any question then we will well there are some three online questions first is asking how to restrain our mind from not thinking from the result of our action at our workplace and in our daily life if you do not think about the results we might be expert it's a very practical question so when you are working that is your duty swadharma and you must have to be very careful to perform that but when we are talking about the action of the work that is in you have already done in your past life in your past life you have done something those impression comes so we don't have any control over that so we were discussing even the Brahma gyani even after God realization so they also behave like that because of the past that and we'll continue this in our next class also but for your question I will say be very very careful when you are in the working field because that is your sadharma and you must be very careful and very diligently perfectly attentively performing your own Duty and after the duty when it is over when you are retired don't think about all this forget that that is the idea but now at this moment you should continue very perfectly thank you there is one user his name is asking how can swamiji says [Music] yeah of course we will come to that we couldn't come to that then there is an argument when you are talking about the karma the bad karmas that is already burned otherwise they will not get the brahmagyana if there is the Bad karmas are there bad means selfishness so when you talk about bad it is all selfishness and selfishness is attached with the ego so there is no ego there is no selfishness so no Bad Karma but as I was telling mannerism Sometimes some behavioral things are already there does that like Swami Vivekananda he was very fond of cooking if you say that in the past life he was not having anything but when he became foreign cooking he learned singing he learned boxing he learned all those the thing that that was the impression was there to that we are talking you know even after over here in Chicago and in America used to cook and he'll be cooking the Indian dishes some American followers they will come and they will eat from there oh this is very tasty very tasty so then the swamiji added some chili in that he said okay here it comes and without asking they will be testing from there and you know in we cannot do that we offered the thakur and then only eat we do not touch with the left hand these are all samskaras but here in America they don't bother about left and right they'll be taking and then after licking the finger with that finger again they will take the same the swamiji told how to stop it he put the chili now that man came again oh this is Brahman and he took that and then when he was eating and shouting hey this is the sound of Brahman see because of the chili so how can you say a brahmagani should not do that these are all natural normal things can you please give me some tips to practice that is you know this when we are practicing meditation yoga we are withdrawing the mind they say that we're trying the senses and I cannot close all the five together and I am closing the eyes but the ear is open we are listening oh the smell is coming or the touch or like that so what you can stop you can just withdraw the mind that is the main key how you will do that mind is nothing but the thought so when you are sitting for meditation you think in this way that the God is sitting within your heart great imagination and a very strong imagination the God is sitting on a red collar flower and you are worshiping the God you are lighting the lamp you are showing the incense Stakes just imagination imagination but that had to be you will forget your body you will forget all the surrounding things and that is called the little translation but eating that means we are collecting something and giving it to the mind to eat but now if you stuck the mind and give the mind some other thought then worldly thoughts will stop and that is called pratyahara you can practice that it is very easy I am I am extremely sorry I could not call you in the fixed time you asked me to follow exam preparation here is the question for you am I this Brahman the one sameness the absolute in this country of course of course you are though you are not understanding these or I am not understanding that at this moment but all of us you know all of us not only me but this table but this microphone and each and everything that you see is nothing but the consciousness but why the human being because the Consciousness Consciousness is more manifested in human being but same Consciousness is not manifested in that food or this iron but Consciousness is there you are Consciousness but the Consciousness means we think the life that is within us but beyond that the life that we see within us it is a reflected consciousness but we have to go back to the original Consciousness when the sun is reflecting in a water that is also Sun and the effect of that sun is also there the water becomes warm in I have seen in our country in the villages in the winter time they don't have so much electricity they'll be keeping all the the water pots and all that with full of water and that will be born with the sun then they will bathe with that water that means the effect of the sun is present the effect of the Consciousness is within us we can think we can cognize we can rationally discriminate that is the effect of the consciousness it is not the body it is not the mind it is the Consciousness so we are consciousness thank you thank you foreign um thank you very much is asking what is karma and karma is a Karma means you know that the action that we do and there are three different types of karma one is physically that we are doing that is called karma mentally we are thinking that is also Karma Karma with the words that we are saying you know this is really really very difficult for us we do not understand we think physically we are not doing anything but we are going on telling bad things about others to others so just spoiling the mind of that person and by spoiling the relationship that is also Bad Karma physically we are not doing anything but just telling something wrong about that is very bad and particularly in the in a political level they use this constantly telling lies and making the whole mind of the whole nation in a different way that is also Bad Karma and another Karma the word whatever word you are using that we want must be very careful that sometimes when you use the harsh word that hurt a person and the moment he or she is heart is a Bad Karma but you were inspiring the person with your words it's a good karma so karma is the action and the action in three different types thank you yeah I have a person like I just wanted to expound on that Tails rocks tail how to that people can live in the world and also in the spiritual life see that if you are developed in this way that I am not belonging to this world I am not attached to this but whatever the responsibility is coming I am behaving that way that much and that is also living in the world as householder but at the same time you are a spiritual person like uh you know that the shita's father janaka the janaka was a king and you can understand the responsibility of a king an administrator but at the same time the janaka was a realized soul I have seen many people at least one person I can remember right this moment he was my friend's father he was a lawyer in Calcutta uh in the high court and always busy and we can could never talk to him his personality was such it is very difficult to go near him and I never noticed that he is visiting the temple or anything I thought that he is not a religious person but before his death I heard it from his son my friend and he said my father constantly he when he became sick he told keep the photo of bhagavan sirama Krishna in front of me so that I can see the Lord all the time and one day he asked my mother to go out and all other relatives who came to visit him you know can you please go out give me some five minutes time I like to be alone and when they went out he was sitting a little slanting like that and looking at this ramakrishna only three times he altered they could hear about sudama krishna's ramakrishna's ramakrishna and when they came back he passed away if he was not practicing if he was not a holy person how could he do that though apparently he was a very busy lawyer but inside he was a great devotee of sirama Krishna and in bhagavad-gita it says anyone at the right moment of his death whatever the thought is crossing his mind he will be in that so he thought of ramakrishna see ramakrishna right that moment before death so in living in the world also you can become a holy person a religious realized soul so thank you thank you friends let us say Shanti three times and we conclude oh my repeat you [Music] that's it
