[3. Yoga Vasistha - Doubts of Sri Ramachandra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2R9vj7Sq1pY)

good morning dear devotees friends let us begin the yoga bashishta this is a journey with a torch of knowledge towards the supreme truth and we will begin with this mantra ananta jinmatramurta tranquil tejasa is the brahmana i salute the supreme brahman how is it the supreme brahman as because we cannot explain we take some of the the qualities we can say to narrate that to explain that who is beyond all qualities tranquil beyond the limitations of the direction space time or objects who alone is the embodiment of infinite consciousness and who is to be known only through the proof of one's own experience this is the only way to know the brahman one's own experience and this is very very important not that the scripture is telling so i have to accept not that the someone told me so i have to accept i will accept i will understand i will realize it and then i will accept it so it depends on the individual in the person so we have already started and now today the doubts of sri ramachandra the second part so we were continuing the doubts it is said that one should serve the spiritual guru with the proper questions so we have to serve the guru spiritual guru particularly with the proper questions in bhagavad-gita it says pariprisna then i am asking the question and the guru is giving the reply so that is called pariprisna and by that way i am serving my guru guru becomes happy we have noticed it in almost everything like bhagavad-gita the arjuna he is asking he is expressing his doubts and the krishna is giving the reply in the uddhava gita the last message of sri krishna there also the uddhava is asking questions and sri krishna giving the reply and here we find the same method same process because that is the same tradition of the sanatana dharma the disciple is asking the question and ram is asking the question and we know that sri ramachandra his mind was completely withdrawn from the saints objects and he is asking this question he was a young man of 16 years eager to know the spiritual truth so whatever the doubts were there he wants to clarify and he is asking his gurus who are they his father his father dasharatha dasharatha is explaining him because darsharata was also so these three they were there present friends those who have started the vivek churamani you know in the biblic ceremony himself he is putting the questions from the mouth from on behalf of the student and those are very important questions and that has been explained in the whole vibe what are those seven questions what is bondage ko naam bandha what is that bondage now we always say about the bondage but what is that bondage i am too completely free in america they always say a free country a free citizen everything free no one is going to control you so that is the way now we are talking about the bondage bondage and bondage and you should be careful about that you have to overcome that what is that bondage shankaracharya is asking this question through the mouth of the student how has it come now the bondage is the attachment to the worldly objects now where from this desire to enjoy the worldly objects has come i was a little baby i was not knowing anything how it happens in my mind when my youth it is so difficult to control where from it came so katami where does it continue i saw my seniors the same thing it happened in their life it is happening in our life it is it will be happening in the my juniors also if you look at the movies the same story and just little different the actor actresses and maybe some different languages they're using wording they're using but the same story but you all go and see the same thing and katham where it is does it contain now katambi moksha how to be free from it what is this non-self self and non-self what is the self that which is conscious non-self that is not conscious but we considered that as conscious and that is called non-self parama atma who is the supreme self katan bibi how to discriminate between these two so these are the seven questions that constantly the teacher will be giving the reply i am not going to give this reply because you have to study the vivector harmony and those who have already started the vivek churamuni there's a beautifully the shankaracharya giving the answer so these i mentioned because basically every spiritual aspirant those who are sincere to know the truth to realize the god to realize the atman to realize the self these are the questions and we are really we wonder when the young sri ramachandra is also having the same questions the ramachandra began began the questions with what is happiness why why he asks this question because that is the goal of human every human happiness all actions all efforts that we do at the back of it only one object is there happiness joy that is the goal so he is asking and then he is discriminating he himself i am asking for the happiness the joy the peace sometimes i get it from the the objects of this world but not permanently why because the object from which i am going to get the happiness is temporary and naturally it will be destroyed and i cannot get that joy now i purchased a very good accompanying car and that was the best model at that time after three years i find someone else is driving by my side another best car and all others my friends will say oh my god look at that that is the best one at this point so after three years and four years my car which was the best now is nowhere so obviously there is no end to this it goes on and on and on and in the advertisement world they will put in such a way that if you don't purchase that your life is lost completely so you think now you must have to purchase because that is the only thing it goes on the competition and we are thinking that we are going to get the happiness by acquiring those things it is all temporary astira sri rama chandra only 16 years but look at it after completion of his study then he went out to see the society see the world and aft visiting different places particularly the holy places when he came back just like the lord buddha also happened much afterwards sri rama same thing happened he was also a prince lord buddha he also saw the temporariness and immediately but that is that here the question is why it doesn't happen to everyone and there that makes the difference one who is ready for spiritual realization and others those who are not ready to for the spiritual realization of anubhava you have to have this analyzing capacity discriminative faculty the something which is temporary cannot give me the permanent joy that is final and then why should i go for these temporary things that ramachandra is asking and he said ego is the main cause of suffering suryamachandra himself not that he learned from the guru he analyzed the thing and then they said ego is the cause of suffering control of mind is extremely difficult of all the yields of the worldly life it is desire trisha trishna desire and in hindi they call chaahat and that is that mean so we have to notice how a young man of 16 years old sri ramachandra he is analyzing the thing himself and then tormenting understanding that why i am going to spend my whole life for these things which are all temporary because he knew that you will have to be the king his father wanted him to be the king all others they were eagerly waiting because he was a just person he was very lovable and used to understand people others so they were thinking if he become the king that will be very good but sri ramajandra himself was thinking for what what is this kingdom today it is there and tomorrow it won't be and that is true true now where is that kingdom of sriram chandra's father the sharatha's kingdom nowhere ayodha a place which is only named there are so many controversies are there they present the people some people they are now saying the ramjander was not there because that is also a wrong way of telling sriram chandra was there but some people nowadays are not very happy with ramachandra because a group of people utilizing the popularity of sri ramachandra and the devotion to ramachandra for their political benefit for their other thing that is not the way we should judge see ramchandra stands completely different with some naturally people will try to take the benefit out of that some group is already there but you people should understand what is real and what is unreal these groups who are coming and trying to take the benefit they won't be there but sri ramachandra will be there why because of his ideologies because of his truthfulness because of his unique character and it came after the realization and what he realized he realized the brahman how he realized by analytical way not that somebody told and he accepted through analysis so he was analyzing and here he says trishna the trisha the desire that is of all the yields of the worldly life it is desire alone gives unbearable pain those who are having that desire oh my god they suffer so much can never be happy can never be they are having so many things but still they will be criticizing others because somebody appraised them and they are not at all happy they can't be contended and who suffers by this way the person so obviously one should understand we should understand whatever we need to survive it is okay we should have those but it doesn't mean that we should go on hankering after that friends i am actually using the essence of yoga bashishta compiled by sri ganadananda bharati and translated by sambhit he wrote in sanskrit and sambid published it and gave the english translation also these questions and answers the doubts of sri ramajandra is available in this book so this book is available in our bookstore too so you can if you are interested to read this you can also write to our bookstore and they will supply essence of yoga basis to buy gyanadananda the best among men best among the people they also become worthless person because of the desire they are so good but just for the desire one desire ring no i like to do these because the attachment so many other things they could do because of one desire and attached to that they could not do anything osage people love their physical body they are charmed by its beauty but what is this body now sri ramachandra he was analyzing first the worldly things worldly objects and he was telling those great sages and also his father and he was explaining that this world is completely temporary everything is changing my body is also changing mind is changing and what about this kingdom why you are asking me to become king everything is changing and our goal is to get the happiness the joy the peace the blessed eternal but there is no eternity in this object this is the first argument and he said look at the body people love their body love their physic and they are attracted to each other because of this body but what is there in the body again if you read the viveka ramani the basic book is the biblical ramani why because those who are interested in vedanta particularly in any religion any path that you are following this basic knowledge are necessary and there in the biblic ceremony also shankaracharya very categorically clearly explain what is there in the body and we find sri ramajandra is also mentioning that you are talking about this body attraction for this body because of this body you are asking me to enjoy this world the wealth and property what is this body so the 43 words it says through and through what is there only rakta and maamsa the flesh and blood where is the beauty ramata beauty where is the beauty tell me osage nothing is there so this we have to understand those we have to remember friends we are reading this book and this is the extreme book siddhanta grantha and it talks about the ultimate truth some may be qualified so we will study who are qualified they are but most of other people those who are hearing or studying this book so we are learning this but understand in your own way so here the body means is nothing but the flesh and blood and for these people are doing so heinous so little girls they will be torturing them and killing them so many information comes why muhammad deluded mind they're always thinking about this body and thinking oh this is so beautiful and here those who likes to realize the god they have to understand these basically this body is made of blood and flesh and distinct to be destroyed where is the beauty tell me oh sage sri rama chandra is telling but notice the sages are quiet they are not giving any answer the same way when arjuna was going on giving the the he was telling i should not do this because this is not good sri krishna was quiet but arjuna's despondency and sri ramachandra's doubts are completely different the sri ramachandra here is analyzing the world the objects the bishops and he is correctly analyzing according to the scripture but he has not taken the help of the scripture or the guru he himself analyzed it that is the specialty and he told that you are asking me to be the king but look at this so temporary everything what is the kingdom second he said you like to ask me to enjoy because i am a prince and you are telling that you should enjoy and what shall i going to enjoy this body this is the body observe the human life childhood is full of fear and when a child means either afraid of the father the mother and any senior one each and everyone will come and then scold why you are doing this why why you are going there so like this it goes on controlling the childhood is full of fear youth is full of passions so much of desires these and that nobody knows how they are going to control that old age full of illness and suffering if you go to an old person he will only talk about the medicine and the doctor because that is the main thing they always start think think about what is happening they will be asking oh which doctor you are consulting i am having this doctor etc so old age means only the illness and suffering and the end of human life is death and that is for sure that is certain death is the ultimate so sri ramachandra analyzing this then he is telling mahatma in 56 words he is telling god does not even protect the great people whole world is kala kabalita it is destroyed by the time kaala kabalita kalam is time and kabalita is controlled or destroyed the kala kabalita time will destroy everything if we close our eyes and go back to to our own lives see how the time has changed where we were born where we were growing up who were the people around us where are those uncles and aunties and all those brothers and sisters and friends and relatives and neighbors nowhere around kaala kabalita all are changing times are changing sometimes the news are coming that he has passed away like these and that each and everything but we always think that i am going to survive i am not going to die and that is maya always mahaprabhu those gyanis they will never ever think of that way they are always alert about the temporariness of the life temporariness of the things and that is why they are not at all attached not that they are killing themselves or committing suicides they are leaving enjoying the life but enjoying with a detachment everything they're doing but complete detachment that is the cigarette of life that is the cigarette of karma yoga the how to be happy just become detached and enjoy everything that you like just become detached understanding is should be very clear otherwise detachment is not possible and sri ramachandra he told about the physical body and then he is telling even the gods cannot protect the matamupi the great personalities the rich people they are ready to give millions of dollars to save their body to leave but can they the best of best doctors also cannot help them even those doctors are also dying everywhere everyone maybe the powerful maybe a poor man highly educated uneducated all are caller kabalita if we remember this only bhagavan krishna said the discrimination it becomes strong when we think that everything is so temporary and i am also going to die someday why should i fight why should i do all the nasty things only for some days and where are those kings if you go to the places in india almost everywhere there are all ruins of those huge palaces they are so proud of they will be beating the poor people and they will be asking them to work hard so many people died in china we went and we found hundreds and thousands of people there's to simply kill them without food force them to build these and that and where are those kings now so history always goes on teaching us the temporariness but we don't learn so that is called maya the moment i get some power position money and i forget that i think i am going to be the permanent i am going to rule the whole world i am going to get everything the yoga bashist the sri ramachandra taking us to that condition when the mind is becoming prepared for the highest truth how is the preparation detaching my mind from the worldly objects and what is the bondage trishna the desire and why this desire because of the ego and we have already read sri ramachandra said the ego should be completely crashed bhagavan's rama krishna the modern day saint he is also telling the same thing so these are the points those who like to develop the spiritual life these are the points but mostly we think oh mystical experience when i am going to get the glimpses of god when the god will come how i am going to realize the god and the doubts are also there is there any god you are god yourself and god is nothing but the love love comes from complete tranquility of mind and tranquility of mind come when there is no desire in the hindi couplet they very nicely say ram tahani come if you have the god then you don't have the desire come tani ram but if you have the desire no you cannot realize god so this is very clearly dimension then why should we do we are householders we have so many responsibilities we should do it as suramar krishna again and again in his gospel of he is telling in his gospel of sirama krishna he is telling leave with a completely unattached way like a lady working in a very rich man's house she is looking after the young kids of that rich man and other things and she is going on telling my rama my shama they are my children and this is our property but she knows very well this belongs to the rich man nothing to me my children are in that village and they are waiting for me they don't get so much of food or clothings but she is as because she is working over there earning the salary so that she can maintain the family she is showing and behaving same way and in a song that swami vivekananda first sang to bhagavan sirama krishna moon challenge oh my mind let us go back to the our real abode this world is not ours so we have to go back to our own self and that is the journey of the yoga bashishta sri rama he said the color the time it controls everything even the god cannot save those who are great people everything is controlled by the time omara even the gods have their time limit omara amara means those who live for a long long time it doesn't mean eternal life all the gods and goddesses that we see is for one period called yuga it's a huge long time in the puranas it is there but in the yuga they will be there the god of agni god of bayou god of rain and these all they'll be there but still that limited and what about my that we are all ordinary people the sri ramachandran is telling the people like us we are all ordinary people so um think about us what will happen to us when even the gods and goddess are also having the limited time the ordinary people like me so this is the understanding this is the discrimination this is the bichara and without this bhichara that's why in indian philosophy you will find again and again you have to analyze thing very clearly the great scripture begin with this now let us discuss about this analyze this what this worldly objects worldly things where from it has come and how long it is going to give us the happiness what is the goal of our life so this analyzing analyzing analyzing then ultimately we come to the conclusion nothing of this world can give me eternal peace and eternal peace eternal happiness eternal joy is my goal as bhagavan suramar krishna announced in the beginning of his life the god realization is the goal of every human life and what is this god realization understanding the truth and what is the truth that i am eternal that is the truth but i am crying i am thinking i have become old and i will die what will happen to me i am crying for that why because of the ignorance and how to go back to that knowledge removing the ignorance and how to remove the ignorance by studying the scriptures and listening to the words of the guru so this is the only policy so it comes in this way sri rama chandra is telling even the gods are also dying so what to talk about us to give the emphasis on the temporariness sri ramachandra continued apathy sage mune kimi bonna sanam can you tell me that what is there which is not temporary any moment there may be calamity upper the we the present the people in the whole world we can understand this we planned so many things each and every one planned so many things oh i will go to that country we'll meet you these that visa was ready everything was ready suddenly someone announced oh there is a kobe 19 and because it started in the 2019 and so kovid 19. now we cannot go out now we cannot mix with each other now we cannot talk to each other and even the durga puja is coming we we don't know how to organize the durga puja all people like to come but there are restrictions that is for the good of us the present organ the administrators they told you cannot take the more than 50 people gathering but in the durga puja time more than 500 600 people they come the who these 50 people then so there is a lot everyone everywhere economy is breaking down all the governments everywhere they are confused about the sudden calamity when it came just it came suddenly it came and we were not ready even the powerful country like america they were also not ready they were not knowing what to do and what not to do so this is suddenly you get a letter from a law firm that someone has given you two three millions dollar or maybe one billion what is there you have just gone thinking so you can think about more so suppose you have got instead of million billion okay it may happen you do not know it may happen so this is happening one lady passed away then the law firm sent to two of our centers that she has given you this much money the one center is getting more than 100 000 another at the balance a little more than that so suddenly the sampada is coming and when there is no donation astronomers are all dying so what to do what not to do suddenly some elk comes but shanam temporary you cannot calculate oh this month hundred thousand i have received next year also this month another hundred thousand no you cannot calculate shanam janma shana mr so suddenly there will be birth and suddenly there will be death mune keem evan then sri ramachandra asking those teachers sir can you tell me which is not temporary what is permanent any moment there may be calamity and then kim even a venerable sage my mind is now burning like forest fire then the sri ramachandra is telling his expression is forest fire now in many of the countries the forest are now on fire amazon and in the west coast of america in india also the maharashtra so news are coming that because of the heat and something and that is terrible even when you see the pictures we cannot think of anything else but fear the terrible forest fire same thing is happening within my mind i cannot think of anything else as if i am dying the food the other things are all tasteless so he is telling my mind is now burning this this is the fire see ramtanja's mental condition that is the real condition of every spiritual seekers whoever is trying to realize god should have this type of feeling otherwise it is impossible burning like forest fire again i will refer to the vivek suramani and these also describe how a spiritual seeker's mental condition and beautifully shankaracharya he writes in a very political way duruvara [Music] 36 words beautifully shankara is telling o lord supreme i take refuge to you because i am terrified and i don't know anyone else except you oh lord please save me from death i am burning by this world fire physical and mental torments i am violently shaken by the wings of my past actions the past actions i want to meditate but something happens i cannot i want to pray to god but suddenly something comes to my mind and it drags me over there i want to be good but no why because my past karma is going on tormenting me and the body and the mind so i am now burning my lord please save me that is the mental condition so constantly the scripture says three conditions are essential to attain the atman koshiti kupunisha the first chapter second verse it describes that the brahma the firstborn he was telling to ashwalyan ashwa lion was a great sage he said sadha bhakti dhyana yogath be he i am not quoting the whole verse i am taking the half of it swaddha bhakti dhyana yogat behe so these are the three great qualities one should have and this is meant for the vedantin and these actually those who are trying to follow the path of knowledge the torch of knowledge is this this torch of knowledge is am i having the sardan what is that confidence in the words of the scripture and the guru fast second self-confidence i am going to make it for sure today i am not but someday i will surely control my passions my mind and i am going to be successful great self-confidence swami vivekananda's vedanta is nothing but self-confidence what is the vedanta he goes on telling have confidence confidence confidence and very nicely wrote it later to his brothers in india now i am noticing in america the people are coming from eastern europe haggards their heads are hanging on their chest they don't have any confidence but the american atmosphere is so it is completely free in america there was no kings any time only king was there in great britain they didn't like it so they had a nice tea party boston tea party that means the first the movement against the king so this the america was completely free they always feel like that swamiji is writing american atmosphere inspired him and after a few days the same man goes and shake hand with the president of america and ask him how are you sir so this is self-confidence confidence confidence confidence again and again he's telling that is called saddam though those who are trying to get something achieve something it is not ego self-confidence many can do many may be successful i too can do why not and sometimes some young people go into depression thinking that it won't be impossible for me why look at your life you have lived maybe 25 years 27 years 35 years who were there with you you're alone you become successful now you're educated you're earning money now suddenly something came some relationship and then it broke nowadays it is always happening so then you are killing yourself just going into the depression and taking the pills and thinking that my life is ruined away simply say to yourself i was good and i am going to be good and this four five years whatever the i am going to forget it it came sometimes the bad things happen what is there so this is the way why this scripture why this religion if it is not helping me to live happily so this is called the shraddha i am going to make it for sure and if you have the strength in the mind you will find that the god's help will also come to you that this is called fasti sarda and what is bhakti in the path of knowledge the bhakti and that bhakti is love and sincere effort to know the self it is not the god the another object that i am thinking and going that is the another devotional path hindus they are having four paths raj marg and they are leading to the same goal that is gyana bhakti karma yoga that bhakti is different when these advaitin they say the bhakti it is the devotion the sincerity to realize the self that is called bhakti love and sincere effort to know the self bhakti then dhyana yogat what is the dhyana yoga do you know the vedantin those who are following the path of true knowledge they never meditate why if they think that i am meditating that i will be there who is this i if they think that i am meditating on the self or the god then another object is there so that true vedantin they don't meditate what do they do nidhiddhyasana they go into that depth of merging themselves with the truth i am that consciousness they slowly forget the external world then slowly forget the person the body the mind and then merge into that joy which is known as brahman that brahman is ananda brahman is joy brahman is the sum total of happiness and that's why they say anandiba ibani bhutan from the joy only everything has come so our goal is to go back to joy we are not satisfied at all the human cannot be satisfied it is not his fault it is the characteristics is a cannot be satisfied if you give the wealth after some days he is not satisfied whatever you give after some days they are not satisfied why dissatisfaction is always remain always will remain because ultimate reality is the joy they must have to go back the circle should be completed we have started from our journey started from the ananda from the bliss we should go back to bliss which is known as brahman so and then dhana yoga be he these are the three so one is bhakti dhyana yoga the sages found these three spiritual qualities present in the character of sri ramachandra all these three was there he was so courteous to accept the words the teachings of the guru and also he because he started the scripture in a school so he also having the complete faith in those words of the scriptures the sadha his mind was one pointed to realize the truth bhakti and now the dhyana yoga is not the the moment we say dhana immediately imagine the meditation sitting in a posture closing the eyes no not dhyana it is concentration or to understand the reality of the things all around us all these three qualities he had fully just respect for the guru it was extremely sincere to know the truth and his mind was withdrawn from the worldly objects the following words of sri rama proved that he is telling now about himself the great confidence so this is we don't know about sri ramachandra at the moment we think about ramachandra there's a story that happened he went to the forest and ravana came all the stories but who is real ramachandra this he was brahma-gyani he knew everything so this is the nabhi nandami maranam i am not afraid of death i am not eager to leave whatever happens to me i am ready to accept that i am fully free from any anxiety friends that should be the characteristics of a devotee of a spiritual aspirant never care for anything always ready to accept whatever happens that is the true characteristics now then like a truest parent of the brahma-yana sri rama requested the sages and he said now yata jaana si bhagavan tata mohani brittain 66 verse it says or revered sir how did the wise people at in the state of freedom from sorrow [Music] those dukkha the sorrow it has already gone completely gone what is god realization this there is no suffering in the mind the people they are confused about the god realization always think about the mystical way but this is there is no sorrow in the mind why i have god i have achieved everything so the ramachandra now he is asking teach me that process so that i can overcome my delusion what is that the delusion should be ended what is this moha what is this delusion accepting the worldly things worldly objects including this body and mind as real that is called more that is called that is knee science that is ignorance so this is we have to understand each and everything right from the brahma down to the grasses everything is temporary everything is temporary so that's why he is asking praying to his teacher can you please help me guide me then he is telling if you don't help doesn't matter at all so this is the decision that he's making atari however there is no way to learn nobody likes to teach me clearly then sri rama expressed his ultimate decision nakimchi i am going to be silent because i have already withdrawn my mind from all these objects i am not going to get attraction in on those things i am going to be silent if you can't teach me if there is no way to learn if there is no person who can really guide me then what else remain for me but to die because i am not going to leave this life enjoying these worldly objects we i have already withdrawn from that the things that that i have spat i've already i cannot go to leak that again the sadhu life is like that once the sadhus have left the earth and home the name fame and physical comfort one should not go after that again that's like leaking back your same thing that you have spat over there so that is sri rama chandra and this is the way we find friends that after sri ramachandra we find that lord buddha he says i'm going to die sitting on this seat i will never leave this seat unless and until i realize the truth you are sunni here and now i am sitting on this and if i don't realize i am going to kill myself why because i don't like this worldly life i am not going back to world swami vivekananda when they were silent passed away so the young disciples they were all they are practicing and practicing and doesn't mean that you immediately will have that realization so one day one brother as a guru bhai he said to swamiji we are trying so hard but still that i we cannot realize the god what should we do then swami vivekananda's reply was if we don't get rama shall we go for shamma no once we have decided to realize the god we are going to realize god and if we don't get the realization this time we'll wait for the next life but never ever give our mind to these worldly things because we have already given the top the shama means the worldly things no bhagavan sri ramakrishna in his life also those who have read the biography of sadama krishna in that extreme condition when he was going on praying so long 12 years he was practicing over there on the bank of the ganga and he was going on praying to the mother divine mother mother please reveal thyself to me and in that extreme condition when the mother was not giving the darshan he then took up that sword from the hand of the goddess kali and then threatened the divine mother right this moment if you are not revealing thyself mother i cannot bear the bank of separation from you i am going to cut my head and offer it to your feet i am going to kill myself the world we don't want god we have not realized then what we can do wait for the death only so this what sri rama chandra said and the beautiful way when he said that friends and his sage bashista sorry sage vishwamitra the visiting sage he first responded do you know what he said the vishwamitra said o raghava there is nothing else to be known by you you know everything swayed in the second chapter second verse of the same book that i am referring he said swayeva sukshmaya you have known everything by your own intelligence you are like the suka shukadeva the son the great sage to see sukhadeva is live now he will mention we will listen to that in our next class why we need a guru that is the the sage vishamitra is going to tell us so friends we will stop over here the he will say a person may realize brahman like the sri ramachandra himself like the shuka deva there also they realized the brahman by analyzing but still they needed a guru why to confirm that truth to that you listen from the sage and the next class thank you is there any question the first one is from talking oh that is swami vivekananda he replied this question you know you are asking how this the creation came so ultimately the creation the vedanti will say it is not a creation actually it is a projection and that to it is not permanent we are imagining so let me tell you in this way shankara's guru's guru govinda bhattabha he said there is no creation at all it's very difficult to understand right this moment there's no creation you are thinking so you are that self you are that knowledge you are the truth you are the brahman you are thinking and you are having this that is the this is rishtivada now again if this rishti is there how it has come for the ordinary people we feel hungry we feel thirsty we cannot simply deny that there is no life over here and there is no creation then they said the supreme brahman thought that i should be many because there is only one it is one the why the so many so that supreme brahman thought i am one i like to be maini and then now the question is why he thought nobody can ask the swami vivekananda said hindus are bold enough to say we do not know that is also my answer thank you there are two similar questions he's saying i am asking how to remain in this world do everything but not get attached to anything i have uh i like to hear music but i feel it is materialistic i think it is worldliness what should i do sir should i leave here in music oh no no no not at all see this is like suppose you have gone to visit some place and where there are some beautiful dishes special dishes are there in every place if you go they the local people they have the so you like to taste that very good taste so you go and eat does it mean that you spend your whole life only to eat that no when the time comes you go back and then you forget like that so music is very divine you should not forget it and through the music if you turn towards god who has created this beautiful the rhythms then your mind will go to god the question is the question is alertness am i going to be intoxicated if that is i should be careful am i going to be fully attached attachment means i cannot leave without that you should be careful but otherwise love enjoy and enjoy with detachment it's a practice it's just practice and you'll be surely if you are alert you will be successful the next question is from how do we meditate on krishna in my heart i don't know whether you have taken the initiation or not if you take the initiation the guru teaches this but if you like to if you have not taken initiation then you can just look at the picture of bhagavan sirama krishna and imagine that is slowly slowly sitting within your heart forget about the body forget about the physical heart only imagine that the god is sitting on a beautiful flower and you are worshiping that god that that way you can meditate that will be the easiest way he so practice of detachment is really really difficult very difficult it's in the everywhere that that is the only way we can get the peace joy god realization but the practice the only practice that is the beautiful way sri krishna said in the bhagavad gita what is the or if i take this again and again i am going to be attached i am going to be intoxicated i am going to be bound so that is very good so sometimes i may eat there sometimes i may enjoy that but i am not going to be bound by this this is first thing and then obviously again and again practicing whenever that thought will cross your mind say no i'm not going to do this i am not going to do this like that practice practice practice will make you perfect detachment doesn't mean that you should be the stone-hearted when a person is suffering no i am detached so i am not going to not like that there is a completely different way that was taught to us for many long days they told be compassionate serve them but at the same time tell your mind i am serving the living god not this person and the god which is suffering or i am educating or giving food or medicine clothing but i am not expecting a thank from that person because it's god that i'm serving i'm living with them maybe some bad people maybe they are creating problem for you but just enjoy the god is having those forms as a bad and now teasing me and trying to make me angry i'm not going to be angry you'll be successful and you will ultimately you will enjoy the next question is asking how to remain attached to god in this fearful situation dev journey is a very good question but the only way is repeating the name of god again i will say if you have taken the initiation from a guru the guru gives a name of god just have faith and go on taking the name of god if you have not taken initiation and there is no planning to take then you can just take the name any god you like maybe mahasara devi or sirama krishna or caitanya just go on telling oh god please help me be with me please help me be with me like that if you go on taking that you will get the strength within don't be afraid at all don't be afraid just we were studying date is inevitable someday or other everyone will die even the doctors who are giving the assurance to that the patient oh i am going to save you will die also one day so that is also true so that we have that faith one day will change and death doesn't mean the end again we are going to bond somewhere there is a change only think in this way and you will never be afraid the next question is that is available in youtube that if you go not mine i didn't do that but it is available if you go to the google and you will get the whole meaning of the nirvana to come the good good interest so if you go to google you will find that the next question is a very good question julia that of course the activity is there when you are practicing the meditation but when we say the meditation the ultimate condition of meditation is merging the self that is me one who is practicing meditation with the the god so we are going becoming the one the god is not an object so obviously i am that so when you are trying to meditate suppose you are meditating on lord siva slowly slowly think that you have transformed into the lord shiva you are that shiva don't you are not finding yourself you are finding only the sheba sitting on your place that beautiful or maybe the lord buddha maybe bhagavan's rama krishna so like that way just merge into that and that is the activity the mind will go away again you have to bring the mind again you have to think in that way that is the activity but the meditation ultimately to becoming that on which you are trying to concentrate thank you all questions okay thank you very much so let us say shanti shanti shanti three times and we conclude that's it you
