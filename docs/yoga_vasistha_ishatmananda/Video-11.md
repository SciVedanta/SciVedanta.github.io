[70. Yoga Vasistha - â€œO Rama, Realize Brahman And be Free"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-aiiCvUBQ)

friends let us begin with this mantra I come on I salute the Supreme Brahman the one who is beyond all qualities who is tranquil and beyond all limitations who is the embodiment of infinite Consciousness and can be known only through one's own experience we were reading this wonderful scripture for we started on November 28 oh no we started much earlier last November 2821 and today is November 27 2022 the exactly one year the last year 21 November 28 we were reading this scripture and you will remember this and there we read Brahma Eva nirantharam that exactly what we studied Brahman alone exists through eternity and nothing else so that was the teaching and all through we are going on studying this brahmagyana now what is this Brahman it's called consciousness what is this universe is the Manifest consciousness so this is a very unique way it mentions over like this the accept Consciousness nothing remains exactly one year before that is the statement we studied and that was Brahma EBA Austin Eva means only as the existing nirantharam eternally and what is that Brahman the Consciousness the Consciousness only continuously remaining and nothing else and that consciousness which is manifested is this jagat so this is the whole teaching we are studying this book for last two years and this is the whole teaching the Consciousness only remain and what is this body is this conscious no then in that case how it came that we will discuss afterwards but you say it is only manifested from the consciousness so this Brahma evil why because the manifestation of the Brahman is this jagat jagat means this universe Guru bashishta learned from his Guru the Lord Shiva who taught in three steps and that is very unique way he taught that we lost time we were studying that one is the prashanti Prashant means experience of deep sleep now the question is the consciousness and how to understand this consciousness that we need to experience it and what is the experience of the consciousness when we are awake our body and mind all are acting then we say well it is there but exact Consciousness without the body without the mind we find in deep Sleep condition it is not somebody is telling us something and we are accepting it is from our own experience we are understanding the prashanti and the prashanti the experience of the deep sleep that's called shushupti the students of vedanta they always know that this is the way it goes we have to understand these that when we are awake Consciousness is of course there otherwise no one will accept us this body has no value without the Consciousness whom we sometimes call Prana it is no value and nothing has no value if that is not conscious no being without consciousness and that consciousness only that Consciousness remain without the body without the mind is in deep Sleep it is every day everyone experiencing so it says the prashanti the Lord Shiva was teaching that to the bashishtha the first tip is the prashanti now you experience the prashanti that means the consciousness then comes the turia that says treaty condition the third condition experiencing not only subsupti turia condition in Sanskrit turiya means is the fourth stage the turia of the fourth stage is the pure Consciousness and where no activity remains now the Lord Shiva is teaching another stay farther and it says in Sanskrit is the highest stage of Consciousness and otita beyond that how it is possible to reach over there only through a large consciousness constantly remembering that this world what we see all around us is nothing but illusory very the guru bashishta he after learning it from the Lord Shiva how he failed and how he practiced that he will share with his disciples SRI ramachandra the Brahman has no beginning and no end it is eternal and the last time we we were studying about this and we were asking this question what is Brahman it is the consciousness and what is Liberation clear knowledge about the temporaryness of this world and not getting attached to this what is Brahman Consciousness this is first thing second it comes the bondage because again and again we are taking birth in this world why because we are attached to this world we are not denying the world we are only mentioning the problem that we are attached to this world and why we are attached because of our ego what is this ego it is very difficult to explain but we all experience that and because this I you we all these words that we are uttering constantly because of that ego so we have from there we have to start our journey I am an individual individual self I am world but myself I and this world are temporary manifestation like the baubles on the water when the bubbles are so many different type of bubbles are there sometimes small medium size big size bubbles all over the water where from the bubbles have come from the water where from the jivas have come from the Brahman so we are the same we are also Consciousness but we are separate from that Consciousness this is the problem studying the scripture means understanding this truth and then solving this problem then this is an statement of fact Brahma Satya Brahman is true and where when the jagat has come it has also come from the Brahman because there is nothing else so that is also another Viewpoint another way to understand this jagat is also Satya satta means to whom one who is looking at this diversity understanding this diversity accepting this diversity when we are accepting this diversity this jagat then it is Satya to me it is there I cannot deny it but then afterwards when I come like the electricians electrical engineers for us different type of lights are there for the electrician it is only the electricity so where from it is coming and what type of electricity AC or DC and all that different type of things they all know and they will be looking at it oh this is not working because of this and that for us it is all different but for them it is only one manifesting in different way the same way the Brahma gyani they when they look at us they see they all are the same but at the same time they know at this moment they are different so this is vigyanadhrishti we studied that and then today we are studying a very deep and ultimate knowledge of this concluding knowledge of the scripture the Brahman has no beginning and no end it is eternal now the problem is when we were studying the upanishad they are the young boy he is asking the same question he's asking please tell me about give me the knowledge about the Brahman the consciousness even after death is there anything the king of death he said yes your Consciousness is there it remains there then tell me what is that when he was giving the description of the Brahman how he will give the description of the Brahman so he was using a word Brahma why because we doubt that we cannot conceive so this omkara that we see it says this omkara is the manifestation of the Brahman in what form manifestation of the Brahman in word form shabda Brahma so the Brahman is the Consciousness but if we say Consciousness it is difficult to understand to for for that they give us something to hold on and that is the first day om that is that is the Brahman that the consciousness but the jagat that we see this universe that we see has beginning but it has aimed too the beginning and end anything that has a beginning surely is going to have an end but Brahman has no beginning and therefore no ain't this is the difference at this moment we may not understand what is this Consciousness but we are aware about the consciousness as because we are sufficiently grown up people and we know what is this Consciousness but we cannot explain it but we can feel it that is sufficient now holding that truth to without the Consciousness this body has no value this universe has no value we start the journey and that is called The Path of Knowledge Journey To The Path of Knowledge and there they won't give you anything to hold in the path of devotion there is God there's goddess and there are many other options but in The Path of Knowledge there is nothing so the only thing they gave only idea the omiti Brahma it's an omkara so go on only omkara that only that sound the way that we have written it is the same Sanskrit in Bengali in Indian language they write in that way or in English it will they will write o and m o and there is that is that the Brahman no is only to reach to the Brahman it is only first step to hold on without the name without the form we cannot understand so this omkar and this is a beautiful explanation has been given by shami mukyananda a very small book he was our teacher in the training center he wrote explain what is this Brahman that is comes to photo then the bach krishna's all these descriptions are there this Brahman is the OM God the omkara has a meaning what is that meaning it is a spota omkara is known as a spota s p o t a sport and what is this quota as a meaning any word has a meaning and that meaning is the manifestation of that particular body now we are going into an another way of understanding if a word has no meaning it is no word even little later has no meaning it is no later so what is that meaning omkara meaning is Brahman so omkara equal to Brahman and that equal to that meaning is known as photo shankaracharya says it is walk and then Etc so this again and again different way they are trying to take us to the ultimate that consciousness now this question before this srishti before this creation where this creation was this moment we said Brahman is the only reality only reality and except Brahman there was nothing again in this practical world we know that I am here my family is there the world is there all everything is all around they are also there then how we will explain it where from it came this hour it says in this way where the jagat was and beautifully uh the guru vashishta is mentioning it was in brahmana then he gives an example as a statue which has not yet been carved from the wooden pillar remain in the pillar foreign means a type of tree a very hard tree from there someone is grieving from that statue so where was the statue it is in the dude but when you go and see that wood there is no statue that means unmanifested statue is there in that wood and it needs someone to only grieve it that's all is likewise the universe remain in the Brahman before creation this universe this creation and always in the Brahman but unmanifested that they will be giving again and again two or three different examples to make us understand Brahman only remained the philosophers are confused to answer this question the good is God that is okay but what about bad where from the devil came who created devil is it from the same God now the philosophers they are some of them they will say oh no no God cannot create devil the goal is always good and where from the devil came ah devil came like that so you cannot say like you have to give the answer they will also came from the same source that is why the in Hinduism it is very clearly they mentioned the out of Consciousness everything is coming out and in the you have seen almost everywhere in all the Hindu gods and goddesses you will find the God is vanquishing or punishing a devil a devilish person where from it came from the same source good and bad are always coming from the same source and what is bad same power but misunderstood Sometimes some people who are hacking the hackers nowadays they are also type of Thieves were very high standard thieves so these hackers the computer the hacking they are very intelligent but they are utilizing their knowledge that intelligency for doing something wrong unlawfully without taking the permission of the owner as a thief is coming and stealing the same way they are doing but they are very knowledgeable people hackers are more smart than the engineers software Engineers sometimes so that is the way if we seek the same Power is coming the power is coming from the same Source it is the Brahman now how you use that power if you are using the power for wrong in a wrong way then you are an Ashura you are a devil you're a bad person only using that same power in a bad way what is the bad way now again when we are thinking this universe this world the manifested Brahman as true and then we try to try to grab it I must get everything if you go and ask privately any of the world leader said do you like to rule the whole world or is it possible give me some idea how to all they want to rule the whole world but as because it is not possible this moment so they think okay so they will be meeting in one place having the cup of tea shaking hands and taking photographs together don't think they're friends any opportunity they will take out all their so this is the condition why because they are thinking this world is permanent again you go to another person very recently if you go to bhagavan sidama Krishna or to Raman maharshi or many of the monks if you go and tell I like to give you the whole property and the position do you like to take it no I am not interested you better go somewhere else exactly this happened in a conversation between the great Alexander and the Hmong so Alexander wanted to offer the whole thing to the Monk and the monk said I am very happy over here I don't need this word so why two different approaches different approaches to the same world the monkeys also surviving he's also eating he has some small cottage somewhere not that he is just dying no he is alive only he is not taking these worlds so seriously that much so this is the to where from this world came it came from the same Brahman but it is not as permanent as Brahman why because the imagination it says [Music] therefore the Brahman is not without Universe this is the 10th chapter 32 words of the this yoga pashishta Sara I will read this whole the sloka again as an image is there in a wood an anutkin it has not been engraved likewise the universe remain in Brahman before creation question was where this universe was before the creation so they are not denying the where from this universe came oh we don't know not like that it is from the same source from the Brahman only therefore Brahman is not without Universe now when the Sundown the word were used over here then a group of Buddhists they utilize this particular word shunnam means nil there is nothing and the madameika Buddhist they say everything is means the void so it's called void Theory there are so many theories people constantly they're thinking and coming out with some idea is a void Theory what is the void there was nothing when you see there was nothing immediately the counter question something cannot come out of nothing is coming out of nothing how it is possible something must be there now you see a shadow and when you go and beat on the shadow you say oh it is nothing it is void nothing no there is something so the shadow has come on that so a tree or if bird the flying sometimes we see when we're traveling in a eurocraft you can see the same with that reflection on on the someone at different places because the sun is on the top so the shadow is falling and the shadow and the craft is going together but if you see that shadow and say oh that is the airplane wrong but if you deny that that there is nothing then where from the shadow came the boys cannot be accepted on that basis cannot be accepted so philosophy is a very intricate it's not so constantly they go on analyzing the truth it's just like science sometimes we understand I feel that oh religion means some emotion some conception that's all it is nothing like that is a very scientific way step by step it goes and here it is telling me this the word shunna depict the idea of unmanifested brahmana when it says unmanifested where was this world it was in the Brahman but we can't see that because it is it is unmanifested that when a child is playing over here maybe someone who can study the mind or the future we look and say oh he's a great doctor to be in future he'll be a doctor now where is the doctor in that child unmanifested so that is the way each and every soul everything has something unmanifested we do not know when a very ordinary person suddenly become a great sage like bhagwan's ramakrishna's disciple he was a servant in somebody's house when he was carrying something as some with the vegetables for the bhagavan sirama Krishna he came from Calcutta to dakshinesha to give that because his owner is a master asked him to do that the SRI ramakrishna looked at that boy and he was impressed to see the Purity in him it is not manifested but the sirama Krishna the Great the artist he immediately realized that the beautiful a human being can be made out of this person then he said to his disciple who's saying that gift so it is okay but can you please give this boy to me and that rich man thought it's okay he will be serving this ramakrishna I will pay for his salary and all that serve you see ramakrishna kept him with him and started slowly giving the many idea of manifestation if you read the biography of advutananda is really unique advuta means unique and really unique completely uneducated persons himself said to teach him the alphabets hurt the vein the fast alphabet he wanted to teach that is awe but as because he was born in Bihar they can't speak or pronounce ah so it is ah when synonym became very angry the second letter is ah if you start with the ah then when you learn oh so anyway you need not to do anything so they are the all these education stopped so that is the fund they always say they Master himself never attended any school and he wanted to teach the student anyway so this person slowly became why because the guru he knew it so he gave the ship and then he looked to the people the rishis after realization looked at the world and seeing the human being is he gave that wonderful call srinathi Amrita listen to me be she in this universe in this world to whom he was addressing human being Amrita shaputra you are the descendants of The Eternity Amrita means eternity you're the descendants of The Eternity and you are so much afraid of death afraid of changes he said then this wonderful knowledge they were giving and if we can understand that properly and slowly slowly manifest it this is shunnam at this moment it is nothing is there but it is there so these two types of words again and again they essay it is nothing there but it is there we will come to that they are telling in that tree there is no image but the image is there so we have to understand what does it mean that image is there if you can truly carb it then only it will come out so it says that here the Sunnah to introduce Brahman the scripture always mention the other words also what is Brahman so we have to have some words some names then only we can conceive they said it is pure it is what is the what is Purity again it is degenerated the meaning degenerated what is should the you are fasting and wearing the washed clothes and after bathing and putting some of the mugs as the Hindus they think are the the Christians they will also think the bathing in the Jordan I was seeing the the picture of the Japanese it's not very weak and it is not very clean water too but anyway they believe that is very and when you go to the ganga oh ganga we take the bath and we think we are pure one type of psychological mental condition but what is purity Purity means no attachment for these worldly things no attachment for these worldly things that is purity who is the Brahman why the Brahman he knows I am only throwing out an imagination that is this Jagger why should I be attracted to jagat I know what is this so this is sudden and stainless it is puta again Puta means stainless and now AMD shunda why Sunnah because it is not manifested it is Shanta calm why can't because there is no desire when there is a desire then only we are all the time thinking oh this is not happened that is not so that way we always think and we are agitated the Shanta the calmness comes only when there is no desire and eternal it is it never changes it is worthless Aja the birthless if that is there is a birth there is surely there is a depth anything that has a beginning that is an end so when the child is born in a family they are so happy but we don't like to remember a date is also fixed somewhere sometime so that is the truth but the Brahman is Aja Independence swatantra not that somebody is guiding Etc it is completely independent and it always remained in his own Glory as a beautiful word in Sanskrit they are mentioning in his own Glory it leaves the sometimes our glory is my family because sometimes the people who say oh he belongs to such and such family they are so rich people they don't discuss about that particular person they talk about their family as because he is from that family they will give all respect it is my own grandeur I have manifested in such a way I don't so that is why the sannyasins the neighbor disclose they like to disclose about their family oh his father was rich and naturally all this respect no SRI mahimni the beautiful word it has mentioned and he is reflecting because Glory because he is the student of so and so such and such University no SRI mahimni this is the word the used is completely different he is not having any reflection or any support anywhere but is a great Granger so that is this Brahman is a SRI mahimni it remains in his own Glory it is not reflected or getting support from anything the Brahman has two aspects unmanifested or Sunnah and manifested jagat the both are the Brahman now the question is where was the jagat the universe before it came into existence the answer it was in unmanifested now the question Brahman is real it is the statement of fact then the jagat which has also come out of it is it also real Eternal unchanging this is a this is called philosophical question when they have the debate so these are the things these are type of questions they always ask the shankaracharya he re-established Hinduism how not by beating killing arsening and all that uh the Buddhist no he went and challenged him the challenge to come you like to explain philosophically and I will counter that and I will try to explain philosophically the vedanta the Hinduism you have to counter that and that world in India it was so liberal all Buddhists they will come unfortunately we have lost that patience and we have become very impatient you know why because we are insecure so we don't have the confidence on our thing a person who is strong doesn't bother elephant it goes in the jungle never bothered about some tigers or elephant or other elephants and other things ah the tremendous power in the Mahabharata it says other brothers they were afraid to go inside the jungle alone but Bheem used to go because we knew even the snake poison cannot kill you were already took some of the uh the anti-shots like that so he was not afraid of the snakes even the elephant also was nothing for him he was so poor so one who is powerful is fearless and he will never denounce others also so this when we understand when we are denouncing we are afraid we don't like to talk we don't like to see it that means you are weak because of the weakness you like to protect no no no no no like this you are saying why this weakness if you are confident oh this is nothing to either like to come and talk also let them talk no matter no problem Swami Vivekananda when he was very sick the one lady from America went some people from India they requested hard and paid all the passage money and two car over there in Calcutta to give lecture against Vivekananda you know always the world is like this and the Vivekananda gave everything positive and so many but they became jealous why he should be so famous so obviously they started but how they will know what has happened in America so they came to know about this lady and this lady knew Swami Vivekananda she took initiation from vivekan and then afterwards some craziness came she started complaining and they came to know about it and they took her over there swamiji when he came to know about that this lady is going to give talk against Vivekananda and Vivekananda he sent his brother disciple saradhananda ji oh he is my child he's my daughter she she is my child she has come all the way from America she doesn't know the weather over here book a good room in a good hotel and be always there after her lecture you must take her to that hotel and see that she is comfortable look at it this is called badappan in the Hindi they say the badappan the broad-mindedness nothing comes you like to tell against me no problem because I know who am I but the weak person will always talking about me is he said this is he said that with a weak one so here it says then no you should not be weak the Brahman that has come is the Eternal and the jagat this universe this manifestation out of brahmana of course but it has a beginning so it is not eternal in reply Guru boshish to say to Rama that this we should read this is a wonderfully bashish to giving the answer is this world which has come out of manifested out of Brahman the Brahman which is eternal is the world is also Eternal in reply the guru bashishta said O Rama the unreal Jiva the individual selves perceives the unreal world on account of unreal influence of the unreality this is the vashista everything is unreal the unreal that everything is unreal going on as a little baby girl she's playing with the dolls and she is thinking a doll is crying why because she's it is a hungry and then she is preparing the food and then offering the food and then after feeding the that small little doll because now you are all right go to bed and she will put her in the bed everything is unreal but but the baby is thinking it is all real then she will come and tell her mother now my that child now it is sleeping don't make any sound from other will say okay so everything is unreal every day we observe that over here so the guru vashish stays telling O Rama the unreal Jiva this Jiva the being that is also unreal why unreal because it is going to die then individual self perceives the unreal World why this is unreal because it is also changing on account of the unreal influence of the unreality the DC is the whole this is called The Path of Knowledge brings all these days we were traveling along with the SRI ramachandra and Guru vashishta holding the torch of knowledge Through The Path of Knowledge what is this knowledge this is this world apparently so beautiful the wonderful relations but it is in reality not true that is the reason the true spiritual Seekers Guru Bashi stays telling this yogis are very Vigilant not to get attached to the universe what is this universe name and form the attitude of the possessingness possessiveness is the samsahara the moment I say this is mine this is mine this is mine that is called samsara and now we have to analyze that those who are trying to follow The Path of Knowledge well listening to the beautiful talk given by some great Scholars and those who know the language and they will be putting it in a beautiful way that is okay when you listen if someone came and told I am the follower of Raman Martian the Great wonderful how do you follow him not The Path of Knowledge what is this Path of Knowledge denying everything of this world can you do that no can you deny your job can you deny your family can you deny this you cannot so don't try that path there is a completely different so that is the knowledge that you are having it is okay but follow the path of this so that a time will come when you will reach to that condition and you can say I don't belong to this world that is The Path of Knowledge never taught this to his other disciples except Vivekananda because they had that capacity so what is that capacity knowing that this is not real he was behaving as the real you know sometimes some people said can you please talk to the children and giving some spiritual knowledge to them I tried once or twice here but then I understood that is not my cup of tea I won't be able to because yes they're looking this side that side talking they're the what I will so I lose patience to talk to this children it is not possible I tried different stories that also didn't work but some people they are so good to talk to those children and children also like them they will also follow them that is their capacity Vivekananda had that capacity he knew this world is nothing but at the same time he was working so hard to develop this world you must have the faith you must have the confidence you must do this you must do that he was going on telling but at the very end of his life if you have raised the bankruptcy of Swami Vivekananda he said Let the dead bury their dead this is chocolate all this world that we see is nothing these are all dead thing let them do all the whatever they want Prabhu I want to go back to my own Abode let me go back so this is the very truth but hardest part so what we should do in the bhagavata they said and another great personality the Shiva panta is that how we should realize the truth when O Rama you will be in distress when great sorrow falls on you you must carefully inquire into the nature of the truth that is this jagat and his false appearance and you will be free from suffering somebody is criticizing you and broken down somewhere something unsuccessful I've broken down what is there for everything if you are doing like that so I was observing one movie the little girl from that that's called previously this to call the raid Indians they were new and so now the Americans the Native Americans a little girl she was not very happy with the modern thing and she was constantly thinking about her own tradition and she was she went inside the jungle and then sleeping under the tree in their old fashion she saw in that dream at the grandmother came and she was telling why you are constantly crying because her mother passed away the father was a drunkard person not looking taking care of the child so she was not very happy she wanted to go back and cry for the mother to come mother who passed away now she saw in Her Dream the a grand lady she came and told hey why you are crying all the time Mommy Mommy Mommy why bro you stand on your own feet and he was deny this this is the truth that somebody will die but doesn't mean that she or he has to come back and to support you you have to support yourself and that is vedanta then I was observing that movie and I was feeling so how it changes and you will be free from the suffering so this is the ultimate knowledge that we get from this great scripture yoga vashista this world is completely temporary around you people are also temporary things are also temporary all this great appreciation from the society are not also temporary so why should I suffer I should not seeing something as a shadow shall I suffer no this world does not belong to you and you do not belong to this world this is the ultimate the teaching of the guru to his disciple SRI Rama this world does not belong to you and you do not belong to this world this is the only way to be free from grief but at the same time SRI ramachandra he was performing his own Duty when his wife was abducted by ravana he didn't never say though this world is temporary one illusory I heard it from my Guru so I am not doing good do anything no he took up the bow and arrow and said I must go and kill that villain and I must rescue my wife that is the I must do that then he was planning because he alone he cannot go so he was planning and he got his support from the hanumana and all that hanumana Clan and then all of them the veined they fought and they won he came back everything he did and not only that he ruled the country also when the people were criticizing about the srita because he was trying to establish a norm some people they were telling how is it he is not caring about his own wife she was there with the ravana what about that he was okay shita should go and purify herself that also she he accepted everything he did as a king as a husband as a brother all the duties he mentioned but he knew his world is nothing this world is nothing and that is called the unique way the shibapantha that is the best way ramakrishna mission we are the monks and we always take care of how much money is there in the bank I almost every day I am asking why because I have to maintain this asthma I have to pay this electricity bill and these there's so much of expenses so I must get that there is nothing other sources by donation so how to get the donation these that so much we are going on doing and then this type of work as a ministerial work giving the talk and meeting the people encouraging the people and asking them requesting them to proceed through the path of spirituality the morality why are you doing at the same time I know after reading this book that this world is purely temporary so this is called shibapanta knowing this world is temporary I am not attached to this but as long as I am here I must do my duty perform my duty never get attached to this O Rama realize Brahman and be free from all suffering what is this Brahman this truth that there is nothing but consciousness but the wall that we see it is also manifested Consciousness but temporary so I should not get attached to these O Rama never forget that you are pure Consciousness it is not drama he's telling us that you may remember that we started reading and discussing this siddhanta today we are concluding this is called siddhanta what is the siddhant decisive it gives the decision it's not that you can think do these and you can do that no option this is the decision we started in June 9 2020. and this is 2022 we are concluding in November the original yoga sister was having 3200 verses then Pandit abhinanda of the 9th century Saint condensed it to 600 verses from 3200 to 600. then again another person we don't know who he made only chose the philosophical verses and made it 223 verses and that is known as this yoga system is the gist and it has 10 chapters and the last verse that we are going to read and conclude and that is Maharishi balmiki when conversing with the rajarshi aristanaimi he talked about this the balmiki muni and he is conversing with that's called Maharishi and rajarshi rajasi means he's a Rishi but at the same time he is performing as an administrator the rajarshi Arista Nami and he talked about this story today November 27 2023 we shall conclude and studying this scripture by understanding that Brahman is the basis of everything this manifested universe and also the unmanifested universe the verse number 34 of the Teen chapter it is the last verse it says foreign calm there is no way but you cannot say there is no way the wave is already there any time the wave may come giving that example it says the Brahman went unmanifested you cannot say there is no universe the universe is there jagat that Universe when manifest from Brahman jagat that Universe went unmanifest that is Brahman Consciousness so it is there now the last stage it says what is practical as we were saying the Rama knew all this even then he took up the arms to fight with the ravana this if we don't do like that then the world the whole world will break down and all this then when the Arjuna was thinking shall I fight or not when the judicial was crying after the fight oh so many people have killed in the war only for this plot of land to rule then the Lord Krishna he mentioned no you have done your duty but don't cry in reality they were not there in reality paramarthika but they were there but they were all temporary and you must do the duty so what is the Dharma performing one's own Duty according to the condition the babarika condition the phenomenal State the universe is perceived in Brahman and in the philosophical State paramarthika condition Universe does not exist in brahmana so this we have to understand because We are following the path of bhagavan Si ramakrishna see ramakrishna said why you can't see God when with open eyes you are trying to see God by closing your eyes in meditation come to see God with open eyes and when you see God with open eyes then that is also the Brahman but at the same time he say if I knew this world is permanent I would have covered my birthplace with gold these two we have to keep in mind and then we have to proceed and that is called the path of Ghana this world is purely temporary but as long as I am leaving I have to live according to my status my condition my duties my responsibilities but never ever get at why should I not because this is temporary that is the way we should understand thank you friends so fresh is asking do we do we need a disease-free body to practice meditation can there be any harm in meditation if the body has illness you know one of our senior swamiji asked say that the disease is good for those who are trying to practice spirituality because if your body is very strong and free and all that many different type of desires will come and will be busy with those but when you have a disease you cannot go out that is the beautiful time we should use to meditate to pray and to practice spirituality and there is nothing wrong if you have a disease in the body so you can always meditate what is the meditation remembering God and forgetting this world that is meditation meditation doesn't mean that you have to close your one nose and taking the 10 times your all those things are external only meditation means remembering the truth that is reality that is God and forgetting about this world you can always practice meditation and the prayer and the Puja while you are physically not fit thank you what is it is asking what advice should one be given if they want to meditate on Brahman what visuals can they focus to perceive the formulas see Arijit I will say that it is omkara usually if you have not taken the initiation then your path is the gyana then they always consider in this way they don't meditate of course but they always consider the omkara as the manifestation of the Brahman so you can try to meditate on the omkara the omkara as a sound that is rolling upward and then coming out and that is the beginning of the whole creation so if you are thinking in that way and meditating and constantly going on remembering that you are the consciousness and you are not the body you are not the mind you are the Consciousness this world that we see all around is nothing but the imagination that is the way the the followers of The Path of Knowledge they go you can practice in that way is asking why do Saints and yogis enter samadhi and leave their body at a very early age oh not all not all that they leave at early age of course it happened in the life of shankaracharya Swami Vivekananda and some a few but not an early age you know that what happened when you become disgusted with this world your mind goes back again and again and obviously you lose interest in the keeping the body and all that the that is the way it it happens to the yogis that they lose interest in these manifested World knowing this is completely untrue the child the who was playing with the doll as I gave the example was a and when the child grew up and become a lady then if you give the same Troy box to Heart hey you can you can play that she will be very disgusted and I don't and I I don't play anything anymore with that so obviously it is the knowledge those who are thinking this world verily the real they like to grab that is called samsara britti I like money I like name I like Fame I like Beauty I like these that all they're trying to grab but when exactly opposite your mind what will happen to you so the yogis when they get the opportunity they leave the body and go away thank you friends do you have any question I promises means unmanifested so when he said probably this is my part that he was an enlightened soul and when he said shunya probably he meant unmanifested but later on people or philosophers they thought the way they go another term Sometimes some people and it is the those who are truly realized Souls whatever they say it almost be true because they have already visited that they have realized that they cannot say anything wrong but afterwards the people when they try to explain that they sometimes make the mistake that is the problem it comes with this great the spiritual their our religious uh Traditions sometimes these explanations it comes but there's nothing wrong some people are thinking in that way that is the philosophy but our Sunnah means this also we use the wordnam in the vedanta means unmanifested okay then Nilesh is asking please the book is already there published by the udh bodhan it is so
