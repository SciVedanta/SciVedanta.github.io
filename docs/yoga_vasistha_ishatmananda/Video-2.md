[2. Yoga Vasistha - Doubts Of Sri Ramachandra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mCFL0_876cw)

namaskar good morning dear devotees friends today the sunday our discourse will be on the yoga bashishta yoga bashista is a like a walking on the razer's age there's a gyana but before that always there will be some questions there will be some despondency there's some doubts then only the knowledge that comes out of sheila as it is said in the bhagavad-gita you have to serve the teacher with your spiritual questions then only the best knowledge it will come up so let us begin [Music] see i salute the supreme brahman who is beyond all qualities tranquil beyond the limitations of the ten directions [Music] space time or objects who alone is the embodiment of the infinite and consciousness and who is to be known only through the proof of one's own experience somebody comes and says even the guru comes and says that you are brahman it is not going to help the person should realize that i am brahman the direct knowledge and that is exactly what it says over here we started this studying and from the last sunday that was the sixth and today we'll be reading about the doubts of sri ramachandra after finishing the study rama and his brothers came back and naturally as the young people even today they do after the exam is over the school is over they like to go out for some touring rama and his brothers also requested his father king the sharatha and the mothers that we like to go out so they arranged and they went out mainly to the holy places and this kingdom was koshala and their capital was ayodha it is said it is in the ramayana it described the koshala the king dashiratha was actually ruling drabida that is andhra sindhu punjab sobhi the saurashtra gujarat and beyond dakshinapatha southern indian states banga bengal anga orisha and magadha bihar kashi that means uttar pradesh this is a huge part almost the whole india we can say and the capital was the ayodhya in one of the books we find the ajada was surrounded by parikha parika means a channel full of water and there'll be alligators or the crocodiles the people cannot easily cross that and not only that again there was a after crossing that if you reach then there is a huge wall brick wall and strong stone and brick wall and that is guarded by so many soldiers and they were having also one type of bow and that was automatic almost the moment someone is coming it will go on throwing the shooting the arrows so are you one cannot conquer through war that is called ayodhya so from there they went out they traveled and they came back and they were happy dashratha just to give an idea because this ramachandra they are the prince of that so this ramachandra father himself was a maharishi and also rajarshi he was not only a very courageous and heroic person and very good administrator at the same time he was like the rishis according to their experiences and knowledge is called maharishi rishim is a man of knowledge spiritual knowledge and many other knowledges and he was maharishi of that also rajarshi like the janaka rajarshi raja and rishi the qualities of a king and the qualities of a monk are the rishi it was both in the character the sharatha was having the eight ministers and the chief of that was sumantra his great friend dasharatha was having three wives and very famous queens this is kaushallah they were almost the the same time they were born but rama was the senior most and very very interestingly rama sumitra's two sons twin son so they one of the twin that is the lakshmana he was like a shadow to ramachandra the other one shatra he liked bharata so four brothers there's a two teams we can say bharatan shatrukna rama lakshmana this is the background now the king the sharatha came to know that the rama's behavior has completely changed after his pilgrimage in the meantime rishi vishwamitra arrived and requested the king to send his son sri rama to punish karadusana the two demonic persons who were disturbing spiritual practices i practice religious discipline for this fulfillment you should give me your son putra made the dartm or you should give your the son the noble-minded drama the rama was by he was only 15-16 by that all country they knew paul people they knew that rama is a noble-minded person so noble rama we want the rama famous for his valor daksham ramam mahatma nam to destroy the demons rakshasanam bini grahi who are causing obstructions to my spiritual practices mama bigna karanam so that was the the sixth verse it says the this way and this bashishta he was also very famous uh so he came rajadashiratu was happy and he was little you know he used to love ramachandra so much naturally when he came to know the rama is not behaving as he used to so what happened when he came back from the school from the guru kula he was all right what happened after so he was thinking has he fallen in love with some lady has something happened maybe the mothers have said something so naturally the father was very much worried for his beloved son and in the meantime when this rishi came so king out of great emotion told oh you have come i am so grateful and so happy and you must have come to meet me with some desire with some wish think that it is fulfilled that was the when he said that that was the defect that he did that he promised not knowing what he's going to ask and this was the prayer and he said and who is that rama so obviously never expected such a request in the meantime rama's attendant informed after his pilgrimage after came back from the pilgrimage ramu has become silent and alone holding everything unreal i don't know it is not in written in the book but we can gaze the father's heart immediately the sharatha perhaps thought this is a very good excuse to say sorry to vishamitra so his mind he is behaving in this way rather you take some of the soldiers and all our commanders are there and if necessary i myself can go he was talking like that but vishwamitra knew the minds he knew the purpose of his visiting and asking rama to accompany him everything he knew so he says is that is it so so bring him here in the court quickly quickly anaya bring atra here in this court evan caita mahaprabhu they forgot who is rama but the rishi knew who is rama he was the lord vishnu vishnu in the human form so obviously the rishis they realized and that's why he is telling maha pragyam and again mahatma he is a broad-minded as a ma pragya and his intellect that surprises all other intellects he knows so please bring him then he said this delusion of rama is neither due to calamities nor due to passion don't think there's something wrong bad has happened to him and he is withdrawing himself not like that and no passion that there is a desire or something nothing like that this is the rishi as because they could read the mind so they say like that is it says in the 21 verse it is because of wisdom is manifesting so because of the discrimination the rishi immediately understood why rama is withdrawing sometimes some people when they fail to achieve something they usually they withdraw from the society they like to be all alone and naturally we think oh that is the sign of something bad that has happened to him all people they were thinking in that line but the rishi vishwamitra he told no isha muharram this delusion not because of any fear or any passion nothing like that why it's because the bible and is arising in his mind he is now 16 years and he is now discriminating he is now understanding things so naturally viveka and bhairav sometimes the parents they wonder why their children suddenly changed because of the past karmapala when you see a little kid and the parents are so happy swamiji he's so devoted always goes and sings kandana and also whenever i am doing puja she's sitting by my side i will wait wait wait till 16 and then after that if he or she is continuing the same then it is okay because after the 16 they say 18 in the modern time their originality or what is the originality the past impressions that start manifesting then the parents can't understand their children he was like this she was like this why it is changing many parents they'll be asking and and they wonder so this is the very clear the rama's mind was also changing because he was the god himself so naturally these bondages in this world is not for him so he was expressing that friends afterwards those who know the ramayana we know how obedient the rama was and he not only followed the vishamitra fought for him and he obeyed his parents the father and also married and everything in his life but the beginning of his life this is important he knew everything then entered into the samsara why we'll come to know about that because for him this world and the spiritual world are the same and this is called [Music] the knowledge of the oneness there is no two those who have read the biography or the gospel of sirama krishna you must be remembering that word of krishna very famous word says he said tying the knowledge of the vedanta of the adventure and then only you go wherever you like this is that when bhagavan sirama krishna mentioned this is the displayed in the life of sri ramachandra the dispassion that is rising hearing the call of the king his father sri rama came and as per the tradition showed his respect to his father and two sages by bowing down and touching the feet and then sat on the ground bhuma asanae this is a great teaching tradition grew in such a way you should not sit on the same level of your guru and you should sit below because to show your humbleness we are humble but at the same time they are very free to express their opinion so he will listen to that sri rama chandra how he is talking with them he showed the respect the tradition calm and touched the feet that is the hindus they do touching the feet of the seniors and then he sat on the floor not on the couch or the chairs is the order of the king the king it is the not only the father he is the king he asked him to come and explain what has happened to him yamcha and both the munis they are kula guru the bashista and now the visiting sage the vishamitra the vishwamitra and bashishta two what has happened to you rama his father asked and both the munis they were nodding their heads that that means it is their question also so what has happened to you now the rama said and he opened up his mind yatha badati bistaram in details friends i don't know whether we'll be able to read all the verses and the way the rama expressed we will pick up some and we'll understand what is the problem he is asking the question and what now he is giving o holy teachers first he is telling what is happiness can happiness be had in every changing object of this world these are the two questions and very important question in the spiritual life you are asking me to take part as a prince as a to be king but tell me why the goal is happiness not to become a king but become happy that is the very very important thing that one should notice the goal of human life is not to become a doctor or engineer or professional or the president or the minister but to be happy that is the goal we always think that to if we become like that we'll be happy it is not so the happiness that should should be the goal masada money devi and she told and that is considered as one of the the greatest teachings that she has given if you want peace then don't find fault with others rather try to find fault with yourself so that you can rectify and she never said the god realization ought to become these or that she said peace the happiness and peace how it is possible oh holy teachers what is happiness can happiness be had in ever-changing objects of this world whatever i am touching it is changing i am thinking that if i get this world i'll be very happy the world is completely changing i was thinking that if i have this office of this position but everything is changing including me i'm also going to die someday so that is the basic question of religion the religion it begins with a question and to answer that questions philosophy comes and they explain the whole thing that exactly what the sages will do then where the philosophy ends there begins the spirituality the spirituality starts after that but the first the question should arise otherwise one is not fit to travel in the path of religion but majority of the people they don't bother about it they go far to the temple and the uh the churches mosques and synagogues they go for extra protection if the god is there the god will protect us that is the idea nothing wrong god of course can do the protect the people but here it is completely different the young man of 16 years old he is asking this question what is happiness can happiness be had in the ever-changing objects of this world ever-changing all the time changing can we have the happiness if we look at the lives of the very popular actor actresses a period comes at times come they are so famous people are mad to have a glance of these people then they come they become old young generation comes and they become outdated even they are moving in the market people are not talking to them why outdated so nata and native in the sanskrit they say the actor and actresses they lose everything when they lose their beauty so is that happiness no they'll be so unhappy if they are not religious minded so they go for drinks and narcotics and they ruin their life in search of happiness we are studying the scripture if the scripture cannot help us in our own life if we don't understand these what is the use of reading the scripture if you are not going for god realization or brahma-gyana self-realization but at least in this life one should be happy by reading these understanding these happiness cannot come from the temporary things then the people are born to die and they die to be born again that is the observation ramachandra was matcha earlier than lord buddha and i don't think lord buddha was influenced by the ramachandra but the same experience happened to him he was also a prince and when he went out to see his city the country he also saw these changes he saw the person can't walk properly and then the old man and then the dead body he got the complete change in his mind why thinking and we regularly see it but we never think and we think that we are going to survive all through in the mahabharata when this question was asked to yudhisthira what is this a special thing in this life astray what is that astrojah then the yudhisthira said chanti yamamandiram every moment people are dying the more than these what will be the wonder the wonder is these every moment people are dying but those who are leaving they think no i am going to leave all through i am not going to die and this is the wonder this is people should think here the rama is also telling jayate the 25th verse it says every time people are born to die and they die to be born again that means this chakra the birth and death this chakra is going on then sri rama expressed his thought thoughtful opinion about this world then he said this is a very important verse he said the movable and immovable everything in this world are impermanent impermanent everything immovable sentient insanity so this both are like this everything is impermanent of what user kingdom and enjoyments to me i am now he is asking who am i oh i am this is a vedanta they always ask who am i go i am i cannot be this body because body is constantly changing i cannot be the mind because mind is constantly changing i cannot belong to this world because the whole world all around me including my parents including my relatives my friends my neighbors my nation everything changing every moment it is changing so who am i who i am then he said king idam agatam why this what is the purpose of this coming who has come and with what purpose there from here it begins the rama is asking the christians the questions of sri rama some people they say despondency of sri rama as the arjuna he was in the bhagavad-gita in the beginning the first chapter he was also confused but arjuna's confusion was different he was thinking that i am going to kill my own people then what is the purpose of killing my own people keith and king relatives friends and brothers so that was a completely different aspect i should say if there were not his relatives arjuna would not have asked this question and they would not have showed these weaknesses no not necessary what i am going to earn from these this the world is temporary he is not thinking in that way rama is thinking a completely different so says daya and maya the two different things both are emotion they are the compassion and the maya there is also compassion but maya with attachment and daya without attachment this is the difference a monk also feels for others if anyone in distress at least i can say ramakrishna mission monks they're always in the forefront in any distress so they will be serving them but without any attachment we don't know them they don't belong to my religion or my caste or my family nothing no question wherever they are in south africa also our swamis they are collecting funds and then feeding the hundreds and thousands of poor people i have seen them i visited and i saw how they are serving giving them education giving them health care giving them food giving them whatever they need and according to their the monetary condition so naturally but see the how they love it the compassion is there but without any attachment we don't know those people in south africa but our swamis who are there from india they are thinking for them constantly begging constantly requesting people can you please give some food can you please give some clothings can you please give some money why this is called the way the surama said the one is arjuna he was going to be bound because of that same compassion that is maya but sri ramachandra without compassion so that is daya so here this is the difference o sage how does this sorrow come to an end this is a very good question almost all people we are suffering either this way the people who are having lot of money they are also suffering those who are not having even a penny they're also suffering so all are suffering in different way so ramachandra is asking the sages [Music] sorrow shambhati how to control honorable sir life isn't transient as the drop of water dangling at the sharp corner of a blade of grass as a beautifully is expressing what is the life a drop of water dangling on the sharp blade of a grass any time it will fall and get destroyed so life isn't as transient as the drop of water dangling at the sharp corner of a blade of grass if you understand these then we'll be free from all miseries not that you have to leave the hearth and home not that you have to leave whatever you are having but if we know that life is transient we will be wise to take decision in many things in our life allah what is the purpose of life sri ramachandra he is expressing they asked why you are suffering what is your problem and he is going on telling it's not that i wanted something sri ramajandra wanted the knowledge why because he observed and very truly he observed the transient the temporariness of this world everything of this world allah's what is the purpose of life then he said the trees also leave jivanti so do the animals and birds mriga briga means the animals and pakshi birds sajibati manu yashya the many of our monks many of our shadows they coat these she alone lives whose mind is alive by reflection if we are not thinking properly understanding the life properly then we are only surviving we are not living i use this two english words one is survival the trees are surviving so long they are leaving so many things they have seen so many things happened under that tree but no reaction and the mountains for hundreds of years they are there so many kings crossed that mountain with the thousands of soldiers and never came back even if they are coming back maybe the haggard condition all the mountains have observed but what is that he didn't change so yes 31 and 32 verse mixed the trees also leave but how just they're surviving and so the animals and birds they are born and they're eating grasses and then one day they die i observe these here i observe that some of the the animals they're born small kids coming out and so fearful and then slowly slowly that they're growing up and then one day they're dead so like that the life goes and when you observe these we should try to imagine what is going to happen to me i was born i've grown up now i'm going to die that's the last that's the end so if we go on manana manana if we go on remembering these things and pondering on that and researching on that coming out with the result that is called jivana sajibati naivaji bati vivekananda placed this in a in a little different way he said they only live who live for others they only live who live for others sometimes the world some organizations they make the list who is the most rich person the highest richest person in this world and there will be competition there'll be so many billions of dollars they're having the one is fast another is second like this like that but do they really feel that what they're going to do with that money they don't it's a type of an intoxication i am having so much money i am having so much money so many people waiting over there just for my command the ego ego ego how much food you can eat how much comfort the best bait best everything even then how much so that one should try to understand rather if they could understand these and the extra money that they are having they could give back to the society the poorer section of the society then the society would grown up not only he would be a god to them they will remember him all through but at the same time his business will run well because the money will go back to the society and what the people are going to do with the money again they will come to the market again they will purchase that that money will come back to him again so this economy that is that goes in this way but these people are thinking that no we should keep all these so this preserving yes very categorically said they only live who live for others rest are more dead than alive the scripture is a burden for one without discrimination sri rama chandra is telling to his gurus if you don't have the discrimination if you're studying the scripture it's a burden and if you go to the traditional schools you will see the truth they have started the whole scripture but they don't have the discrimination bhagavan sinama krishna he said the story the one the pandit the sanskrit scholar used to visit the king and then read out from the bhagavata and after reading out few passages that is the many they do like that he used to ask the king o king have you understood the king used to say pandey you should understand fast but this man he was to feel insulted why the king is telling like that i am reading the bhagavata and king is not understanding what is this then second third it goes on and he can't say anything to the king king is so powerful and moreover he goes to read that only for money and the king is paying him for that so he goes on doing that one day it flashed in his mind the bhagavata is not the whole thing goes to one only the teaching give up give up is teaching us the tiaga to give up now i go and read that bhagavata before the king for money and then i am asking the king whether he has understood it or not scripture is a burden for one without discrimination the moment the discrimination came that old man though poor he understood no why should i go to king he didn't go second day third day king inquired what happened why he is not coming then he sent the people to inquire and this brahmin replied i am not going to read bhagavata for money king was so happy king understood now he has understood the meaning of bhagavata and naturally he gave him a lot of gift knowledge is a burden for the person full of desire i know that this is temporary i know that this is sinful but even then i go and secretly do something very wrong is it not a burden for that person if he was not knowing that it was not a problem for him as because he knows that but his passions and desires are so much he cannot control and when he is doing his suffering is much more mentally oh i have done that why could i can't control this so that is why ramachandra is telling knowledge is a burden for the person full of desires mind is a burden for one without peace and we all know that so when there is no peace when there is no happiness one is there is no control and the mind is a burden the body is a burden for one who does not know the self when only the body is there is thinking of the body it behaves like the animals only having some joy for the body and the body gets joy with some food and excitement that's all so it is because they don't know about the self the body is the moving body is going and he's thinking i am powerful is this the body powerful no because of that reflection of the brahman is there in our buddhi so we can walk we can talk and we say we are leaving so all the problem comes because of the ego i know i can do why should i not do why i have to report why i have to visa ankara just little simple system people are not ready to follow why am car if there is a system suppose you go to somewhere else is unknown place what do you do you follow the system the moment you know someone and if he is asking to follow you something immediately why should i do i am an old associate so i should not do so am god calamity comes then unnecessarily you are creating problem for yourself and also the relation with those people will be bad so naturally if you even go over there they will turn their faces they won't talk to you you won't get the peace as you used to get only a little thing that system that has developed follow these any organization is having some rules and regulation when you go to that organization it is obvious that i am going to accept the rule in the when you join this our monastic order the ramakrishna mart and ramakrishna mission we come knowing that we are going to follow the rules and regulation of these organization is compelling you to come and when you are coming you must know that these are the things that i am going to follow and why you should react against but many they will react after coming after joining oh why this why that that is the rule and we have accepted so this is the way we should understand ego generates calamity arise from the ego i want i want i want desire all is because of the ego there is no enemy worse than ego so those who wants to get advancement in in this spiritual life we should understand this this ahamkara means it comes in the mind control of the mind so here we find the rama he is telling it is so difficult this chitta is very very difficult and he said how difficult it is most of us we are asking each other sometimes the juniors the ask the senior how to control the mind that is an eternal question everyone is asking including sri ramachandra he is asking and he is telling to his gurus 37 and 38 birds the restraint of the mind is more difficult than drinking the ocean or uprooting the great sumeru mountain or eating fire the the same thing we find in the bhagavad-gita the arjuna is also telling the same thing to sri krishna it is so difficult to control the mind as we cannot control by hands the air can i hold the ear can i control the ear no it is just like that the mind is so strong and so difficult of all the yields of worldly life it is desire alone that gives lasting grief the desire alone gives lasting grief the grief that comes from desire if i don't have the desire there is no problem there is a beautiful story about the very famous abu dhota about the abu dhota we have already discussed he used to learn from nature and one day he observed that a kite it's taking a piece of meat and he was chased it was chased by nearly 10 or 15 crows they wanted the share of that piece of meat and this kite it won't share you don't give us his food so just trying to save the food and it was going down going up here there but the crows only ultimately the kite understood it is not for me they are coming for the food okay let me drop it and when he dropped that all the crows jumped to that and they left the kite alone he went and sat on a branch of a tree and heaved and oh god now i am safe so this is the desire that if you have the desire you are going to suffer every day before our eyes the people are suffering because of the desire the cause of every suffering any suffering desire may be sometimes hidden desire so this is the thing that we should remember and rama is telling this these are all his observations these are all his feelings and these is expressing to his gurus and to the sages before his father also they don't think that i have withdrawn myself because something happened in my life unfulfilled desire nothing like that i want to understand the cause of the suffering so he began with what is happiness the cause of suffering is desire isn't it he's asking the guru and he's telling this way of all the yields of worldly life it is desire alone that gives lasting grief desire alone makes the best of men worthless best of men worthless because of the desire then he is telling this the stage of life are painful he is telling the body manifests the world and it is only for experiencing sorrow this body that manifest over it that means taking the birth only for experiencing the sorrow friends if you go to any scripture in indian scripture they will always give you the first thing is this are you sure that you are not happy with the body and mind we after this before we go to the answer of the rishi that bashist will read in in this the first book who is capable to understand so when we are reading this we are trying to understand this going to pursue this are you capable what are the things that is necessary so then only they will say okay you are now capable to understand this we will come to that there is nothing more deplorable than the body and we are all attached to the body and we are all loving this body so much and we don't understand anything else but this body but this body is giving us only pain and nothing else and whatever the way we are maintaining this body the death is sure and after the death either you will be buried or you'll be burned according to your religious tradition but that is to be sure the death is obvious that is sure so that he is telling of whatever is worth then what use is kingdom of what avail our body and things shot for so these are the spiritual questions he is asking friends will continue this it's a long but we'll make it short and slowly slowly is the time he is mentioning about the body about the wealth about the enjoyment about the suffering whatever the way he taught a young man of 16 he is expressing before the wise to wise people and also to his father he was a rajashi then he is telling the kaala the time in some cases where the saints of happiness in worldly life exist for a few time completely destroy even that this is how the this is called discrimination bichara bichara without this spiritual life cannot grow without these the spiritual life one cannot make it successful unless and until there are only two things again and again i say one is the spirituality another this worldliness the world and spirituality then we say the religious people they say the spirituality is nothing but the god who is the creator and his creation is this world and now this world is temporary why because he has used some imagination and he has given that to us like a magician as the magician when he gives the castle on the year we all appreciate oh my god true such a huge castle and it is floating can that be true but the magician proves that is there we also see we also accept that but even then it is not true the similarly this world is the work of the unique magician that is god and the vedanta they say through maya through the power of illusion he has created and it has a time and it is going to destroy all that today one of my monastic uh the they are telling that whether i take medicine or not this body is going to die and it has a time no one can stop that everyone is there and it he has a time exactly on that particular day and time he or she will die if we take the medicine okay if we don't take the medicine maybe it will be a little painful but we don't die we will die on that particular day what is fixed for us so like that if we observe and then we will find with what is this and for these temporary thing and what the time is controlling and i am spending so much of time for these so much of money for these i was seeing in the psalm advertisement or maybe something suddenly it popped up one couple fabulously rich they have hired some hour in the vuj khalifa in the middle east i think it is in the um the uae the vuj khalifa they write something in the in the they'll be writing with the light so the thousands of people will be able to see that they have given money paid money you can imagine how much only to announce that my next child is going to be a son for that millions of dollar this pain and that will be a flash i don't know how many people will read even if they read they will wonder whose son anyway somebody's son so but these two young couples they're so happy then they have announced that my next the baby is going to be a son is it they let them be happy they were really they were feeling they are happy their friends are there and you can understand they can they don't bother about spending money but suppose instead of writing over there they could go to a place where people need that and that million dollar if they had given them food medicine clothings and said will you please pray for my son who will be take birth on such and such date thousands of people would have prayed for that son so please think about it so we will continue how wonderfully this young man of 16 years sri rama chandra he is taking each and everything this body this mind this kingdom this wealth this world and the time each and everything is nothing but temporary father then why you are asking me to become a king so that is the question we will continue with that in our next discourse thank you so the first question is from dave johnithard dave john is asking what is the significance of gothro for us for future generations in the path of spiritual broadness of mind and though it is not related with the subject that you are studying but still the gotra comes from the school another someone may be in in the generation in the family that you are born someone long long back he was a student of maybe modegal so your gothra is the modulator so the training and the culture and the system that has come down from the training of that school of modgula bharadwaja gautra the which we know and he has formulated you should do this you should do that from there we have forgotten what they instructed but it is continuing and naturally that is india it will continue that is called gotra but always you should feel proud and try to live that life that you belong to a rishi and your whole family your clan is belong to a rishi the seer the holy people and you should not do anything wrong that will make them ashamed so that is called gotra thank you the next question is asking life is short through realized impermanence of this world like even a day that is sufficient just say to god god i am yours and you will be realizing god so that faith should be there even for a long long period of time the people they are practicing as because there is no dedication two things are necessary one is faith that god is there second the armistice to be with god that is sufficient it is not the time but your intensity of prayer may god bless you the next question asking um without desire can this cycle of life or power chakra move no the without desire it cannot move so when you don't have the desire at all then your mind become tranquil the desire comes from the association and there will be no association now what will remain consciousness only see the consciousness is there all the time always in every being but above the consciousness it is going on the like the waves of satya raja and tama the three qualities and from the satyarajatama the ego is also coming raja means fully ego and tama is also ego but negative satya is also ego but positive but ego is there and naturally it will rise the desire desire and desire so if the desire is not there then mind become completely tranquil that is the rishis that is the meditation that is samadhi no desire at all and then at that time the reflection of their consciousness can be realized so that is called thank you the next question from charles is asking what is a good way to remember that we are that we are going to die i find it hard to remember that's it don't remember that charles but the thing is only think that it is all temporary the someday either if you look around and particularly now the kavit 19 is going on every day all the other tv channels and the newspapers going on giving the list of debt so naturally we can understand anything may happen to me any day so it is all temporary not much time is left so why not put my mind to the holy thoughts and what is holy thought thinking the good for others you know holy thought is thinking the good for others and to give the benefit to them and not me the moment you become unselfish your life whatever may be the span of life that will be really really useful they only live who live for others rest are more dead than alive so that is the way thank you the next question is asking what is maya maya is the power of god it cannot be explained but can be felt so that is called the the maya and in the in the different particularly and the biblic churaumani shankaracharya has given the descriptions of the maya definitions of the maya and it is there we feel like that but at the same time we cannot explain that that is called maya i see that it is a snake but at the same time when someone comes with the light i see no it is the row how it happened is the maya i see i think that this person is so close to me and i am going to live with him or her all through my life after a month or so after a few years we don't feel like that why why i could not feel this before maya so in our life every day every moment we are experiencing maya's activity but still we feel it we suffer but we cannot explain what is maya okay okay then let us conclude by chanting shanti shanti shanti three times you can also join with me shah a you
