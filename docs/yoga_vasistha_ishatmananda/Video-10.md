foreign [Music] [Music] I salute the Supreme Brahman the one who is beyond all qualities who is tranquil and beyond our limitations who is the embodiment of infinite consciousness and can be known only through one's own experience this is the in four lines they're so beautifully the whole advaita vedanta has been depicted over here that it is beyond everything all qualities there are only three qualities these are the three qualities and with these three qualities everything is formulating Sometimes good sometimes mixture of good and bad and sometimes bad the whole creation is that only so it is beyond that but this qualities have come from it and we have to understand it with our own efforts so we will be discussing about that previously in our last discussion the topic was after the brahmagyana what will happen to that particular person so is he going to behave like us as we do or his behavior will be completely changed now there are different type of opinions are there after the Brahma gyana the sum of the behavior will remain as it is as before because the past Karma that is continuing so obviously it will be like that it will continue like that next someone when walking is looking at the left that is his habit sometimes after a few steps looks at the left again few steps looks at the left that's the that way after the brahmagyana that is not going to change they and sometimes some people they like to make fun cut jokes after the brahmagana say anything will remain as we find in xiaomi Vivekananda but just like a boyish way having the fun and like that it didn't change it was always there so this is the that they say like that now the question is then how we will understand that is a pomegranate then one of the Great Sage he said Brahma is the absolute knowledge and that knowledge of Oneness not diversity only Oneness that will be manifested to that person who has realized Brahman if someone says I am a Brahma gyani I have realized Brahman but at the same time differentiates this is my people they are not and this is my language that is not then he is not a Brahma gyani cannot be the knowledge of one will be there first second the no desire to have anything of this world because he knows this world is not existing at all that is the brahmagyana so if still he is thinking that I should accumulate money I should have these I should have that then he is not a problem again even if he is claiming like that so the criterias the ear sticks are very clear you cannot simply declare or maybe your followers will be clear use of Brahma can you use a Brahma organic and no doctor can check with it he is not there may be some in future they will find out a gun like that nowadays wherever you go they will shoot like this oh okay your temperature is all right goheen so like that or you're a brahmagani okay you go to that side so it may be I do not know but the feeling I don't want anything of this world you know in the life of bhagavan Krishna when the great debate was going on whether he is Avatar or not that is a great thing he is here on avatara or just ordinary person behaving like that acting like that the wind that was going on all the great Scholars were debating he was completely tension free nothing like and he was going on asking when they are going to complete it anything that let them declare because I know who am I so let them declare whatever way they whether they accept it or not it doesn't matter because he never wanted anything of this world so this is the thing they never care for this world so these are the Brahma gandhis but at the same time after that knowledge then beautiful it is say it is saying like this suppose you have seen a snake on a rope it was a Twilight as an evening you couldn't notice properly so you saw a rope and you thought that is a snake and you became afraid and your heartbeat naturally all those expressions of fear was there then someone brought the torch and showed it and said oh this is only a rope not a snake fear God but the heartbeat is going on because that fear it was already there it will continue for some time similarly after the realization of the Brahman some of the practices will be there it remains like that so these all the discussions it will happen yet after having the fear of the snake and when you are knowing that it is not a snake but company that your body as it was reacting out of fear it will continue similarly this is also with completely going away the moha delusion what is the delusion that I am thinking this is this this is a delusion the most of the time that is the problem when the people that think in that rather don't think just ask there's something I was thinking that you will eat this all right before that you ask me why you think you're just you're thinking then you are preparing then you are serving then you are I am saying no unnecessary so much of a stage so just ask why you are thinking sometimes we think in that way and what we think or this world is so beautiful oh this world is terrible but this world is mixture of good and bad all the thinking that that bit just that goes away completely because sometimes as I was telling them the I don't know how many of you have had experience of camel right have any of you camel right hmm oh my God it is not the camel dragon is an experience and moreover if you are riding like a tourist when they go the camel is coming on a high thing then from there you are sitting on the Camel Back That is a different thing when the camels are sitting and you were climbing on that and it is getting up that is an experience oh my God the camel first back legs they will straight and you you are parallel to you that like that you have to hold the camel and camel snake you have to and somehow you have to keep the balance and then camel will get up again you are going towards backward so this is the terrible experience but when we see the people riding on that and they're oh we're so good I like to I also thought in that so I requested one of our devotees the marwadi devotees in Rajasthan at all do we have camo so here swamiji so can I ride on that and that experience then second time due to swamiji we will make it properly and no no no this is an experience not to be repeated again once it is sufficient let the Kings ride on that and do whatever they like but so this is the terrible experience up on the camera but if you go and stay over there it is terrible I was in arunachal Pradesh Greenery Birds animals and so beautiful daytime but in the night terrible and different type of sounds from different corner you can't sleep and sometimes you will feel the elephant is standing by your side because they'll be so close terrible condition and particularly that those days so apparently it is so good when the tourists are coming Maharaj you are in heaven I told that's true where it depends on the experience you know the heaven becomes and the Hell and Hell becomes Heavens it all experience so these every time in every state we find moha this is called so someone was telling the if you like to become a philosopher you should marry then when you imagine after marriage you will be a philosopher naturally so that is the way their experience there is telling you this is so and those who are not married every time they are thinking oh if I could so it is all like this going on so this is the way who will call Mohan the Moon the Tana that wealth well to wealth they're going on searching for that what they will do what they're going to do with so much of money they don't know but still this is pursuing to get to acquire to have that much when their name will be on the top of the list the richest man in the world is so happy mm-hmm suppose it is not there you are also happy what is the problem whatever the food you like you get so this section that's why they say santoshatana the wealth is your containment if you are contented then you are a rich person but if you are not contended even the richest person is a very poor person suffering so one person told oh he was not having anything except wealth so so he was not having anything except well because he was not having friends he was not having any company he was not having any joy and constant fear all this comes under more good delusion so what is knowledge actually what is religion proper thinking clear proper thinking and nothing else what I want shall I want to become a monk and I'll become happy not at all there are so many monks out there who are suffering I know so many monks then ultimately they committed suicide because they could not bear it so many have really human mind only so this is the thing that we have to keep in mind we are thinking oh these people are so happy and they are thinking oh these people are so happy in the Bengali there's a poem is there that one side of the river is constantly telling oh other side you're so happy those there and there also the thinking oh this side must be very happy the thinking so this is the way we always so here it says when the complete delusion has gone even then as because I was in it that some type of practices it will be there it continues then comes the question what is this word now the answer will be from the point of view of the vedanta they say it is an illusion illusory perception on the Brahman not that something is not there there's another a school up with this Buddhism they say there is nothing then there is a controversy then the argument will be against if there is nothing how the something has come something cannot come out of nothing there must be something now I am afraid of snake so I have an imagination of snake otherwise I will know the one of our swamiji he replied a wonderful question in Bombay the talk was going on we were brahmacharians the navishes the one gentleman got up and said I don't believe in God God cannot be then immediately I was wondering how he's going to react immediately he said I bow down to you you are the only person who has seen God no no I don't believe in God that is why because if you have not seen God how you are so confident that there is no God you must have idea about God that you have seen God as I am confident that in this Hall there is no cow there is no horse there is no elephant because I have clear idea about horse cow elephant you must be having the clear idea and realization of God so I bow down to you he became frustrated no no he was going to otherwise anyway sit down so this is the way the wind we say that it is not there you are actually accepting it that's all way of argument you know the fallacy and all that it goes in that way and it says what is this word illusory thing reflected on the Brahman something is there and what is that something consciousness when the Consciousness is there on the wall of Consciousness I am going on imagining you know when I was young I used to lie on my back whenever I got a chance in the open field or on the Terrace of the house I used to look at the sky and I used to imagine all these clouds are moving oh it is a tiger it is an elephant or they are coming together they'll be fighting like that imagination hours together that was a wonderful game for me just imagine so so many things are happening nothing is happening only the clouds but I saw on that sky there is no conception of Sky actually just we are thinking there is something and on that we can see the clouds and the clouds are moving I am imagining now after reading the vedanta we understood that whole world that I see I am imagining I am imagining that he is my friend he is my enemy he is my these he is my dad whole imagination but this moment we won't be able to accept it because this is a realization experience when you realize then you understand it when you don't it is very difficult to understand that so this is this call that what is this word illusory perception on brahmana and Brahman is nothing but consciousness again and again but this conversation is going on not between Batista and Rama this particular chapter that we are reading bashishta is a student at time and he is studying under Lord Shiva not the mythological Lord It's a real Guru Shiva the guru and that Lord Shiva is teaching vashishta now what is this bondage accepting this creation as true and true and eternal and being attached to that this is the bondage so two three things we must remember what is this word it is an imagination on consciousness whatever you like you can imagine in that way and what is this bondage whatever I am imagining I am thinking that is true and that is eternal and I am sticking to that holding to that that is called bondage otherwise there is no one digital and what is Liberation clear knowledge about the temporariness of this world and not getting attached to this clear knowledge that's all not two three brothers they were fighting for their parental home and everyone was complaining to me I because I knew them see he is not I love him so much but now he's behaving in this way uh going on two of them passed away and their children are also not there and the last one is sick who is going to have that building but we thought they thought the other day I was telling what you're going to do with that swamiji my brothers are not there I am also in the same condition any day I can die children are not interested whatever happened so this is the way at one time we are imagining without that I cannot survive I must have this is my right and all that but afterwards we find it is of no use every time it is happening in our own life but we are not understanding it and we are thinking next thing oh that is important next thing that is important we are going on imagining imagining imagining and going on running after that they let the frag end of my life when I'm lying down and to ready to leave the last breath then what thought comes I have not done anything so many other things are left so what is religion it makes you aware about that particular moment if you become a rabindranath and realized then he will say last moment he will say o my death you are so lovable like my God the shama the Krishna I like you so much I'm not at all afraid because I know that I'm not going anywhere I am only changing the body that's all so this is the ultimate truth of the religion fearlessness and why because I don't have any desire whatever I wanted whatever everything I have done complete now I am free and that is why they say swadharma whatever the responsibility that you have accepted that is your religion don't bother about others the year should be performed but we go on doing everything the one who is selling the tea the tea shop owner he will also have some idea how the Prime Minister should run the country and how we should have a relation with the China and Pakistan and you have forgotten to put that sugar in the tea oh is it okay prepare the tea properly that will be gone right and let the man sitting over there let him take care of that so Dharma we take all off and our fingers going out to complain they are bad they are bad they are bad now I learned it from one of the Swami I always remember him then I was complaining to him you're young brahmachary so some another brahmachari was doing something I was not happy so I went to him and said swamiji he was doing that he was doing a finger he's like then he was looking at me very quietly then after I finished he said look your one finger is pointing to him but three fingers is pointing to you my all the three fingers are coming to me pointing to me so why don't you think again before complaining so what happened what should have been it like that the three fingers Point into that's true all the time when you're showing like this so we complain against everyone but have I done my duty we never ask the moment we ask we are free I have done my duty I don't know I am not going to do everything whatever was given to me I have done it perfectly and I am satisfied completely satisfied so this is called Liberation what is Liberation clear knowledge about the temporariness of this world and not getting attached to this not getting access to this we are doing everything but not getting at thirst the hence the right knowledge of Brahman can never arise in ignorance it remained due to the Past Karma now it is not possible the debate was going on and now they say night is not possible what is Right knowledge of Brahman again the question it is the one infinite Consciousness also known as the Shiva is telling what is the right knowledge of Brahman and the Shiva is telling it is the one infinite consciousness also known as truth one Shiva void Supreme self and all this the Brahman is also known as satyam truth the truth that we think this is the truth and that is not it is not like that the truth is eternal here the truth means Eternal satyam means Eternal usually we say satyam or the SAT I mean Satya in Bengali that means that it happened like that but here the satta means eternal he come it is not having any two so in the other religions also they say the God is one they say in Islam the God is one but this that conception of one and this vedantic conception are completely different they go to Great details even a person one person is not one why because he is having the limbs it is a one means without any break they're in the guru stotra it says in the same way so this one it is Shiva Shiva means auspiciousness what is auspiciousness when I don't have any desire I am auspicious it is not that I regularly go and pay it in the ganga and put on tilak and cover the world with all the no if you don't have ego you are auspicious if you don't have desire you are auspicious that that is called auspicious and that is Shiva the void that is the conception has come from that and it says nothing is there so that it is the Supreme self and what is the right knowledge of Brahman again if they are asking it is everything it says like this it is Brahman it is then he is not clear it's some of the names you are only telling again he is asking oh Lord what is the Brahman knowledge of Brahman then he says it is everything it is both real and unreal and this is a unique Point real and unreal the conception of unreal is also truth otherwise how you are thinking in that way as we were telling the moment you say that God is not there that means you have the idea of God and naturally you are saying like that I told you many of you know it then in one time when I was traveling from purulia to some place it was early morning in the train and you know in our the country trains there will be people sailing different type of food items and there was a person who used to sell young boy who's to sell muri and mixed with different type of things very tasty for me and many of the Bengali people there and and very simple way to prepare and of course some of us after leaving here in America will say oh my God so have you cleaned that have you cleaned that that is another thing if you forget about all that it is tasty so and when he was I told you can I have one he was not at all answering or he was busy to give the supply to other people then I thought because I'm wearing the gerua he's thinking I won't pay so I take out the money and told I will pay in our country most of the swamis they don't pay why should he pay by sanyasi every year is free so now he I try to give that money he said no no no I cannot give because something is mixed in this it will be difficult to give it to you what is there we shall I announce it before everyone I was taking a walk what is that in the Moody what you have mixed that you cannot announce now this onion is there do you eat onion the sanyasis don't eat onion oh no no no I eat onion not only onion many other things but but the thing is I never wanted to break his religion so he was thinking not eating onion is a religion at least something sticking that you should not disturb those people at least something he is having at the time of religion I should not do this I should not do that it is okay don't slowly slowly slowly you come to this I am everything it is not one time it cannot you cannot have that I am everything good and bad whatever you see it is me only so that is the ultimate Brahman and that is the true Hindu religion yesterday you must be knowing that the home of Harmony every Saturday there will be some discussions a different type of religious groups are coming and having yesterday it was the Sheikh gurudwara one gurudeva they came for Sangha they were singing and explaining and that granthi the the person who was doing that he said the ultimate of all religion is to see every one as him see we think sick as six are different but it's not the same thing they have taken it from the Hinduism and our scriptures only our gurus and they're explaining in their own way and that going on what is the difference to some of the external thing they must be having the turban they must be having beard they must be having these having that so that the external but real knowledge is same so this is the way if we think what is the right knowledge that it is everything the Brahman is nothing but everything it is both real and unreal then I quoted from one person he is mentioning manifest Consciousness is the universe unmanifest universe is consciousness a very nice way he is putting the Manifest Consciousness is this universe an unmanifest consciousness unmanifest universe is the consciousness now when we are sleeping and going into deep sleep where we are not even seeing the dreams consciousness so unmanifest Universe there is nothing is there in the deep sleep when you've eaten not even you are dreaming then what is there only pure consciousness and we I'm there and when I come back I say I was sleeping and enjoying because there is no dream at all I was there so that eye Consciousness is there the unmanifest universe is consciousness and manifest consciousness this universe so this beautiful he says that is shankaracharya said the Brahman is truth Eternal and jagat this manifested thing means very temporary it may change always changes is the mitta so this is the way we have to when you come to America they're so courteous people here and in the airport also the moment you greet someone just you're an unknown you're just looking at them in India we don't do that usually and we are very friendly type we always develop with a relationship like that we say here they don't do that but they greet with a very wonderful smile they look at you and you'll smile but that is very temporary if you try to if you try to continue with that smile it will be difficult I had a bad experience then I went into the office with the brother and that I was very new the lady in the counter and she smiled and hi how is the day how are you I thought I'd like to she wants to talk to me so I you need not to continue so that is so temporary the world is very temporary not that it is smiling means it is truly there and sometimes they will say a truly I I love you that means it is true it's okay before whatever they say it is not true it goes on in this way so that this is a Brahma but jagat Mitra the manifestation that you see is temporary but that manifestation came from what that is true that never changes that is there but another step is there takes us to that right and we find over here the Shiva the Lord Shiva is teaching the same truth to pashishtha to when he was a student Brahma Satya jagat Satya this Brahman is truth and this world the universe that you see that is also true but this jagat this manifested thing are now based on the consciousness Brahman is consciousness all permitting Consciousness and this manifestation that you see is also the same but based on that consciousness on the basis of this this is called beginadrishti the Guyana drishti brahmas that this is the Consciousness that is the truth that is the Eternal that is existing and other things that you see are all temporary I saw my grandfather when I was a very small boy then when I grew up I didn't find him where is he he passed away grandmother passed away then after some time father mother everyone slowly slowly unto everyone whom I knew or all passing away and I was having so wonderful relation with them now what will happen both are there mitta means temporary so this is truth but ramakrishna says but this jagat is also true because it is the manifestation of the same consciousness on the basis of these Swami Vivekananda he said that if you are worshiping the beings you are worshiping the god premium means the worshiping with all great devotion when you are doing that you are actually worshiping the supreme god because they are also manifestation of the same they don't know it I know my behavior should be accordingly I know them and this is that is called the Supreme knowledge doing a man is having the Dharma or the religion or the gyana the religious realization will he become like a stone oh this world is temporary let them die let them suffer I don't bother most of the people they do like that and that is a mistake great mistake because they have not realized truly the moment you realize naturally you feel for them and that is why Swami vivekan it is not emotional it's all realization he said the poor the oppressed the downward and the illiterate they are my gods and goddesses where from this knowledge then Supreme knowledge Brahman is truth this genre that you seek it is also true and this jagat is now on this word but this jagat that you see is constantly changing so naturally you should not be attached to this but we should not say that it is not there at all Sometimes some of the religions some of the people truth is there but the way they express the whole world is nothing but misery true but for whom who has understood it realized it but if you impose that on each and everyone it is a great mistake that mistake was done when Buddhism came this whole world is so temporary full of suffering everything and become among and I was not thinking in that but still the hall in thousands they became monks and nuns and that actually ruined the whole society the society has a structure that's why Swami Vivekananda very wonderfully said we never travel from wrong to truth from lower truth to higher truth we are traveling from lower truth to higher truth this very moment I think this is my duty and I should do it you must do that that is your religion and after that after the experience you say no it is not so let me do something else that is where you must go so prama on the basis of that is we must react to the world otherwise we become the stone like hundreds and thousands of years millions of Hindu monks the misinterpreted this teaching and they were born they grew up they were taking the support from the society the food the clothing and everything in exchange they said what is it it is not there then why you go for begging uh-huh then why you are saying like that this is hypocrisy not understanding properly they are trying to behave like that as a hypocrisy this is the problem so we were premature in that time we were traveling myself and another brother I think he was one year Junior than me so I was senior as he was Junior we were traveling we went to somebody's house there are about swamija swamiji gave the actress we went and met him he was a big officer we were very happy and they were Distributing food also two three days we were there now when the naturally that gentleman he was an engineer we are all very junior he was I think 17 or 18 years and I was 23. so he was asking the elderly person ah swamiji so what is our what will happen to us we are all good gravity is what will happen to us this boy he just started reading the bhagavad-gita and heard some of the lectures he started telling him oh you people have married and you are not practicing these you will have this suffering that suffering I thought he was going on touching him we are eating now if they take out the plate what will happen sometimes it is true and that's why he he was a very intelligent boy he stood second in class 11 at class 12 examination in the board exam in Bengal so there's he was very intelligent boy but you know that faster he is becoming so he's like that in the I think in Bangalore so I was traveling and just walking and the problem was in front of me then one lady came and she was telling elderly lady with a young girl and she was from swamiji please bless her she is going to be married these boys said after marriage you have suffered so much again you are putting this girl into that because she told her what is it she was confused then I was next so you know swamiji why we don't know much actually we are young so you better go to the inter swamiji these are elderly an experience so this experience is also necessary only the knowledge that creates problem this is the way we have to observe the life of bhagavan siddama Krishna Brahma Satya jagat mitta that is true but that is for shankaracharya that is for shankaracharya not for all of us so why how we should behave brahmas at the jagat also sat there this is also true and whoever comes before us we should worship them and we should be thankful because everything you people are giving to us so that we can sit and meditate that we have forgotten those who have renounced we have forgotten that everything is coming from you only the way you first got the sannyasa we went to one of the senior swamiji vice president there to him he was that vice president then he was telling Maharaja now we have become sannyasi jagat Guru isn't it he said to some extent then we should not touch the feet of anyone is it Maharaja and to some extent he was telling then he said what will happen if my parents come shall I not touch the feet of my mother then he said oh you have already become sannyasi I am trying to become Maharaja is telling if I find my mother I will lie down at her feet because I have not become sannyasi yet and you have already become a sannyasi that you don't so this is the way they used to teach us what sannyasi we have to remember the the our parents how much they have given to us how much they have sacrificed for us how can you forget it we should pray for them so this is called Satya that we have to understand these two truth otherwise our life cannot be enlightened and it will be constantly we are thinking and we should behave like that and we have not realized it that this is a great teaching the vashishta then learned this knowledge from the Lord Shiva who taught this knowledge in three steps now here it says like this first is the prashanti first tip is prashanti in the prashanti through practices when the mind is totally controlled under control and the thought of the worldly objects cease to rise then it goes in a state like deep sleep the when the mind is controlled when we are meditating and in the meditation we try to forget our body we try to forget all around us and no sound and nothing is felt so slowly slowly we are in deep Sleep they say as it as in but it is in consciousness so there is no modification mind is nothing but modification there is no modification but it is having in this way the state like the deep sleep that is the first step second stage Consciousness without mind transcend the three states and it goes to the fourth what are the three states the waking state then sleeping stage and deep sleep stage it goes beyond that that is called the second step the samadhi but there is a third one it goes even beyond the turia turia means the fourth stage this state goes beyond the term Brahman even beyond the turn Brahman because we have a conception of Brahman what is Brahman sachidananda sarupa it is existence it is knowledge it is bliss but you are explaining that the moment you can explain that is becoming Limited you're explaining it whatever way you are trying to give a conception about it immediately it is becoming so friends it is so vast and so subtle knowledge and that is why it says no one can help you you have to help yourself so that when we go and worship a cow or a stone or a river or a tree we are Hindu of course we are Hindu and that Hindu goes up and up and up and up and ultimately he comes and says even the Brahman that you say sachidananda saruba I am beyond that and third stage the Shiva is telling it is the fourth stage they say jagrat then we are awakened and that time body mind and all life is all there then shopna then body is absent but the mind is active and I am seeing the dream then susupti there there is no body there is no mind but only consciousness the third stage and vedanta says beyond that is a food stage means the fourth one so one lady called me I have a baby son can you please give a name and I was reading this I told you can keep his name well no no this is the first one okay okay so I'm so sorry so I was thinking then before explaining she told no no this is the first issue okay no problem that's okay he's the first one so this chaturtham is stage where it goes beyond this but he say the Shiva is telling even beyond the chaturtha the chaturtha means that here we have to understand a little uh you know the subtlety is there chaturtha even chaturtha we have a conception means beyond the body beyond the Mind Beyond this this is the Consciousness Psalm and it goes beyond the chaturtha you cannot explain about it so this is called Beyond in bhagavad-gita they also that's the same thing it says purusha Utama is goes beyond the purusha purusha uttama they have used this terminology purusha uttama purusha means Consciousness which is residing inside every being it is not the male or female the Consciousness that resides in every being we call it Prana so that is the purusha and that purusha uttama beyond that here it also says even the fourth stage beyond that stage it is energy of this Consciousness the Lord Shiva said is able to create the entire universe and also reduce everything to ashes divide that is the energy it can create it can dig back the whole thing then the bashista is asking oh Lord can you please tell me explain what is this energy and what is their power and what is the activity of the energy now this conception one something which is beyond our conception and that something which is beyond has the energy which is working so it is not that the energy that produced from there it is working from that so this same conception you will find in the Tantra this is the pure vedanta this our yoga bashishta is a pure advaitha but in tundra also you will find the same conception and they explain in a more Lucid way so the ordinary people can understand they say paranga Shiva the parama Shiva mostly we have not seen if you find any you can type maybe the Google all knowing Google can give you what is a parama Shiva parama Shiva is a completely dead pale figure and we know that shadashiva the shadashiva is the white lying down lying on his back but the eyes are open and then the Kali standing on sadashiva the parama Shiva sadashiva then Kali the parama Shiva is that stage where it is mentioning over here beyond the turia and sadashiva is Brahman and from sadashiva all this creation that is manifesting as a Kali and here it is Maya so only terminology is a different but the same knowledge in everything in the bhakti Sutra you will find it is the Lord all-pervading Vishnu Vishnu is not working Vishnu has created Brahma and Brahma is working and Brahma how he is working imagination he is imagining this should be there they should be there all imagining how he could imagine because the God has given him all knowledge the Veda I cannot imagine anything about which I don't have any conception unless and until I have the conception that there is an elephant there is a the camel there is these there is that in the dream I may see that the camel hate on elephant body I can see that but I am having the conception of elephant and the camel both then only it is possible but if I am not having any conception I will how I will create so this is also the three layers and here it says the energy the term that is used in energy and he is asking oh Lord can you please tell me how the energies are working we will study that in our next class we will discuss about that so up to this today and if there is any question then we'll try she's asking when we take God's name during the time of performing any action does it not prevent us from doing which is wrong and everybody is putting us in trouble will it stop us from doing something wrong of course well that is a good question if I am going to do something wrong but taking the name of God that means you don't have any idea about God in the olden days and how else I don't know the decoys in The Villages these two worship goddess Kali and to go to plunder here and there and they were thinking God is Khali is the conception of Shakti so we will get the Shakti and they will go that is their conception but it has nothing to do with the Kali but if you are truly believing that God is nothing but love and unselfishness what is God actually if we ask the people so difficult to explain we say God and for God thousands of millions of people have already been killed and maybe in future God forbid in the name of God but we do not know what is God God is nothing but love l-o-v-e and unselfishness so then when you are taking the name of God how can you do something bad no it is not possible so obviously you will be controlled I am taking the name of God how can I be so why the sannyas means they all the time put on the dress you know it is a reminder I'm a monk I have left the Hearth and Home I am not supposed to do this I am not supposed to do that constant reminder one of her swamiji he passed away recently you know the Abram Krishna Mission swamis are all the time jovial and he used to ask hey why your color is this what if I'm all right yours is also that and but why so then he will be confused why means this is tradition no no no this is not the tradition this to remind that we are renounced sir we have renounced everything the religion begins with renunciation religion begins with giving up but if the religion begins with grabbing there is no religion it cannot be so that is the basic conception the Hinduism means if you give up everything then only you will get everything where is Rama there cannot have the desire come you won't get God so this is when we are taking the name of God we cannot do anything wrong that is not good but another you know that I just remind that we were in advitastram and we used to say in the books in the packets of books to different places and at least that that they call it card Pooler the talavala cartwheelers you know I don't know still it is there or not with the long wooden carts over there to two three people there's two pool and the poor people they used to get money but every time they're coming back they used to charge extra 15 rupee in those days and the the before 19 in 70s 80s 15 rupee extra the Y extra there is no bill so we started doubting the man but he was so faithful and very good person from Bihar then one day he said there is a Babu as an officer he says unless you give 15 rupee extra then I am not going to book your lucky thing so then two three of us so you went over there and from distance we are observing what is happening in howrah station then he came and the officer came he took out the mark Ali's photo from his back and hanged it at the at his back and then lighted the incense sticks and he was showing like that then he took out two different sizes boxes one to collect the what is the taxes or whatever the charges another the 15 rupee extra that we can say the Ghosh that is you have to give that extra otherwise they won't book it 15 rupee you have to put first then only the other things will start then when he was doing one of our brahmachary he went he had a very heavy voice and he told just now you worship mother Kali and doing wrong thing just before her so what will happen to your children and he became so afraid oh you are from ramakrishna Mission just tell me I will never charge any extra from you not from ramakrishna Vision but you should not do it because the whatever the extra money we think that we are collecting it is never helping and that will put you in trouble always so we have to have that type of conception and you will get the blessings of God for sure so next time or rectify the negative emotions in US if yes why there are so many crimes fourth stage oh the same devices actually you know that when we reach to the fourth stage we are completely purified person when we are having any desire in our mind our mind will never ever go to that fourth stage that's called turia it is not possible and when you reach to the turia there is no chances of doing anything wrong it is not also possible so whatever you are telling it is much lower level doing wrong and all that once once you become a true sannyasi you can never think of doing anything wrong by mistake you may do unknowingly if you are doing that is a different thing but knowingly is a sannyasi a holy man can never do anything wrong never ever and should not do if he is doing or she is doing then they are not holy people hmm thank you any questions from you you can come to that side we were taking and the eating of onions and all right your active but thakura also never used to eat you know Pure Food and all those things are mentioned you know the Pure Food means it doesn't the ingredients Pure Food means a person whose mind is pure when they are preparing the food that food becomes pure in the ramanuja also said that when a person is truly a holy person in the mind only love and nothing else the classical example is a lady who was waiting all through her life her Ram Chandra and that shabari though she was not of any High caste lady shower shower means the hunters dearly girl the shovery when she was offering food even after tasting whether the food is good or not the ramachandra bhagavan he never hesitated to take that that is called pureful not the ingredients it doesn't matter it depends on your body and your Constitution how you like and what you like with that the foods are also classifieds in the bhagavad-gita you will find it very clearly the she is asking the satwara jatama three types of food in bhagavad-gita is very clearly mentioned it is not the ingredients what you are eating or it is not a high items are eating but it depends on you some of the things which are already another you know in America each and every day we are eating only tamasik food because of the freeze the under in the what I eat because when devotee will bring cooked food and you'll keep in the the What's called the freeze and then we are taking out and warming and eating who will bring regular good food for me so that is also you can say tamashik food and what to do but when you are eating that whatever it is if you think that I am offering to God and I am eating you are completely free and moreover you know that it is not the food that you are eating just through eat that is not the main main is other Vibe the eye when you see the bad things that brings back the the bad impression in the mind that is also ahara when we say something the bad thing and criticize someone or see some way that it is damaging his or her life that is also the bad ahara so it is not only food but if some we feel that without onion you are feeling Purity good for you no problem yes so uh I totally relate to what you said about um but uh this journal is a manifest of the same Consciousness exactly I personally relate to it very well and but sometimes living in this world the doubt comes you know reading the song and this product is not really a manifested manifestation of the same Consciousness so I'm just trying to struggle with this to remove the stuff but I want to remove this how can I do that how can I reconcile to the scenes see yes so that umka philosophy it says prakriti and purusha vedanta philosophy it says Consciousness and Maya the Brahman and Maya but Brahman as a vedantic Maya and Shankar uh was called the prakriti are not same to some extent that is all philosophical thing but in a practical way if I see this world at a completely temporary and not taking care of anybody am I not becoming selfish if you are completely separate from all these living in a cave not taking any help from anyone and practicing that very good but as long as you are in this Society you are taking everything from the society at the same time you're degrading all the time denouncing them is this good then sometimes some of the swamis will say we don't like to look at the women good why you are in the society you go in a cave you go in the forest where you are alone of course you can follow but while leaving that is called practical way because sometimes the some of the swamis they will go to the house and say we cannot eat your food because whatever you are cooking is all bad or you cannot but we can take money from your money also have our I am giving my more money to you and you will go and purchase the ingredients and then you are eating who has brought suppose the potato that you are purchasing you don't know the person who actually brought that potato what was his cost and what is this that isn't really sheer Madness is what you are telling the lies you are not aware of it is a very bad karma rather you eat some one or two fish or meat that doesn't matter but don't hurt others by telling lies don't cheat people that is the main thing you are going on doing the bad thing that you are seeing as a karna nashik all the five constantly we are going on taking only controlling the the tongue that we have to think about it some people they think oh this is and it has become so big Swami Vivekananda became so disgusted with it he said do you think that you have your religion your religion has gone in the kitchen only who is cooking and who is doing this and that and a religion means completely transformation of thought and what is that thought God has created everything I must love God so remember God is nothing but love and unselfishness the more we become unselfish the more we can love and more he can love more we get the peace what is the ultimate goal peace joy happiness thank you friends the latest say Shanti three times and we conclude oh Shanti Sean Shanti Shanti heal you
