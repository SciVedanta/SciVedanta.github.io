[51. Yoga Vasishtha: A Guide to Brahma Jana - “O Rama, Resolve to Realize Brahman”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WknbbA6FalU)

good morning dear devotees and friends and though a little late but we can say happy holi we have kept some color over here [Music] this color always gives us and encourages us to become happy with different type of colors and mixture of that when it becomes only one that is not happiness the different varieties different colors so that is the indication so we should try to understand if you try to live with many different things together that is the cause of happiness but at the same time those who are trying to get the liberation from the subtler birth and death should point to only one that is consciousness in the society so many different type of waves come one after excitement the some of the people they sell that excitement and that is their business they earn money from there at the cost of our mental equilibrium so that we should have to understand those who are searching for the spiritual peace spiritual happiness we should be clever clever enough to understand on which we should stick to all law and that is exactly worth the same the ramachandra is learning from his guru so let us begin [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] i salute the supreme brahman the one who is beyond all qualities who is tranquil and beyond all the limitations who is the embodiment of infinite consciousness and can be known only through one's own experience praise we know sri ramajandra wanted to go out as a monk giving all the heart and home now his father got concerned and he requested the kuru to talk to srila and this conversation is called yoga this is the big book there's a lot of stories that the guru has said to explain to elaborate his teaching we are not going through all the stories we are taking only the specific teachings the we know that the holy companion and reading the scripture and with the help of your swat thick mind strongly resolved to realize brahman the guru said you have to take first it is you you have to take the decision i am going to realize from one in the vedanta they have seven stages the yoga is having subtle similarly the vedanta is also i mean the seven stages and begins the desire what is that holy desire i like to be brahman myself i like to realize brother that is called and how that will come how the decision will come when it says that you have to have the holy company now again who are the holy companions those who are constantly when you go to a temple they say look those people are our enemies come take up all and let us go and fight so we'll see the government is increasing the price and we should go and stand over there and block the road this is for the company these are not they're okay in the society it is a second baby so they are doing what is the holy company that guide you to peace to happiness to joy to please that is the holy company a person who himself is always happy and at the same time his presence his words inspire others to be happy that is a holy company without heart in others without criticizing others that is the political planning who is a holy person the very 28 qualities that the lord krishna has listed if this 828 quality is alive he is a holy person and it begins with [Music] if there is are there so we have to find if not 28 at least 80 this quality is present in a guru a holy person then we should follow him and it says you should have the holy company because that person completely depends on god he has 100 faith on the existence of god because he has realized it so there is no ambiguity in his mind there is no doubt in his mind he is there so this is called early company and constantly you have to go on because so much of attractions you have to save your mind how you can say you have to study the scripture as we are studying the scripture the sunday every sunday we are here discussing the best vedantic book the yoga practice and here it says that you must go to your holy person get the inspiration seeing his life and listening is taught then calm start practicing and to encourage your mind to keep your mind constantly free from any other thing you must study the scripture so sometimes we are encouraging our devotees in different places to develop the pratham to study circle and we are having few study circles here and there and we gave them a list these are the things you must do reading some good book then meditation pondering over the thing that you have already read like that so it is going on so when we are studying the scripture it's not the story books sometimes a lot of stories are there mythologies are there it's so beautiful too and very attractive when you start reading we cannot stop but that is not the scripture scripture gives you a complete idea about your goal that is the scripture and when you are reading that you know what i should do so here the guru poster say to his disciples so you should have the only company and read the scripture and with the help of your mind in the mind there are three qualities of the three [Music] tama is gunas inertia tommy is always anger jealousy all the bad qualities that he finds and when you find a mixture of good and bad is raja but when it is only good that is swat this three qualities of god god has created this quality and with these three qualities is creating and sustaining and destroying this is his game his play divine play in doing the dualism they always say like that lead up the word they we find sometimes some person are so good so kind and obviously so that is the way we can feel so we can understand this way that this is the circle and is also there sometimes you become agitated angry and tama is also there so naturally it is proved not that we're not imagining these three qualities are there all the time present in us and when you see the bad people if you like to see the bad people you have to go to the jail you can find so many together and if you talk to them take the interview and hear about it you can find oh my god a person can do like this this is also human being they were also born in somebody's house they were also growing up and now they're grown up human being but look at their behavior their thinking capacity their their talmud so this is proved so big the neighbor says on imagination disproved raja is also there go and touch anyone immediately [Music] immediately so much of ego that is [Music] look at yourself also the way you find that your grandson is coming or the grandchildren are coming the small kids are there you feel so much of love for them you like to give whatever you have today what is that word that software quality when goes and embraces all others also that is called circle so this sattva quality the best quality that you are having utilize that this sattva quality sadhu-sanga and the scripture with this tree with the help of these three what you should do to resolve i am going to realize from them and going to find out what is the truth and next the state the guru will say how to find it out he's a very perfect guru so obviously he is giving the goal and then giving the practices the how to do it so he said like this he's telling [Music] and if you go to in in the beginning there's a group of people who are practicing spirituality through songs they'll be singing constantly and in that baal because so they'll be composing the different songs they'll be singing and through the song they are actually praying and practicing my mind ask your mind what is the truth that is the sound and that's where it goes so so many varieties way hinduism is a unique hinduism doesn't mean that you have to go with a big plate of things fruits and sweets and candles and the incense sticks and go to the temple and give it to the priest and the priest which show it to the god and seventy-five percent he will keep and twenty-five percent you return like that and then when you were returning you were thinking what is it so this is the way if you go on a thinking then you will slowly slowly understand what is the thought what is the truth what is the truth he says [Music] so easy to understand at least the indian languages the mostly we understand it it says that always hold on to that unchanging reality and how [Music] expanding expanding expanding so don't try to go without anything to waste time calculating that just like that unending but it is there the truth is there and such means which never changes australia hold that all the time so what is the practice we have to hold to that truth which is unchanging in living and non-living beings and things what is that consciousness the consciousness it is present in everything everywhere all the time it never changes so so many in the society where we see if we read the history so many things will happen one after another and so many things will be happening one after if it goes on like this then what is their consciousness it is present so you have to hold on to that jared it is not possible for ordinary people to constantly think on that i am that consciousness is very very difficult it's good to listen to the vedantic talks but it is [Music] but to practice it is better to go for twitter so god is there god is another god is eternal god is there so like that we have something to hold on that is easy same thing we are doing but we are taking some help but those who doesn't take that help the god bless them this is very difficult very difficult so ordinary people should not venture to do that but sometimes when you listen to that which is what is great i will constantly close my eyes and think that i am not the body i am not this skin i am not the bone i am not the man who i am the supreme consciousness better when you feel happy with what you do then you have to go to the kitchen and to say mother is there anything after eating again you have to practice them but who is eating them it is not that it is not possible you have to understand where is my position i always say so when we are trying to climb the top of the mountain maybe the mount everest of course we can do why not but for that first i have to be physically strong i have to practice the physical exercises becoming physically strong secondly mentally very strong third i have to know the technique because there are different type of instruments are there so you must learn how to use that and then you should have a proper the guide will take you why not you can but follow these step by step you can but the same thing you can practice through and that is exactly what bhagavan suramar krishna introduced you know after i think in the next month there is a there is a talk the sudama krishnas began how it is [Music] and it is so easy to call mother instead of father we can always love father so obviously he started the praying to mother mother those who break the background and yesterday one group of people that began to study circle they were having that i was listening so nicely they have their their whole life of bhagavan's rama krishna part by god they were reading you also did over here and at the same time some songs so beautifully they presented what is the praying to the divine mother and when he realized the truth what he realized the oneness only the light we have to be it's not the image but it is the consciousness in the form of light it came and krishna was lost in that so from doing the two earthquakes it is easy that's why he asked us to practice that is devotion with knowledge with the devotion without knowledge sometimes it creates problem because you do not understand what is work we just go on practicing that without knowing actually what is happening the result most of the time is very difficult to get because we don't have the idea where actually what is the dessert so you go on practicing religion going to the temple going to the church going to the mosque going to the synagogue but not knowing actually why will it come to develop love to develop unselfishness we don't know so all the time we are going over there and if anybody is saying oh this is not good immediately we are ready to go and kill them is this religion we have to understand that and if we know that we are going to develop love unselfishness eternity then only it will be easy for us to [Music] what is the eternal truth that consciousness that eternal consciousness when it is there hold on to that then to elaborate we ought to analyze analyze and analyze and what is the present all the time consciousness the consciousness is constantly present the guru wishes to giving an example by as i was telling by telling the story of jannah and you will find at that period of time the king jana was a very famous person why he was a king he was ruling the country he was an administrator at the same time he was a rishi completely detached like the holy monks that is the greatness a wish he can always do a holy person can always think about holiness because for that only he has dedicated his life one bombed wrote to master the mother i am taking the name of god all the time so i think 10 000 times i am doing but i didn't realize taku taku is not giving any russian the mother asked the person who was writing the reply write to him he's a monk he's supposed to go on taking the name of god what else he will do that is his job that is his duty why are you going on asking like that is nothing not big thing but if a householder is taking all attending in all his duty at the same time taking the name of god for three thousand times that is the great achievement what a mom should do every time he is supposed to take the name of god and after oh you know i have done ten thousand french [Music] and for that society is feeding you giving you clothing what else you should do so this we have to understand to hear the narada [Music] at the same time he was a great thinker and how it happened in his life now he's reading the story that one day the king janaka of the day that the kingdom so he was just wandering in a palace garden in those days naturally now also if you go to a king's place the guardians are there the jannah was scrolling inside suddenly he heard a holy person praying and jonatha got interested now if the sattva is not there had it been rajah then the jannah would have passed these guards hey what is it who is shouting over here i am storing i am taking a walk why that man is shouting over there while he is praying ask him to go and in the dhamma they will say arrested man how come that he is here in my god it goes to but immediately became curious to know what he said he went close by and he was listening the holy man was telling oh we meditate on the self which is pure please this is the point this is the word please what is the ultimate goal of religion please so that holy person was praying actually encouraging himself reminding himself we meditate constantly on please the joy of happiness second he said we meditate on that cell in which the objects are reflected first he said oh we meditate on that self which is pure please second he is mentioning we meditate on that cell on which all the objects are reflected in so all these things we can see but on what it is a reflection all the things that we see is nothing but the reflection but for the reflection we need a needle we need something on which it is reflecting that is brahma that is the sound the holy person is mentioning we meditate on the self which is the nature of pure please now we meditate on the self in which the objects are reflected we meditate on the self in which everything exists belong which is the cause of everything so this is the way he was praying so this is the way those who are following the path of gyana they practice the those who are purely following the path of dhyana how they practice this is the way constantly reminding they don't meditate the meditation means subject object i am meditating but they don't like to think that i am so think of it so subtle and then they cannot be the puja how can they because they don't have the conception of duality the god is separate i am separate i am offering the color to god they will never do it but how they will practice the spirituality they will go on reminding themselves i am the holy self which is the cause of everything and which is the nature of peace eternal will go on oh we are sorry for them who now that person is saying we are sorry for them who having known the worthlessness of the objects still remain bound at the heart to them now other prayers was all right but the last one as if the janaka paid it is for me and he took it very seriously listening to that listen wise mom one should strike down every craving with the lord of wisdom don't allow the craving to arise that the holy person was going on praying he was reminding himself the path of gyana is nothing but reminding [Music] there's another story sometimes how it happens then one gentleman he was a rich man and every evening he used to go to some pub and to drink and to enjoy so that that evening also he was doing when he was passing something he hard the one mother the addressing her daughter to start burning the barsam arsenal's dry plankton heaps and sometimes in some parts of bengal they call that dry plankton leaves as basma so now it is already late oh deer form but the mother she was indicating the muscle at least the dry planted leaves got that because we had to warm the water they will wash our men and we have to wash the clothes this time when he was passing harder and immediately came to him personal i have to burn it is already late it is already evening my life i was 60 years now how many times many years i am going to leave still so many disasters still i'm going to that park oh no fire me then immediately he left and he went to below it's true he went over there and he purchased a lot of land constructive building and started living over there practicing meditation [Music] a huge hospital at the same time he acquired that blood of land and maintaining his mother's shrine so that is there so this helps the way you are talking suddenly one word may touch and immediately if the is there if not if the satyr is there you're going to advise me you know who am i that is the problem come on of course the in other ways they react it is in the beginning itself the guru said you must go to a holy person you must study the scripture and apply your name and then only you will realize the truth and what is the truth which is unchanging in all these changes constantly things are changing but you must know there is something which is completely unchanging what is that unchanging consciousness and if you cannot conceive that consciousness the idea of god god is always there without any change [Music] this is our the king janaka this janaka then started pondering for that is true hearing those words of the sage the janaka became very sad ah me i still could not overcome desires now the story the guru is saying to sri lanka the study of germany [Music] inspiration hearing those things he was a holy person and his words was carrying the truth and the moment he heard janaka because he was full of satwa he truly started acting positively in the parables of the jesus he said sometimes the people they are throwing the seeds and the seeds will go in a dry place on a stone maybe it will fall and just dry it cannot sprout unlike that it may fall in some places where it will also get lost like that like if it is falling on a cultivated and good [Music] similarly all the good words and the teachings which are given not that the reaction is always there in every night equally no according to the nature of the people when the is their qualities are there this king janaka was a swat thing so when he heard with the last word we are sorry for those who having known the worthlessness of the objects still they may bound at heart to them worthlessness of the object that's true now so we go and we see and then our pictures have no use we take so much of another photo of us and nowadays you don't need any camera your phone is this camera so you're going on taking the photo then afterwards you'll forget where that goes or you delete because it is becoming the loading the device so that much again you go somewhere again the same thing goes on repeating it goes on in that way it is worthless the hearing that he says the word janna could say i still could not overcome desires alas i am bound without a chain i am bound without a chain apparently there is no chain there is no rope so what is binding us desire so i am bound without the chain flying on me and my disregard condition oh my king janaka said to himself abandon your craving for sense pleasures so that you may be rid of the suffering of repeated birth and death o mind this worldly life cannot give you true happiness hence reach the state of equanimity and experience please the janata understood what is the goal who is the place and what we should do very simple we should have to detach our mind from the worldly objects not that we will give up the worldly objects not like that we should detach our mind from the [Music] and it is so simple and who will do it the person anyone else not even the god not even the scripture not even the guru it is the person only [Music] [Music] [Music] only those wars someone was dealing he heard it and then what he started immediately he started analyzing what is the analysis all these things as a king whatever i am doing is worthless now all the kings all the rulers there is very few kings even the kings are there they don't have that mystery power nowadays but mostly the administrators all over the world 199 countries so each and every country is having someone ruling [Music] each and every one is thinking i am going to rule it for [Music] on the same chair on the same throne somebody else has to seat and after him somebody else will sit and he'll be hanging somewhere in some corner as a portrait as a picture and if they are kind enough to give some information about him it's okay or after 100 years when the people will come and say who is this bad looking person maybe over here so this is the condition this is the wretchedness what [Music] why just for the play again god is coming as the guru and he's giving the teaching and that was recorded that was going on so it is like this it goes on the game goes on like this so he said oh my this worldly life cannot give you the true happiness hence reach the state of beginning and experience peace reflecting god's king janaka rose this is very important so our guru he wanted to tell rama the reflecting gods the king janaka rose and leaving the heart and home family he went to the jungle no engage themselves in the royal duties without any attachment to them before that the story says there's a few pages are there that his bodyguards are coming and telling the old sad you have this duty you have to go and take back and the people are waiting you have to go to the temple please still waiting over there like that like that all this i'm not mentioning here all those things details the janaka he was pondering he was reflecting he was understanding then he rose up not to leave the earth and warm but to go to his duty that is exactly what is the main thing our guru kushista is trying to give to rama why rahu is the am king supposed to take care of his duties if he is living like that then there will be turmoil and when there is no the equilibrium in the society could uh their rules in the society what society will break down so the king should be there and what they look like he was so steady in performing his duties at the same time on attached o rama than the king guru stated king janaka continued to rule his kingdom remaining forever in the consciousness of infinite the king janaka he knew that i am that supreme brother constantly but at the same time is going on doing the work this is the beauty that is exactly what he said again and again that is exactly what shawnee introduced in the modern day society previously when the buddhism came all this world is nothing but the suffering that's true comes along that's true and what we should do give up i don't know whether god put the same or not but most of the people who are not capable to give up those who are having so much of desire in the mind they also because as you were saying because sometimes in the society it comes like the tsunami a great wave of ideas and let us go and fight over there let us do things and most of the people are carried out like that and afterwards they were nowhere and similarly the wave came and thousands of people followed the majority of them were not ready for that and what happened they suffered they ruined the whole system also the one should not so what they should do this is very clear the janata fast understood the truth then he started practicing as a ruler become the introduced karma yoga only about that what is the karma the great path whoever comes to me and wants to study and start start the spiritual life i always advise go and read the karma the karma yoga is very very necessary otherwise [Music] [Music] [Music] himself in the royal duties and the guru says king janaka continued rule his kingdom reflecting forever the consciousness of infinite he never brewed over the past nor did he worry about the future he lived in the present always happy that is called sannyasi the sannyasa means if you go on protein my father is to be so rich person and i used to read on that i was having this many certificates i could be someone now i have become a mom it's better instead of going on taking all those so i need someone always with me what this art will happen at the best do you die and even if the all the best doctors are scattering the we doctor or data doctor why bother them depend on yourself and the began to say don't depend on anyone this is a tremendous power and when you are doing something good good will happen obviously that god's grace will come so he's saying he never root over the past not did he only over the future he lived in the present always happy when the inner light is kept alive it is not affected by the darkness of outside constantly if you can see the god is sitting within your heart constantly whenever you are closing your eyes you can see that light is sitting over there that's all whatever you do whenever you go with whomever you mix only sometimes close your eyes mother yes [Music] [Music] reserved to realize now you have heard how the janaka resolved and similarly reserved to realize brahman inquiring to the nature of the self has generated the general directory is very famous in our spiritual life majority of the spiritual people is to go to jannah [Music] because that knowledge and how we can say that he was a great person no attachment sometimes some people may say but you have a lot of attachment will be constantly worrying about the future where am i going to be elected next time what will happen [Music] you are always very happy you are not bothering about the what is religion freedom and if there is a bondage then it is not religion at all constantly thinking what will happen what will happen and going on the stranding of that once a very rich man came to meet bhagavan krishna and salam krishna and this narendra modi 17 18 years old he also was there talking with his nomination and sudama krishna was industrial which is a few miles away from calcutta since to go back to calcutta that rich man told naren do you like to come with me he was the ambassador of the nepal king can you imagine the ambassador of the nepal king he is offering can you come you can come and sit with me [Music] why because [Music] this is the way we think [Music] then you are not a pure soul name again god is saying if the god wants to do it it will be done it's not don't bother about it is god's job no [Music] [Music] [Music] again and again taking different form and living the life death and birth and death and the like that it goes on this will have this no problem those who are thinking knowledge and now i like to be free from this one days of birth and death for them there it says the guru washington this is simple the seer and pressure the object of the scene the thruster and this that object this is connection if you connect with that oh dear anger means apart so rama you are my part so he says oh dear it is just if you have the connection hankering attachment to the object who is the next time he says means the brahmana this means the object bashar and if the object [Music] not attached to that but he was a great ruler you know was a perfect ruler so this is the way if you can understand who dear when the seer gets connected attached mentally with the worldly objects it is known as bondage mentally physically we have not god basically sometimes we don't get but mentally we go on thinking about many things that is the one day basically if you go and we like to go faster how it is that we see it doesn't matter you go and see the five [Music] [Music] that you're wrong so this is very difficult externally we can show up but what is internally the internal things he says that when the seers here means that i my consciousness connected attracted mentally with the worldly object it is known as bondage and when the seer is not attached with objects that is spiritual freedom there is freedom spiritual freedom completely free when you are not attached to that this is so simple so easy and at the same time you are completely free from suffering the moment you are attest to something or someone then you get detached it is so much of suffering so much of suffering but if you say no it is okay i was not knowing this person then some it came to my life and then we became friends now they are going out okay can you be there then you are completely free you are enjoying the company you are enjoying the friendship you are living together but at the same time you are not at all actors that is called the pure spiritual knowledge and one who can develop that is a dream this idea has been more clearly mentioned in the began the dim division there's a book called they are going on meeting without the team going on beating constantly the same idea what the seer the consciousness and reach of the object they're completely separated can never be together because one is consciousness and another is reflection now if we say the mirror and the things reflected on the mirror are saying no the mirror is reflecting the whole room with the people the chair everything but they are not connected completely different similarly the consciousness on which all things are reflected they are separate trick the consciousness threshold the object though the two for the two these are two objects they are completely separate to each [Music] the seer and the scene are completely different by nature the seer is brahman pure consciousness and the same is maya illusion this is the declaration of all the began the scripture then he said o rama that does not reach the state of utter tranquility the mind that particular mind cannot reach to that ultimate tranquility till these two impulses acceptance and rejection are eliminated acceptance and rejection are eliminated then sometimes some people they will go on practicing in the beginning we can appreciate but then they'll be going on practicing don't touch me don't look at me don't come to me and if the female the women's are coming they'll [Music] [Music] i'm accepting and rejection no no no you should not come but then the lady will say but i have got to check hundred thousand dollars immediately you will go and see yes hundred thousand means [Music] i should say read the biography of krishna no acceptance no rejection whoever is coming to him [Music] that is pure religion no acceptance and no rejection the people they are coming those who are not in that way that those days are they used to say they are not good people but for sure it is all right [Music] accepted no problem so no acceptance no rejection that is the tranquility we have to understand this no hypocrisy i can be hypocrite and i can say i am these i am that [Music] [Music] so what is the liberation i am consciousness and all the objects that i see including my body are bishop are the objects i am not connected with that but i'm not rejecting that dude it's okay as long as it stays thank you friends let us say uh three times [Music] oh
