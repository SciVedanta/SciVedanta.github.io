[14. Yoga Vasistha - You and Your World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfZaKPpdUOo)

namaskar dear devotees and friends today sunday we'll be discussing about the yoga bhashishta and very interesting topic today about the world so let us begin with this matra i salute the supreme brahman who is beyond all qualities tranquil beyond the limitations of the directions space time or objects who alone is the embodiment of infinite consciousness and who is to be known only through the proof of one's own experience this every time reminds us this whatever we see in this world and with so many varieties it is only one now that is exactly what the yoga bashishta will be discussing today the last sunday we concluded by saying that mind is responsible for our bondage and our liberation mano evo the mind is the cause of bondage and mind is the cause of liberation what is the cause of bondage illusion the mind is deluded and that is the reason it creates so many problem and we find that we are bound i was talking with the person and she was telling that nobody likes me i told how do you know it no they are behaving like this they are behaving like that so i'll for a long time i discussed with her and then i told i don't think it is like this so why you are interpreting the act of love as an act of hatred for me they are talking with you asking you to do like this or to behave like because they are concerned about you not that they're going to control you not that they're going to punish you when she was telling the experiences i felt that it is all positive but for her it is all negative and she goes on crying for that and she bitterly started crying no you don't know nobody likes me how to bring her out of that of course the psychiatrists they talk to them they have different type of examinations but this is a if you go to any hospital there's a lot of people going and consulting with this type of problems we i'm thinking that it's behaving like this and i cannot stand like that i am suffering so who is suffering me why because i am thinking like this and who is the thinking my mind and this is my reason i am thinking in this way so friends this is the the very practical if we look at our own everyday experience we will understand this the scripture how correct they are how perfect they are long back when i was in andaman i can remember in those days one lady she was preparing some food maybe reading from some book and she'll be preparing some new dishes and she'll be very respectfully inviting me shamija i have prepared this new dish will you please come i'd like to share this so the husband and the children and other friends i will also go but a neighbor her neighbor she was not liking it that i am visiting her i am not visiting to them and she once called me and told do you know what she says tanjo what that she says oh swamiji eats everything that i give that means that she wanted to maintain gluten i eat everything i told he said she says like that that is great because mothers they always like that their cooking is appreciated by the others those who are eating maybe that she is telling like that i took that positively though the lady i could fill that's trying to create problem but there's nothing so that is the way if we try to deal everyday life we are always the gainer why should we lose we should gain and sometimes if we are not capable to convince the person or it is unbearable better to avoid by that way we have to keep our mind free from all those because it is our life at present we are thinking that i am surviving and i am swami shatman and this is my life these are my people who are appreciating me or criticizing me so these are all whole world so i and my world you and your world so this is the way we are creating our world and here in this world i have to survive happily this is one stand and we will go to another where yoga vashishta will take us to a very higher stand but that is a real difficult place so we are bowed and when we are bound we suffer we are bound for some objects different type of objects that before us and we try to grab that and when we can't do that and we suffer we think that it should be like this it should be like that it is not happening so we suffer so friends if we analyze we will find that all those problems that creating really suffering for us is nothing but our own creation because i am thinking in that way to suppose something i tried but i could not achieve i was not successful and if i think well this was not meant for me this okay maybe something else is waiting for me i will try that so i we have to understand karma siddhi they give and explain a beautiful story and the story the name is the father of the father of shoma sharma you have to remember the name of the story otherwise you won't find get the idea now what is it that we are creating our own world through our imagination and sometimes we are happy and sometimes we are not so suffering the because of the cause the cause is we are imagining building our on the castles on the in the air so that is the reason here the story says like that it was the time of a feminine it goes in the yoga bar shishta we are studying sarah yogavashishta sara the chosen the best philosophical the codes that we have taken that we mainly as reading but sometimes we go back to the original book but a lot of stories are there this rishi bashista is telling those stories and it is 32 000 slokas are there actually in the book and here it is nothing few so they have chosen some of the philosophical quotes and the this is the book swamijirishi wrote and that is a translation but here i am going to the original book where the bashish is telling the stories why and he is telling you bashistarishi rashida is telling to the rama or rama you should accept these stories listen to these stories they're very interesting you know why the stories that gives the explanation of the truth now what is the truth i build my castle in the air and obviously it will break and then i will suffer so who is suffering me why i created it this story goes like this there was a brahmin young boy and he was highly ambitious but very poor and it was a feminine time no food anywhere somehow he collected some a little portion of flower and maybe a pound of that and he was very happy then he sat under a tree and started imagining as because he was little tired he went into half sleep condition he was imagining now this is a very costly thing that i am holding in my hand so this i can sell in the market and with that money i can purchase some cows and i can develop the cows and then i raise some of the bulls and with the help of those bulls i can cultivate the land and then from that land i can get lot of the grains i can sell those grains in the high price in the market and then i can build a beautiful house for me then i will marry a beautiful girl and i i will have a son and the sun the name of the sun should be sharma up to that all this imagination he is only having a little flower in his hand and he is imagining that he has a son etc etc so that is the way it goes so this is the way it goes then what happened that he is imagining my wife is not taking proper care of my beloved son and then i will punish her the why she is not looking after my son and to punish that imaginative wife when he raised his hand the flower fell and that there was a wind and it scattered everywhere and he started crying oh ho ho so this is the whole story and what we learn from the story everything that we make imaginary and that is the reason we suffer the one lady she was blaming me that i was not allowing her son to marry his son used to come to me and say swami i don't like to marry i like to join in the ramakrishna order etcetera etcetera i told wait wait wait because but she he used to go to different people and all that i told finish your job and let her see but the mother one day came to me and told say because of you my son is not agreeing to marry i told are you sure that after his marriage you'll be happy but that is the only my husband passed away long back i raised my son and now i am almost old and i don't i am a widow and if i get a hassan's wife my family will be so happy i told i don't have any objection i am not saying yes or no to your son nothing only think twice think twice before you give to marriage no no no no okay his son came her son came and told the swamiji what shall i do until you decide i cannot say then afterwards he decided and i knew that he won't be able to become a monk because he has some weaknesses i told it is better that you become a householder anyway he be married and after the marriage exactly after two months then the same lady came to me and told oh swamiji please tell my son that he should not listen to his wife no because the wife is creating so much a problem every day every moment it is it is my house and i can't say anything the wife says from now onwards this is my family i should decorate in this way i should cook in this way i should invite these people this is all the story they are in every household now we imagine that we will be happy and then we suffer and when we are suffering we should not share it with anyone we should be brave enough to say this is my fault and i am going to suffer that we should say like that so world is like this you and your world that is the topic today you end your world and if you are imagining the son has married now their young couple let them enjoy the life they let them go to visit this place that place no problem for me i was all alone and i'll be and the son told that we will keep someone another lady to help you that is very good then like that if you could do that i am talking about that lady the she could be happy but no she was thinking the wife uh her their daughter-in-law will be very like this like this imaginative and now like the father of the sroma sharma he never married he only imagined that he married and then he has a son and he gave the name of the son shoma sharma and because of the shoma sharma all his dream and his imagination broke and it was the suffering friends why this why this story the the great rishi bashista is telling to us because this is the way the whole life goes hence it is you and your world guru basista to teach this truth he is telling the second chapter 15 verses yeah as the children they suffer out of fear fear of death why because of imaginary ghost oh something is there they will imagine and they will be so much afraid they will cry the imaginary ghost as a fear of death that much suffering why just imagining that there is a ghost and they will imagine and not the only bala many people that they imagine about the ghost and they will suffer it is really very difficult so many is the people telling that as the children they imagine about a ghost and they suffer and suffer means suffering is almost like the suffering of death that much pain they suffer why just imagination same way and ignore in mood ignorant ignorant person suffer considering this world as real considering this world as real so friends from here suddenly he is taking us to a very higher plane the rishi wants to say that there is no reality in this jagat in this world so when i'm pinching i feel that the pain when i'm pinching myself i feel hungry i feel tired i feel happy seeing my friends all those emotions are there but still they say this vedantin the ultimate vedanta they say there is no creation at all you are unnecessarily imagining so this is really really very difficult and we should be careful when you are studying we should not mix it up it is the ultimate truth maybe that this moment we won't understand but doesn't mean it is not true so that is taking that for a just we are studying this we are trying to understand but this moment it may be very difficult sometimes the children they come they listen about the god and all that and they'll be asking questions also but do you think they're very serious they really understand no because it is beyond their capacity it may be some of you may be able to understand but it may be beyond our capacity to understand though we are leaving this is my family and i am talking to you world is going on everything is going on still we are discussing the world is not there why the rishi said no it is true but to understand the truth we have to develop ourselves the very first verse every day before studying when we chant it says that through your own experience only you can understand what is the proof of the brahman your own experience no one can prove it no one can say anything about it whatever may be the example we can quote but it is only one's own experience the world is full of misery almost many almost all people they're experiencing it but the one thing they did for that they suffer do you think they'll stop over there oh enough is enough now no they will go to do the same thing again they will repeat they will repeat and they will repeat why because they even though they are experiencing the problem even then they will go on doing the same thing that is ignorance and time will come not that they are going to eternal hell that conception in the hinduism there is no eternal hell again they will come up again so there is a story of jayathi in the mahabharata this yadathi was a great soul he was a very powerful king and but he had strong desire to enjoy this world then he became very weak because of the old age then he started thinking what if the god give me the blessings i can get youth once again in my this body so the god told okay you have your sons your three four sons and go and ask them if they like to share their youth with you it's okay then first second third the fourth one then he said okay father no problem you have given me the life and you want to take that for your own enjoyment i don't have any object take my youth so he shared his youth and don't ask why how etc this is a story is like this he shared that youth and then this man enjoyed again another say 45 years 40 years then he realized no desire is still burning again the same type of desires are there through yayati he made a statement you can never ever satisfy the thrust of your desire by enjoying the objects it is impossible a time one should have to stop and say enough i have experienced this i have experienced this i have experienced this and now i know that this has nothing bhagavan he demonstrated this you know he was a very wonderful master very wonderful teacher he demonstrated and people they used to invade the rich people why in those days say 200 years before the society in india particular calcutta the that was the capital of the undivided india at the time of the britishers the rich people they used to smoke most of the people this to smoke so they used to smoke and they will be smoking from the hubble bubble that that was cover hubble bubble was made of the either it's a gold or silver something like that costly and that man with a nice dress you'll be lying down half lying and you'll be smoking a little and poor people from distance they've to say oh the great joy if i could have that suramar krishna to demonstrate that it is nothing he told his disciple mature babu who was also a landlord mature can you please arrange like that as you people the rich people you smoke half lying down and then smoking i like to enjoy that motherboard arranged sadama krishna put on all those dresses then he lie down on that then the half lying he smoke hey there's nothing the same type of  then another side then on his belly he lied down then on his back he lied down and every time he was smoking and stood up through everything and said mind this is called smoking from this the gold hookah the hubble bubble the silver hookah that's there he said so when we are experiencing immediately you have to understand also the futility of this experience otherwise every time when you go on experiencing and develop more and more and more and one day we will die unhappy a miserable person so what is the goal goal is to be happy why we should be happy because happiness is our nature we are born out of the happiness so our goal is not to become a doctor or an engineer or a professor or a great scientist or other administrator our goal is to be happy the one person now is very unhappy in the whole world he is the unhappiest person what to do he got everything but dissatisfied so because of the dissatisfaction he can never enjoy the period of time all that oh i was there and i'm happy this is enough i have experienced it no so this is the teaching and as we are imagining the children are imagining and then they are suffering similarly asap eva akadam the ignorant person considering this world as real considering this world as real he is suffering bashish today giving more example i am not quoting those verses from the sanskrit it is second chapter 16th verse yogavashishta shahar yogavashishta is a big book i am repeating because some people go on asking i am not finding this verse yoga vashishta is a very big book 33 i think 33 32 000 verses yogur washington mission the heat read that book and took out all the philosophical verses and he made that compose that we are reading the sarah but sometimes i am going to the original now it is from the sarah second chapter 16 and 17 verses he says suppose a person does not know what is gold if that person finds a gold bangle it will be only bangle for him because he doesn't know what is gold wonderful example suppose you do not know then there is no nothing for you that bhagavan suramar krishna gives the another example and if you read the gospel of sirama krishna there's so many examples to explain this thing in a very simple way there was a very costly stone lying at the side of a pond the villagers never knew what is this and they used to clean their feet rubbing on that stone and what happened one day one jailer was passing through that he went and he saw that stone oh my god he thought to himself it's so costly so costly i can make a fortune out of this then if they told the villagers can i take this oh yes you can tell there's nothing like that they were there we are only cleaning our oh i will make a nice another stone for you to clean your feet i am taking this one the villagers never knew that is so costly so that is the way it goes costly means that is we think that that is costly otherwise nothing suppose you do not know that there is no problem so this is the way that he says and the 16th verse he is having a gold at the bangle with made of gold as because he was not aware of the gold it is only a bengal suppose we know in that way in this world that this world is nothing but brahman it will be the world for us only if you knew the gold so it is so costly i have to keep it properly and like that we are living over here and we do not know that this is nothing but the brahman the consciousness which is which never changes which is eternal and the source of bliss souls of joy and i am made of that i am living in that why should i suffer this world and the creator this is the only problem in the whole any philosophy you go the philosophy of the kant or hegel or the vedanta abhishe wherever you go the discussion only centered in two things the creator and the creation the creator is the god creator is the brahman creator is the atman creator is the self like that it says and the world out of that creator so now here we are walking from the path of the knowledge that is vedanta and vedanta is giving us this example that suppose you know that this is a golden bangle how you will behave so similarly if you know this world is nothing but brahman how you will behave the brahman is all pervading is all consciousness and will you then go for some little thing and cry if you can't get that so this is the teaching similarly a person who is a parama orthodox artha drik unable to unable of seeing the absolute truth will find this world as city building trees mountain like that this is nothing but the consciousness but he doesn't know as that person was not aware of the gold the same way we have to understand that we are that brahman and we are absolute no question of suffering and who is suffering why so this is the way the vedanti and they teach you are the one who is having all power you are the master you can do anything anytime just say that so this is goes on like this unable to seeing unable of seeing the absolute truth will find this world as city building etc instead of brahman the eternal all-pervading consciousness the world exists because of consciousness in deep sleep no world a dead body doesn't feel the word because of the consciousness otherwise how can we feel so that this is the argument of the vedantin they say there must be some substratum on which this is reflecting if there is no substratum how this thing will come it is not possible you are observing an object an object must be on something otherwise how can you say see this you cannot so this is the way i and my object and also there must be something for which i can see the object suppose in a dark room someone is very dark peach dirk and someone is so close standing before me i won't be able to see i am there my eyes are there i like to see but i won't be because there is no light so some condition is necessary that similarly when we are observing this world and it is changing constantly when it is changing how it is possible for me to understand that this is changing it is going on changing so i must be there and observing like this then only i will understand that the person who has observed that he can say friend don't take it seriously because it goes on changing again go back to srama krishna for the example that he was telling that there was a one person came and told i went to that under that tree i saw that there is a lizard a lizard type of thing is there and its color is fully gold golden hue wonderful next mental oh no no no you are making a mistake it is completely red i saw the same lizard then another told no why do you talk like that i went over there a few days before i saw that it is green so it goes on they were arguing then a person came and told sir i live under the tree i know that lizard and that is constantly changing the color all of you are correct but it is going on changing the color in this world also everything is changing and how we are understanding that there must be something permanent like the man who are sitting under the tree who knew everything all the changes some permanent things should be there and what is that permanent it is brahman it is consciousness so we are imagining thing on what brahman now stop imagining what you will find so we are thinking that it is a bangle but then if you are thinking that this is gold then it will be gold there will be no bangle maybe the shape will be like that but it is gold so brahman is like that the world exists because of the consciousness if the consciousness is not there the nothing can exist one can be said to be both real and unreal now they are going to give us some other way out to understand it is real when the because reality the consciousness which is its own reality so it is real the real because of the reality of consciousness if i am not saying this it is not to me so some person can see these or hear something but the another person standing over there can't see or may can't hear because maybe defect in the eyes or in the ear it may be so naturally from different point of view it is the consciousness that is giving us the idea of all this unreal because the world is constantly changing it is not independent if it is independent it will never ever change now this table maybe after some time it will it will naturally it is old and it will be we will throw it in in the and then it will be once again it will go and merge in the mud and water and all that this table the table form the wool will never be there it can never change if it is real something which is real will never change this is the idea as because the world is changing it is not real and why we see that because of our consciousness and this from that consciousness we are thinking now we have to change our thinking process the truth the consciousness is eternal and that is the reason anything which is changing cannot be eternal and when that is not eternal from the vedantic point of view it is not truth so if we go for those which are changing constantly so obviously we will suffer so that is the main idea now rishi bashist explained this again through another story and the story name is akasha ja james is a born out of space akasha space born out of space akasha there was a holy man he used to meditate all the time and slowly slowly many years passed and the officer from the yoma loka came and told sir it is time that you should come with me that means you should die but he was meditating this officer could not approach him it is impossible to go so close to him too near to him wondering who is it that is not overing the command of death everybody is dying anyone is born is surely to die how come this person whose name was akasha ja is a born of space jam means birth jaw of the akasha is not at all aware about the death and the death cannot hold him so the officer went back to the yoma and told said why this then the yoma said we don't kill anyone they die because of their karmapala yama he is telling his officer that you must know that we are not killing anyone don't go and say that is time for you to die no how you know that it is time you have to go and shake his karma fella and if you see that the what that he has done and the result is now that he has to die then you can say well it is time for you go and find whether he is having any karmapala officer went back akasha was not having any karbapala any result of work he was eternally pure and why the karma why the action comes because of desire when the desire is there i like to eat these so i go i purchase then i eat so if the desire is not there no action all actions before that when you start before that there is a desire there is a planning this man was not having anything naturally the officer he was thinking then what to do he went back to yama again and reported to him no he's not having any karmapala then the yama said he's not born so how you think that he'll die aka this is akasha he has not he has not taken birth at all he's eternal so through this story this our rishi is telling sri rama that this is the world that you see it is your own creation and this creation if you think that this temporary thing is permanent then you suffer whoever will think in that way and if you think the temporary thing is temporary there's no problem you can just this go you can go so this is the way he's thinking akasha think we are born we have body our world and ends up thinking we die we create in this way i am born i have the body and this is my family and this is my world this is my society and one day i die this changes i see because i want to see when there is no desire there is no karma when there is no karma there is no action and no result when knows the result is there you are there eternally and what is that eternal thing is the consciousness so this is the way we have to understand we are really pure consciousness what is this world a throbbing arose in the creator and that thought spread out as the universe it says like this a throbbing that arose and that spread it the vedanta also says that there is a creation how the creation and different philosophy say the that it is the creation philosophy means the three questions you have to answer who is the creator what is the creation what is the relation between the creator and the creation so these are the three questions and they have to answer vedanta they say as if there was a thought arose in the mind of the creator who is the consciousness the brahman as if he said i am alone i like to be maini here in the yogavashishta it says there was a throbbing and the throbbing that created by the creator spread it out and as if a universe was created this throb made only of thought this throb made only a thought hence beings are only appearance as we see in our dream and that when we are thinking different bodies are coming in our dream and the dream is like this so today morning jokingly i was asking given young boy what what dream you have seen in in your last sleep he couldn't imagine until now imagine and then write down what is the dream the dream means our imagination and in that imagination i think it is real i am conversing i am hearing sound i see i smell i taste i feel fear i feel joy as if real as if and our experience says when we get up from the sleep there is nothing so the bidantins say that creation that you see now it is like that who created the creator the brahman the consciousness as if why because of the thought as we create our dream world so he also as if thought and what is this world then thought only either it is not real once again as the dream is not real for us this world is not real for the creator and for us of course it is not real because we are made of that thought and we are consciousness so this is says this throb made only of thought hence beings are only appearance this appearance is imagined to be real as we while dreaming we accept the object of the dream as real be in the world but not of the world then one can enjoy the world then it suppose we are in the dream we are enjoying the dream sometimes and in the dream sometimes you can feel oh i am dreaming so at that time if your mind is there alert i am dreaming you enjoy the dream you're not affected by the suffering or enjoyment whatever you are not affected by any desire so that way if we can survive now the rishi and today we will conclude over here the rishi says this is the 18th verse of the second chapter [Music] anandamayam jagat [Music] for every one sentence immediately an example to explain to the ignorant august knowledge not ignorant so for the ignorant the world is full of suffering full of suffering but to the knower of truth the world is full of bliss anandamayam jagad example is giving to a blind person on them the world is dark bhuvanam andam the for the blind the whole world the is nothing but the darkness but to be a man of sight so it is effulgent so this is the difference now sometimes some schools of buddhism they say the jagat dukkha the whole world the world is full of suffering that's correct but to whom so that is also another question but here the vedanta says particularly the bashishta he says if you understand these that this world is made of the brahman you can enjoy it so that's why he says gyasia those who are the man of knowledge anandam so many things are happening there's nothing that as we see in the movies and the movies we are watching and we are enjoying so many things are going on happening as because we are not affected and we are very much aware that this is nothing but a movie all imaginative and with the person is suffering inside the jungle nobody is there and when we are children we think it is true and used to say what will happen to that man then the groan of our guardians is to say who is taking the photograph the man is moving in the jungle he's all alone and he's suffering but who took the photograph he's with him so don't worry so like that when the someone some people are always there they are taking the photograph it's a movie so we are also like that friends this is the vedantic outlook the creation is like this a different outlooks are there like the duitin they will say god has created this universe and we are all made of god now the god wants that you should go back to god and for that there are some things are there that's called religion some do's and don'ts are there do this type of thing don't do that type of thing and by that way you prepare your mind and one day you can go near to god saluka all this in the dualistic point of view vedantic point of view well you can go and merge in that consciousness the moment you will know that this is nothing but the consciousness you become the consciousness yourself so you go and merge into that so this is these are the mainly two the ways one get and why we should know this to give beyond suffering if you are not knowing this every time we come we'll be suffering only whether we believe it or not whether you like it or not oh this is not scientifically proof so we are not accepting it is up to you but this is going on happening and it's going to happen why because the cause and effect this goes on doing like this and this is our mind so let us conclude the wise knows that brahman which is consciousness is only exist and brahman is bliss but the ignorant imagined duality on brahman and suffer against dukkha anandam jagat why the augustus suffering because they take it as a real and they suffer but the god the man of knowledge let's take it that this is very very temporary and things are going to change in reality it is all brahman and brahman is bliss in our next class we will discuss about the brahman the rishi bashishta will tell us what is brahman thank you the first question is from sanheeta banerjee she's asking how we should avoid worldly attachments in this life there's a very good question you know that problem is attachment if you are leaving is no problem the problem we're together we are living the the husband wife children the brothers sister parents family all this together we are living no problem problem when we get attached to that now the attachment is the only problem and how to go out of it then if we can constantly go on thinking that this is so temporary and it is going to change any time any moment it can change we do not know so i i was hearing uh the yesterday someone was telling the one sister and the brother they just they have gone to the college completed their higher grade education and and the school and they joined the freshmen in the colleges the mother suddenly they found that very advanced cancer and almost in no time she passed away it was a terrible shock for this then the father somehow were collecting everything and the three they wanted to survive one day the father came back hardly a week or ten days at the passing of the mother after that the father came back from the office and he was not feeling well he told that i am not going to take the dinner it uh ate a fruit and lie down and never came up because a massive heart attack now what will happen to these two boys this two children the sister and the brother so this is any time anything can happen whether we like it or not anything can happen so if we go on thinking that everything is so temporary we won't be affected by this this is the only way thank you the next question is sagnik he's asking why my mind is bounded i create my mind i create imagination so who has created me the lord is free so why my mind is bounded or so much attached to the objects a little that another to your question that you have tried well to formulate that if the lord is afraid then how can i be bound that that will be the specific question i think shaknik so it will be the lord is completely free and i am also free but the thing is i am in this form and doing all this because of my karma when the first that we started each and every being even an ant it was having a karma so in this birth it is an ant and that is the belief of the hindus and i am a human being because of my past karma and how to prove that i was born in a family my father and mother we were two three brothers of same parentage same schooling same environment growing up why then we are different one brother is thinking in this way another brother in thinking it is a third brother thought in that way why because the way they reached to their 16 or 18 years old their all their own karma started activating this is the way we can understand so suddenly everything gets changes so our birth because of our karmapala now sagnik our only idea should be to understand this we can go beyond our karmapala by practicing that i am completely free from any action and i don't have any desire for any object of this world and that is called tapasya in sanskrit austerity i have to constantly go on taking out all the any desire coming immediately throw it out no i don't want i don't want like that only you can go beyond this and then we will realize as the other rishis they realized that i am also the brahman so sagnik is asking very similar questions two more questions he says does karma exist if yes how do we make believe to karma second related how to be free from suffering or from sadness so i think i have given you the answer the karma the hindu and the buddhists they believe the karma is there and otherwise you cannot explain the why so many things are happening that the effect without any action if it cannot come suddenly there are some waves suddenly no there is a wind strong wind passing that's why the waves so there must be some action and because of the action the result so we are the result of our past actions the karma and if it is a good karma because of course the result will be good so that is three types of karmas are there all these details we have already discussed in other lectures but karma is there and the karma follower we have to go beyond that by withdrawing our mind from the desire from the same subjects the next question also on karma srima bishwas she is asking what is god's wish what is karma how are we going on the right way question one and how are we going on the right way right how are we going on the right way yes are we not yeah so this is we are going in the right way because when we are studying the scripture that all the scriptures dualists are the modest all the scriptures the vedanta every time telling that it is only our desire that binds we are also reading over here today the karma is there as just now i gave the answer the karma is there the karma follow is also there karma means action the action means reaction is also there and without that how to go beyond by constantly thinking that everything that we see is nothing but temporary so i should not spend all my energy to grab this to have this and should not feel miserable if i don't get it constantly discrimination krishna says go on practicing practicing practicing all the time and renouncing renouncing all the time now that i am aged things will change the day will come when i don't need all these so why so much of clothings so much of shoes so much of these and that let me distribute it let me be free because i am going to die and if i by leaving distribute it it's good and when i die people will come and grab it and take it whether i like it or not so this is called discrimination and i distribute and make myself free and wait for the call of the death and when the death comes as the ravindranath said in bengali modern wraith or death you are just beloved like my god i am not afraid of you so that is called preparation and we are going in the right directions the next question is from a mishra she's saying when something unacceptable things happen how we will be stable is a very practical question so we are discussing all uh that this is this and that but theory one thing practically is another thing so to for that one should be very very intelligently we have to handle that's why bhagavatam krishna said jason so you have to handle you have to behave behave according to the person you are handling and jakhon jamun tokun according to the situation according also the space the place so that is the way one should be very practical bhagavan sirama krishna gave the wonderful uh the stories the many many stories are there let me tell you one the guru said the god is present in every being all they heard then these brahmacarians the disciples they went to the forest to collect the and suddenly they heard that someone is shouting the elephant is mad it is coming in this way go away go away hide and save your life all others they deflate from there only one brahmacharya told no guru told that each and every being is having the god within this mad elephant is also having the god within why should i be afraid of the god let it come and the elephant came it is good good luck it didn't kill but he just threw him so he was very seriously injured so they took him back to the astra and then slowly slowly he came back to consciousness and the guru ji asked him my dear son why you have not fled from there everybody saved their life why you were standing on that the particular place where the that elephant was coming but you said sad that every being is god well i said elephant is god of course but the person sitting on its neck was shouting the go away the elephant is mad and i cannot control it why you didn't listen to that god so this is one should be very practical so this is a theory and now you have to understand in which situation you are and from there only you have to act accordingly we are monks we don't have any bondages we are not under control of anyone so obviously our behavior our way of dealings are completely different not that we are arrogant but we are unattached but in the family you cannot do like that when your son is not eating oh i'm on a test let the sun go like that and the little child doesn't know when to eat and when to sleep and if you are not taking care he will suffer no you cannot do that so obviously you have understood the according to the condition and the situation you do and something when it is very very unacceptable it is better to avoid that place and the person as best as possible thank you let us say three times the shanti shanti and we conclude three times o shanti okay
