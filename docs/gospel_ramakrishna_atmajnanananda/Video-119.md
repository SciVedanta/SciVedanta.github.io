foreign [Music] Souls they're praised by Poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls foreign welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of ramakrishna we are on the chapter I am at dakshinesh work part two it is Saturday January 5th 1884. this is the 23rd day of M stay with israma Krishna dakshineswar and we're on page 380. it was about four o'clock Raquel and several other devotees were listening to a kirtan by m in the Hut at the panchavati now this is an unusual thing and was very very shy he didn't like to sing in public uh Krishna encouraged him and would sometimes tease him hefties and have scold at his his shyness and then encouraged him he uh he had bought a book of songs of ram Prasad and kamalakanta and was learning them them and that's ramification was very happy to hear that so this is a big thing m is not making much of it but it's a big thing for him to be leading to kirtan with with the others there of course the others were younger Raquel we don't know who else but he's probably uh in the panchavati so this is a nice thing Raquel went into a spiritual mood while listening to the devotional song after a while the master came to the panchavati accompanied by baburam and hadees so they weren't there at that time they they came along with him other deputies followed these are all the people who were staying with ramakrishna at that time and different people stayed at different times so Raquel was with him at that time Harish was with him baburam I think it recently come to stay and M is just finishing that long stay at 23 24 days of the stretch rock out how well he referring to him saying kirtan for us he made us all very happy the Master's saying in an ecstatic mood oh friends how great is my relief to hear you chanting krishna's name yeah used to say logic he was against these three things to uh to have too much of shyness to get embarrassed too easily and everything and then hatred and and fear these three things he said one shouldn't have to the devotees he said always sing devotional songs continuing he said to love God and live in the company of the devotees that is all what more is there he said again and when Krishna went to mathura you showed they came to Radha who was absorbed in meditation afterwards rather said to yashoda I this is a famous study they're all different types of kirtan the one types of kirtan is when uh SRI Krishna leaves brindavan goes to muttara and the reaction of the gopis and mother yashoda and everything afterwards rather said do you show the I am the primordial energy see Radha was absorbed in meditation that means she's not in her ordinary state of ordinary State of Mind she just looks upon herself as the Beloved or Krishna as her beloved and she is the as the lover of that relationship I am the primordial energy ask a boon of me would other Boon shall I ask of you said yeshoda only bless me that I may serve God with my body mind and tongue of course she means mostly her Krishna it looks upon her uh not her biological son but she raised him as her son that I may behold his devotees with these eyes that I may meditate on him with his mind and that I may Jan his name and glorious with this time but those who are firmly established in God may do as well without the devotees that means that uh they can be with the drawn they can enjoy their own company they're not dependent upon anyone else as ramakrishna was like that he loved the company of the devotees but if he was alone immediately he would go inward he would have the communion with God dwelling within with the Divine mother but those who are firmly established and God may do as well without the devotees this is true of those who feel the presence of God both within and without sometimes they don't enjoy the deputy's company we see this in the case of different times we see it with uh in Swami turian we see it with Swami Shiva the the those three in particular that they went through different periods even during Tucker's life when they didn't come too much they didn't they didn't especially want to mix with anybody even other devotees certain stage of spiritual life this may come but people just want to be alone they just want to go deep within they don't want any type of disturbance at all sometimes they don't enjoy their deputies company you don't whitewash a wall inlaid with mother of pearl the lime won't stick now what does this mean sometimes they don't enjoy the devotees company you don't whitewash a wall inlaid with mother of pearl the lion won't stick anybody yeah I think what he's saying is that even the company of devotees is nothing compared to the company of the Divine the divine presence dwelling Within and uh even that will be a little bit like just covering over something we're trying to bring some the holy company when that divine presence is within something like that it's not terribly clear to me yeah the master returned presently from the panchavati talking to him Bangla if it is all right sorry everyone it should be right here somewhere you want Chris now soon nothing nothing special just uh it must be yes um adage huh so do I yeah okay when the master returned presently from the panchavati talking to M Master you have the voice of a woman can't you practice a song such as this that meant he had a little bit of a high voice for me also had the high voice there's a funny incident where there was some in the early days when everyone had funny ideas about this and questioned whether these are real sadhus young men they could be working and having a job maybe they're a bunch of Thieves who who knows what they're doing there they wanted them heard and it sounded like a woman's voice singing so they said ah now we've got them and he went and it was a Swami shot her down there he had a high voice like that yeah can't you practice a song such as this tell me friend how far is the Grove where Krishna my beloved dwells that means on the singing uh uh the words of Radha herself 2m point you see my own people have become strangers ramlal and my other relatives seem to be foreigners and strangers have become my own don't you notice how I tell baburam to go and wash his face the devotees have become relatives this is something that I think all of our close devotees understand this becomes this isn't something we don't have to explain to other people this becomes very very clear I I know I have I have seven Grand nieces and Grand nephews and Grand nieces I like them and everything but all of our summer camp kids I love those kids I feel much closer to them than they might offs the whole family of course parents are different but uh but still we we really formed a family relationship with the other deputies who are following the same path the same spiritual mood and everything you're very close close-knit is very important people wonder uh how to get that feeling in the center we have a different way down to centers how to to Really build up a center I always feel it's important for the devotees to have a relationship among themselves to also feel this this kind of family relationship not just with the center with swamiji and everything but to have that interconnectedness with everyone all part of one the same family looking at the panchavati I used to sit there if this is where he did so many spiritual austerities practice so many different spiritual moods I used to sit there in course of time I became mad that phase also passed away yeah this does he used to say it's not the real Madness it's divine Madness the uh he even questioned his own sanity that he would go months on end with hardly sleeping he would say sometimes he went six years without hardly eating anything and and the Sleep left him completely sometimes he said he would try to close his eyes with his fingers even to make him sleep so people thought he was mad he also thought he was mad he questioned his own sanity this is when the brahmani came and explained that no Roger had all of this Jake and he then he was very much relieved and this is uh one of the reasons of course we see a deeper spiritual significance but one of the ostensible reasons why uh he he married his uh his brothers and his mother all felt that uh if he were married that would bring his mind down worthy duties and everything that he could lead a more normal type of life and he agreed of course he agreed for not because the reason that they thought but uh anyhow that's the story behind how they arranged his marriage with the holy mother so he really acted like a madman in those days even even later a Mad Men are a drunkard that very often he would use that language that he would real and when coming down from that state of ecstasy people would have to hold him sometimes he would get annoyed don't hold me up they'll think I'm drunk if he was in a company of this gentlemen these well well to do people of Calcutta so looking at the panchavati I used to sit there in course of time I became mad that phase also passed away kala Shiva is Brahman that which sports with kala is Kali the Primal energy this is one way to understand the meaning of the name Kali we also understand is is a black color but is the concert of shivas is known as kala kala means time color means death in college because everything uh comes into existence in time and it's destroyed in time time is the great destroyer of everything so Shiva has that name also so kala and Kali Shiva and uh and Kali kalashiva Brahman that with sports with Kali is Kali the Primal energy Kali moves even the immutable saying this the master saying my mind is overwhelmed with Wonder pondering the mother's mystery the very name removes the fear of Gala death himself beneath her feet lies mahakala yeah this is this is a reference to the image we find in the different Kali temples that you'll see Shiva lying flat when if you see the dakshineshwara Kali Temple you will only see the matted locks of shiva's head when you look straight on and mother Kali is standing right on his chest anyway this is supposed to be that Union that between this uh Brahman and its power of colleges that that power and she has to be in contact with him to have that uh to to have that power activate then he said to him today is Saturday and Tuesday footnote Saturday and Tuesday are regarded as auspicious days for the worship of the Divine mother today is Saturday go to the Temple of Kali as the master came to the Buckle tree he spoke to M again this we we generally think of this philosophy of Shakti and everything as belonging to the worshipers of the Divine mother but these worshipers of Krishna and Radha have the same philosophy that Radha represents that Shakti in Union with Krishna who was the absolute and they'll use these different terms the same way would have been Brahman in itself that'll be this pure Consciousness and chit Shakti the power associated with Consciousness and generally means power to project the universe but here it's in general whatever power they talk about Jiva Shakti the power to enter into it uh different types of manifestations of that same power this is this is how that one reality is looked at from two different points of view and it's always male and female we this is a very common theme here and so so Krishna will represent purusha and Radha will represent so we'll have both meanings it'll have this philosophical meaning as as nature or that manifest manifestation and also the female to receive them but really male and female but also these philosophical meanings so the purusha is the chidatma and paracudi is the chichakti SRI Krishna is the chidadma and SRI Radha the chit Shakti the devotees are so many forms of the chit Shakti this is why they say in brindavan there's only one purusha we have that story when mirabai uh went to brindavan and wanted to meet sanatana group group Swami and he was a very Orthodox person of the manner of renunciation and caitanya David was very strict about the mixing of men and women so he didn't want to see her because he was a woman and then she said Oh I thought everyone that there was only one purusha SRI Krishna and everyone else was so he heard that in a little bit embarrassed and then he met her afterwards anyhow this is the story so the from a practical point of view this means that practicing this look upon looking upon God as the Beloved it means that we think of ourselves as the uh like the gopis the love they had for Sri Krishna so the mood that a little counter-intuitive for men to think of themselves as women worshiping Shri Krishna but talk with did this of course he practiced this and uh he said that this removes from from men that uh a strong identification with a male body this is one way to realize ourselves uh as as Beyond gender he didn't recommend it uh too many people his mother Baba uh is not something we generally he recommended either or shantandro he's looking upon oneself as a child of God where is the servant of God friend of God others he said or all all of these are good relationships but these are the two that he seemed to emphasize most so the devotees are so many forms of the chichakti they should think of themselves as companions or handmaids of the chichakti srirata so talk with did this this way but he also did it thinking himself as a handmade uh attendant of of madurga when he stayed within mathura's house this is the whole gist of the thing after Doug see it also ramakrishna ties together the very deep philosophical uh meaning behind all of this and the devotional element yeah but he goes what's more important is that ecstatic love but but he he also wants the devotees to understand the philosophical significance also after does sirami Krishna went to the Kali Temple and was pleased to see M meditating there the evening worship was over in the temples the master returned to his room and sat on the couch absorbed in meditation on the Divine mother M sat on the floor there was no one else in the room the master was in sawati this of course was a very common feature for him after the Temple of worship as soon as the sun went down this this period of dusk Twilight uh was a dangerous period for him he could he could go into samadhi at any time with some ecstatic mood he began to come gradually down to the normal plane now this picture he's there it's about the m is the only one in the room yes sitting there watching him but his mind was filled with the consciousness of the Divine mother in that state he was speaking to her like a small child making unfortunate demands on his mother he said in a piteous voice mother why haven't you revealed to me that form of yours the form that bewitches the world I pleaded with you so much for it but you wouldn't listen to me you act as you please he had so many Visions in so many different ways what he's referring to exactly we don't know and uh and how serious he is about complaining to mother Half Heaven just having fun with mother the voice in which these words were uttered was very touching he went on mother one needs faith is he hardly aware that M or anyone is in the room and just talking to the Divine mother one needs faith away with his wretched reasoning Let It Be blighted this vishwasa it was one of the things that takur emphasized tremendously that I not the type of Faith where we just accept dead things without questioning them if we want to have real conviction I like the translation conviction better if we want to have conviction about something then we have to really uh analyze it question it and make sure we understand it and we have to have tremendous faith in those who tell us things that we haven't yet understood or experienced so we we can develop a certain type of conviction by analyzing things but is not the same as having the experience so the other thing that we do is we see those who have experienced these things or who have made tremendous spiritual progress who can speak with some Authority or scriptures some Authority and we have faith in the words so generally we have two terms viswasa is means that we have reverence for all of these things whether we understand or not we with the great humility great reverence uh we we follow the words of the scriptures and of the teachers and Google's and everything in order to develop deep conviction so this conviction comes towards the end has to be there at the very beginning about this deep conviction of the truth of these things it comes through a little experience a little experience and when we see him observing the life of Sharma Krishna he sees that he won't say anything that's not true he won't say anything that he hasn't experienced he won't tell anybody to accept something that doesn't make any sense so m is developed this Shanta for the words of srama Krishna in the beginning he questioned things but after the second meeting he said thankfully this was my first argument in my last argument with him so after that and it's not a question of just saying that I understand look at charmedia he argued with ramakrishna but he never lacked in your head that tremendous reverence and faith in him that he didn't just say oh this is nonsense I don't believe any of this that he would argue in order to understand and surrounded Christian like that he was very appreciative of that of that attitude so conviction doesn't come unless we analyze things the the type of conviction that Jess says that I it's written in the scriptures and I heard in Guru say it so I accept it that's not based on anything else can easily be overturned we ourselves have to analyze these things and think deeply about them if they don't appeal to our sense of logic now I did logic is is the final but if there's something about it that doesn't make sense to us then we have to continue to try to understand better some things won't make sense and by the very nature of it these are the things that these uh uh things this uh how this Maya Works some of those things we won't understand but very simple things we get instructions uh meditate morning and evening why morning and evening we can argue if we wanted just to be for the sake of being argumentative but we see how such a long tradition and how these are sacred times and everything we developed some conviction we do it ourselves and realize yes there's something special about these times these types of things he went on mother one needs Faith away with his wretched reasoning so this is this is a very strange very hard to to know where to draw the line this talk would use the same word of each other when we should just say enough of this these things are beyond the ability of the mind to understand and when we should say that no I have to keep trying to analyze and understand these things but it's a a very fine line between these things is so so strong with M and don't reason anymore promise me you won't so strong with him because he had that type of mind he thought too much and others he says one constantly reason what is what is a value what is not a value they're a little bit different Realms one with the reason about other things we understand that are Beyond reason but still uh it's when we do this we try to part of this discrimination is what really is worth reasoning about and what has to be left aside what can only be experienced if it's something the truth of which can only be experienced that we have to go beyond the mind to experience it then we leave it aside if it's something that means we have to sharpen the mind and intellect then we work on that and and we have to know which is which CM question certain things when he first came to srama Krishna if we it's really surprising uh at least for me it was very surprising uh I had this automatic assumption that uh during taqwa's time that any Hindu would accept reincarnation would accept some Scholars would accept the avatar I didn't realize how strong the influence of the Brahma samaj and and Christian missionaries and everything was that many questioned those things and it took a long time for him to accept this idea of the samskadas and even rebirth one time he asked will it harm me if I don't have strong faith in this this idea rebirth that talk was it enough if you understand that everything is possible for God he left it that way but then later of course understood all of these things swamiji also because they from the Brahma saman's tradition they didn't like a lot of things they didn't like there's a guru idea they didn't like this uh Avatar idea these two things especially away with his wretched reasoning let it be blighted one needs faith faith in the words of the guru childlike Faith mother says to her to her child a ghost lives there and the child is firmly convinced that the ghost is there now this faith in the words of the guru Cocker also says you have to examine the life of the guru before you accept anyone observe by day and By Night make sure that the life is very pure and they're really a person of high realization once we've done that once we've accepted then we have to uh if we've really accepted them and and then they ask them to do something we should do it without questioning it too much if we really have that conviction they won't ask us to do anything that's not good for us the mother says to her child a ghost lives there and the child is firmly convinced that the ghost is there again the mother says to the child a boogeyman is there and the child is sure of it further the mother says pointing to a man he is your elder brother and the child believes that the man is 125 percent his brother one needs Faith now remember he's talking to the Divine mother but and now I think he's very much aware that m is there so it's really for M but still talking to the mother uh one needs Faith but why should I blame them mother what can they do so this will be m in the these Western educated uh disciples that came to him it is necessary to go through reasoning once yeah once we understand something this uh say I I've come to this this uh firm conviction that the cells Within is covered with different parties that that makes me feel that I'm separate from that that real paramatman that that's my true nature once I've understood that realize that I don't have to keep that keep going over that over and over and over again I have to assimilate it I have to live according to it I have to act on it but I don't have to keep going back and read reason once I've understood it once it is necessary to go through reasonably once didn't you see how much I told him about it the other day so this would be it was the only one in the room but it all proved useless ultimately not useless but that meant that it took a while before I am could give up this habit of questioning everything the master was weeping and praying to the mother and a voice choked with emotion he prayed to her with tearful eyes for the welfare of the devotees mother may those who come to you have all their desires fulfilled see this Gospel of Swami Krishna this is something really that we have to we have to uh Place ourselves there if we if we can picture these scenes taking place it's dark the sun has just gone down maybe the lamps are lighted there m is alone in the room with them talking to the Divine mother saying all of these things How uh could could have both of these things at the same time this this tendency for the mind to be absorbed in the Divine mother and this tremendous love and compassion for the devotees as soon as the Mind comes back down talking to the mother about the devotees mother may those who come to you have all their desires fulfilled now what does it mean all desire is fulfilled it means fulfill enough desires so that they don't have any more desires that doesn't mean endless desires we keep having more desires keep feeling and no that fulfilled desires it means to end them come to an end of our enjoyment but please don't make them give up everything at once now takunu which of his devotees were were fit were destined to lead lives of monks and which were destined to leave lives of the householders I am uh not that he questioned his his Longing To Be A monk or his his renunciation but he he felt that it was good for him and good for others for him to remain in the world that that he would represent a special example for others of the ideal householder who had the the mindset of of the sanyasan but please don't make them give up everything at once mother well you may do whatever you like in the end if you keep them in the world mother then please reveal yourself to them now and then otherwise how will they live how would they be encouraged if they don't see you once in a while but you may do whatever you like in the end there was an earlier conversation with the Divine mother and was there and sarama Krishna says to the mother why did you only give him a portion this of spiritual power he said oh now I understand with that it'll be enough it's not clear that it means him when we were reading this this other uh and was saying that he was talking about him and about the role that he had to play that with that little bit he'll do great work and disservice to to the world through this gospel not just through the gospel so many came to him many of great monks of our order uh when they first came to Kolkata they went to meet him uh so information on the d uh he was he had read the gospel to ramakrishna and the first thing he did when he came to Kolkata was to to find out where M lived and met him others also that he was really so highly revered and he would turn everyone to surama Krishna we we know that several of the monks were his students also the Swami version and some others and this there was a whole group of them that used to go to ramchandra that is uh there's a garden house is uh uh and looked upon him as a type of a guru whether he actually gave initiation to them or not he used to give initiation it seems but M said to them yes that he's a great deputy and everything but you want to understand ramakrishna then you go to beldermott actually that burn on the door and you meet the monastic disciples so he encouraged so many who later joined the order the master was still in an ecstatic mood suddenly he said to him look here you have had enough of reasoning no more of it promise that you won't reason anymore and with folded hands yes sir I won't Master you have had enough of it when you came to me the first time I told you your spiritual ideal now what was in spiritual ideal we get glimpses of it in different places throughout the gospel once one place Robert Krishna asked him and he says yes I like both this soham idea and I like this idea of the servant of God and everything and then we read not too long ago that Survivor creatures does very clearly yes that you're a worshiper of Shakti so what he told him in the very beginning we don't really find that uh he gives you of course beautiful teachings and everything but uh we we can say with certain uh what things M decided not to write down he kept his diary there may have been things that he considered too personal once or twice a few places we we have suggested uh Krishna explained something to him and he doesn't say what it was you know just leave it that way anyhow this is a very beautiful this part when you came to me the first time I told you your spiritual ideal I know everything about you do I not and with folded hands yes sir now remember this is the end of this long stay this long period where he's really molding him he's making him the perfect instrument for the work that he has to do yes I know everything what your ideal is who you are your inside and outside the events of your past lives and your future do I not am with folded hands yes sir master I scolded you I scolded you in learning that you had a son that we remember that that when uh M first went to srirama Krishna they had their first long conversation and takur asked him are you married and then he said yes and they said oh I'm loud he's married and then thought oh is it such a sinful thing and then he said do you have children and then said he was shaking at that time that he had to say yes children he said oh Ramadan even children then later he explained you see I see good signs in you I see science of of them being a yogi and everything this is why I thought maybe uh you'll be fit candidate to you know he was waiting for all of his his future monastic children to come Rock College already come they're in the head come earlier but just a few had come at that time so I scolded you and learning that you had a son now go home and live there now this is another theme that runs through the gospel um uh right before he just before he met ramakrishna he decided to leave home he was very unhappy he couldn't get along with his father his father had married again mother died he had Brothers there who weren't very spiritual the older brothers and they would make fun of him and it would joined family so he was very unhappy he decided to to leave and he even thought of taking his life so throughout the gospel surrounded Christian is saying that now you're you're alone that you you have to look after everything for yourself if you can go back make up with your father and everything and live there happily you your mind will be a little free to do your spiritual practice so it was back and forth a lot then finally he um says yes I'm going back and taku was very happy so and then later he'll move out again and uh so this this is a kind of a theme that runs through now go home and live there let them know that you belong to them but you must remember in Your Heart of heart that you do not belong to them nor they to you so this is that uh mid-servant idea that we live in the world as if everything belongs to us family positions and everything but we know that deep down that everything belongs to God and that we have our own real family you can say uh in in the Divine this is a real home aims that in Silence the master went on instructing him Master you have now learned to fly so he really really considers uh that this was a the end of this training period how many days 23 24 days pretty important you have now learned to fly but keep your loving relationship with your father can't you prostrate himself yourself before him and with folded heads yes sir I can Master what more shall I say to you you know everything you understand don't you M sat there without uttering a word Master you have understood haven't you and yes sir I Now understand a little Master no you understand a great deal Marco's father is pleased about his staying here now why does he bring this up huh it seems like a non-sequitur it seems a little I was wondering about this then I came up with this an idea I don't know if it was right or not but uh pakur's is is is laying the ground he's he's the director of this Leela huh the director of this of this play he's already finished his work with him now huh and now he's going to be finishing his work with raqqa and in order to do that he wants Raquel to be staying with him so now he's pleased that it's almost like yeah and now you've learned your lesson you're ready to go you're ready to fly and now all right it's good that Rocco's father is letting him stay here that now this will be a very important period for him it's just my guess huh but it's interesting when when we first read it it sounds out of place huh why does he switch from one to the other so he says now no you understand a great deal Raquel's father is pleased about his staying here because in the beginning he was very unhappy uh Taco had a bad reputation among many of the educated people there that he was turning the heads of these young boys that after going to him they were interested in their studies anymore that they were going to renounce the world somehow and so they weren't very pleased uh the render his family was really uh unhappy that he went there also we don't read as much about that we hear more about porna and some others but they they really would try to stop him and everything and so he he also had to defy his family quite a bit to go to Sri ramakrishna so he had that reputation and uh Raquel's father was a worldly man he was a kind of landlord and I we have a few different occasions when takur when he goes to see taku and talk what he doesn't exactly flatter him but he's very nice to him and he's very happy to introduce him to some other big shots those who have powerful positions and everything and so then he sees that Rocco's father likes to come everyone to the world he can talk to them about business deals and things like that Deputy magistrates uh some important people who were coming this ramakrishna yeah but if for some reason at some time uh there wasn't such a strong objection see marriage in those days is not what we think of marriage it's not that the husband or wife immediately set up a a household and family and everything like that that she was young I go how old she was 14 15 something like that and they stayed mostly at home and he would stay mostly at home and sometimes they would be together sometimes not it wasn't exactly what we think of in this country it's a typical type of marriage yeah so stay with you ramakrishna almost meant that he wouldn't lead a a very traditional type of married life he never abandoned his wife these were different times and in different uh it's not not like uh the real sannyasin who leaves home won't look at his wife again that we know with with swamiji's grandfather that after 12 years he came back to see the family that was the tradition after 12 years that there was one incident where swamiji's mother I think was in Benares huh and she slipped or something and when sadhu was there and and saw her fall and helped her up and saw that it was his what his wife and immediately turned away and ran off quickly and when he came back they thought they would trap him in the house make him come back and learn the family life so he just refused to eat or do anything just had a meditation then they thought better to let him leave than have them just die there so they left the door open and they left so we don't find that with the those who were married who came to sarama Krishna this will meet this will be uh yogin so I'm a Yogananda this would be Raquel these were the two mostly and uh even when the yogenwood becomes from Yogananda his final illness that the holy mother persuaded him if I remember correctly to let his wife come and nurse him at the end huh yeah and uh broccol of course continued uh to see his wife and son he had a son and then later the son kept the company of the monks they also shall become a monk also but very unfortunately uh his wife committed suicide and the son he had something happened he fell and got some infection or something and died at the at a young age also so they were married to Swami shivananda he was married but his wife also died very very shortly after their after their married before he came to sravakrishna at that time they were the only ones I made Dwight and of course he was much older than all the others so that's all about racquel's father is pleased about his staying here are you not pleased but at least he didn't fight against it anymore he gave his permission I guess aim remained with folded hands master yes what you were thinking will also come to pass that we have no idea and what is what this is all about and M doesn't say anything about it but obviously there was some thought in his mind at that time that Taekwondo and there's no need for them either one to say anything more ceramic Christian now came down to the normal state of mind he's still in this ecstatic State half talking to Mother half talking to him rakal and RAM Lal entered the room at the Masters bidding ramlal saying who is the woman Yonder who lights the field of battle the darker her body gleams even in the darkest storm cloud and from her teeth their flesh the Lightning's blinding Flames this is that image of mother Kali that we'll get from chandi is destroying the demons in a bit he sang again who is this terrible woman dark as the sky at midnight who is this woman dancing over the field of battle master the Divine mother and the Earthly mother it is the Divine mother who exists in the form of the Universe and pervades everything as consciousness so now again uh we're getting this the philosophical understanding of things this is one side of the Divine mother the other side is a highly personal God who talks to him who is his constant companion is guiding him holding him by the hand he hears her anklets with climbing the roof that one idea of mother and the other one is a jahili philosophical idea Divine mother who exists in the form of the universe so this is nature of this Virat this idea this whole universe uh is is manifestation of the Divine like the body of God this is a Buddhist idea but everything uh is thought of as the manifestation of Shakti even though srama Krishna says very very often that Vermin alone has become all this we have to take that as Brahman together with Shakti otherwise Brahman doesn't do anything it doesn't change it's Transcendent pure consciousness so it will be that full review of Brahmin nirguna together which means divine mother it means the Divine mother so even the Avatar Swami Krishna will say this is all the play of Shakti so that aspect of vermin which is beyond Shakti that's that's the Shiva lying like a corpse she was a sugar that way but in conjunction with with his mother Khalid that idea then this universe functions so she mother exists in the form of the Universe and pervades everything as consciousness so everything in this universe has that Divine source and wherever Consciousness is found dwelling within any living creature that's the the real presence of of mother there so this this universe projected out of Brahman and then Brahman dwells within or out of mother we can say like the spider in the web the the the web will be composed of this of this but it comes out of the spider itself same material so well there's the material codes of the universe and then the spider dwells within everything so wherever there's Consciousness that's the consciousness of of mother of the Divine mother so this is all about the doing he's talking about Divine mother and Earthly mother the Divine mother and the Earthly mother it is the Divine mother who exists in the form of the Universe and pervades everything as Consciousness the Earthly mother gives a birth to this body I used to go into samati uttering the word ma mother while repeating the word I withdraw the mother of the universe to me as it were like the fishermen casting their net and after a while drawing it in when they draw in the net they find Big Fish inside gauri this is gauri Pandit he was one of the great Scholars of tacos day he met the early early on godi once said that one attains true knowledge when one realizes realizes the identity of Kali and goranga we'll go down to here it means titanium and there's a footnote an uncompromising hostility exists between the deputies of Kali and the deputies of gauranga so the two very different types of traditions uh and it's it's not true that this uh this is uh hostility that's always there because among tacos the devotees who would come we find the equally enjoying songs to to chaitanya Deva and songs about mother Kali and everything so this will be in certain very sectarian areas some Villages and things that there'll really be some type of hostility partly because uh the mood is so different partly because with with the godonga uh everything is is sweetness and and loving and and kind and none of this dark element it was a mother Kali we have that she is the source of everything a good and bad of sorts of evil everything in this universe that uh the advice numbers worshiping oranga that they won't touch non-vegetarian food and worshipers or mother Kali constantly cutting off the heads of goats they just such a different way of approaching spiritual life that very often they just clashed that there wasn't too much of an overlap because of sharabi Krishna we can appreciate both attitudes equally both in beautiful attitudes so there are all these different songs and different Traditions about not Kali and goranga Kali and caitanya but Kali and Krishna as the identity of the two of them the very touching beautiful songs that uh uh over the mother of what happened to your your guardian of skulls now I see you're wearing your Garland of wildflowers that means it's Krishna because they both have that dark complexion is so godi wanted that means that uh that one becomes Universal that one C is the same Divinity manifests in different ways worshiped in different forms with different spiritual moods and attitudes what attains true knowledge when one realizes the identity of Kali and varanga that which is in brahmana is also Shakti so that which is Brahman is also Shakti Kali it is that again which assuming the human form has become goranga so if we say that the Avatar comes from the Shakti aspect then we'll also have that identification otherwise traditionally it will say Vishnu but Vishnu also represents one of the powers we have creation preservation and and dissolution so from uh point of view of the shaktas that'll be also from Shakti foreign the human form has become godang at the Master's request ramlal sang again this time about godonga yeah to me it's so interesting we have sometimes instances where uh the Durga Puja is going on they happen in surendra's house all the songs are about gauranga the old Christian songs and everything then finally the end surrender says we're super mothers should we have it these ones are good and then Takara sing some songs about divided because uh Taco is my and there is no difference and just depending on what triggered something in his mind what the mood was Master 2m the nitya and the Leela are two aspects of the reality this is the absolute and the relative we can easily understand that from one point of view that says say we take a a ocean from one point of view or river one point of view with water everything exactly the same another point of view that the river will have a certain course that he takes it'll have Banks it'll different colors if if any of you have been to allahabad the triveni if you go to where the ganga comes from one side and Andromeda from the other side they're two different colors the one is like a light gray and the other light blue and then they mingle together but the water is the same from the point of view of water There's no distinction whatsoever so the one are the same it's not that they're two separate rivers or anything like that from the point of view of water There's no distinction from the point of view of the attributes the appearance we can make lots of different distinctions so this is this absolute oh we have the same thing with shankarachary yeah this is we can see things from the absolute point of view the Roman alone exists even the scientists they can they can break everything down to to energy yeah go to to just a combination of atoms and things like that they won't deny that everything has a shape and a form and a color huh just looking at it from two different points the same chair looked at from two different ways so the nithi and the Leela are the two aspects of of the reality God plays in the world as man for the sake of his devotees this is that Leela so Leela also has that meaning of uh when God comes in in human form and we see this this play that all these other great souls are there and and everything seems to be in place and uh a great tremendous wave of spirituality floods the world after usually they're not recognized during their lifetime afterwards we see this tremendous effect that takes place God plays in the world as man for the sake of his devotees they can love God only if they see him in a human form this is also uh this idea of loving God that we have to have human form or at least human qualities we have to think of the God is a loving God then God has to at least have love and compassion something like that but we add a human form think of God manifest in the human form as the Avatar then we have filled some real type of connection even those those Traditions that have a formless aspect of God say Sufi tradition so if we tradition formed this aspect of God and yet God is the Beloved so the superimposed upon that attributeless nature of Brahman will be some feeling the same type of feeling that the lover has in search of the Beloved that will be there also somehow so it's not a human form but it's some humanness gets added to it so that we can relate to it they can only see God if they see him in a human form only then can they show their affection for him as their brother sister father mother or child it is just for this love of the devotees that God contracts himself into a human form yes well one way of trying to understand how that the infinite reality takes some finite form contracts himself into a human form and descends on Earth to play his Lila okay very significant this this uh these two chapters this is the end of uh M's long stay with drama Krishna dakshineswar we'll start next time with the chapter 19 the master and his injured arm page 383. um [Music] foreign [Music] who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts and sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of
