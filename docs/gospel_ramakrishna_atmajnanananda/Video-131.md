um only where you can do that um [Music] [Music] your words are like nectar bring life Discord Souls they're praised by Poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of Sri ramakrishna we're on chapter 21 a day adduction ishwar it is Saturday April 5th 1884. and uh Krishna has been talking to mostly to m and Krishna is also is also present in some others as well now we get a statement we're starting here we're on page 419 that talk where mentions many times this change in his attitude he said I find a change coming over me years ago Elation of Judah and said to me one attains perfect knowledge when one sees God in man now I see that it has got a loan who was moving about in various forms as a holy man as a cheat as a villain therefore I say narayana and the guise of the sadhu narayana and the guise of the cheat narayana and the guise of the villain narayana and the guys of the lecture this was the result part partially at least those trauma Christian's broken arm we've we've been through this several times but what happened was uh when he was on his way to the Pine Grove walking along path I don't know where exactly but there's a railing somewhere and he went into some type of ecstatic mood and he had some vision of jagannath in Puri and there's a tradition that goes all the way back to caitanya Deva probably earlier of trying to embrace the image and in his that ecstatic mood trying to embrace the image he fell down so unconscious of the external world he fell down and broke his arm and he said we've seen it several times it was as if the Divine mother were telling me that I don't see God in this state of bhava with eyes closed than somewhere else your mind isn't going to some other realm see God dwelling within all human beings so Tucker mentioned it many times and he always seems to bring in the division of children who told him earlier that this is the final stage now it's not that you're immigration that didn't see God dwelling in all beings of course he did but he went through different periods in different stages uh here he seems to be saying that rather than seeing God with eyes closed in some ecstatic state to see God with the eyes open see God dwelling within all beings and we know that this was something that swamiji reichen under cherished this ideal and when we talk about swamiji's practical vedanta sometimes we think that it means putting a vedant into practice of course it means that but this particular idea seems to be the uh the main feature in traumaji's mind with his practical vedanta this uh shivayani with looking upon Jiva as Shiva and serving so serving all living beings looking upon them as as the Divine God dwelling in in human form so swamiji picked up this idea but it it goes it's much earlier Krishna always had this idea but the change was that and now his mind was directed more towards seeing God running within all beings and we see it especially in kashipur in kashipur he's over and over again he would say that he sees prominental being seated in all women Roman old men with many different instances where he makes those types of statements so this is something that is not such a radical change a little bit of a change of emphasis this is all and and his attitude uh but even before that he always said do we only see God with with eyes closed can we see God with eyes open see Divine mother manifest everywhere but there's one particular idea each and every individual is God himself or herself the Divine mother however we understand it uh in taking human form so this is what is within all beings and also the other time some special manifestation of God in human form which we call the Avatar these are both different aspects of this not a Leela so why he mentions it here is not exactly clear but it's something that was definitely on his mind and he still suffering from his broken arm at this point that uh that lasted it was a very bad break somehow it seems very painful for him and all they could do was was wrap it with some bandage and and some type of board some splint splint in the bandage it must have been very painful foreign Ty talked about so much to see God dwelling within all the beings the divine presence we wonder how do we see God in in these terrible people we we have to distinguish between the outer covering and the inner Divine Light you know Divine Light is within everybody the outer covering will be that will be the Thomas and Radisson that review what uh hides the Divinity rather than reveals the divinity now my problem is how can I feed all of you I want to feed everyone so I keep one at a time with me and feed him that means the young devotees mostly prawn Krishna looking at him and smiling a fine man indeed to the master he would not let us go till we put him ashore we read this last week that uh M was going to accompany brand Christian and some others in a country boat and he got on the boat and it was very rough and he said the you have to let me out off he was afraid that it would tip over or something and he and he walked the whole way he got there much later than the others so as a referring to this again looking at him smiling a fine man indeed to the master he would not let us go till we put him ashore Master smiling why what happened Krishna he was in our boat seeing that the river was slightly rough now from him's point of view it was very rough their point of view slightly rough he insisted on being put ashore to him how did you come am smiling on foot srirama Krishna left Krishna to the master sir I'm thinking now of giving up my work one who was involved in activity cannot accomplish anything that means in spiritual life pointing to His companion I'm training him to do my work after I resign he will relieve me work has become intolerable no this uh is is actually what is supposed to happen this is the scheme of life and the whole vedantic tradition that we reach a point where we fulfill the duties householder duties and everything it's time to retire and to devote more and more time to to spiritual life uh it was the case with many of those who came to srirama Krishna we read about Rahm saying that he'll also do it he'll work a few more years save up enough money and then retire completely so many had that idea some do it and some don't do it for some it's just kind of a dream it never gets fulfilled for one reason or another others do it and there were some who came to ceramic Krishna who actually these great pundits were actually renounced everything left their family at home and went off to Menards or other places Master yes work is very Troublesome it is now good for you to meditate on God for a few days in solitude no doubt you said that you would like to give up your work Captain said the same thing worldly people talk that way but they don't succeed in carrying out their intention because hidden desires are there and attachment is the same thing with everybody whether spiritual or not spiritual some people they don't know what to do with themselves after they retire and other people they're thrilled to retire and they have a new life and so it depends on if the mind is prepared or not the mind is even even if it's not to lead a spiritual life if one has some desire to do some charitable work or the social service or something or even just some hobby or something then they have a nice retired life some people don't know what to do and many people they don't live that long after they retire yeah it's a real phenomenon that some people immediately the health goes down because they have nothing to to look forward to to wake up to yeah and they lose their sense of identity this happens to some people if the whole life they're a doctor they're a lawyer they're an electrician they're a plumber one day they don't know who they are they're no longer electrician a plumber a doctor a lawyer they don't know who they are those who take the spiritual life shouldn't have that problem because we know at the very beginning that we're none of those things yeah of course if we're satus we're retired we'd never never work a day in our lives there are many pundits who speak words of wisdom but they merely talk they don't live up to them they're like vultures which soar very high but keep their gaze fixed on the Charnel pit what I mean is that these pundits are attached to the world to lust and gold if I hear that pundits are practicing discrimination and dispassion then I fear them of course he didn't fear them but it meant that he wouldn't take them lightly he showed extra respect to them otherwise I look upon them as mere goats and dogs sometimes he would say straw and other things but yeah go ahead and meet them and let me know if if they have any uh humility and any renunciation and then you know sincerity or if they're simply pundits if they're simply Scholars and things he wasn't so anxious to meet them but if you thought there was some metal some stuff in them that he was very happy to meet them yeah it's amazing how uh bondage can have such a grasp of scripture and philosophy and everything and Lead very ordinary lives not put it into practice we we see this of course in uh in the West in that academic study I I had some professors I one in particular very nice man and they're very brilliant he really knew this is vedanta all the scriptures and everything but it didn't have much effect on him and his uh or regular life he had no real spiritual interested we could say it was very scholarly and he got some joy out of it that scholarly type of thing but uh how people can read these things and and not feel some desire to plunge and practice them the question in some Scholars huh is this question if uh whether karma is somehow I I don't know but but in India we find some of these these great pundits or the most arrogant and uh prideful with people because they're great learning and everything foreign was fortunate he met many of these pundits that were really good people also and he respected them yeah brand Krishna saluted the master and took his leave he said to him will you come with us no sir catch me going with you again goodbye brand Krishna laughed and said I say you won't come to the boat come in the boat em took a little stroll near the panchavati and bathed in the river then he went to the temples of radhakanta and Kali and frustrated himself before the images he said to himself I've heard that God has no form then why do I bow before these images now we have to remember that he was also very closely connected with the Brahma samaj so he also would have taken the pledge we we were talking about that the other day how uh Swami Brahman and Raquel both took that pledge and not to engage in idol worship not even image words of idol worship because this is how they looked they looked upon it and uh Narendra was very particular about these things about keeping his word and everything I read an interesting thing the other day that uh Narendra went to dakshineswar one day and srama Krishna asked has he come and they said he came he's he's out sitting outside and everything and then he said why doesn't he come and he asked him and he said sir I told you I would come at four o'clock it's not yet four o'clock so he was also also very particular about keeping his word yeah truthfulness uh yeah yeah so he was always late to his lectures but the ad was a different thing yeah yeah the the he could keep his word but he wasn't on time for things yeah he for his like when his own lectures oh yeah yeah he would show up whenever he felt like showing him he used to say there was it happened one time that somebody cerebral one of them or something say swamiji we're laid and he said don't worry nothing will happen till we get there and then he said there was a man going for execution and he saw people running to get a good place ahead and he said no need to run nothing will happen till I get there so yeah he lived in eternity he wasn't very good with yet but when he was younger and and because he had given his word where is it from where did we read that uh okay okay so so for M uh he once he came to Sri ramakrishna he really didn't have that connection with the Brahma Samantha I don't know how close he was he was close because uh his wife was related to k-shub I don't know if he was so close because he attended all of their services and things I I don't know that you know that much exactly but uh for m M it wasn't so much that he had taken a pledge but it was more that he really looked upon it as as bowing down before a clay image or stone image that that idea was prevalent not just among the brahmos but among the Western educated people in Calcutta especially he goes to the British hammered that idea into them they were idle worshipers you know and especially this mother Kali so they hated this idea and the Swami swamiji himself he used to say how I hated his his mother Kali when you had and then later he used to say is my very my own special fad that he had this tremendous love and devotion for this idea of the Divine mother mother Kali you know who was most responsible for uh changing the image of this worship of of mother Kali during this period was Sister nivedita she gave a lecture that Albert Hall I think was very very popular and was a highly educated people very well received and everything explaining all the symbolic uh elements and and this image of mother Kali and it was really quite influential at least we read that so yeah at some point M found himself following German Christians also bowing down in the temple partly because he did it but partly because uh his mind was undergoing a change also he was starting to understand this whole concept of of God with form that uh takura gave the illustration of water how we can take ice it can it can form into blocks of ice for in order for us to Worship in the form that we want to see so he said to himself I've heard that God has no form then why do I bow before these images is it because ramakrishna believes in gods and goddesses with form I don't know anything about God nor do I understand him the master believes in images then why shouldn't I too whom so insignificant a creature accept them yeah we were talking about humility the other morning huh M was really a humble person who highly learned it really and just in terms of academic things and everything highly learned but after he came to sarama Krishna he really became a very humble type of person and looked at the image of Kali he saw that the Divine mother hold in her left hands a man severed head and a sword now a lot of this goes back to the quranic ideas that she is has to kill these demons and everything that she comes out of and they have the asuras are there so there's a history behind us it's not that she goes about killing people indiscriminately these are all these these demons that she's doing to help save the world with her two right hands she offers bones and reassurance to her devotees in one aspect she is terrible and in another she is the ever affectionate mother of her devotees the two ideals are harmonized in her she is compassionate and affectionate to her devotees to those who are submissive and helpless it is also true that she is terrible the consort of death she alone knows why she assumes two aspects at the same time yeah Tucker explains Kali as a consort of color so the Shiva is known as call it time or death so the concert and uh this is that other idea that uh all of this will die one day this is not one of the Divine functions and this is a Divinity means that whatever takes place is in birth and everything is that the Divine debt is also part of that that Cosmic function so she represents that aspect swamiji like this idea that seeing the Divine in the in the Terrible and uh if we we see this even the floods and volcanoes and and tsunamis all of these things the same Divine Shakti is there so he said to nivedita once learn to see God not only in the beautiful but in the terrible and of course you read his poem the colleague the mother filled with that idea so for srirama Krishna that it was always the mother your red eyes don't frighten me either I'm a small child you're the mother very sweet so I mean you like that but he also like the other type of aspect that worshiping a mother Kali as that Shakti which manifests everything good and beautiful and everything on destructive and terrible same Shakti manifest in different ways and remember this interpretation of Kali given by the master he said to himself I've heard that keshab accepted Kali and shramakrishna's presence we we read earlier how towards the end of his life he would talk to the Divine mother now it doesn't mean he's having a vision or anything like that but this is the he had that faith that and who knows it at the end probably he did have all sorts of vision to take he was a very uh what to say Advanced so anyhow talk where he had had tremendous respect for him he used to say of all among all of those of the Brahma sahaja he was the only one huh that is his tail had dropped he could live and land as he he could dive deep he said you could say that he could really go deep in meditation Tucker observed it when he would watch the case of meditate foreign yeah but towards the end we remember that one of his disciples that said this Robin could say see just like you sir he talks to the Divine mother I talked with happy he did hear that so and remember this interpretation of Kali given by the master he said to himself I've heard that keshav accepted Kali in sharami krishna's presence is this as keshav used to say the goddess all spirit and consciousness manifesting herself through a clay image so we have two terms to ordinary ordinary way of looking things the images made of clay Are Made of Stone it means clay yeah but in Maya yeah T becomes an end Earth so most of the images for Durga and everything I mean this mother Kali of course is Stone and basalt but most of the images are made of clay they'll mold them together and everything so Taco used to say but I see this I sees the embodied of spirit of consciousness foreign to the Master's room and sat on the floor suryama Krishna offered him some fruit and sweets to eat on the count of trouble in the family M had recently rented a house in another section of Calcutta near his school his father and brothers continuing to live in The ancestral home this is a theme that runs through the entire Gospel of srama Krishna that M only met you ramakrishna because he had decided to leave his home if you remember at the very beginning we talked about this that he he felt that he couldn't live at home anymore and he they got a little they got a carriage and had their things there and he and his wife went and the carriage broke down and they didn't get to their friend's house they got to somebody's house they weren't happy and they ended up staying with his uh his nephew Institute and then it was the nephew and he was even contemplating suicide things were so bad and his nephew the next day said let me take you to a few nice places and then one of them was the temple garden and that's where he met suramakrishna so this is a theme that runs through the the whole gospel part of the time members at home completely unhappy then he moves out and from a Krishna tries to convince him to move back home and he goes back and forth a couple of times and uh so this is this is a little theme that's woven throughout the gospel this whole idea of uh can and manage to live at home with his father and brothers who didn't appreciate his his spiritual mood and his uh they just made life uncomfortable for him and he also lost his mother he had his stepmother and he was just very unhappy at home for some reason now he had a younger brother kishori who uh became a very close disciple we can say Krishna but he never mentions that it's his brother there must have been two key shooties huh because sometimes you'll say kishori Gupta then we know that was his brother but he'll never mention that it's his brother yeah otherwise the other brothers I think were older and they they would tease him and he was just very unhappy at home so am had recently rented a house and another section of Calcutta near his school his fathers and brothers continuing to live in their ancestral home but SRI ramakrishna wanted him to return to his own home since he joined family affords many advantages to on leading a religious life plus srama Krishna was a little bit traditional and we'll we'll see especially with regard to the duties that his son has towards his parents now the duties that a daughter had or different because she lives in the home of her husband and his family but the son is supposed to look after the family allow the father to retire and everything and do that so takur respected all of those types of traditions mm-hmm well to twice the master had spoken to him to this effect but unfortunately he had not yet returned to his family see he's saying unfortunately he decided not to it was a question of the good fortune or bad fortune but he probably means unfortunately that he couldn't bring himself to to do what because he wanted to follow whatever takur told him he was in in that way with things that Tako said were some of the things where mahavaki is for him you know we had a list of things that things that he called adesha things the commands to him things are called mahavakis things and statements that you have to hold up is is the highest type of authority uh in in his journal and everything he had in different categories for different things so I'm sure he felt a little guilty about not listening to ceramic Krishna about this moving back home Master telling me that you were going to your ancestor house the home and I can never persuade myself to enter that place one of the few times that he really doesn't follow tuck wood of course you will later Master why your father is making over the whole house em I have suffered too much there I can by no means make up my mind to go there Master whom do you fear and all of them so father stepmother brothers who don't know who else exactly um okay uh Master seriously isn't that like you're being afraid to get into the boat now what he's trying to say to him is that the river the water couldn't have been that rough the others went without any problem this is your mind that was telling you no it's dangerous it wasn't dangerous for anybody else and just because you're so timid and everything so it's a very nice way of putting it that I'm sure it really struck him that isn't that like you're being afraid to get into the boat the midday worship and the offering of food and the temples were over the bells gongs and symbols of the Oddity were being played and the temple Garden was filled with joyful activity Beggars sadhus and guests hurry to the guest house for the Noonday meal carrying leaf or metal plates in their hands and also took some of the Prasad from the Kali Temple yeah this Rani rashmoni when she when she built this whole Temple she made sure that any sadhus or any visitors or Beggars or guests that they could all be fed and especially sadhus that there would be some place for them to stay in in that type of compound so it was a very welcoming place and she knew that there would be some who would be very strict vegetarians so they would get Prasad from the Radha Krishna Temple from the country Temple and that would be strictly vegetarian and those who were not strict vegetarians they could get Resort from the kalitam so there were two different uh sources of food for everyone yeah yeah probably every Saturday uh at least Tuesdays and Saturdays yeah you can still see where it was yeah and taco refers to it several times that nowadays I can't bear to go there and look at it or anything yeah and now it's become fashionable in many places especially homes that used to do it that they'll substitute a squash yeah for for a goat that keeps it yeah but you know these these two people who would eat goat meat anyhow and now at least it's Sanctified this was the idea behind it yeah even bull fighting you know the horrible thing they killed the bow and everything but I've heard that they give the mid to poor people yeah I don't know if it's true I read that one time they'll distribute it or something SRI ramakrishna had been resting a while after his meal when several devotees including Brahm and garindra arrived they sat down after saluting the master the conversation turned to the new dispensation Church of Acacia Chandra sin Ram we've met many times he was related to swamiji uh he's a bit of a troublemaker we'll we'll see with this whole conversation he's always poking a little bit and he makes things interesting Taco will sometimes get a little annoyed with him but talk we loved him very much and he was tremendously devoted to ramakrishna tremendously devoted he was one of the ones he and goodies especially that were proclaiming everywhere that he was an avatar one of the early ones to do that but he also had a little bit of this Guru bhava that he looked upon himself a little bit after Sharma Krishna passed away he himself became a type of type of Guru and many came to him I don't know if he really gave the league of initiation I don't know we don't of course these things are the private things we don't know exactly but uh he brought many to uh to belarmat and everything uh average relationship with with ram and others and was caught in between because a little bit of a tug of war sometimes between the the young future monks of the order and the older householders and Emma's a householder and everything but sometimes he sided with the monks a little bit so what is what I was thinking about something anyhow okay forgot so anyhow we know with with the ashes the top was relics and everything else you know if you oh and I remember yeah that uh NM School that one of his students was something named Kali Krishna huh later began Swami Virgen and uh he noticed that during lunch time when everybody else would go to eat the them would go up to the roof and sit in in the meditation reflection and everything sometimes writing things down and everything so one day he asked him and then he told them about suramakrishnan and how he was remembering and had his journal and told him a little bit about that and then this Kali Krishna said oh I also know about srama Krishna he said how he said we go to Ram chandra's place all right so M said to him that's wonderful he's a great devotee and everything but if you want to really know who ceramic Krishna was you have to go and read the monastic disciples so M sent him to to meet uh swamiji and Swami brahmananda and everything and then of course he became one of the great monks of our order he took initiation from holy mother and sannyas from swamiji and was one of the presidents of her order I never knew it I just read it the other day he's the brother of Surendra yeah surrender we hear so much about get into that we don't hear so much about him he doesn't show up as often but he was also very very devoted to sarama Krishna yeah and Robin would have been friends because Robin surrender were friends and they lived near each other and they both had these garden homes and the conqueragachi area almost next to each other conversation turned to the new dispensation church this was the name that Keisha gave when there was a split that after that big Scandal that he had married his daughter when she was not the proper age to this uh the family of the Maharaja of kuch Bihar then there were a lot of people who thought that this is very disingenuous that here he said of this organization and they have a aged girls shouldn't be given in marriage before that age and he broke that and everything so they left and there were two different groups and he started to call his new group this new dispensation but he died shortly afterwards it wasn't in existence very long I don't know and what happened afterwards any old conversation turned to the new dispensation Church of Acacia of chandrasen so really it's the same Brahma samaj who would had to give a new name to it Ram to the master now you will see that I'm always poking sir I don't think the Navidad has done people any good if Kesha Babu himself was a genuine man wife or his disciples left in such a plight I don't think there's anything at all in the new dispensation it is like rattling some pot yards in a room and then locking it up people may take it to be the jingling of coins but inside there's nothing but pot charts Outsiders don't know what is inside Master now he's saying all of this he knows how much attack we loved Keisha yes I don't know why he's doing all of these things but anyhow that was his nature it was Rob's nature Master there must be some substance in it otherwise why should so many people respect geisha why isn't Shiva not honored as much as keshav now another strange relationship how takwa talked about the shivanat all of the examples that how we love to see Chief not we won't talk about them when we see him we're so happy and everything but at the same time he would say he doesn't keep his word and now he's saying that uh really he doesn't attract people the way keshav did and everything so that was another interesting relationship why isn't Shiva not honored as much as Geisha such a thing cannot happen without the will of God so taqwa really felt that uh well had some special uh some special spiritual power I won't say that he felt he had that command from God that he talks about because well we'll we'll see he always felt that though if people really wanted to be these types of acharyas or preachers they should renounce everything that always be endowed with households and you have he'll talk about that uh hey here it is but a man cannot act as an acharya without renouncing the world people won't respect him they will say oh he is a worldly man he secretly enjoys lust and gold himself but tells us that God Alone is real and the world unsubstantial like a dream unless a man renounces everything his teachings cannot be accepted by all some worldly people may follow him led the life of a household hence his mind was directed to the world also he had to safeguard his family interests so giving his daughter in marriage to such an aristocratic family really removed or all worry and everything from him about her future and so that that Kaku never criticized him for that he said to the duty of the father to Revenge a good marriage for the daughter he didn't care too much for uh the age I think was a few months short of their I don't know what it was 16 or something you remember I think she was just a few months no I don't think 13 15. I think 16. anyway we can check 14 would have been too young yeah I think yeah I think it was 16 and she was 15 in in some months but I'm not sure anyhow uh but but for the for the other members of the Brahma samaj it was a very big thing and this Vijay Krishna goes for me he was also a very truthful and simple person it wasn't that he was talking for some reason to be if you feel seeing ketchup we're very close but he also felt that this was a little bit of uh translation of the of the rules so this is ramakrishna speaking he had to safeguard his family interests that is why he left his Affairs in such good order though he delivered So Many religious lectures what an aristocratic man he married his daughter to inside keshop's inner Apartments I saw many big bed steads yeah we know that last time that he went to see Keisha that he was taken usually he was taken to the inner apartment where other men outside men are not supposed to go non-family members but uh this was the one time where all the women in the family could have his company so he always did that when he went to visit the householder devotees so inside kship's inner apartment I saw many big bid States all these things gradually come to one who leads a householders life the world is indeed a place for enjoyment now Tucker will very often say this world is not a place for enjoyment this is a world this world is a place for Spiritual practice but what he's saying is in in the eyes of most people that would lead aware of their life in order to make some money and have some enjoyments in life from ketchups and inherited those bed States when his ancestral property was divided and for keship to take part in the in the division of property see again criticize whatever you may say Sir Vijay Babu told me that keshab had said to him I have a partial manifestation of Christ and godonga I suggest that you declare yourself as another one of the uh Companions of caitanya do you know what else he said he said that you too were a follower of the new dispensation who's he talking about of the case of it said that all left Master Lefty who knows but as for myself I don't even know what the term new dispensation means who will know what it means it's uh kind of half a technical term half a nice interesting term or something but unless you know that this was the Brahma samaj it's not something that any Bengali will immediately know exactly what they're talking about keshav's disciples say that he was the first to harmonize again I'm getting advice master and surprise how was that what the end of the of the ramayana now he could mention so many other things even go back to Gita and everything and so many other texts that we have and did a nice blending of foreign it is written there that while praying to Rama not other said O Rama Thou Art the Supreme Brahman described in The Vedas thou dwellest with us as a man that were pierced as a man in reality Thou Art not a man Thou Art the Supreme Brahman Brahma said Narada I'm very much pleased with you except the Boon from me not of the replied what moon shall I Ask Of Thee grant me pure love for thy Lotus feet and may I never be deluded by their World bewitching Maya the adhyadma ramayan is full of such statements regarding Jana and bhakti taku is very fond of that of that text a scripture the conversation turned to Amrita a disciple of Keisha Babu seems to be in very bad shape Master yes he looked very ill when I saw him the other day of course this also shows what an intimate relationship is this how he could just kind of banter with them knowing things that will just you know make make it stir the pot a little bit from Sir let me tell you about the lectures of the new dispensation again while the drum is being played the members cry out Victory unto Kesha so this will be after Keisha passed away yeah obviously you say that dull grows in a stagnant pool means that scum that uh the the static pool algae or some other things yeah that's the term to choose for him [Music] is on the far side yeah and uh was uh very well known religious leader of the day his organization was called the brahmos he had gone to England and met Queen Victoria he was a he was a very uh skillful lecturer orator and he had a big following his teachings were influenced by Christianity he's a very great devotion for Christ and also the Western ideas so and and reform movement they were very much interested in uh outlawing this uh some gas distinctions and uh they wanted to allow the widows to remarry and uh get rid of child marriage different things like that also so there was a case of changes hmm so though it made doll also means a group The Following so it's it's a play on words here you say the doll grows only in a stagnant pool so that means that uh people who are only interested in getting a big following are not the real genuine types of people that this is something that comes if a pool is is really clear flowing water you won't get this this you say that Dole grows only in a stagnant pool so Amrita said one day in the course of his sermon the holy man meaning Swami Krishna has no doubt said that Dole grows in a stagnant pool but Brothers we won those we want a sect so it means yeah a little bit of a following in her group we want to sect really and truly I tell you that we want to sect no it's not such a horrible thing but it means that they wanted to have their organization they wanted to have their own followers they wanted to have people who could claim to belong to that group that is so contrary to ceramic Christian's way of seeing things this says he was so non-sectarian with everything and different Dole is used for anything like a party of people group a group of vowels of minstrels came and left and everything uh order will be some some traditional uh usually the monastic order based on a parampara traditional going back to tradition from Guru to disciple the disciple that way to either God realize Soul or most of these parampas they'll go back to some Divine personality something like that with shankaracharya back to Draya this is that type of idea so that's a very traditional thing that nobody comes up and just creates it it has to be based on uh long-standing well-accepted tradition that I'm not doing it I'm I'm following the advice of my Guru who the father's Guru and all this transmission there will be some transmission and all anybody can start a little following it can be a party not not a party that you throw a party or the party of people yeah it can be any type of it has a lot of meanings any type of group that uh or the following yeah a band of menstruals yeah he uses that the term also Master what nonsense shame on him what kind of sermon is that the conversation drifted to the desire of some people for praise master they took me to case of the house to see a performance of the nimaisanyas no this is a little curious that they're not interested in all these things but they've this was so traditional this nimaisanyas this is the story of caitanya Deva when as a as a 24 year old uh who had recently married his first wife died of snake bite he was given a marriage again they arranged the marriage again with this Vishnu Priya all of his uh other brothers my little sisters where they were but they had all died young and his one other brother had left the world and become a monk he was the only son left and the hard rendering this the people weeping well this is this performance that's done where he has to go to his mother and tell his mother that I I'm renouncing the word also or one hope her greatest love in life uh husband was also dead he was the one who would look after her in her old age and everything so this is a very beautiful thing we we had it performed once here mandira she did it many many years ago but it's a very traditional thing in in Bengal beautiful songs that are associated with it and everything it's a little strange that they would do that in keshab's house but as I say It was kind of a musical performance also not just as a religious thing but uh very very nice dramatic and musical performance so they took me into casab's house to see a performance of the nimai sannyas I heard that day someone speaking of vacation as caitanya and nithyananda in terms of the Holiness and everything they are often referred to as two brothers they were literally Brothers but as if they were brothers they were so close to each other Persona asked me who are you then keship looked at me to see what I would say I said to him I am the servant of your servant the dust of the Dust of your feet ketchup said with a smile you can't catch him he left Ram sometimes kashab used to say you were John the Baptist no why he said that I don't know exactly John the Baptist was he played a very important role because he is the one who baptized Jesus right and some somehow helped Jesus start his his ministry and of course the founding of a whole religious tradition and everything but who which ramakrishna be John the Baptist 4. that's the thing John the Baptist himself alone is not such a special figure he's he's his greatness is that he helped how do we say awaken the Divinity of Christ or something like that in the world that he played sister Ellen or any ideas huh what's wrong with you with nobody at that time no but we're talking about the time that he said it the time that he said it that's swamiji was 20 years old or something he would say you know yeah there was no thought that somebody who's greater would come that uh I don't know how well do you know the Bible inside and out the inside and out oh yeah I think he was with a master yeah any idea oh his cousin yeah okay have children but you know John the Baptist is known for saying he must increase I must decrease so because John has a good problem he had a following but he wanted to be in the background he knew that he wasn't the one is the one who was who was the who was to introduce or to inaugurate the uh the uh the mission of your vipers anyhow it's a curious statement but uh Rahm said sometimes keship used to say you were John the Baptist a devotee but kasham also said that you were the chaitanya of the 19th century said in English of the 19th century Tucker didn't know what that meant uh Master what does that mean Liberty that caitanya has been incarnated again in the present Century of the Christian era and that you are he and recognize his greatness far more than any of the others did and when all this stuff is going on who was who and this and that he sat back and smiled Master absent-minded mindedly now what of it can you tell me now how my arm can be cured this broken arm his arm is worrying me so much they talked about trilokia's music devotional songs in k-shubs Brahma samaj and not just saying he wrote many many songs he was a gifted songwriter he came to ceramic Krishna many times was very very fond of him he was very devoted to srama Krishna but still held that view that Keisha was the one who influenced him and he wrote a little book and later towards the end he gets grilled about it he comes there the other they say did you really say this and everything but still he did pick up all of these ideas from Sri ramakrishna this this famous song uh mother make me mad with my with thy love my Deva of course inspired by Swami Krishna so before that their songs were a little bit uh I don't know lacking in in that fervor devotional fervor but after meeting trauma Christian then this other mood came so they talked about trilokius music Master ah how nice his songs are Rob do you think they are genuine Master yes they are otherwise why should I be so drawn to them he has composed his songs by borrowing your ideas it's true while conducting the worship keship said described your feelings and realizations and compose songs accordingly take this song for instance there is an overflow of joy in the marketplace of love see how the Lord sports with his own in the Ecstasy of bliss he saw you enjoying Divine Bliss in the company of devotees and wrote Songs Like This Master with a smile stop don't torment me anymore why should I be involved in all this all that okay we can stop here Rob he created some interest that's what he came I think on purpose half of it is just to have some some nice conversation so many times so many times of course and when Ram bought that had that garden house built the yoga dance it's in conqueror and he was so pleased to see it no he was a great everything and taco loved him very much there's no question about that but he had that other side there well um [Music] [Music] we've our heads before srama Krishna who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts and sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and everworthy of our worship peace peace peaceful thank you
