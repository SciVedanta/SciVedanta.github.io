[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (12/09/22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z08_lcnacdc)

[Music] [Music] you know your words are like nectar bringing life to scored Souls they are praised by Poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of Swami Krishna we're on the chapter Ahmed dakshineshwar part two it is Thursday December 27th 1883 and we're on page 370. Shri ramakrishna last last time we met he had been at the house of ishan ishantas talking to his son Suresh at dusk the master was ready to start for dakshineswar he stood on the south porch of the drawing room talking to ishan summoned remarked that the Channing of God's holy name did not always produce results how can you say that the seed of an ashwata tree the seeds of an ashwatha tree are no doubt tiny but in them lie the gems the germs of big trees it may take a very long time for them to grow yes yes said the master it takes a long time to see the effect that was what we finished with last time next to ishan's was his father-in-law's house sarama Krishna stood at the door of this house ready to get into the carriage ishan and his friends stood around to bid him Ado sarama Krishna said to ishan you were living in the world as a mudfish lives in the mud it lives in the mud but its body is not stained this was one of several different illustrations Tucker used to use of how we can live in the world in the midst of all sorts of difficulties and problems and difficult people and even people who were doing unlawful things and everything and and not letting it stay in our minds this is the main thing that we have to let things slide off our backs he gives the other illustration of the mud fish the foul waterfowl it dives into the water and even those underwater as soon as it comes up it doesn't water doesn't penetrate the layers of the feathers so it doesn't get wet as we have so many examples the water on the the Lotus leaf and all of that yeah to live in the world without letting the Mind get affected is a very difficult thing and we have to strike a balance between not getting affected and becoming indifferent yeah it's very difficult if we if we take the example of swamiji we can't say that swamiji's mind wasn't affected by things of the world it was tremendously affected when he saw the poverty and suffering and everything but nothing on a personal level and uh nothing that was it any type of attachment this is this is the saying that uh if if we have some personal interests some ego behind it something like that some attachment is there and some Karma sticks to us but if we have a little bit of Detachment even this is a hard thing to to be detached from our own mind that the mind will react seeing suffering huh and yet at the same time uh we know that we're the witness of everything we and the the real self can't be tended by anything or this isn't the attitude of the gyani also that if I know that I'm the witness the real self that self is this this argument is never tended by anything so partly a question of identifying with that but all of these these ideas these questions of not being affected by the world I think it all comes down to uh to this idea of ego and and affected on the selfish selfish level ego level if we're very pure in heart and the the reaction that we get to seeing suffering is a very pure reaction of of really love and sympathy and everything it won't leave that type of Mark the talk was talking about well is it like tolerance and intelligence indifference we don't want to be indifferent tolerant I won't use the word tolerance we don't want to be in we want to be this is that the engagement and disengagement this is what swamiji says learn to be attached and detached both have the power of attached equal power of Detachment and attachment because there's always the danger that we become a little uh Inward and it becomes a little indifferent that we we put so much emphasis on our own spiritual life we don't care about other people this is why in our order these these the the twin ideal of the order each balance is the other one caring about the welfare of the world and also striving for realization that if too much of one that needs a little the other to counterbalance it otherwise striving for realization we may become a little bit indifferent to the world and just caring about the world then we we lose the real goal of life and and what we're really trying to do in this lifetime so we we need both together to live in the world as the mudfish lives in the mud it lives in the mud but its body is not stained it releases the question of the Mind so the mind is not staying of course we shouldn't think that we can do all sorts of evil things and that none of this Carnival will stick to us because we're not attached this is this is theoretically if we there's no attachment then these things won't stick to us but there won't be any motive if we if we really live that way there won't be any motive to do anything of course we read in Gita whatever we do that there'll be something negative to it there'll be some Dosha and those that it's connected with whatever we do and they said you can't have fire with those without some smoke that it has to be there so we try to be detached from it uh and not cling to the fruits and not have any our motive should be pure for what we do not have any ulterior selfish motive for things they're about Vidya and avidya in this world of Maya now this is another one of the favorite doctrines of sarama Krishna that when we talk about Maya takur generally he's talking about just this relative universe in this context yes this relative world uh sometimes he'll use the term Leela instead so everything in this relative World falls within Maya within time space and causation that everything is subject to to change and come into existence go out of existence It's a combination of Parts all of the things that we know are opposed to what's called in the theory absolute so he's talking about a very broad thing within this Maya within this relative universe there are things that are helpful there are things that are not helpful Vidya Maya the types of Shakti they'll use the termination there are different types of things that will get us more attached to the world and there are things that will release us from the world from this type of attachment so we have to this is this is part of this process of discrimination knowing what will help us and what will drag us down and in very very simple terms we can just talk in terms of satwa we'll pull this upward and Thomas will drag us down but I just they say this keeps us in the middle but right this actually pulls us down he said they say that's kind of the in between but this is also not helpful and parkour's illustration this Thomas will kill us but right this binds us also and this can release us so this is satwa will be this Vidya aspect of Maya this will be the thorn that removes the other Thorn because we can't get out of our problems in this relative world without doing it through the relative world we can't defeat the uh attachment to the mind without using the mind so there's higher level of mind that will help us get out of it this is that Vidya aspect and the Mayan which is attached to the world and full of desires that'll pull us down that says of India so they're both Vidya and avidya in this world of Maya who may be called a paramahamsa he who like a swan can take the milk from a mixture of milk and water leaving aside the water he who like an ant can take the sugar from a mixture of sugar and sand leaving aside the sand so this is viveka this is what we call discrimination discernment that we're we're always faced with the different choices and options and I this is this is what distinguishes uh intelligent people adult people thoughtful people considerate people from from others the choices that we make you can almost say we are defined Define ourselves we are defined by the choices that we make and if we choose the the selfiest as opposed to the unselfish then uh we will be going to this to the side of India and not Vidya that's all and this is how we form new samskatas and how we uh change our character in nature and how we develop in spiritual life that we transform ourselves so this this is a type of each other the tapwood likes we will see later if we get to it when he tells the M don't do this for each other anymore it's not this type of each other this he says constantly we have to discriminate constantly whenever we have to decide what to do and what not to do what is it that will take us higher and what is it that will drag us down what is it that is selfish what is unselfish when you have all different criteria to use some scars and Fashions passions yeah the Passions on one level we can say that the passions are are natural to everyone just because we belong to this human race which is part of this animal race as you can say so the passions are something that everybody has to a certain degree the samskadas uh these will be the things that uh will develop depending upon what we do with these passions if we've developed the power to control them if we develop the power to transcend them or give them a Different Twist going a different direction we'll develop different some Scholars some Scottish different Tendencies uh but these passions uh are Universal but different in degree with different people so we see that there are some people who just seem to be very much free from the passions and this again we can explain in terms of how much of Rogers and Thomas there are so the passions uh are something that we don't have to always Trace back to behavior and this and that they seem to be natural natural to the to the human being you know I use this I came up with this this concept of darwinian some Scholars and just being part of this this animal kingdom in the human race that were born uh with with these different Tendencies which allow the race to continue this protection of the species and all these different things that we that we know so yeah the Passions this is a battle that we do with the passions srama Krishna likes this idea of uh of utilizing them because they're natural to us emotions also emotion passions and emotions are very similar uh we were reading the other day about Swami Turi and under that he said I was amazed when Surah Krishna said try to when you feel they have a feeling of lust try to increase it tremendously increase it as much as you can but direct it to God because what is it it's a desire to to to have that ultimate enjoyment in possession God so if we uh if we if we try to fight these passions all of the time then depending on how strong they are and how strong our mind is then either we're successful or we get frustrated and uh this human machine that we are has a few elements to it that there are not very helpful but if it's not a perfect machine and uh were either born with or we develop it from a young age because it's mine going outward whatever it is but we have the issue they're called the enemies huh shut the repo these six enemies the foes that they they attack us to us and uh those who are very pure uh they don't have to deal with it so much but everybody has to deal with it to a certain extent this is just the nature of what it means to to be a human being the passion some Scottish or really things that we can trace back to our own activities and and uh decisions that we make things that we do in in life we have certain Tendencies based on our either this lifetime or a past lifetime [Music] temperament temperament if you take the uh all of our subscribers together and try to to create some type of uh personality or something out of it yeah it'll be something like that but Taco is not terribly in favor of just going to battle against the passions and things like that he's more in favor of uh give it a different direction or give give the Mind something better for for he says that we have these these two grade magnets one is the world and one is God this magnet of God is much greater but we have to at least get closer to it and then we'll feel the pull we have to do a little bit ourselves otherwise this is this pull of the world and enjoyment is very strong so this is a dilemma of being a human being we're caught in between pulled in two directions we have this desire to go higher and higher and higher and then this this mind and uh the lower elements or passions or trying to pull this down so with a constant battle by the way this is why if we can practice some type of surrender uh if we have the Holy company if we go into Solitude there's so many things that taco says it's it's to help us win that battle somehow and to uh give the mind a Twist and feed the mind give the Mind something that's a bit more tasty no this is the Tucker's way of looking at it it was evening and the Masters Master stopped at rahm's house on his way to dakshineswar he was taken to the drawing room and there he engaged in conversation with Mahendra goswami Mahendra belonged to the vaisnava sect and with Ram's neighbor Krishna was fond of him master the worshipers of Vishnu and the worshipers of Shakti will all ultimately reach one of the same goals the ways may be different the true vaishnavas do not criticize the shaktas Krishna he had a tremendous respect for gold swamis when he would meet them he would bow down before them and everything because they traced their lineage back to either or one of the companions of caitanya Deva and he just had tremendous respect for them at the same time he always seemed to have in the back of his mind this idea that they were a little one-sided and that they were a little fanatical and didn't have such a broad liberal attitude that everyone will attain realization it was a little bit uh that you have you have to follow our path if you want to attain anything in spiritual life they had that attitude a little bit we don't know if it was this Mahindra goes for me but anyhow Ceramics very often will emphasize that point that to to open up their their hearts a little bit make them a little more liberal so he says the worship worshipers of Vishnu and the worshipers of Shakti now this is especially the Clash especially the Clash that for many reasons the one innovation of us and and the chaitanya school Bengal are usually very strict vegetarians and the shock this they'll take a goat meat and everything else not everything else of course not to me but this is one thing and their Krishna is very sweet and loving and his mother Khalid has a sword and bloody and everything so the very different types of attitudes and they often Clash shakt is also will have their own type of fanaticism you remember once there was a a meeting between takur takur had matarbagu and vaishnav Jordan I think they were together the eating or something and then somebody wanted right now China and said something like no one will achieve anything in in spiritual life without accepting my Krishna or the other said something with my mother and takur laughed and poked them and everything and yeah so there's a little fanaticism uh was there in in some villages let's say I wish ramakrishna grew up there wasn't too much of this uh clash between the different communities other places there there could be you know there could be a strong vaishnavi Village or something like that a shock to the region and during Ram prasad's time there was one of Isner who used to follow him around and and when he would compose a song he would compose the opposito we we know that uh Mansion of Mirth uh and framework of Illusion these these two things so there was always a little little bit of uh tension and and the two communities didn't mix too much in Bengal they didn't go to innovation of community they really stated themselves uh they have their own dress and their own marks and everything and so takura he he of course he loved both ideals equally we may say Divine mother was nearest to his heart but so much of of his spiritual practice and everything was from the advice of a tradition also there are so many beautiful songs also that stress this idea that mother Kali and Krishna they're both black you know this is sham shama uh there's the Oneness between them and talk we like these songs somebody wrote a book called the uh the flute in the sword yeah about this there's some not really a big tradition but there were some who uh I saw them both as as one somehow what is it something where why have you given up your uh your your Wildflower Garden for the garden of skulls addressing either Kali or Krishna is as the same person yeah so a little bit of that tradition but that's that's the uh the exception goes for me smiling she even Parvati or our father and mother srirama Krishna out of the stock of a dozen English words said sweetly thank you and then he added yes father and mother goswami besides it is a sin to criticize anyone especially a devotee of God all sins may be forgiven but not the sin of criticizing a devotee and now those who were very narrow they'll take this to me another vaisnavis but we can say physical Swami is much more liberal than many master now he'll go off on sin sin is another thing that uh is a little bit emphasized in the division of a tradition this idea of of looking upon ourselves is very lowly Cinders or or just this too much emphasis on on humility oh where nobody we're nothing we're Sinners this idea Taco didn't like that that was one of the elements that he didn't like very much Master but this idea of sin does not by any means affect all for instance the ishwara kotis such as incarnations of God are above sin SRI caitanya is an example when Tucker uses this term ishwara koti an incarnation of God he's really talking about these ever free Souls who don't come into this world Bound by Karma they come in this world with some special mission to perform and these are people who won't do anything that we can say that is sinful but if we if we look at uh huh that is asking or do you need to kill people now if we want to say that there's something sinful or I'm bad about that that type of thing can't cling there will be no effect to someone like Krishna or something like that because uh this is for the purpose of salvation of Dharma and it's it's not out of greed or any desire for power or anything like that a different type of thing but otherwise we we naturally assume these great Souls they won't do anything that anyone would consider to be sinful but the point is that if they don't have this this ego feeling that no Carnival will cling to them regardless of what it is but this is a big test if somebody says that I'm beyond good and evil I'm beyond the sin I can do whatever I want and nothing will affect me and they go and do all sorts of nasty things and we know it's hypocrisy if they reach that stage there'll be no incentive to do anything that's not good for people and and uh every everything they do will naturally be beneficial to the world is we don't know much about these things the the ideas they come along with the avatar we have different terms is another term that yeah and the idea generally is they come with the with the Avatar uh is it the same group every time do they pick up some new ones did they lose a few old ones we can't say much about these things uh can somebody become a nitya does it mean that they've always been free we don't know how these things work really he was always no maybe no no no no actually no initi said also that I think Swami sharanandi says either they were born perfect or they'll attain Perfection but they won't attain liberation it sounds like it should be eternally perfect but we have this this idea the two two ways and yeah these are all our categories we don't we see these great souls and we come up with our own categories we don't we don't know really how these things work we may claim to know it and we may have faith in it and everything even this idea of Avatar it can be understood in so many different ways yeah this we we have this feeling of course that uh uh there'll be some Souls that will be attracted to others these great souls and they'll come along with them something do they always want to is it their own choice maybe maybe not we have the one very interesting conversation between uh holy mother and he was one of the closest monastic disciples to holy mother and one day he would say mother I won't I don't want to be burning and I won't come back she said you have to come back when I come back you'll have to come back I don't want to he said you have no choice you'll have to come back something like that so anyhow we don't really we don't really know how these things work very well talk word he we we go by what he said because he had the inside track on these things he's he had some uh knowledge of these things that we don't have but it's interesting that uh talkers mentioned mentioning caitanya Deva who was not listed of course uh as was one of the 10 avataras or anything like that but Tucker accepted him and of course in the the device never tradition in Bengal uh he's considered to be one of the main avatars they don't they don't restrict this the idea of Dash avataras this is more of a quranic idea in the Gita in every age there'll be new a child walking on a narrow Ridge and holding to its father May slip into the ditch but that can never happen if the father holds the child by the hand this is also a difficult concept and how do we practice this I mean for us we have to cling to God and that at some point we'll we'll reach a higher level where we're incapable of even doing that and that's when God will hold us but uh these these are very difficult different code things to put into practice how do we put that into practice exactly the full dependence on God without even making any effort on our part every High stage and as long as we have some feeling of I we have to make an effort and take some responsibility and then we say yeah then I'll do my best to remember God and to rely on on God and whatever happens to accept it uh and this is all all we can do if we want to be like become like small children and not do anything without the mother leading Us by the hand that takes some Grace for that to happen that's nothing the guru can help of course this uh through the grace of the guru see they talk about srama Krishna what he could do now he's not an ordinary Guru but into so many cases they talk about they would go to him the direct disciples and say this what do I do about lust and and they'll take care of it and then I'll say after that I never felt it again so this this is of course a very rare thing of this is we don't find this uh else but uh otherwise uh the guru gives us that uh that real strength and Guru gives us that ideal to follow and uh yeah uh depending on on what type of faith we have we look upon the guru with that we're supposed to really have that feeling and uh the prayers of the guru of course are if we if we know Guru was really our best well-wisher then of course it has to be beneficial for us yeah in the case of these great Saints the Saints themselves are well known but they always pay tribute to their gurus and in some of their bhajans and or whatever their homework you can clearly feel that they have gotten guidance when the grace of the guru when they needed it yeah [Music] see the grace of the guru may depend more on on the uh devotion of the of the disciple there may be a worthless Guru maybe her phone in Guru and if the disciple really has that love and devotion the disciple will gain tremendously from it but will it be from him no from God no it will be from the god dwelling within the heart of the disciple yeah yeah so yeah we have that very funny statement um even if my Guru goes to the Grog Shop still I look upon him as the embodiment for a certain Bliss the Eternal Bliss and everything or the other way around so no we we see this that same thing with prayer how much is it that God is answering our prayer and how much of it is the power of of uh of the of the prayer of the prayer of the person who's praying how much how much devotion and love and faith they have that prayer uh itself will will be the Catalyst for change not so much that it's answered by anybody so the same thing that a lot of it is is our attitude and uh our conviction and our love and our devotion and everything yeah but of course if we have a real loving Guru who guides us and everything then we really feel safe there's a tremendous help in in spiritual life yes in our tradition of course we're supposed to look upon says embodiment or symbol for this Rama Krishna that his power is coming through the guru also foreign listen I pray to the Divine mother for pure love I said to her here is thy righteousness here is thy unrighteousness take them both and give me pure love for thee here's thy Purity here's thy impurity take them both and give me pure love for thee o mother here's thy virtue here's thy Vice take them both and give me pure love for thee now what does it mean to give up it means to go beyond all of these things to to not be stuck in this thing these are actions I should do these are prohibited actions everything can go beyond all of that but what do we mean by pure love this this is a very interesting question is this what is mean you're not asking for anything okay these are two two different answers and two very good answers and what is in Tucker's mind when he says it we don't know exactly one is that pure devotion unmixed with Guyana there's one one idea and the other is this what he calls that motivless love that we love someone we don't ask for anything in return the other idea is that we don't care to to follow any of this Path of Knowledge this uh I am he any of that type of stuff we simply want the devotional attitude we don't care for this uh yoga at all we only went to yoga this is one idea of this I think taqwa sometimes she'll talk that way but we were talking about it earlier though sometimes they'll ask I only want this purely but you have to know God to love God there has to be somebody on it there but this other idea this uh that there's no motive behind our love we love because we want to love about it yeah so there has to be this purity of Heart of course is part of that the taco used to talk about these three different types of Love based on the three different types of the gopis huh that some of them they wanted to serve Krishna because it brought them great pleasure and they're jealous of all the others then the in-between ones they they've got great joy out of serving him but they wanted him to have joy out of their service and then Radha was the highest she only cared about the happiness of Krishna so that'll be one idea of this is but then did the gopis and then other interesting question did they look upon Krishna as God himself knew that they were worshiping God and serving God himself we read in the bhakti's bhakti Sutra that unless they had some idea of the of the divine within Krishna and then it is simply ordinary type of love and then on the other hand through ramakrishna emphasizes this idea that they didn't care this is oh he's the Supreme Brahman we don't care about that we want our Krishna that we can play with in this so different attitudes huh photography the taco talks about that that when the daughter will come and say well don't you know he dwells within your heart he's the Supreme brother don't tell us all that we don't care for that uh we want our Christian our friend and everything to serve him yeah yeah he's on the other school they're both in both different attitudes we can appreciate both attitudes we can appreciate both ideas that that intimacy of the relationship is gone see if Mother you showed that I look to the baby and stands and is re reminding herself or get that idea that oh this is God himself that I'm serving then lose it the sweetness so this this part of this invasion of a tradition is is to hide this attitude a little bit sorry anything no body like you know Krishna from time to time sure is which fruit to yashoda yeah yeah did he ever show it to the gopis no no I don't know it doesn't say so yeah no but it had to be the Divine love but it would it was not an ordinary human love we know that it's the full of the Divine some somehow anyhow go Swami yes sir that is right Master you should undoubtedly bow before all the views so again he's going back to this idea take a liberal attitude but there is a thing called unswerving Devotion to one ideal nishita this is nishita is something that is very very important that if we're if we're so liberal that we say every path is equally good that I like them all all the same and we don't get any any further in our spiritual life we may say that they're all equally good but not for me this is the one for me and uh we really should be establishing that mood and whatever it is whatever spiritual attitude we have that we have to stick to that and we have to go very deep within the nishta is really what carries us along in our spiritual practice having that Very Special Love foreign by worshiping any Avatar or any aspect of God but for us this is the one that that we feel as it's something special this is the relationship that we have and that taqwa says because of that we can respect every other View he said he gives that example that the daughter-in-law in the household she serves all of her husband's relatives because they're related to him but it's all just through that relationship her real love is devoted to the husband that's a different type of relationship but because of that she serves and respects everybody in the in the whole family so that'll be the same type of thing that uh talk where he wants him to be there's a goswami he's telling him they have respect all different views and everything but we shouldn't water anything down we still have to have a special relationship hidden relationship not that we go about telling people oh don't you know this is the best way to worship God that because it it's a personal thing it may not be for other people so there's a thing called unswerving Devotion to one ideal true you should salute everyone but you must love one idea with your whole soul that is unswerving devotion Hanuman could not take Delight in any other form than that of Rama yeah we we know that story when Krishna said you better take the form of Sita I'll take the form of Rama hanuman's coming he won't want to see us in this world that's a little bit fanatical of course a little bit but still it shows that what tremendous devotion did Hanuman had to that aspect of God is Rama the gopis had such single-minded love for the coward Krishna of vrindavan that they did not care to see the turban Krishna of dwaraka say in person but even then a wife oh here it is a wife may serve her husband's Brothers by fetching water or in other ways but she cannot serve them in the way she does her husband with him she has a special relationship but I'm treated the master to sweets srirama Krishna was ready to start for dakshineshwar he put on his Woolen shawl and cap and got into the carriage with em and the other devotees RAM and his friends saluted the master now remember that m is now uh with srama Krishna I think since December 12th something like that this is uh next entry Saturday December 29th so he'll end up staying I think three weeks with them this is the one long stretch it was the day of the new moon auspicious for the worship of the Divine mother at one o'clock in the afternoon srama Krishna got into a carriage to visit the Temple of Kali at kalighat we were talking about the kalighat it's a fantastic image that the tongue of mother Kali goes all the way to the ground yeah golden huh a golden tongue is a relief fantastic and you feel some Shakti there that it's yeah it's a very powerful place I I uh I haven't done it for a while but it used every trip I went to Kolkata I would go to caligan and I lived in the ground floor of a house it was owned by the people who he he was a real kalibata every Saturday night he would go to the college Temple I won't get them a few times also yeah the Kali got a very old Temple some people think that the word Calcutt uh he intended to stop at other's house on the way since other was to accompany him to the temple while the carriage was waiting near the north porch of the Master's room M went to the master and said sir may I also go with you Okay so so this is so there induction is for and he was going to visit the Kali Temple Kali God and to stop in the other's house so M says may I may also go with you and master why he knows he can read the M's mind M has been away from his family now for this whole whole long length of time wife other children and everything M I should like to visit my home in Calcutta now not such a bad thing huh but it's ramakrishna this is this is putting the final touches on the training of them I think this this one long period induction is for and he doesn't want anything to spoil it huh suramic Christian reflected a moment and said must you go home why you were quite all right here so he doesn't go and wanted to see his people now m is usually M doesn't tell us personal things but and wanted to see his people a few hours but evidently the master did not approve that's that's the uh only entry for that day because attack were left and behind it's not that he wanted to go with swarama Krishna but it wasn't that far of course colleague and M's house are not close to each other but maybe others else yeah others house in themselves were close so while they were there he was going to sneak and go and see his family and everything so talk we know he'll be going soon enough back to the family okay Sunday December 30th 1883. at three o'clock in the afternoon and was walking up and down under a tree a devotee came to him and said that the master had sent for him three o'clock in the afternoon while Anne was walking up and down under a tree and Deputy came to him and said the master had sent for him and went to srirama krishna's room and found a number of devotees there he saluted the master RAM kedar and others had arrived from Calcutta Rama had brought with him the vedantist monk whom the master had visited near his garden a few days earlier you remember he liked this the sadhu very much they walked arm in arm they had a nice conversation and he said please come visit me sometime so they did it he said yes and they actually arranged it on that occasion ceramic Christian had asked him to bring the satu to dakshineswar yeah they just found them sitting on you know they had these like wooden wooden cots outside sometimes near the Garden area and he was just sitting there maybe sleeping in the garden at night or something like that the monk was sitting on the small couch with the master they were talking happily in hindustani master what do you feel about all this monk it is all like a dream he's he uh introduced himself as a part of mahangsa that means that he's not a sectarian type of sadhu it'll be more vedantic uh gyani so they'll follow this idea a little bit this world is swapnavat this world is like a dream Master Brahman alone Israel and the world illusory so he's quoting this famous line well sir what is Brahman monk Roman is the sound it is om and now this is one particular uh way of of explaining Brahmin actually more way of explaining om we can say almost it sounds simple for Brahman but he sees explaining it this way Master but there must be something indicated by the sound isn't that so now normally we say that every word uh stands for something there will be some reference there'll be something we say the word chair and there's an object chair so if if this om stands for Brahman then it's not just a sound it's the Roman itself but this word home is a little bit different so he gives an interesting answer he says that itself is the thing indicated as well as the indicator so those who who follow this type of meditation and spiritual practice own is the shabnam the sound itself is identified with the Brahman it's not a word like an ordinary word that indicates a particular object they identify the two together in this shamda it doesn't have to be a it is not the type of that we know ordinary word that this will be some type of primordial vibration that was responsible for the creation of the whole world they're all different theories like that now what does srirama Krishna think that itself is the thing indicated as well as the indicator at these words shivrama Krishna went into samadhi we may think he'll say no my dear it does not open but just hearing that then that triggered in his mind uh this this idea of the infinite absolute that this home is not an ordinary word and it doesn't stand for anything in particular it somehow is identified with this infinite that these words srirama Krishna went into samati and said Motionless the Monk and the devotees looked wonderingly at him in his ecstatic condition said to the monk look at him sir this is samadhi now this sarati is something that all of these vedantists knew about but I how many had ever seen anybody in that state of samanti it's a very very rare thing we don't know I if if they're really we see many instances of people going into ecstasy and and trances and singing all sorts of things but this this real so Auntie the taco would have if it's very very rare type of thing I remember a very funny thing well I was uh I had visited the New York Center many many years ago this is when I was before joining and Swami swananji was there he spoke there and then there was a little session of the library afterwards people could ask him questions and somebody was asking him about this the samati and you know have you seen people with the Somali and everything and Swami swanji sometimes he you get like that get bug eyed you look at anything you think it's such a common thing with samadhi he said your your heart stops beating your breath stops there's no posts you're as if dead to the world like that this is not such a common thing yeah many were things from Christmas they didn't know what to make of it yeah the monk had read of samadhi but had never seen it before after a few minutes the master began gradually to come down to the normal plane of Consciousness he said to the Divine mother mother I want to be normal please don't make me unconscious of course that means to the outer world he wasn't unconscious he was one with Consciousness I should like to talk to the sadhu about sachidananda mother I want to be Mary talking about sachidananda yeah takura his mind would so easily go into that state that he had to do things to keep it down he had to really make an effort sometimes to keep the Mind from going into that state the monk was amazed to see the Master's condition and to hear these words said to him please do away with your I am he with your soul do away with your soham now it's not that you remember Christian didn't like this attitude maybe he he saw it for this sadhu that uh it was it was something that he wasn't qualified for uh that because of that he wasn't enjoying this Bliss of communion with God well we we just guessed sometimes why he says things like that uh I think the joy of communion with with the Divine mother was so great that shurama Krishna felt said when he saw people that because of this idea of the gyani that they they couldn't have that experience so anyhow says please do away with your I am he let us now keep I in thou to enjoy the fun a little later the master was walking in the panchavati with ram kedor M and the other devotees Master to cater with a smile what did you think of the sadhu this kedar is a very complex person he she had some high opinion of himself a little bit he had he had joined lots of other different groups at different times he did some weird things uh he held on to takus toe one time to get some power he had a little group that in in Dhaka they would come and they would bring things for him and everything so his little uh sometimes that taku really praised him one time he said get him away from me and the Decatur said what did the master say so but he's a little bit uh judgmental you can say so kedori it is all dry knowledge so he's looking down upon this I'll do a little bit he's probably young we get that impression and probably on the young side the Pod has just been put on the fire but as yet there is no rice in it so say master that may be true but he's renounced everything so yeah you want to start criticizing him what have you done yeah but at least he's renounced the world he's doing this and in search of the highest goal of life yeah he's not doing it in a very nasty way to this kid or not like he's really criticizing him but but he's setting it straight but there is nothing inside yeah the sadhu is not there anymore no no he had left this was afterwards but still yeah I won't maybe not disrespectful he's trying to he's giving his honest opinion but but used to say that he even uh sadhu doesn't do any spiritual practice at least having given up the world that there's something to be admired about that even though other times they'll say if he doesn't do spiritual practice then you have to say but but he did he did have that uh that respect for him that may be true but he has renounced everything he who has renounced the world has already made great progress the sadhu belongs to the stage of the beginner so he's really he's taking a very mature of you don't judge him too too harshly that at this beginning stage is a very sincere person nice so I'll do a talk with liked him and everything this is the path that he's on the shadow belongs to the stage of the beginner nothing can be achieved without the realization of God when a man is intoxicated with ecstatic love of God he doesn't take Delight in anything else then and then taku sings a song cherish my precious mother shama tenderly within her mind may you and I alone behold her letting no one else intrude this idea of tasting that the sweetness of this relationship was was so uh enjoyable to him it was it was just that uh he he just felt I I get the feeling that he felt that those who follow the dry Path of Knowledge were just missing out on the sweetness of this of this relationship calling upon God his mother or any of the other relationship not that that it wasn't a good path a very hard path not many people could follow it but uh that there's there's uh uh it's this beautiful sweet element that's missing there has to be some Joy otherwise cooking and who can follow that ashokanandi also says it is not as dry as it is yeah I think when we when you say it when it's dry into those who just engage in philosophy yeah those who have the realization of the self that will be also very sweet it has to be it has to be you don't have the same idea about uh they say just because you cut Capers like a monkey yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah so yeah we have to balance things look at both sides of it but uh in general yeah why do people follow this piece of Ghana yoga sometimes they have no interest in personal God sometimes uh they like to use this intellect it appeals that the logic appeals to them uh how many of them get the sweetness of it um even those who worship personal God and how many you have to be Advanced to really get the sweetness from it uh people who who really devoted to Ramana maharashis oh yeah yeah yeah they are by no means no I I made our dhiration energy from me once great gyani very sweet loving nature yeah no this is true but these are very Advanced Source yeah well Ghana is yet he was obtained yeah she says ignorant is the one who is part of life John is the one who has seen them we use the term Gianni in two different senses I think Johnny is someone following The Path of Knowledge and the guy is also someone who was achieved that that knowledge so Tako sometimes the Yani will be the one who gets to the roof and when he comes back down he's a bigyani but uh no no this is a higher only from the point of view of elevation of the land climbing the ladder the other is more advanced and that this is also a questionable thing that which one is is really high or lowered if we said the gun is this nearby samadhi and coming back down a little bit from that uh has to be a little bit lower but uh it includes the other also anyhow this is these are technical things but but the guyani can just be someone who's who's trying to follow the path of Ghana yoga that's also a gyani yeah the term issues both ways if if they've achieved something yes of course for the gyani the reality is one's own self yeah but ramakrishna says for the bhakta it's also the idea of Oneness is there we realize that Unity when we when we reach the highest stage so in a sense we'll get to that well we may not get to it tonight but anyhow he he talked about that that this path of devotion will also lead to this brahmigiana okay there repeated the words of a song and keeping with the Masters feeling how shall I open my heart o friend it is forbidden me to speak I'm about to die for lack of a kindred soul to understand my misery and how he scolds not really scolds he corrects Cather so softly and sweetly and not saying you fellow you're judging the sadhu but how but he gets his point across huh returned to his room about four o'clock the door of the Kali Temple was opened and the master walked to the temple with with the monk so this monk is still staying at the temple area uh probably went off the uh have this meal or do some meditation something like that all right M accompanied them entering the inner chamber the master prostrated himself reverently before the image the monk with folded hands also bowed his head repeatedly before Kali Master what do you think of Kali monk with devotion Kali is supreme Master Kalyan Brahman are identical is that not so this of course was one of talk was great teachings that this Shakti belongs to Brahman we don't can't separate them as long as one's mind is turned to the outer world one must accept Kali very much in keeping with takur's understanding as long as a man sees the outer world and discriminates between good and evil he must accept good and reject evil to be sure all names and forms are illusory but as long as the Mind sees the outer world the aspirant must give up woman now he's talking about uh for for this sadhus here the ideas of Good and Evil are applied to one who was still a student on the path otherwise he will Stray From the Path of Righteousness it goes back to that earlier thing huh the talk was said uh here is by virtue here is the advice thus conversing the master and the monk returned from the temple Master to him did you notice that the sadhu bowed before Khalid and yes sir that's the end of that day stop thank you foreign [Music] who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts and sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace
