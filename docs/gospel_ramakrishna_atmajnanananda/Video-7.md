the worker karma rhythm dr. jay burnham copy variegated on cosmic album share among golems srimad adam we gonna do you know your words are like nectar bringing life to squirt souls they appraised by poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel is ramakrishna for those of you who were following along in the book we are on page 88 this is the chapter the master and disciple and we do not yet have a definite date but this is in 1882 it's the third visit to Sri Ramakrishna and sometime probably towards the end of of February and last week we met a young man by the name of Narendra and we know this narendra becomes the future swami vivekananda so we start out with ramakrishna pointing to narendra the master said you will see this boy he behaves that way here a naughty boy seems very gentle when with his father but he is quite another person when he plays in the colony narendra and people of his type belong to the class of the everfree NIT Ascenta we had before sri ramakrishna and spoke about four different classes of jeevers of individuals those who were bound to the world but dear those who were striving for liberation moksha mimosa dua those who were free muta given those who were ever free Divac I hope I got that right and so he spoke of Narendra here and has ever free this India and the tea driver and the tea moon or nitya-siddha whose the term that he used very often this was a class of individuals who are not born in this world because of past Karma either they're eternally free which is with a difficult concept of course or those who had their realization in the previous lifetime but had some special mission or came along with the avatar or had some special desire to help others in the world and so I chose in a sense to be born again and the classic example we have is of the four friends who were walking along the road and there was a high wall and they heard singing and dancing and laughter and one by one they climbed at the top in the first three couldn't couldn't withstand the temptation to jump over and enjoy the great merry men on the other side but the fourth one thought to himself let me go back and tell everyone about the great joy in the other side of the wall so that will be the ditty Sita so ceramic Krishna sees this young man who was probably around 18 and understands him to belong to that class and of course he'll he'll give him a higher status as someone who was at each riccati someone who comes along with the avatar and then we know through the vision that Ramakrishna felt that he himself had taken the form of a young child and had and awaken this narendra who was lost in in Sumati and some solo realm the realm of the absolute he said as one of the seven sages and himself brought him down to the world to join him in his mission and we also should remember that this is after the first few meetings with Narendra when Shri Ramakrishna touched him and sent him into a state of Samadhi and addressed him as not a rupee Narayana that God come in human form some people take this that he was the sage at nara and narendra who was very very proud of his of his control self-control in mind he was he was a brilliant person in every way even as a young man and had tremendous control over his mind he was a brilliant thinker he had tremendous willpower tremendous concentration of mind so he was convinced that the he'll be on his guard next time she Ramakrishna won't be able to play this tricks on him but they went to the house of money Malik and there again talk were touched him in a very simple way and he lost all our consciousness and shri ramakrishna put different questions to narendra who he was why he was born what his mission in life was how long will all sorts of different questions and niranda answer these questions in that that's transcended state whatever that is and she Ramakrishna said that everything agreed with what he had seen in his state of ecstasy and this was more assurance that narendra was the one that he thought that he was and he would be this is his main disciple to spread his message throughout the world so he's talking about this Narender now ceramic krishna had a habit of praising narendra and the renderer for all of his self-confidence he wasn't a proud person the egotistical person and he didn't like it when taqwa praised him all of the time that taco was always giving special preference to him and he whenever some nice food would come he would start feeling the render so he would say well what about my friends feed them also so we'll see that every time ramakrishna starts praising the render he'll find some excuse to leave the room he gets a little bit embarrassed so we're starting out here this point eaten the render the master said and we know that he's talking to him and there are other people in the room also and they're entering people of his type belong to the class of the everfree they are never entangled in the world when they grow a little older they feel the awakening of inner consciousness and go directly toward God they come to the world only to teach others that means we come to the world because we have karma we have desires from the previous lifetime that haven't been fulfilled we haven't realised our true nature and our goal in life is to attain to that state of liberation and freedom and wisdom enlightenment that under didn't have to do all of that the everfree they had a slight veil of maya covering them which they can shake off rather easily and of course through the touch of ramakrishna that wasn't a big job at all so they have a different purpose for coming to the world they never care for anything of the world so they're born without any attachment to the world they are never attached to lust and gold the vedas speak of the Homa bird it lives high up in the sky and there it lays its egg as soon as the egg is laid it begins to fall but it is so high up that it continues to fall for many days as it falls it hatches and the chick falls as the chick falls its eyes open it grows wings as soon as its eyes open realizes that it is falling and will be dashed to pieces at pieces on touching the earth then it had once shoots up towards the mother mother bird high in the sky now as I said before this is a typical thing at this point that entered or left the room because he doesn't like to hear he knows that Ramakrishna will go on and on and on praising him as a great virtues he's a young boy he was so embarrassed sometimes sometimes Sri Ramakrishna would compare him to Kesha kay shipped rented a sandwich world famous he had lectured to throughout the world he England he had met the Queen he was the head of a Brahmo Samaj he was such a well-known person brilliant also and there's so many followers and SH Ramakrishna would say this ketchup only had a small fraction of the spiritual power and virtues that this young boy met in the head so he would get embarrassed by all that so narendra left the room kadar pran Krishna M and many others remained Master now you won't stop he'll keep talking about you see that Endura excels in singing playing on instrument study and everything he came from a very well-to-do family they had all different tutors for him so we learned to play all different instruments he was a the wonderful singer and they used to sing in the Brahmo Samaj the choir he knew horseback riding all sorts of things he's very well rounded type of education and it's so brilliant that he could read something and remember it without any effort so shouldn't eat how do they talk about those who just hearing something once and the second class they have to read it twice or hear it twice but he was he was really brilliant so what Sri Ramakrishna's saying about him is the true and in the every possible way especially with musical skills but tremendous singing voice also if only we had recordings of his voice and we forget house Ramakrishna week mesmerize people with his voice not just that he was an ecstasy but aside from that will see that the mm says that he had the most beautiful singing voice he had ever heard and this narendra who probably had a deeper baritone type voice oh also and he would new classical music and through pot he was a great fan of Drupada and when he composed kondañña he didn't listen through pod and rhythm so he tried to revive that also so the master you see never end of excels in singing playing on instruments study and everything the other day he had a discussion with kadar cater not who was quite quite a bit older than him and was also a longtime deputy and well-versed in everything he had a discussion with caterer and tore his arguments to shreds or left yeah sure Ramakrishna you used to like to tell any of any great pundit came he would say who have a discussion with Narendra and he would watch the fun because Narendra could find holes and everyone's argument to him is there any book in English on reasoning so this is the ayah Bengali was famous for especially as Navi in the ayah this is a new school of neo logic they they call it sometimes and little curious what brought this idea to talk was mine to ask him about it because we'll find out that he's not terribly interested so and yes sir there is it is called logic so any book in English one reason is called logic so he uses the English word which Tucker mayor I've ever heard of master tell me what it says and what's it little embarrassed because M was very shy he said one part of the book deals with deduction from the general to the particular for example all men are mortal scholars are men therefore scholars are mortal and other part deals with the method of reasoning from the particular to the general for example this crow is black that crow is black the crows we see everywhere are black therefore all crows are black but there may be a fallacy and the conclusion arrived at in this way for an inquiry when they find a white crow in some country there is another illustration if there is rain there is or has been a cloud therefore rain comes from a cloud still another example this man has 32 teeth that man has 32 teeth all the men we see have 32 teeth therefore men have 32 teeth English logic deals with such inductions and deductions Ramakrishna barely heard these words while this link he became absent-minded so the conversation did not proceed for this nya is one of the six systems of Indian philosophy shunderson and it's it's one of the systems that applies to all of them we sometimes think that these six different systems you have to choose which one you like it's not like the schools of vedanta you either believe in a de or mr. data where do I this the laws of logic have to be followed by all of the schools and it's a study is mostly about brahmanas how do we judge if something is true and what standards do we use because if we if we want to prove the truth of something we have to have some standard by which to prove that so there are three basic pramanas protection we see something then somebody says well how do you know that happen I saw it and then there's a uh no mana well I deduced it because somebody walked in and they were soaking wet so I assumed that there was rain outside now they're all of these there can be some type of mistake there and then generally shoved uh there are different terms that are used there's some Authority some authoritative person told me that it was true within the Scriptures totally it was true they doctored six pramanas but this these are the basic three they break down this on the mana into a smaller portion so this is this is comedy the reason is that if something doesn't meet the standards of logic it can't be true that means it couldn't have taken place so it's not just an intellectual type of thing if we want to show if we can prove that something is illogical that means it couldn't have happened this this is a kind of recently behind all of it when the meeting broke up the deputies sauntered in the temple garden em went in the direction of the Panchavati Panchavati i was the place where Rama Krishna did a lot of his spiritual practice and a lot of his ecstasy took place there's a very sacred place it was originally five trees the taqwa planet there was a bunch of Adi when he first got there but then it must have died out somehow and the one they're talking about was planted by taco himself and biggest one is a big banyan tree then after all these years that they all died with the banyan tree then I think it was hit by lightning or something I don't know if the free planet did or not but you can still see at least there there was a concrete platform there and during tacos time they used to have picnics there and these big creepers were there they could swing on them the boy would play with that so Tucker used to like that where he would send people you said go and meditated the departure party because of all the spiritual practices and ecstasy's that had taken place there so m1 in the direction of the Ponte 80 it was about 5 o'clock in the afternoon after while he returned to the Masters room there in a small North veranda he witnessed an amazing sight to Ramakrishna was standing still surrounded by a few devotees and the renderer was singing taqwa loved to hear that into the sing so we see over and over again in the gospel that her last murder please sing a song sometimes he'll he'll mention a particular song but sometimes he'll leave it to Narendra most of the songs in the beginning that are in the renewal were from the Brahmo Samaj but he is as I say he had a brilliant memory so he had all of these things committed to memory and had never heard anyone except a master saying so sweetly when he looked at Ramakrishna he was struck with wonder for the master stood motionless his eyes transfixed he seemed not even to breathe this is the first time that Emma seeing's from a Krishna in this exalted state he was impressed with them before because of his his brilliance because of his tremendous devotion although these are the reasons but he hadn't seen this the state of ecstasy before he seemed not even to breathe a deputy told them that the master was in Samadhi and it never before seen or heard of such a thing this Savanti unless someone studied Raja yoga and was familiar with certain schools of philosophy and everything this isn't something that they would have known about and certainly no one would have seen it there were a few cases we hear about in the gospel of someone going into that state sometimes it would be without much preparation and there's one story about someone who went into that state of Samadhi and the his devotees tried so hard to bring his mind down that they practically burned his body and he eventually died from all of that but with Ramakrishna the Samadhi is not exactly the Samadhi that we read about in Raja yoga in Raja yoga we have two different types of Sumati this sorry called paneer we culpa and the distinction is in in both cases the mind becomes perfectly still but in so we called the Samadhi there's no functioning of the mind but there's some of awareness some eye consciousness so this some is some feeling that I've entered into this very deep state something like that and the near peak of the Samadhi that's gone so there's only merging so the only pure consciousness at that time now the devotional schools talked about something called the bhava Samadhi and generally equestrian victory had all different types generally the Sumati that we're talking about with Rama Krishna is this a prophecy lot and they'll use both terms and we'll describe it the master is in bhava a state of ecstasy or in sumati this near bacopa Samadhi was what strong Christian experienced under totapuri when he did his wedding sauna and at the very beginning when total-body told him to merge his mind in that Brahman and he put a piece of glass between his eyes and said fix your mind there and talk were said when the image of the Divine Mother came I took knowledge as a sword and cut her in half and she disappeared and then I merged he was in that state for three days three days and three nights thought the podium was waiting for him to come out of that state then later after told to put he left he was in that state more or less six months his mind would come down just enough of body consciousness to somebody somebody probably hitting him at everything so that he could swallow a little bit so he didn't die he could live for six months and then ultimately two things happened and which is the cause and if they're related it's very hard to say but you're the voice of the Divine Mother say remain and haruka and he also said that at that time he had such a terrible dysentery that the pain of that also brought the mind down so perhaps the second was the the instrument of which the divine mother managed to bring his mind back down so he's in this state now of Sumati what's going on inside of his mind you know only he's only clue we get is that very often he would tell us afterwards he would say oh you know the divine mother said this or I saw this in that state so it's not the type of Samadhi where the mind is not functioning the mind is functioning but on a completely different level and the mind is completely cut off from this senses so taqwa during that time will have no awareness of his body no awareness of where he's sitting or standing in the room that'll all be gone mine will be in some higher realm somewhere from from the outside and no one could tell what type of Samadhi it is only we know that much that he had lost all out consciousness this is the term that she was very often in the gospel so in everyday told them that the master was in salty and it never before seen or heard of such a thing silent with wonder he thought is it possible for a man to be so oblivious of the outer world and the consciousness of God how deep his faith and devotion must be to bring about such a state now the state used to come it used to get triggered there's a term that we find and talk were uses in himself often throughout the gospel deep honor well deep honor means something will in Kindle this spiritual mood in him and taco used to say that he was like very dry kindling that the flame comes anywhere near little blaze up very quickly so that was the nature of chakras mine that anything could could trigger this spiritual mood this was a problem for him because one time they was talking on going to the zoo and he said if somebody said well if you've seen the lion immediately would have thought a dog and you would have been lost and you wouldn't have seen anything else so this happened to him very often and so especially when the render is saying narendra was singing meditate on my mind on the lord hari the stainless one pure spirit through and through how peerless is the light that in him shines how soul bewitching is as wondrous for how dear is he to all his devotees even more beauteous in fresh blossoming love that James the splendor of a million moons like lightning gleams the glory of his form raising erect the hair for very joy the master shuddered when this last line was sung his hair stood on end and tears of joy streamed down his cheeks so when the mind will calm down he could hear these things he had these different states conscious state semi-conscious state this unconscious state were unconscious of the external world mine would go back and forth this is that problem uka state he could go back and forth between these three different states he could be aware of the world but see this world as a manifestation of the divine or he can go into that half semi-conscious state and bother state or he could be merged in Brahman the master shuddered when this last line was sung his hair stood on end and tears of joy streamed down his cheeks now and then his lips parted in a smile was he seeing the peerless beauty of God that James the splendor of a million moons was this the vision of God the essence of spirit how much austerity and discipline how much faith and devotion must be necessary for such a vision the song went on worship his feet and the Lotus of your heart with mine serene and eyes made brilliant with heavenly love met behold that matchless sight again that bewitching smile the body motionless as before the eyes half shut as if beholding a strange inner vision so the Mayan comes down enough to hear the song then goes back up the song drew to a close narendra sang the last lines caught in the spell of his love's ecstasy immerse yourself forevermore or mind in him who was pure knowledge and pure bliss the site of the samadhi and the divine bliss had witnessed left an indelible impression on m's mind he returned home deeply moved now and then he could hear within himself the echo of those soul intoxicating lions immersed yourself forevermore or mind in him who was pure knowledge and pure bliss so this is the end of that day and went home just one more thing about this his relationship with Ramakrishna was really unique because he disagreed with practically everything that Sherman Krishna said he was as we know a member of the Brahmo Samaj he was highly educated in the Western philosophy and literature he did not be as a member of the Brahmo Samaj he did not believe in any type of the image worship they didn't like this idea of the new guru they didn't like this idea of the avatar and also as a gyani that the narendra he used to laugh at that idea God dwells equally within all beings how do you say that God became one person and not another person so there was so many different things that he disagreed with with Shri Ramakrishna that people would wonder sometimes why he even came and the relationship was such that Ramakrishnan didn't mind what he argued with him or objected to things we came up with with the counter arguments the didn't take it as a lack of respect where are there sometimes we would wonder why does he argue so much with Ramakrishna but Tucker knew that this was his his nature that he wouldn't accept anything unless he really understood it and talked or respected that and appreciated that and loved it in fact he told him don't accept a word that I say without testing it test me the way the moneychanger tests his coins they'll bite into it to make sure that it's real hard metal so don't accept anything without testing so they had that type of relationship and gradually as Swamiji came to accept everything that Tucker said and he said because I fought with them so hard for six long years that now I know every inch of the way so very wonderful the relationship to the head why did he keep coming because he said he had never seen such purity such simplicity such ecstasy God realization and he had never felt such love they had such a tremendously loving relationship when both sides we times sometimes think that looked awkward we think for Narender that introduced a week to see taqwa also they they had a really unique relationship we don't find this with any of the other disciples with the exception perhaps of Rocco to a certain extent but but not to this extent I don't feel the next day to is a holiday for EM so we can say after the first visit he sees coming at every possible opportunity we know it was a holiday because he had left home at that time we don't know exactly why is February any hope the next day too was a holiday for him he arrived at that finish soiree at 3 o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna was in his room that Indra baba not and a few other devotees were sitting on a mat spread on the floor they were all young men of 19 or 20 seated on the small couch Sri Ramakrishna was talking with them and smiling now who would the Baba not this is a great question Vinod is a mystery he and Narendra were very good friends they used to come together and ramakrishna encouraged them to come together taqwa used to have some insight into who was a good companion spiritual companion for someone else that either they had the same mental spiritual attitude or they complemented each other and he always thought this bhava not in the renderer that they complemented each other so he was happy when they would come together he had a very high vinod we hear sometimes that it include the Pavan odd it is one of the six each word cotys and cause I mean et cetera he puts him in the same class as the others later it seems that for he considered foreigner to be the other one any other with a Baba not whether he wanted to or not because it sounds like he didn't want to but I had a marriage was arranged for him and in the beginning it was it was a very spiritual marriage he would refer to his wife his mother and everything taka was very impressed but gradually he stopped coming and for someone who was so close to ceramic Christian in the beginning it's a little bit of a mystery what exactly happened because when talk was very ill and Kashi poor he didn't come so much and the other devotees who would say what is happening the Mahavir not he's been entangled in the world through marriage that means getting a job and everything else so a little bit strange but a very pure type of Souls Ramakrishna praised him very very much and he in the render were very good friends seated on the small couch Ramakrishna was talking with them and smiling no sooner had M entered the room then the master laughed aloud and said to the boys there he has come again they all joined in the left ER and bowed low before him remember in the beginning he we just fold his hands and now he understands how to greet somewhat of ceramic Christmas stature he bowed low before him and took a seat before this he had saluted the master with folded hands like one with an English education but that day he learned to fall down at his feet and Orthodox Hindu fashioned Sri Ramakrishna even even this even how to make pranaam he would teach the devotees because sometimes he himself would do it when Keysha would come case of also in the beginning we did the folded hence he would make put on the case of dedication with matin Pradhan to him Taku who had no pride that way if he would show the highest respect holy mother also then some simple brahmin priest would come to do puja or something sulphur thing and she would make her nam to him and give him so many gift and everything so they were completely free from pride that way so before this he had saluted a master with folded hands like one with an English education but that day he learned to fall down at his feet in Orthodox Hindu fashion presently the master explained the cause of his laughter to the devotees he said a man once fed a peacock with the pill of opium at 4 o'clock in the afternoon the next day exactly at that time the peacock came back it felt the intoxication of the drug and returned just in time to have another dose or laughs mmm thought this is a very apt illustration remember he always refers to himself in the third person he's reading this and thought there's a react illustration even at home he had been unable to banish the thought of Strama Krishna for a moment now this is not we shouldn't take this as an exaggeration if any of us could have met sri ramakrishna then the impression would have been so strong and intense that we wouldn't be able to think of anything else they all felt that they all used to say that they're very closely on Turanga inner circle then the second we left we counted the minutes till we could come back to see him and the thought of him the whole time that power of Attraction was with such a tremendous thing and what was the power of attraction it was mostly love this Swamiji makes a very great statement later he's as he tamed us to his love so that was the thing that really attracted them along with something which no one could really and that how he could commune with the divine mother talk to her how the mind could enter into a realm didn't nobody know nobody knew how we did it or where he was or what that experience was like but they could see the joy these fits phase beaming hair standing on that so these these were tremendous they exerted tremendous power of it of Attraction in the meantime the master was having great fun with the boys treating them as if they were his most intimate friends now remember talk were said that the God realized soul lives in the world by behaving in a particular way one of these is Bala covet like a child and Ramakrishna used to stress it doesn't simply mean like a small child it convene in all different stages of life that sometimes this is God realized soul he's like a young man sometimes like a teenager at different times so here he's as if he's a teenager the same ages as the others and just enjoying the fun with them and they would sometimes they would forget also they would leave and say ah I was talking to him and playing with him treating him like like a dear friend just as Arjuna says in chapter 11 that oh the Krishna please forgive me I addressed you just as my friend and we would lie down together and play together I had no idea who I was sitting with so they would get that feeling sometimes afterwards so even at home and had been unable to banish the thought of Ramakrishna for a moment his mind was constantly at that finish work and he had counted the minutes until he should go again his mind was constantly the chinnis were throughout his entire life the whole hold meditation is everything he was constantly thinking of those days Duc shaileshwar and he always sent everyone there to the Chinese War and he said you also look at everything so carefully that it leaves a deep impression in your mind so when you sit for meditate you can feel that you're sitting there they're very wonderful technique so in the meantime the master was having great fun with the boys treating them as if they were his most intimate friends peals of side-splitting laughter filled the room as if it were a Mart of joy the whole thing was a revelation to em he thought didn't I see him only yesterday intoxicated with God wasn't he swimming then in the ocean of divine love the sight I had never seen before and today the same person is behaving like an ordinary man wasn't it he who scolded me on the vert on the first day of my coming of my coming here didn't he admonish me saying and you were a man of knowledge wasn't it he who said to me that God with form is as true as God without form didn't he tell me that God alone Israel and all else losery an idea transitory wasn't it he who advised me to live in the world unattached like a maidservant in a rich man's house so we see with Ramakrishna this tremendous variety of moods that he could be in and one following another the very next moment he'd go into ecstasy again ceramic krishna was having great fun with the young devotees now and then he glanced at em he noticed that em sat in silence the master said to Ramla you see he is a little advanced in years and therefore somewhat serious ROM law was Tucker's relative nephew a few Ramla well he had several nephews and who worked it in at the temple there and the one to the priests and Ramla actually Rama and Aphrodite they were the ones who spent the most time with Shri Ramakrishna and when strong and Charlotte Ananda composed his Sanga the great master he got so much information from the two of them and this is Ron Malala he formed a very close relationship with Swami Ramananda later and we find him mixing with the devotees and he also could sing so they would very often ask him to sing he was a good singer so the master said to Ramla you see he is a little advanced in years and therefore somewhat serious he sits quiet when the youngsters are making merry and was then about twenty eight years old and it is true he had a very serious type of nature and a shy and a little self-conscious he didn't want to have people see him getting up and singing and dancing and all of it and taro scolded him for that that he said this is also a federer this Lord Jia was unconscious the Gupta desire to hide oneself this little self-consciousness daughter Karina boy eighteenth octane Oh he used to say that one should avoid having these things this log guy in the sense of modesty is a good thing in the sense of embarrassment the embarrassment means that were too self-conscious so logic arena boy this hatred and and fear these are things that represent fetters for us bondage aimless then about 28 years old the conversation drifted to Hanuman whose picture hung on the wall in the Masters room Hanuman was in one sense the the ideal of Shri Ramakrishna because of the great statement that is attributed to Hanuman that he looked upon see Rama in different ways according to his his state of mind that when he felt identified with the body then he felt he liked the servant attitude so ceramic Christmas said if the Eagle sent us there remain in the world is a servant of God then mind went a little higher he felt he was a part of God and then when he realized himself to be the odd man then he was in the state of oneness non duality that Rama you and I are one in that state so Strummer Krishna quotes is very very often a very beautiful verse and of course Hanuman is the image of devotion in the darcy Ahava the attitude of the servant to the master and when Shri Krishna wanted to realize Rama he emulated Hanuman this is this is the whole theory of this worshipping according to the different parvis that we first have to identify with the ideal worshiper and and have some experience of that now before we can have the experience of the object of worship so ceramic Krishna identified with with the Hanuman to such an extent that he lived on fruits and he jumped from place to place and I really felt himself to be on Aman in order to have the realization of Rama so that then he did it with all of the different spiritual relationships sure Ramakrishna said just imagine hanuman state of mind he didn't care for money honor creature comforts or anything else he longed only for God that meant he wanted to see Rama this Rama was the beginning end for him when he was running away with the heavenly weapon that had been secreted in the crystal pillar mondadori began to tempt him with various fruits so that he might come down and drop the weapon but he couldn't be tricked so easily in reply to her persuasion he sang this song we find a footnote here the story referred to here is told in the Ramayana Ravana had received the boon as a result of which he could be killed only by a particular celestial weapon this weapon was concealed in a crystal in his palace one day Hanuman in the guise of an ordinary monkey came to the palace and broke the pillar as he was running away with the weapon he was tempted with fruit by mondadori arrived and his wife so that he might give back the weapon he soon assumed his own form and sang the song given in the text this is the song and Maya need of fruit I have the fruit that makes this life fruitful indeed within my heart the tree of Rama grows bearing salvation for its fruit under the wish-fulfilling tree of Rama dua Citadis plucking whatever fruit I will but if you speak of fruit no beggar I for common fruit behold I go leaving a bitter fruit for you as Ramakrishna was singing the song he went into Samadhi so either hearing a song or singing a song he could go into that state again the half closed eyes and motions his body that one sees in his photograph just a minute before the devotees had been making merry and his company now all eyes were riveted on him thus for a second time M saw the master in Santi after a long time the master came back to ordinary consciousness see this is Samadhi for Sri Ramakrishna there will be different depths of Samadhi and sometimes his mind would get so merged that it was very hard to bring it back down this became a tremendous problem when Holy Mother faith first came to Dutch channa Schwar to stay with Ramakrishna in the beginning they stayed in the same room there were two cots there one next to the other and the whole night Sri Ramakrishna would go into different states of the ecstasy and Savanti and and talking holy mother got no sleeps he didn't know what to do and other times sri ramakrishna would go into such a deep state that it was very hard for the mind to come back down and he used to teach his devotees and holy mother different methods and he would tell them that if I go into Samadhi because of any particular song or any any statement it's made regarding any particular aspect of God then that's the name to repeat in my ear so if someone's singing a song with the divine mother then repeating that somehow that will catch the attention of the mind and bring it back down so sometimes he would go to very deep state so the different levels of this type of power Samadhi there was one time when someone was singing songs for Shiva and he went into such a deep state because Shiva represents the infinite absolute reality that after a long time when his mind came back down he warned them he said these are dangerous songs for me if you sing songs about Shiva saying something about the Divine Mother afterwards that will put my mind in a slightly lower level so this was the nature of that mind of Shri Ramakrishna which is just impossible to fathom after a long time and the master came back to ordinary consciousness his face lighted up with a smile and his body relaxed his senses began to function in a normal way yeah when she Ramakrishna would go into Savanti practically the signs of death would come sometimes the body would even start to get a little cold they had trouble knowing if he was even breathing they would put something under his nose to see if there was any breath sometimes they could hardly feel his pulse that there's one case where the one of the doctors was present and he actually put his finger on tacos I eyeball with such a sensitive thing to see if he and me feeling there and he couldn't feel anything so this in this state of Savanti there really the breathing almost stops the heart of the everything slows down to a tremendous degree when Tok were actually left the body they really had no way of knowing whether he was in again in the state of Samadhi or if the life breath had left so for a long time they chanted the name of God in his ear for a long time they tried different methods with Pookie on his back and rubbing down to bring Kundalini are all different things until finally someone said no that their life breath is gone that this time he's actually passed away so it's very hard to even see signs of life so when he would come down sometimes he would take a deep breath and and take a second and and he could see things and everything would be more or less affected or wounded or normal bit his normal so his face lighted up with a smile his body relaxed his senses began to function in a normal way he said tears of joy as he repeated the holy name of Rama and wondered whether this very Saint was the person who a few minutes earlier had been behaving like a child of five so in that condition probably had the vision of Rama or Hanuman or saw some divine play we have no way of knowing the master said to Narendra and M I should like to hear you speak and argue in English why talk we did that he did it on different occasions well he wanted to hear and the render and get his coach argue in English he knew a few English words but these were mostly words that were common in the Bengali language at that time but just for fun he liked to watch this thing they both left but they continued to talk in their mother tongue it was impossible for him to argue anymore before the master those who are Krishna insisted they did not talk in English at five o'clock in the afternoon all the devotees except Narendra nem took leave of the master as M was walking in the temple garden he suddenly came upon the master talking to Narendra on the bank of the goose pond the Hajj book or Ramakrishna said in the render look here come a little more often so he had been coming less than a year probably calmed a little more often you were a newcomer on first acquaintance people visit each other quite often as is the case with a lover and his sweetheart that enter in M left so please come won't you Narendra a member of the Brahmo Samaj was very particular about his promises he said with a smile yes sir I shall try we will stop year for tonight you have the closing jet on Iran general determinant uru poem but time will come her to little bit crumbly you saw avatar on Paramecium medium Tamarama Krishna she Rosanna mama boom we bow our heads before Shri Krishna who is stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts and sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of our worship long shank is Shanti Shanti peace peace peace be on
