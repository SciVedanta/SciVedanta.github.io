[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (10/7/22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6LItFQ6r1s)

[Music] you know your words are like nectar bringing life to scored Souls they're praised by Poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls Welcome to our class from the gospel of srama Krishna we're on the chapter Ahmed takshinishwar part one this is Page 358 and it's Monday December 24th 1883. which would be Christmas Eve yes but it wasn't really observed it's just in passing uh this is uh getting towards the end of M's very long stay I've mentioned several times that this was a very significant period in M's life and this is the longest period that he ever stayed with srama Krishna without a break as far as We Know and this period in the December of 1883. at eight o'clock in the morning SRI Rama Krishna and M were talking together in the Pine Grove at the Northern end of the temple Garden this was the 11th day of M stay with the master the very Northern end is right where the big wall is and then the magazine and everything is on the other side and that's where the bell tree is and and where Taco did is it was Winter the sun had just risen the river was flowing North with the tide not far off could be seen the bell tree where the master had practiced great spiritual austerities this was when the Romney came and he did all of the tantric at that time srirama Krishna faced the east as he talked to his disciple and told him about the knowledge of Brahman master the formless God is real and equally real is God with form this was one of the first statements that talk were made to m in the very beginning and caused Great confusion in M's mind and how can two contradictory things both be true at the same time but now I am understanding is much much greater than it was before an angta used to instruct me about the nature of sachidananda Brahman he would say that it is like an infinite ocean water everywhere to the right left above and below water enveloped in water it is the water of the great cause motionless waves spring up when it becomes active its activities are creation preservation and destruction so this is really another way of saying that the nirguna and saguna aspects of brahmana are both real and see nankta was a great Advent but he also didn't he may have looked Upon This World this is unreal somehow but he's saying here that this is still part of the Shakti you see at the end had to accept this idea of Shakti in in a more definite way but even before that uh the saguna aspect is really with sashakti when we talk about the the attributes of Brahman uh this chit chakti uh at least for for some of the vedantic schools is the most important element it's not so much uh the personal god with the attributes of loving kindness and and all of those things and we say point of view it really means this there's a power to create and preserve and sustain the universe and withdraw the universe so this was really what Taco used to say that it's the same order when the water is is still in calm this is like this near going to Brahmin when it's in waves like saguana Brahmin or Shakti but it's water all along they're not two different things it's the same saguna Ramadan you're going to Brahman are not two separate things it's just sometimes this power is active sometimes it's it's in a latent potential form again he used to say that Brahman is where reason comes to a stop there's the instance of camphor nothing remains after it is burned not even a trace of Ash so this this idea is that through reasoning we eliminate all of the false ideas this is this path of each other uh doesn't directly lead us to that highest type of realization that highest type of realization has to Simply emerge it has to Simply awaken within us but this eliminates all types of attachment so with the tacos peeling of the onion that we we eliminate attachment to the body of the Mind the ego senses and everything like that it's not like it at some point we say that oh what's in the very center I am that no everything else disappears and then what is is it simply remains that way so this is this is uh what happens after we reach the end of reasoning we can we can't realize our Oneness with the infinite absolute through reasoning we can eliminate all of the false identifications and then that uh that reality somehow manifests itself within us the way they explain it with unto teachers Roman is beyond mind and speech a salt doll entered the ocean to measure its depth but it did not return to tell others How deep the ocean was it melted in the ocean itself now this is uh an illustration that taku uses many many times and he uses it I think if we if we examine the way he uses it in two different senses one is for the ordinary diva who attended that state of Oneness in that state of nearby samati and then merges there's no no coming back from that state but for those who can come back and again this goes to practice that's his interpretation he says what melts away is this ego is the scent of I so when the salt dog gets to the bottom see in the case of srama Krishna and when it gets to the bottom that means when it's emerged in that absolute reality there's no I there that is dissolved but coming back it reappears somehow but because it wasn't there at that point then even for ceramic Christian that he can't say what that experience is like because at that time that ego has melted as it were even though it can come back for him or ordinary individual if this all doll if it melts in the ocean there's no way to retrieve that's all God's gone it's become one then the body will fall off eventually but for those who can come back from that state their ego is like the sold out at that time it's it's gone so that's why I talk word even when he tried he couldn't explain what that experience is like that nearby experience or that being merged in in Brahman so it did not return to tell others How deep the ocean was it melted in the ocean itself so this would be the case of those who attain that state of of brahmagana from which there's no return now we may be frightened about this then do we want to attain that state and then we'll never come back to this world and the body will fall off there's a question of our Karma and there's a question of How Deeply we enter into that state and what will pull us back from that state it's a very complicated thing topper talks about it so often is never entirely clear who comes back from that uh how much how much say we have in the matter and tuckworth's case the Divine mother herself this is the way he understood it that brought uh brought his mind back down a little bit for some they'll have a little desire to work for the welfare of the world for others they'll have a little bit of karma left so a complicated thing but if all of One Economist is is exhausted if one is no more desire and one enters into that state of completely merging in Brahmin there's no mechanism by which the mind can come back but we won't care at that point this is not so it's we if we have some fear that though we may end into this then we won't enter into it that fear itself will make it impossible it only comes when we have that perfect dispassion and perfect contentment that there's no pull of anything external for us the Rishi is one said to Rama or Rama sages like may very well call you an incarnation of God but we cannot do that we adore the word Brahman this footnote here says om the symbol of Brahman this is just another way of explaining it means this infinite absolute reality there's not such a technical thing we do not want the human form of God Rama smiled and went away pleased with their adoration but the nithya and the Leela are the two aspects of the same reality now this uh are terms that takura uses in a very specific way and very often in the English translation it'll be the absolute and the relative so he's talking about uh if we if we think of this the ocean again then the ocean itself is in nithya and when it's broken out into waves that's the Lila so this is at play we have the Beautiful song as Swami permission and see the the difference between that and the eduardic point of view do I take point of view uh is a very nice verse from the viveka 2 Domini that uh this wind of Maya are blowing over the surface of the water and it's creating waves now in this and Swami permission at the song it's the Grace Grace this is this creating the waves of Leela so it's just a different way of looking at it that what what makes this infinite absolute reality uh become relative there has to be something otherwise it remains it simply remains this pure Consciousness if it's pure Consciousness if it's inactive if it's without any personality without any form without any desire without any lack uh how does it become many how does the one become many this is of course is a huge question uh either we bring in this idea of Maya or we have to bring in some idea of Shakti or will something something like that there has to be some other type of explanation otherwise uh say if somebody's sleeping then why does somebody wake up when they're sleeping there has to be something other way otherwise they'll remain sleeping there has to be some uh other Force either internal or external something that will that will create this this manifestation and most of vedanta and the different schools arguing with each other are about this one point how does the one become the many does it really become the many is it an appearance is it this some Cosmic ignorance is it this Divine Powers so we have all these different possible interpretations he likes the idea of Shakti we know that we know that that he likes this is his I would say preferred Doctrine he doesn't have any one thing that he says oh this is right and that's wrong we know that but he likes this idea that to think of Brahman as as only nirguna doesn't give us the full weight he uses that language full way to the Bell fruit that we need to bring in this idea of Shakti also and whether manifest or unmanifest doesn't matter so so obviously always gave the illustration of the one the woman and the mother that uh the woman who gives birth to a child becomes a mother but she doesn't cease to be a woman the woman aspect is always there near-gon aspect is always there that you can't have saguna without nirguna you can't have the the relative without the absolute that that has to be there if something is going to manifest it has to be unmanifest itself so a Taco's illustration of of the vat of liquid is that vat of liquid uh can turn any cloth into any color that you want the liquid itself has to be clear it can't have any color of its own if it has any color any one color every cloth will come out that color if the liquid every cloth will come out blue if it can come out any color then it has to be colorless so this the Transcendent and they're gonna aspect of Brahmin is the ground and that's unchanging so water is water whether we're talking about the ocean is flat without waves or broken out into waves water is water that doesn't change so this is that a relationship and for ceramic Christian they're both real now when when the dwighten says that this universe is unreal what we can understand in the sense that uh it's it's constantly changing it has no substantial its name and form mostly if we if we go to the ocean I used to do this when I was a boy my my grandfather was a great fisherman he used to love to fish and I would go with him at night sometimes in Atlantic City out on the on the pier you could walk out to the very end and he would fish there and and the Moonlight I would watch the waves I would watch the waves and try to to see try to follow it and it became very clear to me that really there's really no such thing as a wave just the the surface of the water is taking a certain form it doesn't last for even a split second constantly changing there's really no such thing as a wave and yet it gives you the appearance of it so we can understand how the dwightening can say that this is unreal but it doesn't mean that it's just that I was imagining that wave no I'm seeing it I'm seeing it it's something that's that's they're visible but uh it hasn't has no uh substance to it other than the water other than the water but it has a reality of its own because there's nothing but water anyhow this is the way sarama Krishna I like to look at this that that nitya and that Leela both of these are real to that he says two aspects of the same reality as I've said before it is like the roof and the steps leading to it the absolute plays in many ways so the roof and the steps so this this is the way kakua explains how in the beginning we may see the waves that separate from the ocean somehow we may try to see this universe is is somehow different from Vermin and that enables us to to go higher and higher and have that realization of Brahman but then we say that it's all one coming down he says that then we understand that the steps are also made of the same in the same brick and lime and dust and all of that and mortar and whatever concrete they do the same stuff that the roof is made of but in the beginning we have to leave each step behind to get to the roof then we come down we have a different vision of things so blessing Grace can be impersonal blessing will have to be from uh either I some concept of a personal God or an individual we pray we ask somebody to bless us the Taco's idea of Grace it's kind of a universal idea that this grace is the very nature of ramen is Grace the very nature of Roman is that it wants to reveal itself to us so if if we think of all of the illustrations that taqwa gives of bringing water to to the field from the reservoir so we dig the Canon the canal the channel and everything and when we lift The Floodgate then the water comes on its own that's Grace we don't have to do anything at that point we remove the whatever obstacle there was and then it comes on its own so that's Grace and then of course this idea of the of catching the breeze that this is a very Universal type of idea so it's available to everyone so the fact that this Brahman is somehow trying to to fill our hearts his ego is is that Floodgate his ego is preventing it so the very nature of Brahman that it wants to reveal itself to us this is Grace we can explain it that way so then no idea of a blessing or anything if blessing is usually we we uh either very personal concept of God or we seek the blessings of a holy person something like that Lila or the two aspects of the same reality as I've said before it is like the roof and the steps leading to it the absolute plays in many ways now this is this is uh the vision the world viewers is that he'll never separate this near Brahman from it's the same the same infinite absolute reality uh can manifest itself and in so many different ways so the the upanishad upanishadic idea of the spider the spider will will manifest it's the whole universe out of itself and then we'll dwell within uh enter into each and every being so so many different ways that it can play so taku will say uh as ishwara so that means that uh this again the uh nirguna aspect is is the is the is the one uh ever-present aspect that that's never gone that's always there but as soon as the universe is there then it's playing as ishwara just as the the woman as soon as the child is born then this is that play of the Lord as mother huh so this is the first as ishwara as the Gods and part of this whole manifest Universe includes so many things that we don't see so many different Locas and everything we don't know anything about these things there was a very nice statement that was made by Diana De Saraswati you remember he had a conversation with Keisha talk what relates to this conversation keshav didn't believe in all these gods and goddesses and things so this Diana that he said that the Lord made so many different things the tables chairs trees but oh my sun Stars moving everything why couldn't he have made the gods also yeah and why should we think that this reality is the only reality is that because we only see humans and animals there can be other levels of reality with other types of beings and things like that subtle things so anyhow this is one way as as ishwara sorry as ishwara as the gods as man so this this was this this is what takur said was the most important uh way of of seeing the manifestation of God in the world uh in his later days when after we know that incident where he broke his arm and everything used to say this uh so uh and this was the aspect that swamiji liked the best very cool other Idols we're running around bowing down in temples and the greatest temple of God is this human body and then uh to to worship God dwelling within man through service this is the highest type of worship so this is that not a Lila not a Leela has two meanings it can also mean this Avatar with the god special manifestation of God as man as the Avatar but it could also mean seeing God dwelling within all beings and as the universe Virat so we start out with swarat and we end up with Virat we have this who was talking about step down the theory I think yeah this step down idea the swarat oh God is the infinite absolute Glory Beyond everything absolutely Transcendent nothing else existing at all then manifesting a little bit lower as the Creator so we have this is entering into everything and then being everything the sweetheart this idea so this we have the the sleeper who becomes the dreamer who becomes the the whole dream universe and becomes the actor in the dream well it kind of stepped down Theory step downward step down transfer something yeah this is one of the the ideas of Shiva this idea Virat and I've told this story before I had this very interesting little Epiphany you know the little every once another little light bulb will go off that we were on pilgrimage to cater knot I went with a couple of others and we went for uh Beth and rudra prayag you're supposed to bathe in all of these products and when you go there and it was nighttime so you have to walk down a lot of steps seven steps of stairs and everything to to get to the water level and everything and from there I looked up and you can see the the snow Peaks and it was just by chance it was a crescent moon just resting on the top of the snow peak yeah and and you can see where the Ganges is coming out it looks like there's matted locks and the snow the ashes on the body and then I think ah this is where it came from that idea yeah so Shiva it and when we think about it this Shavers we think these are the ones the infinite absolute reality but their kailash is right on Earth you can walk to it and by Kunta this is some other realm other thing so this is they also had this this kind of earthy idea both Transcendent and also yeah this whole universe like the old polish idea this universe is the body sun and the moon or the eyes the the idea and this takur lives in this world with that Vision he saw everything in the manifestation of the Divine we only talk about it this was this was his everyday experience that one day he was picking flowers to worship Shiva and said what is this this is Shiva himself that was the end of his speaking flowers for worshiping Shiva he saw the invasion of Virat so swarat Virat shining in its own glory and manifestes everything everything all possible variations in everything that's a little different kind of we we can't tie everything together a little different idea the Incarnation is the play of the absolute as man so now he's talking about another leader as the avatar do you know how the absolute plays this man it is like the rushing down of water from the big roof through a pipe so this will be those gargoyles we have them on the side of our Temple only it doesn't have the the lion and all of that but when you'll see sometimes when there's a heavy rain that the water will come out of them I don't know if you ever noticed ordinarily there's an internal drainage system so you don't see the water with a very heavy rain with overflow it'll it'll come out of that so out of the spout so Tucker used to use this illustration so it looks like uh this water is coming out of the lion out of the tiger out of all the different things but it's all only the same one in the same water the one that the same Divine Source manifesting in these different ways it is like the rushing down of water from the big roof through a pipe the power of itself descends to the conduit of a human form as water descends through the pipe so what is the difference the power the power we can say the power is what manifests everything but the presence is it's it's the actual environment itself present as consciousness so this is why if we go back to the dream illustration this dream universe is the power of the dreamer but it's the same the sleeper and the dreamer and the actor in The Dream It's not a manifestation it's the same the same eye I wake up I fell asleep I had a dream I did this in the dream the same I is not an extension manifestation it's the same uh we realized that when we wake up so this is interesting the power of such itself descends through the conduit of the human form as water descends through the pipe only 12 sages and the others recognize Rama as an incarnation of God not everyone can recognize an incarnation yeah this is Taco gives so many illustrations of uh or or ways in which we can understand these special Souls uh how we understand what's the meaning of the Incarnation that of course is is very mysterious we have everything from this highly quranic point of view almost mythological point of view the Vishnu in heaven has to come down and we have in Gita it's more of a Marx's marxian historical imperative forces of Dharma become so strong that the Avatar has to come it's kind of a historical imperative we can say marxian Theory of course we don't usually explain it that way but a little bit uh that it's not even a choice that it's the force of adharma and the lack of the Dharma in the world it causes the avatarity anyhow there's so many different ways of understanding it that but when these special Souls come we we see that very few recognize them in the beginning and then afterwards maybe 50 years 100 years tremendous Revolution takes place in the world Christ had a handful of disciples and Buddha was uh took another hundred years before it really became a such a huge movement interview so this is one of the signs otherwise these people come they make a big splash and there's a big big following for a while and then it's gone but this is one thing with the Avatar and so many other things that taqwa talks about this power that taqwa had to lift somebody up to change the whole uh thought current yes with it with the touch with the glance uh there's a power that he had to have so many types of realization and to do that type of spiritual practice and to be able to withstand the spiritual emotion that an ordinary person all body and mind will be shattered completely shattered with just a tiny bit of that and how we could withstand the the different types of Hava that he had day in and day out that we we stand in awe and we have to come up with a new category we may not understand how and why but I really very difficult to just say oh he was a great South Dakota or anything like that there's too much and holy mother the the power of love that they manifested so we say all the time whether we really understand what it means or not doesn't matter we recognize something very special and uh we stand in awe and reverence before them the Buddhist tradition is interesting because they don't have this idea was in Avatar and so they don't really worship the Buddha but they venerate they use this term to venerate that means to show the highest of respect and honor but if I'm not much different from worship but it fits in better with their worldview or something like that so uh especially during their lifetime very few how many recognized ramakrishna the half of the people thought he was mad huh or they just kind of dismissed him and uh thought he's a good person or a holy person but how many how few could really understand him how many very intimate disciples did he have you remember one day he said de la too let's let's take a count huh how many are there they came up with something like 30 I think and now we see I remember once you remember this 14 year old Guru this was in this early 70s his parents set him up as an avatar or something plain loads of westerners came he would sit in their open field I happen to be there by chance in in Delhi my first trip to India and tens of thousands had come to see him this budgie little guy sitting on a big throne and people with waving back and forth with these big Palm leaves and everything like that and then within a few years nothing he fell in love with uh with his secretary and they got married so they set up his elder brother as the Avatar and everything so the huge huge to do over all of this and then gone and then you have and this was very interesting because the J krishnamurthy was speaking the same I did I happen to be in Delhi and this this 14 year old who do I don't know that's what they called him in those days and uh Jay krishnamurthy was also speaking I went to see him and they were about 15 people such a genuine Soul I'm not going to say the Incarnation or anything like that but it's a genuine you know authentic real soul and uh people don't care for that they like it's a little splashy stuff yeah so how few can recognize yeah these these great Souls when they come because they they remain hidden and taco will explain they're so human they and they don't pretend to be anything they don't play any of these roles or anything yeah this this really uh when we can't even comprehend what it means to be an avatar how can we distinguish who has more power less power and everything these are these will be things that taqwa talks about that you know he he asked him how many honors do I have and he talks about this one is is a part in the particle of the Divine advice tradition has lots of these things all different degrees of manifestation and everything like that there's too much we we how do we understand yeah we can say if we want among the direct disciples that perhaps uh swamiji had greater power that he could raise lift up a whole audience and everything but it's kind of foolish on our part to try to uh we can't even recognize them how can we distinguish who has more power and less power but yeah there will be in in this put on us especially they may make those types of distinctions the bhagavata of course makes the ultimate distinction that Krishna is more than the Avatar that is the Avatar he's the source of all of the of the Dust krsna's [Music] doesn't even list him as an avatar listen to everybody else but he is the Lord himself any of this is a little bit of fanaticism we can say word or devotion if we don't want to say fanaticism yeah yeah degree of power even in human beings that we all have a different degree of power in terms of uh even problem solving and thinking and activity and everything and and Leadership things like that so there'll be some difference of course it is God alone who incarnates himself as man to teach people the ways of love and knowledge yeah this we have these the two theories one is in the Dharma idea from the Gita and shurama Christian likes this other idea better this the uh that he was born he took human birth in order to to uh spread throughout the world there's a knowledge and devotion and peace and love and all of that and he says many times the Avatar's main purpose of the Avatar is to teach love of God so because Avatar fits in more with this bhakti yoga of course than with Yani yoga and uh what does ramakrishna teach us how to love God and of course what is the ultimate goal of life and everything but uh the tremendous love and longing of the heart for God realization that we we see that in this life so it is God alone who incarnates himself as man to teach people the ways of love and knowledge well what do you think of me now Taco would ask this question many times not that he wanted to flattery or anything but to engage uh the depth of of the M's understanding and and faith and everything at that time but he doesn't really it's not a real question he doesn't wait for an answer either him doesn't say anything once my father went to Gaia now he's going to explain see the birth of the Avatar is also something special this we we always find this in different in Christianity of course with this Immaculate Conception and everything yeah yeah once my father went to Gaia there said to him in a dream this guy has a very special place this is where chaitanya Devo also had his uh Awakening you can say that he went there to do shradha for his father and there he met his is his Guru and came back completely transformed he was very proud or arrogant scholar and came back this humble loving sweet it was that happened in Gaia also he had initiation there and there said to him in a dream I shall be born as your son thereupon my father said to him oh Lord see they were simple people he didn't question he didn't say oh it was just a dream he was convinced this was something real thereupon my father said to him oh Lord I am a poor Brahman how shall I be able to serve you don't worry about it replied it will be taken care of now SRI Rama Krishna is going to uh try to explain to him that there are certain circumstances to the birth of these great Souls and that generally we'll find there'll be one or two even childhood who recognize them this was the case with the baby gopala and with caitanya Deva when he was very young also my sister put into his mother used to worship my feet with flowers and sandal paste one day I placed my foot on her head and said to her you will die in Benares she was much older he goes right away and talk over the same age more or less once matar Babu said to me Father there is nothing inside you but God your body is like an empty shell it may look from outside like a pumpkin but inside there is nothing neither flesh nor seed once I saw you as someone moving with the veil on what are these it seems when you open up a pumpkin and you have to scoop everything out yeah these are all these some scatters and the impurities and the desires and and the bad Tendencies and passions and everything he was free from all of these to him I am shown everything beforehand you used to have all of these Visions we know before swamiji came before Rock Hall came he would have some Vision that someone will come and this will be your spiritual child this would be uh your your helper with his Leela and everything he used to get these presentiment with visions beforehand once I saw gauranga and his devotee singing kirtan in the panchavati I think I saw a bull around there and you too we've seen so many times this is one of the very few visions that taco is not very clear on for some reason that he almost always mentions I think I think I saw you there also I don't know why I wanted to know the experience of gauranga the chaitanya and was shown we've shown them at shambazar in our native District this is not the shambazar in Kolkata where Taco lived this is what did they call the fully something like that it was near kamarpukur another one of the little villages in that area a crowd gathered there because they used to have this gear done it would go on for a week something like that day and night they would have cured on there I saw that in one other place in the outside of a Dhaka this is in tulsi's place he took me there they had the same thing continuous scared then yeah day and night they had a big fire there and people would be singing and dancing around the fire and everything it was really something to say foreign gathered they even climbed the trees and the walls they stayed with me day and night for seven days I had no privacy whatever thereupon I said to the Divine mother mother I've had enough of it and this happened in panihati also with that which is one day I am at peace now now we get this statement we were talking about this earlier I shall have to be born once more a very cryptic statement with kind of Mystic cryptic statement that uh I don't know exactly how we how we try to understand this is now if he knows himself to be an avatar and this Avatar will come again and again again and again why did you see one more time yeah anybody have any ideas have you thought about it no yeah in connection with that um [Music] before College yoga is over okay one one thing that comes to mind a little bit I'm not saying this is an explanation but the the way they explain the caitanya Lila chaitanya's uh uh Avatar is that Krishna himself wanted to be born uh with the with the mind of of Radha he wanted to be born with it with a devotional feeling of Radha so because when he saw uh how much love around the head held perfectly unselfish it was he was the Paradigm the Paragon of of of love and devotion and represents this Paradigm of this that uh the ecstatic love ecstatic love for God that he thought uh may I be born uh some somehow so that I can experience what Radha had so they look upon this chaitanya the followers of caitanya look upon this chaitanya Incarnation as uh until Krishna that within the black and without uh golden complexion this is this was the how they explained if he's an incarnation of Krishna why does he have this golden complexion so they say because that rather had a golden complexion within he was really Krishna but experiencing the world uh the way Radha did understanding that uh the Ecstasy in bhava all the different levels of of uh ecstatic love that Radha had so that Krishna wanted to be born maybe once more in that particular form now I don't know if it's not a a really good explanation we'll have to remember ask somebody else son I don't know so too high any ideas [Laughter] [Music] he pointed yeah to he says in the when we when we do home and other things the uh they're uh eight directions and up and down the ten ten directions and uh each one has a different presiding deity so why you is the deity for the Northwestern part so he said they all have to be born again so we say in the Northwestern Direction yeah he explains it that way [Music] that I don't know yeah no no we yeah yeah 200 years yeah he says you only heard it from okay anyhow we don't have to take these things so literally that uh yeah it could be Seattle we have no idea I see Punjab he'll be a Punjabi next time you think so okay that was prativa ah okay yeah maybe yeah it'll be a pattern there are certain things that swamiji has said yes swamiji yeah with regard to this Corazon and the other places in turkey and in there's some Vision with four different areas in the there and yeah anyhow we don't this is really useless speculation anyhow It's Curious I I think he may have said it one other time but but this always struck me when when I read this I'm at peace now I shall have to be born once more because when he was asked somebody asked him all of these when the devotees who come to you will they all be liberated and he said no he said only those who were not these antaranas those who are within this Inner Circle they'll have to come again when I come again but he doesn't say just one more time but we take them in again and again and again but there must be some special significance to the statement I just don't know what it is so uh he said I'm at peace now I shall have to be born once more therefore I am not giving all knowledge to my companions yeah if if they maybe we can say this is a little bit like uh with withramaji that will keep it under lock and key a little bit slight Veil of Maya so he can do his work something like that yes [Music] he transferred all of his power he said I'll dwell within you yeah yeah yeah so I am at peace now I shall have to be born once more anybody out there in this uh YouTube land if you have any ideas you can send an email therefore I'm not giving all knowledge to my companions with a smile suppose I give you all knowledge will you then come to me again so willingly yeah how do we even imagine all of this these great Souls is like they're they're just uh different different moons in the sky and the planet comes and when the planet starts to move they'll come and circle it and come with it and everything we don't know this power of attraction so that they come in white Taco says oh you've come so late why did you make me wait so long yeah when the Krakow swamiji in everything sometimes says he spoke like that I recognized you now he's talking to him on the hearing you read the caitanya Bhagavad is one of the biographies of caitanya do you are my own now look at this we sometimes make a mistake when we think that these antarangas are only the monastic disciples he says you are my own the same substance like Father and Son all of you are coming here again so when he comes again they have to come again huh all the same Playmates in this Leela when you pull one part of the cult me creeper all the branches come toward you you are all relatives like brothers so this this connection well this is that uh like that water Hyacinth then you look at the surface and it looks like all separate things but but it's all yeah all connected to the bottom you pull one and they all come together so some special connection you were all relatives like brothers suppose and the others had gone to Puri and you were there too would you live separately before you came here now this is the m and he's not talking about before you were born now we meant before he came to to see srama Krishna before you came here you didn't know who you were now you will know now this is also these are all mystical language when we say he said when swamiji knows who he really is he'll refuse to live in the body very mystical language does it mean the die of the self does it mean there's play made in this uh in this Leela and everything now it sounds like he's telling m that you're one of the antarongas that you've come along with me remember this is the end of this long stay very important period here so this you can imagine how M feels hearing this huh after he's gotten scoldings after so many things have happened he berates him for living with his wife all sorts of things and then at the end he's yes everything leading up to this the these final final days when he stays with him before you came here you didn't know who you were now you will know it is God who as the guru makes one no so uh not only does he want him to realize of course this is ramagana he wants to know them to know his real nature and and have that type of realization but this isn't that on the realm of Leela who is he within this Leela he has to know but Leela he wants him to know also what role he has to play and we know that it was one of the most significant roles I would say perhaps after swamiji Evan's role was most important perhaps I mean we can argue this of course but but what he did for us by recording all of this ah if we didn't have that what a tremendous loss that would be nangta told the story of the Tigris and the herd of goats so ramadi used to tell the same story but he would do it with the Alliant and sheep with the same story we want the Tigress attacked a herd of goats a hunter saw her from a distance and killed her the Tigris was pregnant and gave birth to a cub as she expired the Cub began to grow in the company of the goats at first it was nourished by the Sea goats and later on as it grew bigger it began to eat grass and bleed like the goats gradually the Cub became a big tiger but still it ate grass and bleeded when attacked by other animals it would run away like the goats one day a fierce looking tiger attacked the herd it was amazed to see a tiger in the herd eating grass and running away with the goats at its approach it left the goats and caught hold of the grass-eating tiger which began to bleed and tried to run away but the fierce tiger dragged it to the water and said now look at your face in the water you see you have the pot face of a tiger it is exactly like mine next it pressed a piece of meat into its mouth at first the grass eating tiger refused to eat the meat then it got the taste of the meat and relished it at last the fierce tiger said to the grass eater what a disgrace you lived with the goats and ate grass like them and the other was really ashamed of himself so what does this mean see swamiji not just ramakrishna but Swami he liked this idea that our real nature is is is nearby is that we have to this ottman you know we can look at this ottoman as a very pure philosophical concept of yes Consciousness and the witness and everything or we can look at this this ottoman as the source of all power and strength now we may say that it's it's really once we know where the ottman we feel that strength but anyhow so swamiji he used to recite this this line foreign so this the uh God realized Soul he'll break through break through this this cage of the world like a lion breaking through its like a bamboo cage you can't it'll just break through so this is that type of realization that uh and that's why he said this wait until he liked this idea the lion of vedanta that we should feel that the self within is the source of all power and strength now just this this very vague philosophical idea that pure Consciousness but that when we have that realization we know or who we really are then we won't have that fear that fear will leave us will fear to feel tremendous power and strength eating grass is like enjoying lust and gold to bleed and run away like a goat is to behave like an ordinary man going away with a new tiger is like taking shelter with the guru who awakens one's spiritual consciousness and recognizing him alone as one's relative to see one's face rightly is to know one's real self so how does this tie in with everything else that taqwa went to M to understand both he wants him to understand his real nature that strength and everything within from this nithya point of view and from the Lila point of view is the Eternal connection with srama Krishna whether what a blessed experience for him after staying so many days with srama Krishna and going through so many changes and upheavals emotional things and everything to finally get to this point there will be more things also okay let us stop here because uh yeah 300 Krishna stood up this will be the end of that conversation um we bow our heads before shramakrishna who was stainless of the infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of our worship [Music] peace peace peace
