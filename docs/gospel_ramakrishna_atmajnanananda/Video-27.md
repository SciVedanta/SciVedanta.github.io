[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna with Swami Atmajnanananda (10/09/20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WpPeF7gkdA)

foreign your words are like nectar bringing life to squirt souls they are praised by poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of srama krishna we're in page 139 for those who like to follow along this is the chapter the master in keshav it's october 27th 1882 it was friday the day of laxmi puja the setting for this is that k sub who was the head of the brahmo samaj of india or the new dispensation the name that they gave it this was shortly after the split that took place uh where uh one half became what is now called or what was called then the shadow brahma so much the general brahma samaj and keshav's side was called the brahma-samaj of india or the new dispensation was the term that they gave for it and the what had happened that day was that kesha came by steamer he had married his daughter to the son of the maharaja of kuch bihar and this apparently was their steamer so they got to use it so he would have outing sometimes with the members of his brahmos-hamad so the split took place because of this marriage he married his daughter who was then a few months short of the marriageable age that the brahmos themselves had said now i mentioned last time i wasn't certain whether vijay was was just vida krishna goswami he he became the main acharya for the i wasn't sure uh how much was because of him and how much was because of other people but we were reading in the great master just last night that that that bj krishna gosvami was very devoted to truthfulness and he really did he really was offended that kesha himself had set the age of marriage it was either 15 or 16. i don't remember but that he himself hadn't kept to it so so the media krishna gosvami himself was one of the ones who felt that he couldn't remain with the the brahma-samaj under kesha and he left it was a big blow to keshav and of course it was difficult for the media krishna gosvami also because they were very very close bj krishna goswami was his right hand man probably something like that uh now on this day bj krishna came apparently with some of his followers from uh his half of the brahma-samaj and we're sitting in the room with swami krishna having a nice conversation with him at the same time kesha chandrasen showed up with a whole group of his people and they came on on board a camera on shore and went to shirami krishna's room and told them that they were waiting for him with the steamer and they wanted him to come they did it from time to time we hear earlier that they did it with somebody named cook some englishman who was probably the first englishman to meet ramakrishna in that type of setting so they did it from time to time now uh bijoy and kesha probably hadn't even spoken to each other they not that they had any hatred or anything but a very uncomfortable situation but bijay krishna goswami wanted the company of sramakrishna and the others and so they went with him so this is this is the background they all got on board at the same time and later we'll see how sriramic krishna will try to smooth things over because again it was an uncomfortable situation these are the two two groups that uh that split apart from each other actually it was bjor christmas group that left keshav's group so this is the situation here and shirami krishna is speaking to all of them in the gospel it simply says to the brahmo devotees so we're not making any distinction now some of them probably were remain friendly some of them probably didn't we read last night that narendra he didn't care too much he went to both and even the ones who left keisha they they all uh considered him to be uh a wonderful person and a highly spiritual soul only some of them felt that that was very hypocritical what he did takwa didn't take used to say the duty of the father to arrange a good marriage he arranged a good marriage for his daughter it turns out that his daughter also became a well-known person uh what was her name or something i don't know but she got involved or founded some girls school or did did some work she made a bit of a name for herself of course she had a lot of money and a lot of opportunity to do things it was a very good marriage okay so that's that's the background so tucker is talking to them and i'll start at the bottom of page 138. he said to the divine mother i prayed only for pure love i offered flowers at her lotus feet and prayed to her mother here is thy virtue here is thy vice take them both and grant me only pure love for thee here is thy knowledge here is thy ignorance take them both and grant me only pure love for thee here is thy purity here is thy impurity take them both mother and grant me only pure love for thee here is thy dharma hears thy adharma take them both mother and grant me only pure love for thee now this uh taqwa used to talk about sudha bhakti and sometimes we get the impression that sudha bhakti will be something different from what we call jana misra bhakti devotion and knowledge combined uh i don't think so this is my own theory that when takara talks about this pure devotion i think he's really emphasizing the fact that it's selfless devotion that there's no hint of of any personal gain not uh not loving god for the sake of getting anything just for the pure love of god because takara used to like this idea that there should be some some deeper understanding behind our our devotion and if you want to love someone you should know who you love so he didn't like this this idea of simply and yes be a devotee don't think about anything don't discriminate he wanted people to do that also but in the sense that there should be no selfish motive behind it this is my my feeling i don't think it's in uh contradiction to the side of jana misra to the brahma devotees now listen to a song by ram prasad come let us go for a walk oh mind the kali the wish fulfilling tree how does it go [Music] [Music] something like that i can't sing but there's a tune which i did pretty good this is called the prasadi there's a tune it's actually used for many other songs ron prasad he composed many songs to that tune but then other authors would just write things and they could use the same tone and became very famous it's very beautiful i wish i could sing but uh so it says come let us go for a walk or mine to kali the wish fulfilling tree this kalpatoru it's famous for us because taquer became the wish fulfilling tree that we say on january 1st of 1886 this was a tree if you if you could find this tree and sit underneath this tree then whatever wish you had would be fulfilled so this we approach mother and with great sincerity have some uh shall fulfill our wish come let us go for a walk or mind the kali the wish fulfilling tree and there beneath it gather the four fruits of life dharma of your two wives this passion and worldliness this is they are called jaya these the two wives and pravriti bring along this passion only nevertheless is the tendency of the mind to turn deep within for ability the outgoing tendency of the mind engagement entanglement attachments all of those things so of your two wives dispassion and worldliness bring along this passion only on your way to the tree and asked her son asked us on discrimination about the truth when will you learn to lie o mind in the abode of blessedness with cleanliness and defilement on either side of you only when you found a way to keep these wives contentedly under a single roof what does that mean that means fulfilling our household duties being engaged in the world whatever according to dharma and at the same time with the drawing the mind having inner renunciation so pravriti has a role to play the householder life is connected with purifiti this life is connected with liberty withdrawing without getting attached how do we do it and god knows we we cling to god we hold on and we have if we have that higher ideal that we're doing everything just as an offering then we won't get attached if we have this idea that i really all i want is is love of god we won't get attached if we have this idea i'm really not the the agent of action i'm the witness then we won't get attached if we feel mother is the operator i am the machine we won't get attached we have dozens and dozens of different methods of using that we can adopt so that we don't get attached if we have longing we are longing to lead a life of devotion to lead a life of offering then we won't get this type of attachment and if we understand that attachment brings suffering that will also save us to a large extent only when you have found the way to keep these wives contentedly under a single roof will you behold the matchless form of mother shyama ego and ignorance your parents instantly banished from your sight and should delusion seek to drag you to its hole manfully cling to the pillar of patience tied to the post of unconcern the goats of vice and virtue killing them with the sword of knowledge if they rebel with the children of worldliness your first wife plead from a goodly distance and if they will not listen drown them in wisdom see says ram prasad if you do as i say you can submit a good account o mind to the king of death prasad was an accountant there will be lots of references to that i'll tell you in a second and i shall be well pleased with you and call you my darling the story is that his life was a little bit similar to srama krishna's life when when he was young his father passed away he had to go to calcutta to make money same thing in the suramar christian's case it was his elder brother who went and brought him along with him he took a job in some business office and had to keep accounts but instead of doing his work he used to write the name durga kali things in the ledger and sometimes he would start composing songs and his co-workers none of them liked him why because they all took bribes and did other things and he wouldn't do any of that so they resented him because of that and they found out what he was doing they saw his ledger and said okay now we'll get him in trouble so they took it to their to their boss the boss it turned out was a devotee of the divine mother and as soon as he read the songs that were on just in the in the margin of the ledger tears came to his eyes and he called in rob prasad and he said you weren't born to do this clerical work you go back to your village he lived in a place charlie's halle shahort not too far from calcutta you go back there whatever salary i gave you here i'll give you there and you won't have to worry about money and you compose your songs and and worship the divine mother so there's so sometimes we'll see these references to keeping accounts and then takwa says why shouldn't one be able to realize god in the world this was the question this is a long answer to that question and it's asked over and over again see the brahmos they they had no uh tradition uh monastic tradition within their little circle they of course they were hindu to a certain extent so they understood the monastic tradition they respected srama krishna because he led the life of a monk but all of their acharya's teachers and leaders were married people keisha himself was married bijoy himself was married so uh they hear all of this talk of renunciation they say that taqwa has some disciples he wants them to lead the life of monks and so they always had this doubt can one realize god in the world while living in the world before they met ramakrishna the question probably didn't arise too much because kesha didn't talk about those things if you do you have devotion to god you worship god that will be enough but after coming to swami krishna this question comes up very very often so tako says why shouldn't one be able to realize god in this world king janaka had such realization king janaka has always pointed to he is the one shining example we have of somebody who had not just worldly duties he had to run a kingdom he was a king a video he was a king we've run across him not only in the ramayana stories and everything but also in the upanishad he was a great gyani also these these yagni valkys others these great pundits would come and they would have these high philosophical discussions sometimes arguments with king janaka sometimes he would be the one who would end up teaching them so he was considered to be a great soul both for the ideal karma yogi and also as a great great ghani king janaka had such realization ram prasad described the world as a mere framework of illusion now takur is referring to a different song that and there's a story behind it that in holly shahor there was another deputy there who was a very strongly vaishnava i don't remember his name something goes swami he was some some gosvami and he he was a thorn in the side of ram prasad because whenever ram prasad would compose a song he would compose a similar song kind of making fun of it with an opposite idea so he would follow him around sometimes and if ron prasad would sing a song he would sing his own song so and as much as takur loves ram prasad somehow he always liked the the we can say the answer rebuttal song to this one song of ram prasad yeah so whenever even taku does it whenever takwa talks about that uh this this world is a framework of illusion that was a this song that ron prasad wrote and this other gosvami he wrote the song this very world is a mansion of mirth so takur somehow took sides with the other guy even though he loved ram prasad so much so he says but if one loves god to hallowed feed then now he'll quote this other song by this gosvami this very world is a mansion of mirth so in the beginning everything is maya this world is is full of suffering and misery that we want to get out we want to escape this is tucker says this is more of a beginner's attitude he says but if one loves god's hallowed feet then this very world is a mansion of mirth here i can eat hear drink and make merry janika's might was unsurpassed what did he lack of the world or the spirit holding to one as well as the other he drank his milk from a brimming cup huh so tucker he quotes this song very often all laugh but one cannot be a king janaka all of a sudden januk had first practiced much austerity and solitude yeah it was very common for the brahmos and others to say our idealist is janaka we want to be like king janaka now there's a there's a little bit of a pun here because janaka means somebody who gives a birth is a father yeah so swamiji used to used to joke sometimes that these people of kolkata they think they can just be janakas by having a lot of children so what tak was saying is yes we read in guitar we read through karma alone some attain perfection and janaka and others janakady says and others but taqwa always adds that but you don't know how much uh of austerities king jannika practiced before all of this he said with head down and feet up in the air doing different types of austerities and things and and living in solitude and everything preparing himself so that he could be an ideal karma yogi otherwise this attachment can come so he says john again first practice much austerity and solitude even if one lives in the world one must go into solitude now and then this was one of the prescriptions that krishna made the the reasons are very simple and very complex the very simple thing is that we have more time we remove ourselves from the environment we remove ourselves from all of the old associations we we can be very introspective we can go very deep in our spiritual practice this is the one thing this is a very obvious simple thing the other thing when we go into solitude that we begin to realize ourselves is that we invert things we flip things upside down that when we when we're in the presence of other people we're seeing things as people see us this is another theory that i have this this idea of identification with the body uh it comes to a great extent because we see other people looking upon us as the body that's the only way they can see us so when we spend a lot of time in solitude that disappears that element is not there and after a while we start to experience ourselves from the inside out not from the outside in from the inside out which is really what we are i am i am the center of the universe i am the consciousness of everything around me even of this body that that's my real nature we start to feel that when we spend a lot of time in solitude we get in the company of other people and all of a sudden i'm an embodied being we live alone for a long time we can almost forget that we have a body we we walk down the street if we're we don't have any companions with us people are bothering us and we feel like our feet aren't touching the ground we're simply observing everything observing this body we can really feel that we are what we really are swamiji says in meditation this is the one time we can be who we really are but this is because meditation is also solitude so when we're in solitude we can also have that type of feeling so it's a very very helpful thing the second aspect of it only comes when we practice it if we live for a long time in solitude then we start to to realize ourselves as the as this as the self and cease to identify ourselves as the body be because there aren't other people to see us as a body so a lot of it comes from that we identify ourselves with the body not that other people don't recognize our personality and everything but if they want to see us what does it mean to see somebody it means to see their body we can't see anything else to see the body so so it will be a great help to a man if he goes away from his family he lives alone and weeps for god even for three days so tucker always emphasizes that uh even if it's a short time because he knows people can't take time away from their work and their family and everything even if he thinks of god for one day in solitude when he has the leisure that too will be good sometimes he tells people build a little hud or something not far if you have a little extra land something a little place where you can go and just remove yourselves from the family situation people shed a whole jug of tears for wife and children remember he's talking only to the men that's why everything is wife and children this remember we're on the boat still all the brahmos with it people shed a whole jug of tears for wife and children but who cries for the lord now and then one must go into solitude and practice spiritual discipline to realize god so we can increase the intensity increase the time we eliminate all the distractions a very very positive thing and we can learn to love solitude we can learn to love solitude enjoy our own company this is not not of course the highest type of admiral but we enjoy our own company not the same as a god realized soul who revels in in the south but still a little bit of touch of that we can experience living in the world and entangled in many of its duties the aspiring during the first stage of spiritual life finds many obstacles in the path of concentration while the trees on the footpath are young they must be fenced around otherwise they will be destroyed by cattle the fence is necessary when the tree is young but it can be taken away when the trunk is thick and strong then the tree won't be hurt even if an elephant is tied to it then tako gives a nice example the disease of worldliness is like typhoid and there is a huge jug of water and a jar of savory pickles in the typhoid patient's room typhoid is a disease that makes people feel thirsty all of the time this is one of the things about it i don't know too much about it so the disease of worldliness is like typhoid and there are huge jug of water and a jar of savory pickles in the typhoid patient's room so if you want to cure him of his illness you must remove him from that room so as soon as he sees the pickle the mouth will water and as he sees the water held the desire to drink the worldly man is like a typhoid patient patient the various objects of enjoyment are the huge drug of water and the craving for their enjoyment is its thirst the very thought of pickles makes the mouth water you don't have to bring them near and he is surrounded with them the companionship of woman now for for women he'll say the companionship of man is the pickles hence treatment and solitude is necessary now it's not only when when he says man or woman here any object of enjoyment another point is a very nice point here i was thinking about this yesterday also we read in chapter two of gita in the state of pragne section about this this causal chain uh which which starts with the mind dwelling on on sense objects and through that some attachment comes some desire comes if we don't fulfill it some anger comes and then we lose our sense of discrimination and and we completely become unhinged now what taqwa is saying is that there's a step before this that it's true if we're always thinking about something that the mind will get attached to that and some desire to enjoy it will come what taku are saying is that we're fueling the mind by being in the presence of these things so taqwa is telling us physically remove yourselves he says okay suppose someone has an addiction to to alcohol now it's not enough to simply say well don't think about it of course if they're constantly thinking about taking a drink that's one thing but if they're constantly spending time in the tavern then of course that desire will be even greater so we say physically remove yourself separate yourself from that object of enjoyment so that the mind won't be constantly dwelling on it the mind can still dwell on it but this is the first he's saying this is the first step so the very sensible thing this is why we wonder why he's talking about these young boys and always warning them don't keep the company of the women even even if they're great devotees women don't keep their company because your minds will automatically become attached this is the nature because the the unright mind is like the typhoid patient in the company of possible attachments that the the mind will will go in that direction this is this is actually one of the tests one of the tests for that sometimes though they'll if they want to know if a young man is qualified to become a monk they'll say if he's constantly in the presence of of worldly things and the mind formed a little desire for that is understandable if he's if he's away from them if he joins the monastery and uh if if he's not constantly bombarded with tv heads and billboards and things like that or or he sees uh women coming there all of the time and the mind is still going in that direction then it's not a good sign now what tuck were saying is that you won't even know unless you remove yourself go into solitude for some time of course he's talking to the householders now but for the monks also if we go into solitude and we find that the mind feels free and then the mind can go deep within he's saying that this is a very positive thing hence treatment and solitude is necessary so please don't don't get offended all of our wonderful women devotees that talk worse is he's not blaming the women he sometimes he said even even if a woman is is the pure soul the greatest devotee that is this this unfortunate fact that lust is built into the constitution of of human beings maybe men more than women i don't know so it's not the fault of the women and it's also not an excuse to keep them veiled and and and shuttered up that's also not that's also unfair but this is this is the fact of it so he's saying that this is why he he would wonder how uh these places where men and women are sitting together for meditation that half the time the eyes will be opened and looking from both sides back and forth and uh even the brahma samaj separated the men and the women yeah because he would when when he was talking to the keisha keisha once he gave in his lecture he was saying uh dive deep in the ocean you know dive deeper and tucker left and he said you can dive deep you have to keep coming back what will happen to them it says pointing to the ones on the other side of the screen that meant that the women were all sitting on the other side of the screen so even they separated them and when they came to visit they didn't bring their wives and when he went to keshev's house or any he went many times to the homes of the brahmos and afterwards he would go into the inner apartment where the women were and spend time with them and take his meal with them they were more educated because they encouraged education they discouraged child marriage they encourage a remarriage of widows so that's true but they still observed a little bit of this separation that it came i think it came into india after the mogul invasion mostly and not so much in south and everything but it's true they they were very much in favor of education of the there was a brahma girls school yeah yes very highly educated of course it was actually his father who was the real founder of the adi brahma-samaj the original brahma-samaj we can we can give some credit to rambo hon roy also for really maybe being the original uh inspiration behind the whole movement but that towards father was really the the founder so yes they they comparatively they were much more liberal uh with regard to uh education of women and the equal opportunity but not 100 they they were also victims of of the social conventions of the day and thought in those terms you know one may enter the world after attaining discrimination and dispassion now takwa would scare everybody sometimes he would say first realize god then live in the world and everyone says how is that even possible even this is a little scary that first attain discrimination and dispassion that's a big thing before we even get married and have jobs and do all of those things how do we how do we do that so he says one may enter the world after attaining discrimination and dispassion in the ocean of the world there are six alligators lust anger and so forth so this is sometimes called shad repu these six enemies kama krota what is it there's a little verse there are a few different versions of it anyhow uh and then there are eight nooses and things like there are all different things but we know these to be the different passions that's all lust anger and so forth but if you need not fear the alligators if you smear your body with turmeric before you go into the water it has a pungent smell and they don't like it it keeps them away i don't know if it really works don't try it [Music] discrimination and dispassion are the turmeric now discrimination of course we don't use that word much anymore it has a such a negative connotation to it but what is what is ultimately important in life we don't have to go into all of this uh this world is unreal and god alone is all of that what is ultimately important in life what uh what is this life meant for what do we want to accomplish in life this type of discrimination very important and this passion that let us not get carried away with all of our attachments to this world and really attachment just steals away the ability of the mind to to to discriminate to make good decisions to know what to do what not to do so these two vivek or the turmeric discrimination is the knowledge of what is real and what is unreal it is the realization that god alone is the real and eternal substance and that all else is unreal transitory and impermanent this is this is enough for us we don't have to think is it is it a dream is it a projection we don't have to go there we know that this world is transitory that it's impermanent there's nothing to hold on to is insubstantial and you must cultivate intent zeal for god this is a another one of the taku's formulas that this viraga veda is always accompanied by anuraga it doesn't do any good to to eliminate our attachment to the world if we don't replace it with attachment to god or to truth this is longing for enjoyment has to be replaced with a longing for realization so there's anuraga thakura always adds that and you must cultivate intend zeal for god you must fear love for him and be attracted to him the gopis of vrindavan felt the attraction of krishna let me sing you a song now he's singing the exact wrong song for the brahmos they don't care for any of this krishna leela the stuff like that they were modern people they based everything on the upanishads punishables that means none of this wishiwashi mythological love stories or anything like that they love the upanishads and the path of knowledge takara always call them bhaktas yeah yeah i like you because you're devotees you're not gyanis but they thought of themselves more as ghani's yeah gyanis but they still had some type of love but not this intense personal type of love love of god listen the flute has sounded in yondered wood there i must fly for krishna waits on the path narendra also hated these things in the beginning but he sang these songs he didn't really hate it he would pretend that he hated it but he actually sang a lot of these radhakrishnan songs tell me friends will you come along or no to you my krishna is merely an empty name to me he is the anguish of my heart you hear his flute notes only with your ears but oh i hear them in my deepest soul i hear his flute calling radha come out without you the grove is shorn of its loveliness the master sang the song with tears in his eyes and said to keshav and the other brahmo devotees now he's going to say something that i think is very very important i i think that this is extremely helpful whether you accept radha and krishna or not now what does that mean on the one hand it can mean whether you believe that they ever existed it may be sheer poetry that's on the one hand on the other hand whether you even like the idea even if it's real you may say what is this this is a some young girl who falls in love with some young boy so whether it's real or not real you may not even like it and you may not think that you may think it's just poetry sheer poetry he says please do accept their attraction for each other try to create the same yearning in your heart for god yearning is all you need in order to realize him now the point here is that this radha krishna episode and we don't have to accept it as historical it makes no difference whatsoever we can say that it's sheer poetry just just for the sake of argument let's say that it's your poetry if we can understand the pain and anguish that radha felt when she was separated from krishna and that intense joy she felt when she was in the company of krishna that's enough this is what tucker is saying it's enough try to understand what they're trying to teach us through this story it doesn't matter whether you accept it as real or not real and adopt it to in whatever way you want to if you're brahmos and you and you think about god as as brahman okay the supreme absolute brahman at least feel that his life is empty unless i have that realization and that with every ounce of my being i want to have union with that brahman i want to realize god accept that attitude this is what he's saying this this is the the attitude is everything as is our attitude it says feeling of love here usually but ad is our ad so is our gain so this is this is the beauty of this relationship we can forget about this idea of love between between a young boy and a young girl and all of that type of stuff that's not the important thing the important thing is that this world is empty without this realization this tremendous longing and the tremendous joy that we have when we experience union with god in whatever way we understand it so this is this is the real meaning behind uh what's called virah bhava and milan abhava virah bhava that yes we should feel miserable that there's an emptiness that we we feel that uh we're separated from our our real being what is that that real the essence of our being it may be personal maybe impersonal it may be the truth that i'm i'm wallowing in ignorance i know that i don't know the purpose of life i don't know who i am even at and because of that i'm miserable there's a tremendous longing to have that experience and then we have it the tremendous joy that comes so this is what talk is saying that forget about the personalities for forget about the story try to understand the tremendous longing that a young girl will have when she has a crush on a young boy this is really what's happening how old are they 12 30 something like that there's they would force these young girls to get married to some older man miserable at home and the young boy is there who plays the flute who's charming they all get together and sing and dance and every moment they're longing to go back and have this rash dela it's not for everybody it's not for everybody it's not for everybody but this longing is for everybody this is what takur is saying he's saying that this feeling of bakulata this intense yearning to have that union and it's definitely not for everybody and he knows it's not for the brahmos he knows it's not for them to think in terms to try to really do i want to try to identify myself with a 12 year old girl who's anxious to go and and play with some boy who's playing his flute with cows around and everything that doesn't appeal to my mind very much but i understand i have to try to think what is the frame of mind of radha does she have anything selfish in her mind she only cares to make krishna happy there's so many beautiful things in this this rather krishna leela and and we have to understand and draw that don't simply dismiss it and say no it's not for me i don't like all of this stuff swamiji himself didn't care for this even though he would sing these songs and everything he would say we're monks why do we have to have a relationship and think about that but he understood he understood the the beauty of it and this is what taku is saying it's uh we we can learn a lesson from all of these different bhagavatas somebody may say you want me to identify with hanuman he was a monkey and that i should just do blindly think about only what the master wants being like a servant but we have to understand the nature of the mind of hanuman how pure it was no selfish motive whatsoever each of the bhavas has a special uh element to it there's selflessness there's boldness there's fearlessness there's pride i am a servant of god each one has something special in this radha krishna lila the specialty is this intense longing for union with god that we can all adopt in our own way and so because he adds this because he knows that they don't accept it he says whether you accept radha and krishna or not he's he's saying that that's not important i know that you're not going to wake up tomorrow and you'll turn into the vaishnavas and you'll sing and dance with songs of rather than christians i know it won't happen but for that reason don't dismiss it understand that this is one of the best examples we have of bakulota the tremendous longing anguish of heart at separation longing for for union and the joy of realization try to create that same yearning in your heart for god so this virah bhava virah bhava in the case of radha was so intense that the body would be burning srama krishna went through that he went through it to such an extent this is hard to believe such an extent that sometimes full days he had to spend immersed in the ganga and the bhairavi brahmani to in order to help him move would have to have a cloth to cover his body because if you put her hand on his body her hand would burn and sometimes they would take mud and and rub it on his body in order to cool the body off immediately that mud would turn into hard dirt huh cracks like you see sometimes in very dry areas where there's drought how the ground will crack this was no joke this isn't a a allegorical thing of this burning of the body he experienced these things these were the different signs of mahabhava that rod have had also and caitanya they've had insurance krishna head and by every brahmani she saw these and she told all of these things to the all the pundits and they said yes these are all the signs that uh these these rare souls who had this mahabhava this is radha and caitanya yearning is all you need in order to realize him so with king janaka karma yoga wasn't enough he had to do with intense austerities in the beginning takara says uh but we get this vacuolata through doing intense spiritual practice when we realize that nothing is enough that there's a limit to how much we can do then it leads to this uh both surrender and yearning at the same time both at the same time there's a uh one time at least probably other times when somebody asked takur what is the purpose of sadhana why do we do spiritual practice and he said it increases ibakulita it increases this yearning for god it doesn't directly bring about god realization it does many things it purifies us it sharpens our understanding it does many many things but it increases our bakuluta that was what he felt was the the causal link if we want to say what's the real cause of god realization he would say to bakulita everything else is preliminary everything else leads up to that for the devotees they'll say everything leads to bhakti and that's the real link for the gyanis everything leads to a purification of the heart so that the mind can be clear and everything leads to ghana and that's the real link for talk where the real link was it doesn't contradict the others exactly but he gave special emphasis to that gradually the ebbtide set in the steamboat was speeding toward calcutta it passed under the howard bridge and came within sight of the botanical gardens so they had picked them up in dakshinishwar and they're going south they'll go south a certain distance and then kesha will tell them to turn around and they'll go back they'll drop them off and then they'll go back and wherever they keep it more that's where they'll take it the captain was asked to go a little farther down the river they didn't want it to end they didn't they didn't want to turn around and go back they were enjoying tucker's company so much the passengers were enchanted with the master's words and most of them had no idea of time or how far they had come kesha began to serve some puffed rice and grated coconut i read it fascinating thing this morning i there are books that are that have come out that have so many interesting things that i never knew about that when taco was young he he used to ask his mother for this puffed rice morty and he would take this puffed rice there's a certain type of big hat what do they call it toka or something you know the name of that some big kind of country hat that they would wear and she would put it in that and he would go around and whoever he saw he would give them some puffed rice and he would he would take some himself and he would go back and tell his mother to fill it up again and he used to tell the women of the village he was very very close with in kamarpakura he was very often the only male even though he was a boy who could hang out with with the women so often especially this la family they loved him very much he would sneak in sometimes there's a nice story how the father of the family he said that no man has ever been in the inner apartments where the women are he was very strict about that so tucker one day dressed up like a girl and and he went in and and uh and they all greeted him as if he was some stranger took him inside and everything and then at the end laughing he showed who he really was and they ought to they had fun with it but uh so he would tell them that they should they should go around they should uh put it in the corner of their cloth until keep them puffed rice with a little whole hood with a little turmeric mixed in and they should snack on that during the day so he loved this puffed rice we know the story that uh when he was going to the vishalaki temple and had that vision of the cranes and everything that he had the same thing he had his puffed rice and when he fell down unconscious the rife went everywhere did i don't know tumeric says yeah yeah i never heard of that exactly but so acacia began to serve some puffed rice and grated coconut you you know these bengali people they loved popped rice and uh even or swami swan on the g and our swami sarvedevanji also yeah yeah it's such a common common thing other people think what is it is it nothing very special but and they make wonderful things with it they'll put the little cucumber in and some different spices and things and peanuts and and also they'll come on it on the train with their little strapped around them their little thing and all this and this and this and this a little uh mustard oil and all sorts of things a fantastic snack some peas and some dhoniya pata coriander other things so kesha began to serve some puffed rice and grated coconut the guest held these in the folds of their wearing clothes so just as taco was saying and presently started to eat everyone was joyful now we'll get this little the situation the master noticed however that keisha and vijoy rather shrank from each other yeah it was uncomfortable for them they didn't want to look each other in the eye they probably hadn't spoken since the split took place [Music] and he was anxious to reconcile them taqwa which anxious to reconcile them master de keshav look here there is vijay your quarrel seems like the fight between shiva and rama shiva was rama's guru though they fought with each other yet they soon came to terms but the grimaces of the ghosts the followers of shiva and the gibberish and the monkeys the followers of rama would not come to an end loud laughter such quarrels take place even among one's own kith and kin didn't rama fight with his own sons love and kusha again you must have noticed how a mother and daughter living together and having the same spiritual end in view observe their religious fast separately on tuesdays each on our own account as if the welfare of the mother were different from the welfare of the daughter now we're coming to the end uh i remember reading reading this and thinking what in the world are they talking about how do you observe fast separate the fastest the fast the fast means you don't need anything and then i learned bengal they have wonderful ways of fasting you can eat all sorts of things you can have luchi you can have fruits and this and that so on the fasting days the mother and the daughter-in-law they can easily help each other i'll make some luchi you can do that we can do it together so then it makes a little sense otherwise i'm thinking what are they talking about you're fasting alone how do you fast alone together didn't make any sense so anyhow he's talking about people who really are on the same spiritual path keshav and rejoy and yet they they had this uh this misunderstanding or disagreement among them but what benefits the one benefits the other in like manner you have a religious society and vijay thinks he must have one too laughter but i think all these are necessary see how nice he's being while sri krishna himself god incarnate played with the gopis at vrindavan troublemakers like jyoti land kutila appeared on the scene you may ask why the answer is that the play does not develop without troublemakers olaf there is no fun without gertilla and kutila ramanuja upheld the doctrine of qualified non-dualism but his guru was a pure non-dualist they disagreed with each other and refuted each other's arguments that always happens still to the teacher the disciple is his own vijay wasn't exactly a disciple of kesha but kesha was really the the senior one among them all rejoiced and the master accompanied and his words uh we we read that after this vijay and and and keshov they reconciled to a certain extent no what happened was that uh uh so they they at least got on on speaking terms again but shortly after this video also left the shadow brahma samaj because he really was never cut out for that talker said over and over again that if we try to follow a path that's not suited to our personality it won't work and he said this video krishna goes for he was a goswami the goswami that means and takwis manulis that means that they were born with this some scada of bhakti of devotion that they traced their lineage all the way back to one of chaitanya davis disciples to one of the goswami or the vishnu priya something like that so he always said that video had this this uh the the nature of it of individual so uh through the company of srama krishna vita also developed this tremendous feeling of renunciation so i mentioned before his honesty and so we were reading the great master of the long section about this that because of his honesty he felt that he could not no longer remain in the brahma-samaj because the tendency of his mind was towards worship of god with form so he left and then only shivna sastri was there and it started to dissipate the second one it really fell apart a little bit and vijay krishna gosvami he he renounced the world during takur's lifetime because we say in the gospel that he would come and taku would say oh hallelujah now we're in guerra so much renunciation he even dyed his canvas shoes garuwa he mentioned something like that so that's what happened i think probably this other brahma-samaj died out a little bit even even kesha's group because kesha so with within within a couple of years bj krishna goswami he leaves and renounces the world and kesha dies he died in 1884 i believe so gradually it kind of disappeared i guess it kind of morphed into this shantiniketan with rabindranath and and lasted more that way calcada is not too much from ram mohan roy he was the original inspiration and i think devendra was the one who really founded the adi brahma-samaj what we call the alibaba okay so we'll stop here and this is page 141 and i will close the chant krishna who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship om shanti peace peace peace be unto all everyone thank you for joining and everyone please stay well and we will see you next time
