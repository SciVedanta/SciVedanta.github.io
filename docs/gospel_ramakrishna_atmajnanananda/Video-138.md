[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna by Swami Atmajnanananda (7/7/2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWjgNYJNe4o)

foreign [Music] Souls they're praised by Poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls Welcome to our class on the gospel of srama Krishna we're starting a new chapter 23 festival at surendra's house and the date is Sunday June 15 1884. a lot of songs tonight arrived in the morning at the Garden House of Surendra one of his beloved householder disciples in the village of Concord near Calcutta Surendra had invited him and a large number of the devotees to a religious Festival now we've been introduced of course many times to Surendra but I thought I would remind us because he plays a very important role you see here that uh conquer gachi we associate with ram Chandra datta they lived near each other uh in Calcutta and then I think Ram bought that garden house in kakurgachi and then probably after that surrender bought his which is very nearby because we read that on one of his visits to Ram's house he walked to certain results that's where he met then do we have that now is that it's still there do you know all the times I've been to conquer got here I never thought to ask about surendra's house and yeah so this is a garden house and Surendra was quite well to do and he was a combination that he was careful about his money but very generous both very generous we have one Deputy who's connected with them emotionally in Arabic and from Richmond yeah yeah nowadays you know almost everyone has some connection to some somebody it seems like that either a monk of our order because yeah every once in a while we'll meet I remember in Trabuco once somebody came in was great great granddaughter Johnny rashvani yeah so these different connections come up like that and uh one uh great great grandson of of Captain from Nepal yeah he also came here one time so obviously there'll be these connections anyhow this so so Surendra surendranat Mitra he was an atheist in his early days self-proclaimed atheist and very unhappy but he was friends with ram and he came through ramchandra Mohan Mitra so the two of them thought that uh if he could meet srirami Krishna he was around 30 at that time that that would help him in his in his uh in his life and uh it says he was uh perfectly uh uh he has absolutely no faith whatsoever in anything every real yeah perfect atheist you can say but when he met that's ramakrishna and then everything changed for him and he went of course to dakshineswar many times and invited srammakrishna many times and very often he would have these afterwards the Buddhism in his house this couldn't go and it was very sad and Tucker said that don't worry I'll see see it somehow and he he had a vision of surrender there and so a lot of interesting things took place with that uh yeah three other pujis took place there so Taco went many times and he was considered Vice ramakrishna as one of the suppliers of his needs and uh when they moved syrup Krishna to kashipur he bore most of the expense others also contributed but he was the main person to pay for all of that and uh he was the first one to arrange for the observance of sarama Christian's birthday in 1881 and again bore all of the expense for that so interesting things and uh even after that he would pay for most of it when they would have that yearly celebration and then we know of course that after ramakrishna passed away and when some of the young monks had no place to go that he had a dream or something or huh takur came to him somehow you remember anyone we're just okay while in doing Puja talk group period And so anyhow he was inspired and he and he told the others that whatever I gave before for sure I'll be happy to give it it'll be a place for the future young monks to live and for us householders to go and from time to time and get some peace of mind so he was the main person to to Bear the expense for uh the first Veronica mat and so there's one one place in in the gospel we read that the swamiji and the others they they say oh how how blessed uh Surendra was how grateful they were to him because they they gave him credit for all of that so very very devoted this ramakrishna a little bit what we call abhimani that he could uh feelings could get hurt a little bit easily and that he wasn't appreciated and this and that but otherwise the wonderful person so this is one of those these occasions where he invited uh Krishna to not his regular house to his garden house that was fashionable in those days for wealthy people that have a little place a little bit outside of the city with a nice Garden area and everything occasions like this were a source of great happiness and rejoicing to the Master's liberties he was then seen at his best yeah because he loved it when the devotees were there and they would usually arrange for kirtan and there would be great fist if it is and it would be some beautiful garden house or something and he would go into ecstasy so these were great occasions chapters like this really are are meant to paint a picture for us because a lot of this will be descriptions a lot of it will be the songs that are being sung is not so much that takur's is giving his teachings important teachings and everything but we get to see him uh that joyful the ecstatic mood that he goes into so M writes he was then seen at his best he joined with the others in devotional music and enchanting the names of God frequently going into into ecstasy he poured out his entire soul and inspired talk explaining the various phases of God Consciousness the impressions of such a festival lingered in the minds of all for many days the devotees stood in rows inside the big Hall of the garden house to hear the music sung by the professional singers the floor of the room was covered with a carpet over which was spread a white sheet a few bolsters pillows and cushions lay here and there the musicians were singing of the episodes and the life of Sri Krishna especially associated with his Divine love for the gopis of vrindavan this was a theme which always appealed to the master and would throw him into ecstatic moods Krishna God incarnate lived the years of his boyhood in vrindavan as a Cowherd he tended his cows on the grain Meadows along the bank of the jamana and played his flute the milkmaids could not resist the force of his Divine attraction that the sound of his flute they would leave their household duties and go to the bank of the Sacred River their love for Krishna destroyed their attachment to worldly things neither the threats of their relatives nor the criticism of others could make them desist from seeking the company of Krishna in the love of the gopis for Krishna there was not the slightest trace of worldliness it was the innate attraction of God for Pure Souls as of the magnet for iron the author of The bhagavata has compared this love to the all-consuming love of a woman for her beloved yeah not the wife for the husband this is this is uh the two different types of this this and in in this particular School the division of the school this uh the love that the wife has for her husband is is is this level a little higher level is it is love that uh the lover has for the Beloved the Paramore they had their own families and everything but it was for Krishna because uh one has to give up renounce all good standing in community and not care about reputation or anything they love the soul all uh encompassing that they're willing to to give up everything so it's considered uh among the Gloria vaishnavis at least is is the highest type and bhagavata uh for the guardian of the community is the ultimate Authority greater than Innovative or anything they considered it they take that as having the same standing foreign Rush of that love all the barriers between man and God are Swept Away the deputy surrenders himself completely to his Divine beloved and in the end becomes one with him Radha was the foremost of the gopis and krsna's chief playmate she felt an Indescribable longing for Union with him a moment separation from Krishna would Rend her heart and soul during media moonlit night Krishna would dance with Radha and the gopis in the sacred Groves of vrindavan and on such occasions the gopis would experience the highest religious ecstasy and in vrindavan today they have temples in all of these places were there different Groves where and and they know all of the places where these things took place when caitanya Deva went to brindavan it was all overgrown jungle area and he he somehow with his Mystic Vision could could recognize all the places where these things took place and he he sent the goswamis to go to vrindavan and not just to write all of the works that they wrote but also uh to establish temples and all of these places so the vrindavan that we know today is is mostly because of uh the great efforts that were made by the the goswamis yeah who went there so if your daughter is very ancient but the temples and things will go back to 15 16th centuries so during many immunity Krishna would dance with Radha and the gopis and the sacred Groves of vrindavan and on such occasions the gopis would experience the highest religious ecstasy yeah the interesting thing about this Krishna Leela is that really heroes are the gopis and Radha is the epitome of of the highest type of of bhakti in parama and mahabad and everything and not so much Krishna Krishna becomes uh the really hero of the Mahabharata and with Gita and everything but this this episode that the real Paradigm for the highest type of devotion is Radha and in the caitanya Lila this is caitanya Deva supposed to be uh this kind of mixture of Radha and Krishna this this is a very nice theory that Krishna envied the devotion that Radha had and wanted to experience it and so he was born with with this color was of so on the outside Radha yeah yeah but here Krishna and within black this Krishna within so he would have the Turkish but it's a very nice nice idea at the age of 11 Krishna was called to be the king of mathura Now the ages are always interesting people of all different theories and everything how old were they if he was 11 how old were the gopis well so around the same age did they have the child marriage in those days that age also would they be living with we don't know these things ah that would be for for the Kings and things and everything yeah you'll think for everyone but any of my my what I picture in mind is girls that were given in marriage too young and they're with older husbands that they don't like and have to do a lot of work day and night would rather play in the fields and everything so any of the age of 11 it says was called to be king of mathura he left the gopis promising them however his Divine Vision whenever they concentrated on that they would get his Divine Vision whenever they concentrated on him in their hearts for centuries and centuries the lovers of God in India have been worshiping the Divine by recreating in themselves the yearning of the gopis for Krishna this is this is what's ramakrishna said so many times especially to the case up in the rambos doesn't matter if you think this really happened or didn't happen uh what you have to to try to grasp is the beauty of of the symbolism at least that try to feel that longing they'd rather had for Krishna and to have that same longing for God realization so for centuries and centuries the lovers of God in India have been worshiping the Divine by recreating in themselves the yearning of the gopis for Krishna exactly taq was teaching many of the folk songs of India have as their theme the sweet episode of Christmas life SRI caitanya revived this phase of a Hindu religious Life by his spiritual practice and his Divine Visions in his ecstatic music caitanya assumed the role of Radha now I don't understand this this in his ecstatic music they probably maintain the kirtan and everything that he didn't he didn't sing or even compose songs huh uh maybe the songs about him or something and he was a little odd to me when I first read it in his ecstatic music chaitanya assumed the role of Radha and manifested the Longing To Be United with Krishna it must have been during saying of kirtan for a long period srirama Krishna also worshiped God as his beloved Krishna looking on himself as one of the gopis or as God's handmade no this would have been when he lived with matur and his and his wife we that whole time to me it's also not clear when he was addressing his uh woman and everything as a handmaid of the Divine mother but also as Radha some at the same time or different times also not entirely clear to me what do you say it's not too high yeah [Music] this is the Deep practice Yeah [Music] it was this one he was staying with matar Babu yeah yeah and different from when he felt himself to be handmaid of the Divine mother then also he dressed like that and lived with the women in everything I think I think they overlapped somehow yeah yeah so ceramic Krishna went right from there to visit so for a long period SRI ramakrishna also worshiped God as his beloved Krishna looking on himself as one of the gopis or as God's handmaid at surrender's Garden house the kirtan had begun early in the morning the musicians were singing about the love of Krishna and Radha for each other the master was frequently in samadhi the room was crowded with devotees among them bhavanat niranjan rakal Surendra of course RAM and M and many members of the Brahma samaj now these members of the Brahma samaj I am not sure uh were they coming it's your friends of some of the others were they really kind of sneaking out this wasn't something that that Brahma samaj would have been much in favor of this this type of spiritual practice and everything and it doesn't say who many members the Ramos on this is 1884. at this point he was well known many of them became close devotees of his when he invited him to their homes for these they had a very strange this strange relationship where some of them some of the brahmos really had a little bit of jealousy and resentment I think towards ramakrishna and others had some very slightly secret tremendous reverence for him it was a real mixed bag I would say the Brahma devotees in accordance with the custom the kirtan had begun with an introductory song about goranga gauranga a name of caitanya Deva Embraces monastic life he's being consumed with longing for a vision of Krishna he lives and goes away as a Wandering monk to seek out his beloved yeah all the songs how he left in the middle tonight and went to Kesha bharati's Hut and cut his hair and took off his nice clothes and and put on the kind of rags and and took two monastic life his devotees unable to Bear the Pains of Separation we bitterly and big odanga to return the musician saying ogor come back to nodia is next the musician sang about the anguish of Radha at her separation from Krishna this this is a very famous Doctrine we find in this godia vaisnavi tradition that there's something called that when Rod is separated from Krishna the whole mind sold everything is is consumed with longing for a union with Krishna and then when she finally has it then that's a milliona power that Union and they say somehow that this the intensity of the longing is is is greater than the experience of the Union so according to some schools this uh is a higher the civilian Obama so they say Desiring something is greater than getting something it's a Bengali expression okay went through every Krishna heard the song he suddenly stood up assuming the mood of Radha he sang in a voice Laden with sorrow improvising the words o friend either bringing my beloved Krishna here or take me to him the singing he completely lost himself in Radha and could not continue the song now this is another part of the philosophy of of this these different Barbers and moods that uh in order to worship Krishna one has to become Radha in order to worship Rama one has to become Hanuman that has to ident feel identified and we know especially with the worship of Ramen House ramakrishna really tried to become Hanuman with his dress with hopping from place to place eating bananas all sorts of things whatever he could do to convince his mind this is Hebrew sonaman uh if we want to worship God as a child we have to somehow become mother yasoda so that we really feel what what would it feel like to be her and have that type of love for the baby gopala that's how these moods are are practiced so first Rama Krishna he'll have to identify with Radha and this is why he even wore the clothes women's clothes and things like that so we would be completely identified with the with the lover of the Beloved the singing he completely lost himself in Radha and could not continue the song he became speechless his body motionless his eyes have closed his mind totally unconscious of the outer world he was in deep samadhi foreign he regained normal Consciousness and said in the same heart-rending voice oh friend take me to my beloved Krishna and make me your bond slave I shall be your handmaid Forever o friend that means one of the other gopis oh friend it was you who taught me how to love Krishna o Krishna o beloved of my soul the professional music musicians continue their song they took the part of Radha and sang as if she were talking to her friend oh friend I shall not go again to the jamana to draw water once I beheld my beloved friend under the kadamba tree now it means Krishna whenever I pass it I am overwhelmed the master again became abstracted healing a deep saw he said Ami Ami the song went on Radha says even the desire for Christmas presents has cooled and refreshed my favorite body now and then the musicians improvised lines to the music continuing in the attitude of Radha oh friends you can wait show me Krishna my beloved again do not bother about my ornaments I've lost my most precious ornament mini Krishna and again alas I have fallen on evil days my Happy Days Are Over and finally this unhappy time lingers so long SRI ramakrishna improvised aligned himself or not better times yet in sight for me the musicians then improvised such a long time has passed or not better times yet in sight for me the musician sang wrought his words to a friend oh friend I am dying surely I die the anguish of being kept apart from krsna is more than I can bear alas To Whom Shall I leave my Priceless treasure when I am dead I beg you do not burn my body do not cast it into the river see that it is not given to the Flames do not cast it into the water in this body I played with Krishna bind my life this form I beg you to the black tamales branches tie it to the tamale tree touching Tamala it touches black Krishna is black and black is tomorrow black is the color that I love from earliest childhood I have loved it to the black Krishna my body belongs let it not lie apart from Black two special features of this Godiva vaishnavi tradition or uh biography this was one of the first uh kind of really attempts it was more or less historical types of biography with the chaitanya and so many songs that were composed very very rich literature in Bengali literature goes back to this vaishnava tradition reaches her last extremity she fought she faints away then the song Radha has fallen to the ground she lies they're lost to outward sins repeating her preciousness name and straight away closes birth both her eyes ah as the drama reached its end what ails you o Delight of Krishna only a moment ago you spoke my friends anointing brought this form with cool and soothing sandal paste you remember when takur had that burning sensation in his body then the bhairavi said yes they did this with Radha let it try it with you and they put Santa paste and led the help to a great degree he had all of these different signs that we see in the life of radhe and caitanya Dev this is burning sensation and tears and even blood from the pores all these different things that you write about her friends anointing rather's form with cool and soothing sandal paste attempt to bring her back to Earth some of them weep in bitter grief they cannot bear to see her die some sprinkle water on her face perhaps she will revive again but oh can water give back life to one who dies of Christmas love brought his friends chant krishna's sweet name in her ears this brings her back to partial Consciousness she looks at the black tamale tree and thinks that krsna stands before her krsna's name another song Christmas name restores her life once more her two eyes gaze around but krsna's face she cannot see alas how bitterly she weeps where is my Krishna where is he whose name you chanted in my ears bring him but once before me here seeing the black tamale tree she stares at it and cries aloud there is his Crest I see it clearly there's my krishna's lovely Crest but only a peacock did she see whose glistening feathers she mistook for the gay feather on Christmas crest Krishna had gone to mathura to assume his Royal duties he had discarded his coward's dress and flute and put on the Royal regalia brought his friends after a harried consultation send a Gopi to mathura as messenger she meets a woman of that city of her own age they're probably teenagers of her own age who asked her where she comes from friend says I don't have to call Krishna he himself will come to me see these are the country bumpkins now going into the big city but nonetheless she follows the woman of mathura and goes to krsna's Palace in the street she weeps overcome with grief and prays to Krishna Where Are You O life of the gopis O enchanter of our hearts o beloved of Radha oh Hari remover of your devotee shame come to us once more with great pride I said to the people of mathura that you yourself would come to me please do not humiliate me now another song and Scorn says the woman of mathura oh you are only a simple milk maid how can you go to see our King our Krishna in your Beggar's Rags behind seven doors his chamber stands you cannot enter how can you go I die of shame to see your boldness tell me how will you manage to enter says the Gopi Krishna beloved soul of the gopis oh where are you come to me here and save my life where are you adorable soul of the gopis come to me Lord of matura and save the life of your Sorrowing handmaid ah where are you beloved of Radha Lord of our hearts and friend of our souls o Hari destroyer of our shame o Priceless Treasure of the gopis come to your handmaid and save her honor thus the messenger weeps and cries out for Krishna when the musician sang where are you adorable soul of the gopis the master went into samadhi as the music neared its end the musician sang louder srama Krishna was on his feet again in deep samadhi regaining partial Consciousness he said in the half articulate voice he was too much overwhelmed to utter krsna's name distinctly the kirtan was coming to a close at the reunion of Radha and Krishna the master sang with the musicians composing the lines himself behold there are the stands by Krishna on his bosom she reclines behold her standing at his left like a golden creeper Twining round a black tamale tree as the music came to a close the master led the chorus all chanted together to the accompaniment of drums and symbols Victory to Radha and Krishna Hallowed be the names of Radha and Krishna the devotees felt a surge of divine emotion and danced around the master he too danced in an ecstasy of Joy the names of God echoed and re-eccoed in the House and Garden after the music the master sat with the devotees just then the ungen arrived and prostrated himself before him did of course the future swamiji ranjanananda one of the very beloved Disciples of shramakrishna at the very sight of his beloved disciple the master stood up with beaming eyes and smiling face and said you have come to to him you see this boy is absolutely guileless this was one of the greatest compliments that shurama Krishna could give to anybody that he really if someone was a guyless and innocent and purehearted then the taco was thrilled to see him one cannot be guileless without a great deal of spiritual discipline in previous births this is a very important point that we have to be born guidance this is not something that that we can learn that we can uh attain guylessness somehow we see some people just it's the type of Grace they're very simple and don't question things too much don't judge things too much accept things and there's a great blessing to be born like that a hypocritical encapulating mind can never attain God don't you see that God incarnates himself only in a family where innocence exists how Gael is so it was Nanda krsna's father there is a saying ah how innocent a man he is he is just like Nanda to niranjan I feel as if a dark veil has covered your face it is because you have accepted a job in an office now we may think what's so bad about that but we have to remember that he was he was one of the ones who was earmarked to be to lead the life of assatu obvious couldn't bear to see any of them get entangled in the world in any way it is because you have accepted a job in an office one must keep accounts there besides one must attend to many other things and that always keeps the mind in a state of worry you were serving in an office like otherworldly people but there's a slight difference in that you are earning money for the sake of your mother now I don't remember did his father die at that time or something anyhow they were in some situation of poverty just like Loren did I had to look for a job he had to work for the sake of the of his mother one must show the highest respect to one's mother for she is a very embodiment of the Blissful mother of the universe if you had accepted the job for the sake of wife and children I should have said fire upon you shame a thousand shames now this is not what he'll say to the householder disciples he'll say no you have to do this this is your obligation this is the householder life but this is uh he he's already counting him as this at this point look at this boy he's absolutely guileless but he has one fault he is slightly untruthful nowadays the other day he said that he would visit me again very soon but he didn't come to niranjin that is why rakale asked you why you didn't come to see me while you were at ariadha so near dakshineswar iranjan I was there only a couple of days Master to niranjan pointing to m he is the Headmaster of a school at my bidding he went to see you so this means that he didn't know him before this I guess I don't think the London had any connection with the Brahma samaj we don't hear about that to him did you send baburam to me the other day the master went to an adjoining room and began to talk with some devotees there Master 2m ah how wonderful was the yearning of the gopis for Krishna there were seeds with the Divine Madness at the very sight of the black tamale tree separation from Krishna created such a fire of Anguish in arata's heart that it dried up even the tears in her eyes her tears would disappear in Steam there were other times when nobody could notice the depth of her feeling people do not notice the plunge of an elephant in a big lake these emotions these they call it these very high types of emotions astronomy Krishna says are not possible for ordinary people many of the things that he says about this and the very high states of meditation that these are very rare things same thing with these uh mahabad and everything that ordinary person cannot maintain if they get even a little bit of that that it'll just whole body will be shaken like a elephant in a small straw hat so what is Radha like like an ocean sometimes he'll say yeah when the elephant goes into big Big Lake you hardly see any Ripples and in small little Pond everything will be splashed all around so she she was rather was the embodiment of this mahabhava her tears would disappear in Steam there were other times when nobody could notice the depth of her feeling people do not notice the plunge of an elephant in the big lake and yes sir that is true caitanya too experienced a similar feeling he mistook a forest for the sacred grove of vrindavan and the dark water for the ocean of the ocean for the blue jamuna this is that when one thing reminds us of the other so we have three examples of all of this Radha caitanya Deva and shivami Krishna that is all of the things that he's saying that were found in radhan were found in caitanya they were found in him also that he had that same ability his mind to make Divine associations if he saw something that would trigger some feeling he would go into an ecstatic mood if you would go to the zoo and see the lion and immediately then he's gone nothing else to see there's one theory is in fact one one time uh going along the the shore of the ocean that he was so convinced it was the Gemini and that he could have his Union with Krishna that he he went in had to be fished out by some fishermen and everything and one theory is that he may have died that way nobody knows exactly uh how we passed away or what happened to his body Master ah if anyone has but a particle of such Prima what yearning what love wrought to possess not only 100 of divine love but 125 this is what it means to be intoxicated with ecstatic love of God the sum and substance of the whole matter is that one must love God must be restless for him it doesn't matter what you whether you believe in god with form or in God without form now this is also interesting though all of this is is so personal personal God but if someone has that yearning for for self-realization or for truth the same thing we find this in the life of Buddha that he had that that same type of bakulita the the tremendous restlessness to find out what is the secret what is the answer this Mystery of Life yeah this is the difference between the the traditional uh godivaisnava where it has to be within this context rather Krishna and for his Rama Christian and others that it's the feeling it can be transferred to anything any other type of religious expression we saw uh with the sufis that they have this because Tucker says can even be formless they have a concept of formless God but also the Beloved and the relationship between the lover and the Beloved and the sick static love and everything without this this type of personal form but still this feeling of God is as the Beloved so this this that also will allow for that type of longing for Union so he said you may or may not believe uh in God with form or in God without uh sorry it doesn't matter whether you believe in god with form or in God without form you may or may not believe that God incarnates himself as man this is what he used to say to the to the Bravo especially because they didn't care for this Avatar my dear it doesn't matter if you believe this is all true or not that there are other Christian business unless he was an avatar but try to accept that feeling that she had but you will realize him if you have that yearning then he himself will let you know what he is like if you must be mad why should you be mad for the things of the world if you must be mad be mad for God Alone presently surama Krishna returned to the main hall of the house a big pillow was placed near him for his use before touching it he said um perhaps the pillow had been used by many worldly people and that was why he purified it in this way and other devotees sat near him yeah there was something about these bolsters and pillows that were associated with wealthy people who would lie back and comfort and everything we read when uh when he first went to srammakrishna he saw that that type of boats that were there what type of part of him says he and then he saw that Tucker didn't really know how to lie down the way these wealthy people do they said ah this is another deputies sat near him it was getting late but there was no indication that the meal was going to be served the master became impatient like a child and said I don't see any sign of food what's the matter where's Narendra hadn't come yet a devoted with a smile sir rambabu was the manager of the feast see they were good friends and he lived nearby so he told the this surrender it don't worry I'll take care of everything he is superintending everything Master laughing oh prom is the manager then we know what to expect a devotee things like this always happen when he is the supervisor all that Master to the devotees where is Surendra what a nice disposition he has now see he underwent a complete transformation language and some of the others there's very the worldly man no the spiritual interest in anything in any Metro he is very outspoken this was another thing a very truthful person he didn't hide things he didn't hide his feelings or anything he isn't afraid to speak the truth he is unstinting in his liberality no one that goes to him for help comes away empty-handed to him he went to bhagavadas what sort of man is he no this is another incident that refers to another incident in the life of drama Christmas he lived in a place called kalna where is kalna not that far from Calcutta no North North okay so some somewhere yeah and he was was highly esteemed in in that Community considered to be very great saying you're quite elderly uh at that time and there was an incident uh in which ramakrishna was invited to uh one of these they call it harisabha one of these these kind of devotional meetings and uh the vegetable place and and their tradition was they kept in Asana just as you see for Ramadan Asana is kept for Hanuman Asana was Kept For caitanya Deva which nobody would sit on of course but he went into some ecstatic State and he went over and and stood on it or sat on it stood on it I think anyhow and nobody thought too much about it because the excitement and and the Ecstasy and everything but there were some people who got very upset especially afterwards and they went to this and uh he said yes no one should enter on that the sacred thing and everything but later SRI ramakrishna had a desire to meet him so he went and somehow he was kind of covered covered with some cloth so nobody knew exactly who it was and then when he met and they they spoke to each other that he recognizes as a great soul and bhagavadas recognized ramakrishna and then when he when he found out that he was the one who who sat on the Asana he said then it's all right first and then find out what type of does he have humility is he genuine and everything yeah he did on many occasions so here also he probably did that and uh they had a conversation and which I think right there was there and and they asked him why at this Advanced age with such an exalted spiritual State he used to do so much of a jump into everything still and he said I do it for the benefit of the others for the welfare and then pakor said oh you have such pride in ego that you you do it for the wealth so even this great soul and he took it in a good way that this was also a kind of a lesson for him not that he was a very conceited person or anything but uh he took it in the right Spirit which shows that he was really a good Soul so anyhow this is the bhagavadas is probably curious to see what M's uh feeling was about him what was this estimation of bhagavadas what sort of man is he him he is very old now I saw him at kalna so that was his place it was night he lay in a carpet and the devotee fed him with food that had been offered to God you can hear only if you speak loudly into his ear hearing my mention your name he said you have nothing to worry about so he was he must have been a great soul and just by seeing from a Christian one time he recognized this is not an ordinary person to him you haven't been to dakshineswar for a long time the master asked me about you and said one day has em lost all taste for this place see taku was very particular he noticed who came who didn't come who said they would come and they didn't cope with everything overnight laughed as he said these words a little bit he was after a bit of a troublemaker the master heard their conversation and said to him in a loving voice yes that's true why haven't you been to dakshineswar for such a long time M could only stammer some lame excuses held the master in great respect and was a frequent visitor at the temple Garden he was a man of independent means having inherited some ancestral property he devoted his time to religious thought and to the study of the scriptures he was a man of some scholarship having studied many books both Sanskrit and English and very proud of his of his learning whatever little he had uh yeah swamiji caught him he had a huge library with books that he he gave the impression that he had read them all in in India when when they print books very often they'll fold the page and print it and then you have to cut it yourself yeah so anyhow uh Narendra swamiji he said yes we went and saw this library but most of the books were uncut that means unread they were just there for show but Taqua didn't carry liked him and he built him up he was the few verses that he knew how to recite talk would always ask him or recite that version of it what is this I see a steamship here or left we expect here a small boat at the most but a real steamship has arrived but then I know it is the rainy season laughter the same conversation took place with vidyasagar the rainy season the rivers are all swollen and big boats can go foreign he asked him isn't feeding people a kind of service to God exists in all beings as fire to feed peoples to offer ablations to that indwelling spirit this is really the meaning of from our pranam that we recite to feed people is to offer oblations to that indwelling Spirit but then one shouldn't feed the wicked I mean people who are entangled in Gross worldliness or who have committed heinous crimes like adultery even the ground where such people sit becomes impure to a depth of seven cubits now holy mother of my default Taco in this issue they all were her children even if they saw it themselves she would take them up and everything but any other tacos feeling huh this is there's no way to make sure that's true I mean some some things are we know are obvious but yeah yeah this is not for us to try to judge people who foreign number of people at his native place a good many of them were Wicked I said to ride look here if you feed such people I shall leave your house at once to mahima I hear that you used to feed people but now you don't give any such feasts is it because your expenses have gone up left and Tucker like to teach people that especially about manid those who were tied with money because he is a bit of a miser yeah and he used to balarambos also you have to sing your own song then while the rambos were so generous yeah it was teasing yeah the meal was to be served on the south Veranda of the house Leaf plates were being placed on the floor the master said to mahimatulum please go there and see what they are doing you may help them a little in serving the food but I shouldn't ask you but this is just a little bit of the etiquette thing is he too big a guess to go there or is it not his business or something anyhow he felt a little funny about all of this said let them bring in the food I shall see Heming and Hoying he went toward the kitchen but presently he came back srirama Krishna and the devotees enjoyed the meal greatly afterwards he rested a while about two o'clock in the afternoon Pratap Chandra majumdar of the Brahma samaj arrived he was a co-worker of Geisha chandrasen and had been to Europe and America in connection with the brahmo missionary work he greeted ramakrishna and the master too bowed before him with his usual modesty they were soon engaged in conversation now let's put it up he actually after Keisha passed away being became leader of the Brahma suhat he was the one who probably at case of the bidding he wrote that first article on srama Krishna who was the name of that article he just I just read it anyhow so he was partly responsible for the devotees to start coming the brahmos and others to start coming uh Oriental Christina oh so these are different things that he wrote yeah different books anyhow put around for me and anyhow so he he's another one who uh had some ambivalence he he received great love from srama Krishna he somehow recognized him but again uh he was in the camp of the keshav and and and we know that he created tremendous problems for swamiji uh he he also went to the parliament of religions and that spread rumors about swamiji that two things how he twisted these two things one that swamiji was actually a lawyer so that means pretending to be a sadhu but really a lawyer now we know that he was studying law his father was a lawyer he was going to be a lawyer then his father died and he gave it up so he never became a lawyer or anything like that and that he was an actor on the stage now how was he an actor in this stage this is Brahma samaj used to put on plays and he was a member and he acted in some of the plays but he gave the impression that he was a complete fraud and it created tremendous proudly or others who who also created difficulties for swamiji but swamiji writes in one of his letters this uh uh he writes like that so what does he say so concerned with jealousy some something like that yeah so this was a problem for these people that uh the ego comes in the way even after receiving such love from srama Krishna and everything only Kesha application really appreciated I I like ketchup recently for a change of air Master but your health hasn't improved much what are you suffering from the same illness that keshab died of so okay shall we just start recently tuberculosis they began to talk about keshop Pratap said even in Boyhood he showed non-attachment to worldly things seldom making merry with other boys he was a student in the Hindu college at that time he became friendly with satyendra this will be satyendra not one of the tagore family and through him May the acquaintance of his father it was actually the the founder this what they call the adirama and even before that Rambo and Roy was really the inspiration behind all of this kesham cultivated bhakti and at the same time practice meditation at times he would be so so much overcome with Divine love that he would become unconscious the main purpose of his life was to introduce religion among householders the conversation next next turn to a certain lady some women of our country have been to England this marhata lady who was very scholarly also visited England later she embraced Christianity have you heard her name sir Master no but from what you say it seems to me that she has a desire for name and fame that kind of egotism is not good the feeling I am the doer is the outcome of ignorance but the feeling that God does everything is due to knowledge God Alone is the doer all others are mere instruments in his hands okay we'll start with this next time because this is a big topic this idea of feeling that God is the real Doer okay so we're stopping here on page 451. um [Music] we bow our heads before srama Krishna who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace next Friday next Friday's Pittsburgh next so a week from today so there'll be no class nah there are no class next next Friday night no I won't be here next Friday so and then the week after that I'm also yeah
