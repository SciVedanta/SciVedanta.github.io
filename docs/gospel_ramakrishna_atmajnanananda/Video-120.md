foreign [Music] Souls they're praised by Poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of srama Krishna we're on chapter 19 the master and his injured arm this is Page 383 and it is Saturday February 2nd 1884. we've just finished this time of a very long section it actually was two chapters that was that very long period that M had staying in the candy store with shramakrishna and that was about three and a half weeks something like that yeah so now February 2nd this means that it's almost a month after that so uh we never know for sure if I am visited to ramakrishna in between because he had to pick and choose what things he wanted to to record and what things he wanted to publish uh good chance that he took a little break maybe he couldn't go in between this is a period when and of course was was very seriously recording everything and we had a lot of things so anyhow this is just uh our guess whether this is actually the very next visit but it's the next recorded visit that we have Saturday February 2nd 1884. it was three o'clock in the afternoon sriyama Krishna had been conversing with Raquel mahimacharun hajara and other devotees when em entered the room and saluted him he brought with him splint pad and lint to bandage the Masters injured arm so either and had been there in between or was told that that he did hurt his arm and was asked to bring these things one day we'll go into the Pine Grove the srirama Christian had fallen near the railing and dislocated the bone in his left arm he had been in an ecstatic mood at that time and no one had been with him this was a very bad injury a probably compound fracture and when we look at the photograph it looks like it didn't heal exactly straight his arm you could see a little bit and we I don't know if it if he talks about it here I don't remember but we know what happened that srama Krishna suddenly went into some type of ecstatic mood where he was thinking about this jagannath Puri and there's some tradition that one should embrace a juggernaut there I think caitanya David did when when he went to Puri anyhow so in the master in that ecstatic mood even though his mind is everything is taking place in in this ecstatic State still the body is reacting somehow so somehow trying to embrace the image in his mind in the state of ecstasy the body also went forward and he fell and he broke his arm and so this is this is uh what happened at that time and it was a very very significant in the mind of Sri ramakrishna because he mentioned many times after that that he felt that the Divine mother was was giving him a sick note that she was telling him that you've had enough of this ecstasy seeing God with the eyes closed in some ecstatic mood that now is the time to see God with eyes open dwelling within all beings this and he used to quote devotion of children the advice of children used to say that this is the highest state when one sees God dwelling within human beings and through our Christian would say now I realize that he was right as if the Divine mother was trying to teach me that she had me break my arm but we'll see he's he's not very happy with the Divine mother for this whole thing hey Master to him hello what was ailing you are you quite well now okay so now we can guess that this long gap of four weeks was probably because the M wasn't well and the Talk work got news of it but uh probably he hadn't seen him in between um yes sir I am all right now Master to mahima well if I am the machine and God is its operator then why should this have happened to me now now we shouldn't take this as uh some philosophical or metaphysical doubt or question in the mind of sharami Krishna this is a very common attitude that the devotee of the Divine mother takes sometimes is quote sometimes that one can can quell with the Divine mother one can be a little bit hurt one can have a little peak one can can uh even say mother that I won't look at you anymore like a small child so because this happened tuck was in that mood now of the of the small child uh and not that he has any doubt in in but the other thing is that it's good for us to also understand that we don't know why things happen and uh very often tragedy happens we don't know why for very good people uh every once in a while people will come to us with some great terrible tragedy and they'll feel guilty what did we do that this happened to us and uh we we have all of our theories about why things happen God's will Karma Giants all sorts of theories but we really don't know and it's best not to try to figure it out too much and best not to feel guilty to blame ourselves too much if we like this idea no one but me to blame the karma idea that's okay but we shouldn't feel guilty about these things anyhow this is very nice like a little child is very unhappy with the mother well if I am the machine and God is its operator then why should this have happened to me every time Taco talks in in with this type of language we know that he's thinking of God is Mother even if the translation may say he or just God thinking of the Divine mother the master was sitting on the couch listening to the story of mahimacharan's pilgrimage mahima had visited several holy places 12 years before mahima I found brahmachary in a garden at chikro in Benares he said he had been living there for 20 years but did not know its owner now Garden it's not like we have a house with a little garden these sometimes there'll be these big Estates and there'll be a whole Garden area and they know that tattoos can come sometimes they'll even uh have some Hut where they can stay and everything we know at least one instance with uh uh RAM and Surendra they both had kind of garden homes near each other and one saw that was staying there they could just camp out or something and they didn't have to ask for permission and the owners usually knew it and and were were happy this was a kind of arrangement especially in a place like Varanasi Menards he asked me if I worked in an office on my answering in the negative he said then or you were wondering holy man I saw sadhu in the Bank of the narmada he repeated the Gayatri mentally it so thrilled him that the hair on his body stood on the end and when he repeated the Gayatri and om aloud it thrilled those who sat near him and caused their hair to stand on end the master was in the mood of a child in being hungry at see this arm it was a very very painful thing they didn't really have this type of anesthesia that we have for now they couldn't set it the way that we said it they had to actually I knew somebody who who he fell and and landed on his elbow off a ladder and the doctors for some reason they just wrapped the whole thing tightly and it was so horribly painful for him that he had to actually take it off and then he went back and they put a cast and everything but uh it wasn't like today how things were treated so he was in the mood of a child being hungry he said to him what have you brought for me looking at rakal he went into samadhi he was gradually coming down to the normal plane to bring his mind back to the consciousness of the body he said I shall eat jalebi I shall drink some water the elipi was probably his favorite sweetie like sweets the very famous sweet meat shop that was there from Taco's time even weeping like a child he said to the Divine mother oh brahmai oh mother why hast thou done this to me my arm is badly hurt to the devotees will I be all right again see talk we had so many different moods that he could go into samadhi come back come back down and there's no pain or anything this is this is in this very uh ordinary type of mood where he's really uh identified with with this physical body almost the way Ordinary People are almost of course quite differently but still uh and we find very often that the smallest little thing that taco will be concerned and again this is all this that uh need for him to be identified with the body so the mind isn't always flying off into savati it wasn't that he had any attachment to the body or anything like that but uh if he almost had to be in that state to keep the Mind from from going into these ecstatic moods all of the time we have one very funny instance where his leg was a little bit swollen a little puffy a little puffy and so that if he if he pressed it it made a little dimple little impression so everybody he came he said look at this when I press a little dimple you press your your leg there let me see if you have a temple there also and then he said one did he say oh okay yeah I also have a dimple when I do it he said uh okay then I feel relieved so just like a child he would get in this child's like mood foreign to the devotees will I be all right again they consoled him as one would a child and said surely you will be quite well again master turakov you aren't to blame for it though you were living here to look after me yeah that was the ostensibly that was the purpose that rock College was there to serve srama Krishna did need somebody Lotus was probably also that was his purpose of being there Raquel but it was really for taco to train them up with both both not that he didn't need somebody to serve him but he used to say look here roccal is here to serve me I end up serving him because he was going into ecstatic moods and things like that so with a bit of a of a play this idea that they're here to serve him they were here to enhance their spiritual life also but uh in addition to that they were supposed to be with him and one one thing about serving surama Krishna men standing near him so that if he went into an ecstatic mood he wouldn't fall this was the main job when baburam came Swami permanent because went through a period where he was so sensitive to Purity and impurity the touch of someone who wasn't so sensitive that it was only baburam who could hold him up in that statement he was such a pure soul that even even the other direct disciples how much he loved the swamiji and how much he loved Raquel and and all of them but he needed he said I want him there because he pureed was very bones so that was one of the reasons why these sabox attendants were there to make sure that he didn't fall down uh walking sometimes they would have to hold him or he would put his hand on their shoulder because he could start reeling like a drunkard we're going to a mood and then just uh not be aware of anything and fall down so they had to be there to support him so Master to Rocco you aren't to blame for it though you were living here to look after me for even if you had accompanied me you certainly wouldn't have gone up to the railing this is where the fall took place outside of his room the master again went into a spiritual mood and said oh oh mother what is this that I am saying don't make me unconscious mother with the knowledge of Brahman now this is another strange thing this idea of the knowledge of Brahman for surama Krishna this was the the ultimate goal is to have that that uh realization of of Oneness to reach that state where we don't make any distinction we see Brahman everywhere the highest state this we can say brahmagana but for Sri ramakrishna that this when he's talking about Birmingham County here he means that nearby Copa state he means entering into that state where uh he doesn't see anything he can't converse with the devotees he he can't fulfill his mission really that he wanted the mind to be a slightly lower level so that he could talk with everyone enjoy their company they could have his divine presence and everything so we've we find on different occasions a very very strong language where he says his knowledge of Brahman he had this is written there's a spinning like two the the uh as if I Spit on that knowledge of Brahman now how can anybody say that this knowledge of Brahman sometimes we talk would say this is the one thing that can't be expressed in words it's a very highest thing so we can't take this literally we have to take this as meaning that mother don't let me lose away consciousness of this external world and get the Mind merged in Brahmin that I want to be on a little lower level so I can enjoy the company of the devotees okay don't make the unconscious mother with the knowledge of Brahman don't give me brahmigiana I am but thy child so we we have that line very important line from that ramprasad song that uh I don't want to become sugar I want to taste sugar and now the the Duelist will say forget about becoming sugar it's impossible there'll always be that relationship the Gianni will say I want to become sugar that's my real nature the the devotee who has this uh understanding of the the harmony between knowledge and devotion will say yes I know that in reality I am one with the sugar but let me have that little sense of Distinction so I can enjoy the taste of it so this was really taka's attitude most of the time not that there's not joy in in nearby samati there's such a joy that he could hardly resist and having the mind go up there but he wanted this other type of Joy this company the devotees and everything so uh he would pray the mother let me have a little bit of this Duality to see this this play of yours and to enjoy the company of the devotees don't give me brahmigiana I am but thy child I am easily worried and frightened I want a mother a million salutations to the knowledge of Brahman give it to those who seek it o anandabahi o Blissful mother uttering loudly the word he burst into tears and said mother this is the song of verse this is the grief that surely Grieves my heart that even with thee for mother and though I'm wide awake there should be robbery in my house again he said to the Divine mother what wrong have I done mother do I ever do anything okay so now there'll be different attitudes again and uh I don't think we should take this as a real question what wrong have I done mother of course he hasn't done anything wrong uh there has to be either it's an accident or there's some hidden purpose for it but it's not not that because of some bad action that he has some bad karma he had to fall and and break his arm so this is a little bit of a play that he's having but first he's asking this question and then he's saying but mother I don't do anything anyhow what I do is you make me do I'm an instrument so uh why did this happen he said what wrong have I done mother do I do I ever do anything it is thou mother who doest everything I in the machine and thou art its operator this is uh a second attitude of the worshipers of the Divine mother see and these are both based based on these beautiful songs of ram Prasad kamalakante and others that uh when there's a little feeling of Duality then the child depending entirely on the mother and uh when that goes a little bit higher then uh I'm simply an instrument in the hands of mother and a little bit higher mother alone is doing everything through this body he had to do all these moods different moods at different times all right he seemed to feel that uh being the instrument mother's the operator that this this was uh the mood that he was generally in but very often and she would Supply the words he would speak she would Supply the words sometimes she would speak through him but anyhow it would be his voice it was this play who was doing it in the mother he would he would also get confused sometimes mother are you feeding me or am I feeding you a beautiful beautiful Cave of how the mind can guess go back and forth between slightly higher levels and lower levels fascinating his mind his mind would work that way even here first he's saying what have I done wrong as as if I am I am your child I must have done something wrong and you punished me that that attitude and then but do I do anything you're the one mother you're the one who does everything I am the machine and you are the operator to rock off smiling see that you don't fall now he's joking see that you don't fall don't be peaked and cheat yourself again addressing the mother srirami Krishna said do I weep because I'm hurt not at all so this is not that his arm hurts but why did Mother allow it to happen that's the real thing that I might am I not a good child is that not your obligation to your child to make sure that I don't fall this type of attitude do I wait because I'm hurt not at all then he sings the song again mother this is the grief that sorely Grieves my heart that even with thee for mother and though I am wide awake there should be robbery in my house so things happen sometimes uh gives a very interesting we wonder why do we get diseases and suffering and all things that happen sometimes he simply says that you live in a house you have to pay the tax for it now that that means that whether there's the karmic reason for it Divine reason for it or just is the nature of the body it's going to wear down it's going to break down someplace it's going to be a painful thing we have to accept that he takua gives us all of these different ways of understanding things we choose the one that appeals to us and we appreciate all of them the master was again talking and laughing like a child see when his mind comes down from some ecstatic mood very often it doesn't go down all the way we see this very often when he had his throat cancer that he would go into ecstasy come down and he said now I'm all right and as if the pain isn't there anymore it's on one side I'm on the other side so he had that that ability the master was again talking and laughing like a child who though ailing sometimes forgets his illness and laughs and plays about Master to the devotees it will Avail you nothing unless you realize there's nothing like discrimination and renunciation now how Talk work can go back and forth before the everything is Mother everything his mother's will whatever you do and now there's the language of of the highest type of Guyana yoga there's a Vivek but argue these are the two of Elemental things the two most significant uh qualities or attributes that we need for this Indiana yoga that we have to have great dispassion for the world great longing for God Israel and we have to have a very sharp intellect that can distinguish what's real what's unreal so and now if we want this highest type of knowledge so how everything was Blended in his mind he didn't see any type of contradiction between speaking about praying to mother on the one hand and then the next minute talking about uh discrimination dispassion and everything the worldly man's Devotion to God is momentary like a drop of water on a red hot frying pan for chance he looks at a flower and exclaims ah what a wonderful creation of God one must be restless for God see now back to bhakti there's breathless for God this is with some idea of the personal God that can be realized and experienced if the sun clamores persistently for his share of the property his parents consoled with each other and give it to him even though he is a minor God will certainly listen to your prayers if you feel Restless for him now again this hymn this is Bengali doesn't have this the gender distinction with with these words uh in talk with mine I'm sure he's thinking her of course they don't as I say it'll be the same word but we in English we have to choose what to write in those days it would have sounded very odd to translate it that way but uh generally and let's talk we're specifically talking about uh something like that when he's talking about God in general and revealing himself herself uh my feeling is that in his mind is this idea of divine mother that was the most uh suitable way of looking upon God for it the one that appealed to his personality and and his spiritual attitude most so God will certainly listen to your prayers if you feel Restless for him of course this is the thing that takora uh emphasized more than anything else if he talks about prayer if he talks about meditation Japan Southern in general the one time he was asked what is the purpose of satana why do we do spiritual practice and he gave the answer because it increases our longing for God and that is the thing that is that will lead to realization everything else will increase that this might argument why do we want this passion for the world it increases lonely for God why do we want this type of discrimination where we see everything is is dreamlike or transitory flow so we'll have that longing for realization was really the most significant thing for suramakrishna God will certainly listen to your prayers if you feel Restless for him since he has begotten us surely we can claim our inheritance from him yeah cockroaches they force your demands on God like a child the every right this is our very own parents this inheritance is due to us it's even legally we may have to wait till we reach the age of majority but it's this is our our right our Birthright because God realization is our Birthright this was the attitude that he had that is not something that uh uh we we have to beg and plead for that please be gracious to us no you have to do it and I wanted early I don't want to wait till I'm 21. I wondered early so he said if we if we can do do that like the small child the parents will even give the inheritance at an earlier age since he has begotten us surely we can claim our inheritance from him he is our father our own father our own mother we can force our Demand on him we can say to him reveal thyself to me or I shall cut my throat with a knife now this of course we know is is that uh play that took place with the talk with first vision of the Divine mother Kali that he really felt that without the vision life wasn't worth living and that he saw the knife hanging on the wall on the Kali Temple went to reach for it to to whether he would have done it we doubt it much but anyhow that was the same when he when he he's when he felt at least life wasn't worth living without the vision of mother then he had the vision then he had that vision we have one other instance of this I'm sure there are many but one that is rather well known who is from a permission on the G this he was a holy mother's disciple I mentioned his name many times a very wonderful soul of course I'd never met him but uh the very point he wrote many beautiful songs but he went through a period of intense intense spiritual discipline and uh one day he just reached that stage where he had to have that realization and really the same thing mother if you don't reveal yourself I'll take my life and not to cut his throat with it but he had a rope with the Noose at the end that was uh attached to the rafter and in the house where he stayed and ready to take his own life and and he had a division of mother that night because that was it was real if we do it it's uh nothing will happen it has to be a hundred percent genuine 100 genuine surama Krishna taught the devotees how to call on the Divine mother I used to pray to her in this way oh mother oh Blissful one reveal thyself to me thou must again I would say to her O Lord of the lowly O Lord of the universe surely I am not outside thy Universe I am bereft of knowledge I am without discipline I have no devotion I know nothing thou must be gracious and reveal thyself to me thus the master taught the devotees how to pray they were deeply touched tears filled mahimatudan's eyes Sharma Krishna looked at him and sang cry to to your mother shama with a real cry o mind and how can she hold herself from you how can shama stay away several devotees arrived from sheep poor since they'd come from a great distance the master could not disappoint them he told them some of the essentials of spiritual life Master now we'll go right back to this Guyana yoga see he goes right from this first of all don't give me this brahmigiana then he goes to this Vivek event discrimination and renunciation then he goes to this praying to mother and now he'll switch back again Master God Alone is real and all else is illusory the garden and its owner God and its splendor but people look at the Garden only how few seek out the owner sir what is the way master discrimination so now we'll get the same feedback between the real and the unreal I want you to always discriminate to the effect that God Alone is real and the world unreal and one should pray with sincere longing now this is discrimination between sad real and Assad unreal now I I I mentioned this almost every time because I think it's important that uh talk very rarely uh talked about this Assad as as illusory we get that translation here illusory it's it's I won't say it's a bad translation but if we want to be sticklers that takes is saying Satya and anitya he's using the the terminology here and uh it's significant the distinction is significant uh because uh it implies a whole different type of of understanding of the relationship between the absolute and the relative which we also wanted a great teachings of suramakrishna so whenever he talks about that can be translated as as illusory but even that there will be so many different ways of understanding it these are on our famous verse that gives the the gist of it this is the term is used ceramic Krishna uses it when he's referring to that to that Doctrine when he's talking about just in general then he'll almost always uses anitya were of us to he likes these these terms sometimes sad Assad these are all terms they're Sanskrit terms I think found in all Indian languages I think almost everyone will know vastu and agustup substance something substantial insubstantial you can say Eternal transitory being non-being something like that we even have I know in this pradatan or padanta I I know in in Bengali abudate is used for a worthless person yeah yeah but but metaphysically it'll be the same type of thing something has substance something has no substance you say even a man of substance or something with notes of you know a worthless fellow something like that so there these are distinctions that uh have an implication of a whole metaphysical system so uh each term will go with a different term that's used for the feminine side we talked about this many times the masculine side feminine side that they'll be Brahman and and Maya they'll be ishwara Shakti there'll be all different these these these pairs that talk where says everything is explained by the union of the this what's considered a masculine and effeminate uh we shouldn't take it too literally but anyhow that uh if if the dwightens they talk about this near Guna Brahman as the as the one side then the other side will be Maya and if we talk about Maya then we can talk about mithya this universe now what exactly does it mean that somehow that there's some covering of the ignorance that make something appear to be what it's not so if we if we use this illustration the snake in the Rope the Rope never becomes a snake there's this is just to falsely perceived to be a snake so there's no real rum and just remains what it is the very difficult Doctrine to understand this remains it is it appears to be the universe so then we can say some types of Krishna he prefers this idea of Shakti if we say that it's the Shakti the power that belongs to Brahman then we can say that this whole universe is that is transitory we won't say it's mithia it's not completely false we won't even say avastu because the substance behind it is Brahman itself but I was doing the sense because taku uses that term that in itself there's no substance to it now all of these things these terms have a psychological value to it if we say something Allah that means that there's something Hollow about it it doesn't mean that there's there's no matter underlying the appearance of of these physical objects it means that there's something incapable of of if we're looking for something that will really fulfill our our desires in life that this won't do it that these there's something Hollow about this type of enjoyment that's also of us do now this idea of vanitya this is what taqwa emphasizes I think this is a very very beautiful way of understanding this idea of Maya that things are just constantly in a state of flux that every second things are changing every second we're changing that this whole life itself will end one day that is dreamlike but not in a metaphysical sense dream life in a dream that every object is just a projection of mind but this maybe we'll say projection of this Cosmic mind but in anyhow in the in the event it has some internal external idea that uh where we we don't have to say that this isn't just figment of my imagination to understand that it's transitory and to understand that it can't satisfy the deeper logging that we have to for to fulfill that that desire of the heart there's there's something within us that feels empty and it needs to be filled and this is almost this can't do it because there's something Hollow about it this is the most important part of this uh sadasad viveka otherwise we're just we're just philosophers arguing with each other I don't see much point and and all of these big arguments that uh is it a projection of of this Cosmic mind what we we have to deal with this world and we have to accept the reality of other people and everything transitory and it'll end one day just like a dream comes to an end when we die it'll end at least for us we assume it'll continue for others but at least for us so uh this is one way the other way of looking at this so the south of each other is uh discrimination what is is is of ultimate value in life and what is what is of temporary enjoyment this is that sharia's prayers this is the other way of looking at it if we want to practice this path of discrimination we have to ask what are my priorities in life what's important to me will help me realize that highest goal what will a JS be a little diversion which is maybe harmless but is not in the long run going to be what I want to achieve in life and so this is all part of this viveka this is similar words so takor he'll say one we have to constantly practice this type of each other and we have to constantly eliminate this other type that is just philosophical speculation that just makes us go around in circles we saw how many times he told them promise me you won't argue and reason anymore about those things but at the same time you'll say well you have to constantly practice this other type of discrimination otherwise uh we we get mixed up with the world we we lose our way we fail to see the ultimate purpose of life we forget that these are uh very difficult things to hold on to the everything will elude or grasp ultimately that type of happiness that we're we're striving to realize so we have to have that type of discrimination so he says I'll go back a little God Alone is real and all else is illusory that means all else is transitory the garden and its owner the garden is real but it's it's not going to last it'll it'll have a nice season and then the next thing you know that little flowers will dry up and everything it'll be gone and then had to plant it again God in his splendor but people look at the Garden only how few seek out the owner adivity sir what is the way Master discrimination between the real and the unreal so this one should always discriminate to the effect that God Alone is real and the world unreal illusory they're all different terms that refer to the same idea with it just a slightly different connotation as I said before Taco uses this the transitory word and one should pray with sincere longing so no no contradiction between this devotional practice of prayer and this philosophical idea of discrimination devity but sir where is our Leisure for these things Master those who have the time must meditate and worship but those who cannot possibly do so much bow down wholeheartedly to God twice a day now time this is a big question how do we utilize our time there's a very nice song I think from Prasad song where he says mother I find time to do everything else but I don't find any time to call on you it's a very nice song so we always tell ourselves that no I don't have any time for doing it do we have time to to sleep and to eat and and do I make our phone calls and do everything else yeah we find time so they're they're of course are certain circumstances where we really don't have time uh and then we have to do at least what taqwa says bow down hold hardly but most the time it's up to us to to carve out some special period for our spiritual practice uh the one thing everybody can give up is sleep no one preventing us from getting up early it's accepted of course our own mind that's the thing so uh usually these are these are a bit lame excuses that I have no time he knew that but for those who really don't have time then uh they he he says at least Bow Down uh about that wholeheartedly did to God twice a day morning and evening we could say we have that story of Narada and narayana says so he wants to know who is my greatest Liberty and he shows this one farmer the early morning he bows down to uh in the shrine before the image of the Lord then goes and works all day long and comes back and bows down again and not it is not very impressed but then on top where he teaches them that those who would engage all day long at least to remember twice a day so this is a minimum we can say but the point is wholeheartedly with great sincerity that is the main thing he abides in the heart of all he knows that worldly people have many things to do what else is possible for them you don't have time to pray to God they forgive him the power of attorney but all is in vain unless you attain God and see him now this power of attorney again that we have to make sure that we're not being Hypocrites with this eternity then I do whatever I want there's nothing gained by that what does it mean to the power of Eternity it means that we have to uh really feel and deep within our heart that we're doing something at the prompting of the Divine somehow and the only way we can do that is to eliminate any selfish desire if we eliminate any ulterior motive any selfie desire but we can feel that maybe I'm acting according to God's will don't know that's about the best that we can do until we've really attained some high high State this idea that I'm the instrument and God is the operator this is for for the god realized soul this is not something that that we can practice uh with the ordinary mind that does everything out of desire and and longing for uh for power and enjoyment and and fame all of these different things that type of mind can't say I'm the instrument God is the operator it may be true with that type of mind but still then we have to try to practice this type of purification so this is really an ideal that to reach that state of given mukti that even mukta has no desire to do anything and just prompted by the Divine or whatever uh presents itself to him or her that's how the demon book that will act in the world another devotee sir to see you is the same as to see God now talk where again had different moods sometimes people would say that things like this he would say no no don't ever say anything like that then other times people would say it is can can never be seen they talk what's my answer are you sure so he again it would have different moods so here he says don't ever say that again we know that in in that certain mood he couldn't bear uh anybody praising him too much and when he would be in the mood of a child of God and then it would be just go against the grain Guru Baba karta he used to say if anyone addressed him with these three words that it would be like he was being stung by this type of blowfish or man of war or whatever it is some some stinging fish that is very painful he couldn't bear that don't ever say that again the waves belong to the Ganges not the Ganges to the wave that means I want to think of myself as a part of God not that God is a part of me or God anything like that or one with the whole ocean let me feel I'm a wave and this and this this ocean a man cannot realize God unless he gets rid of all such egotistic ideas as I am such an important man or I am so and so leveled amount of eye To The Ground by dissolving it with tears of devotion devity why has God put us in the world now we we don't have any Ultimate answers for these types of questions and taco will give different answers at different times depending on his mood depending on what he thinks will be helpful for the listener I don't think we can take any of these as a Taco's final opinion because we'll say different things sometimes he'll still simply say who can understand the ways of God here he'll give one possible attitude that we can take that we may like we may not like we may find it helpful we may not to perpetuate his creation okay this is the answer we're going to get now other times he'll say so that we can realize God he'll give different as I say different answers it is his will his Maya he is deluded man with lust and gold devotee why has he deluded us why has he so willed now again we can say this is Maya there's no real answer for these things you try to give an answer Master if but once he should give man A Taste of divine Joy then man would not care to lead a worldly Life The Creation would come to an end so there's one one way that we can try to understand that uh this is necessary this little Maya is necessary for this world to go on it won't go on otherwise the grain dealer stores rice in huge bags in his Warehouse near them he put some puffed rice in a tray this is to keep the rats away the puffed rice tastes sweet to the rats and they nibble at it all night they do not seek the rice itself so this is a way of saying that we find little bits and pieces of enjoyment in the external world that's enough so that we don't seek for the real gems Within is enough but just think when Seer of rice yields 14 seers of puffed rice how infinitely Superior is the joy of God to the pleasure of lust and gold to one who thinks of the beauty of God the beauty of even these are these upsets these two Celestial dancing girls of exquisite beauty uh appears but the ashes of a funeral prior a devotee why do we not feel intense restlessness to realize him to realize God good question Master a man does not feel Restless for God until all his worldly desires were satisfied okay now another very important concept I I I find great significance in this because it's not so easy to to know what it means or how to go about it Boga means enjoyment unto means end the end of enjoyment now for for some uh it means that we we have a list we have a finite number of things that we have a desire to enjoy and we enjoy those things and then we're finished this is the concept behind the different stages of Life the householder stage of life is man to fulfill those types of desires desire for family desire for uh career although there's things to fulfill those things and be finished with them to to see through them then there are other types of desires that is a pouring game on the fire that it increases the more we get the more we want we we get a little taste of of of money and fame and power we want more and more and more there's some Central enjoyment we want more and more and more how do we get to boganta for that to reach the end of that either we burn our fingers enough so that we we know that uh it's it's not worth it or we observe other people or some some Grace comes upon us or we just simply use our willpower that I know that this is uh yes spiraling out of control sometimes we have to hit the bottom we we read uh with uh those who have some type of alcohol or drug addiction that they have this this idea until you reach Rock Bottom you won't be able to turn your life around so there are all different ways of of understanding this concept and how we go about it and first ramakrishna he said the little enjoyments fulfill those things these little desires fulfill them and get rid of them that type of thing for uh you go to the book to hope you have explained a lot okay so so yeah so far we're talking of course there's no longing to have bad experiences or a desire for it yeah yeah those actually those are the things that the teach us our lesson when when we suffer because of these things we suffer because of our desires then then we start to see that this is our own misconception that these things can bring enjoyment and everything yes suffering is the greatest teacher actually if we want to look at it that way uh what Taco is talking about here I think I think that's one of the ways that we get over this desire to keep enjoying things when we realize that there's the there's a suffering that follows we have this these verses either at the end we find that there's greater enjoyment with spiritual happiness where we find that there's greater bondage and greater suffering so when we have these bad negative experiences and we have to learn our lesson some people don't learn it they keep sticking their finger in fire other people learn it by watching other people but until we reach that point and and it's it's not going to be it uh a hundred percent we're never going to reach that point where there no you see desire is such a big category that when there's no little desire we'll always have some some little things that we want those are those I'm not talking about that but to reach that point where we uh really uh only desire some something higher now we care only for God that doesn't mean that we won't enjoy a nice meal or go for a walk and and see it sunset and all the it doesn't mean that that we can still appreciate and enjoy those things but deep down the only realism longing is God realization Karma theory of course is all tied in with this yes so we have we have two things one it will be some squatters that were born with certain types of desires and the other will be that yeah that we we have uh a certain amount of enjoyment and suffering that probably is due to us yeah and so that can also be that it can also be read that we have to reach the end of our Karma if but the problem is we keep creating more and more and more so we have to also stop creating more karma and so that's also part of the whole thing that's where this discrimination comes in stop doing the same things over and over again yeah for some people it's very easy they're born with very few desires very pure hearts there's a good karma good some Scottish for others we have to go through a lot of suffering and make a lot of mistakes until we learn our lessons but the point is somehow to reach this this this period where uh with it whatever we had to experience good or bad is done but uh it can't simply be that they will let me wait till my karma is done and everything it also has to be let me reason and observe and see what am I gaining from all of this is it helping me and and uh to achieve what I really want in life there's an obstacle creating more bondage as a creative more misery ultimately and at some point and at the same time increase is longing for God so they they also work hand in hand then how do we how do we reach the the limits of the worldly enjoyment by increasing this this uh desire for doing spiritual practice and getting a taste of some Divine communion it's a little taste of it that will also help us but this very important statement that uh one does not feel Restless for God until all his worldly desires are satisfied now uh worldly desires this will have to be see and satisfied for some people satisfied it means that we've accomplished it see there are two ways to eliminate desires the one is to fit fulfill them and the other is to make them disappear the the idea of fulfilling them we keep getting new ones so the real thing is is to get rid of them is uh to somehow uh have this other and Tucker always emphasizes the positive have this longer for God so strong that the others uh become insignificant to us a man does not feel Restless for God until all this worldly desires are satisfied he does not remember the mother of the universe until the share of the enjoyment of lust and gold is completed a child absorbed in play does not seek his mother but after his play is over he says mother I must go to my mother now when does the play end this is the whole thing it'll be different for different people if it's uh this this just the play of the child we don't know why at some point a child will get tired with the toys and and want mother alone we don't know why and how this is also the bit of Grace when we reach this stage all desires are fulfilled but after its play is over he says mother I must go to my mother son was playing with the pigeons calling to them come Titi when he had had enough of the play he began to cry then a stranger came and said come with me I will take you to your mother unhesitatingly he climbed in the man's shoulders and was off those who are eternally free do not have to enter worldly life talked about it a very small class of very special Souls who were born from time to time usually when this Avatar comes that are already born they've already finished these enjoyments in the past lifetime those who are eternally free do not have to enter worldly life their desire for enjoyment has been satisfied with their very birth okay we can stop here and now we're at the arrival abductor um [Music] [Music] with
