[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (06/25/21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXf5VhzCIVM)

[Music] your words are like nectar bringing life to squirt souls they are praised by poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to the class on the gospel of srama krishna we are on chapter 11. this is with the devotees of dakshin ishwar part 1 and it's monday june 4th 1883 and we are on page 234 the discussion had been kind of superstitious things well we would call superstition that things the the omens and things like that israel krishna he was a combination of things huh but uh one aspect of his life was that uh he was a village boy from orthodox brahmid family and a lot of cultural things and customary things that that we don't always understand things that he grew up believing and let's see what he says so before this he had said i shall take this to be true if i meet a certain person or a certain officer of the temple garden or if a certain officer of the temple garden talks to me what i would think of would invariably come to pass so this is what triggers this whole thing m had studied logic english logic in the chapters on fallacies he had read that only superstitious people believe in the coincidences of mourning dreams with actual events therefore he asked the master was there never any exception of course what happens in his life and what happens in everybody else's life there are different things maybe everything true in his case i know i have many dreams and they're just complete nonsense and i've even had dreams where so clearly something happened to someone and you think oh this you make a phone call no they're fine nothing happened yeah of course other times people have dreams and they really something that actually happened so very hard to say master no at that time everything happened that way i would repeat the name of god and believe that a certain thing would happen and it would invariably come to pass to manila you'll remember that manila was here he was an elderly member of the brahma-samaj but you must remember unless one is guileless and broad-minded one cannot have such faith now he's going to make one of these statements that i always yeah feel a little funny about bony people the hallowed the cross eyed people with physical traits like those cannot easily acquire faith what can a man do if there are evil omens on all sides this uh they don't actually translate this very cute little expression taco had so many of these cute little things that he knew that uh somehow i i like to remember some of these things there's a literally it means to a banana tree to the south and then puy some type of green to the north and then uh a black cat a single black cat so what can i do yeah that they're seeing all these these bad signs so uh yeah these physical traits things like that the two things one is that he didn't need these physical traits he could tell what a person was like he could like looking into a glass case he could see the inside but he did he did believe in these these different things he would look at uh sometimes he would ask someone to remove the shirt to look at the chest if it was it was indented chest or this and he had his own way of of doing things i asked one of our swamis once about this and he said yeah we don't really believe in these things but taco believes in it so we we pay respect to these things like uh this thing about starting a trip on the thursday afternoon huh yeah it's a superstition we don't really believe in it but but uh talk with we had great faith in that so we don't do it some of our swamis who are very scientific and rational people and everything they'll also follow these things swami's finally he would never never start a trip if he if he had to take a trip uh say they they made a fight for him thursday afternoon he would leave his room before 12. so he felt like he was starting his journey before 12 o'clock the thursday afternoon superstitions he wouldn't travel with a banana huh yeah i don't know do you know that have you heard that superstition we had another wonderful swami i think i mentioned him last time ram gopal muraj and he stayed with us one time and we were we were going for i think we were driving to thousand island park at that time and we were packing lunch and everything and i said can i pack a banana he said why not i said oh some people won't travel with the banana he said ah i don't believe in those things so everyone is different everyone is different that way for the exams to refuse us to take the banana oh just on the exam day so to the south of banana tree now why black cats of course in the west also a black cat it's never seen that that happens to anybody no yeah it was dusk the maid servant entered the room now another difficult thing to follow made certain servant entered the room and burned incense this is bring day we meet her at the very first day when m comes because ann was asking brende is the master in can we go in the door's closed perhaps he's he's doing his evening uh devotions and she says no go right in then he asked her i've has he read many books and he said no there is a mukesh everything is on his tongue and so we've we've been introduced to her but we don't know much about her except she was an elderly woman at that time so it was dusk the maidservant entered the room and burned incense manila and some other devotees left for calcutta m and rockal were in the room the master was seated on his small couch absorbed in meditation on the divine mother there was complete silence after a time her name was was bhagavati but the nickname was brinde an old maidservant of the temple proprietor i'm assuming it's the same person entered the room and saluted the master from a distance the sri ramakrishnan bade her sit down the master had known her for many years in her younger days she had lived a rather immoral life but the master's compassion was great soon he began to converse with her master now you are pretty old have you been feeding the vaisnavas and holy men and thus spending your money in a noble way she came from the division of the family of course bhagavati smiling how can i say that this is a way of saying yes i've been doing it it's kind of a pretended humility or modesty see she doesn't want to she wants to let him know that she's really doing it but she doesn't want to sound like she's bragging about it so yeah how can i say that but yes i have master have you been to brindavan benares and the other holy places bhagavati shrinkingly how can i say that but then she starts to brag a little bit i've built a bathing place and my name is inscribed there on a slab master indeed yes sir my name is written there master with a smile how nice emboldened by the master's words bhagavati approached and saluted him touching his feet like a man stung by a scorpion srama krishna stood up and cried out govinda govinda a big jar of ganges water stood in the corner of the room he hurried there pending and washed with the holy water the spot the maidservant had touched the devotees in the room were amazed to see this incident bhagavati sad as if struck dead srama krishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone you should salute me from a distance in order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment the master saying tenderly listen to a few songs now some people will say why did he do that does he does he not know how embarrassed and horrified she'll feel and it does he has no control that the candy put up with a little pain this and that there's a natural reaction would holy mother act that way people will say things like that but takur had his own physical sensitivity to things and everything i've mentioned this before but everything manifested in such a concrete and tangible way with him there's the the mind and the body were one if the mind couldn't bear any impurity then the body couldn't either if he said that he he couldn't bear to have money then the physical touch of that money he said would sting him like this this there's a type of fish i think it's like a blowfish or something or a man of war portuguese man of war something like that they can sting it's very very painful so he this is was just his nature this is a part of this mental and physical instrument that that he dealt with and through all of his spiritual experiences he became so sensitive and even physically sensitive to impurity we we know that uh in that state of samadhi during a certain period he couldn't bear the touch of anyone even even his direct disciples except for baburam he was the only one this is he said nowadays i can't when i'm in samadhi that it'll be painful and this includes rakhal narendra and everybody else he says only baburam was so pure that he was the one if he went into samati that he would have to be there to hold him up so this was just his nature we have to accept this there's no no point in trying to to think oh couldn't he have done it in another other way was with was he so cruel uh it wasn't anything that he wanted to do this is just the way his his body and mind worked he had that tremendous sensitivity to things now he's doing his best what he knows that how she'll feel mortified by all of this so the master then sang about the divine mother the black bee of my mind is drawn in sheer delight to the blue lotus flower of mother shama's feet these are all beautiful songs i remember there was one very nice swami in delhi first time i went there he passed away he was from south india but learned to sing bengali songs very beautifully and i heard him sing this song one time ah it's just gorgeous then he sang high in the heaven of the mother's feet my mind was soaring like a kite when came a gust of sins rough wind that drove it swiftly toward the earth these are all ram prasad and kamlakantha again dwell mind within yourself enter no others home if you but seek there you will find all you were searching for god the true philosopher's stone who answers every prayer lies hidden deep within your heart the richest gem of all how many pearls and precious stones are scattered all about the outer court that lies before the chamber of your heart this may not be wrong prasad song does it say the other little different maybe advice of a song even okay that's the end of that that day or the entry for that day tuesday june 5th 1883. were staying with the master in the temple garden at dakshineshwar of course he stayed there all of the time that that was where he had his residence raqqah he was recently married but in those days these marriages were often uh where they were always arranged and sometimes they would not exactly child marriage his wife i think was 15 or something like that i don't know a little bit young so it wasn't all the ways that after married marriage the husband and wife lived together very often they would wait until the wife was a little bit older look at the case of a holy mother she was 18 when she came to stay with sherman krishna and they were joined families on both sides so sometimes she would stay with her her family sometimes rock and roccal with now he was married but he was so drawn to takur and takwo uh wanted him to stay with him takwanui was married that somehow he knew it wouldn't be a problem for him we were just reading this morning about yogin murads from yogananda that his mind was not inclined towards studies or to work or anything like that it was very from a young age very very spiritual and in drawn nature they sent him to live with an uncle and to see if they could engage him in some type of work do something useful because the monetary condition of the family wasn't so good they were very wealthy big family at one time so then the mother said to send him back home and when they when he came home he saw all big arrangements for big celebration everything and then he found out that they'd arranged his marriage without even telling him and it was two days later and he had no inclination he said no i won't do it and then his mother she started weeping and said if all the arrangements are made it'll be such an embarrassment that you have to do this otherwise i may commit suicide this and that so finally he agreed to do it and later when his mother saw he wasn't interested in staying with his wife or working or anything he said well then why did you marry he said why did i marry you said you would kill yourself if i didn't he was shocked and she said that nobody marries because the mother says something like that and then he said nobody would talk over but the master could he trust in his words but he was so embarrassed that he had gotten married talk were always talking about renunciation that he stopped going to him a taco played a trick i won't go through the whole story but when he went there he said what is it you're married what does it matter you can be married a thousand times it won't hurt or harm you in your spiritual life so talk where you even send rock called back to his wife have a little fun with your wife and then they had a son so yeah we think taco was so strict always this comedy conscience don't get near women and everything each person was a little bit different so uh rakhal at this time started staying with the master his father wasn't happy then he said bring your father here and then after his father met sri ramakrishna he and saw that there were other big people there his father was a little bit of a worldly man it wasn't so much that he was attracted to srama krishna but he saw that there were other business people and deputy magistrates and all of that going there and then he thought oh okay it's not such a bad thing so grudgingly he gave his uh his permission and his wife's family they were all they were devotees that's how it was it was brother-in-law that he first came so anyhow rockhold was staying at that time hazura was one of the the regular people who lived there m2 had been there since the previous sunday so this is tuesday so it's a long time it must have been school break school holiday or something as it was a weekday there were only a few devotees in the room generally people gathered there in large numbers on sundays or holidays it was afternoon srirama krishna was telling the devotees about his experiences during his god-intoxicated state oh what a state i passed through this is one of the very standard things that tucker says before he gives his reminiscences yeah so what what a state i passed through so this will be talking about that god intoxicated state and his behavior sometimes like a madman that sometimes suggests uh just a little odd huh because he didn't care what people thought and like a real eccentric at that time and you'll see that the things he's going to tell are not very flattering so just what is the point in telling all of this the point is one thing that he has a good sense of humor about himself doesn't take himself too seriously and wants to let them know that god intoxicated state people don't act like normal people do they have a whole different way of living in the world at that time i didn't eat my meals here i don't know why induction it's or before a holy mother was there he at that time he would just take food from prasad from the temple kali temple i would enter the house of abraham in the village the dakshinosura was considered a village at that time nearby places generally it would be past meal time so he's showing up at the wrong time this is number one anybody who who wants to be courteous and doesn't want to uh put anybody out if they're they're going to be a guest the uh one of the beautiful traditions in india is that if anybody shows up and they haven't been fed and need any any guests it's the obligation and joy of the householder to feed them was it either holy mother's mother or taco's mother that would wait and wait and wait if nobody came because they won't take food she wouldn't take her food until she saw that everyone had been fed that men even any any guests who had just shown up any beggars even or holy men whatever it was so that was a tradition but you try to do it at a time when it's not inconvenient for them even for us satou is when we don't go baking our food very much at the time of sanyasa and everything we know exactly when to do it around 10 in the morning that's when the the women are just finishing their their cooking and everything it's convenient and easy for them we don't want to inconvenience them so he knew these things it didn't strike his mind he didn't bother he was in a half a mad state so generally it would be past meal time i would just sit down there without saying a word if the members of the household asked me why he had come i would simply say i want something to eat now and then i would go uninvited of course to ram charity's house at alambazar or to the chaudharis at dakshineshwar this will be swami yoga and this family huh we're guessing that they belong to that sabor no children family yeah suburb but i didn't relish the food at the children's house one day i obeyed mature to take me to the bendura i said they went to chance the name of god and they want to see him will you take me there now he was probably at that time one of if not the most well-known and important figures in in calcutta at that time he was the uh really you can say founder of the original brahma-samaj adhi brahma-samaj the inspiration really was rambo hon roy but actually the way we find it today with the name i think i would say and he was considered to be uh a very pious person he was a householder had a big family we know about all of the children ravinder not the most famous of course uh but he had a name takur he always liked to meet people who had some type of good reputation there's a verse in the gita which says that if anybody excels in any field then there's a special manifestation of god within them so taco felt that a great musician a great speaker a great religious leader something like that so he would go uh he wanted to meet them he would a little bit test to see what they had sometimes he himself would grant them the grace of of seeing him and learning from him also other times they wouldn't appreciate it we don't get the full story here it comes later but it says will you take me there maturable was a very proud man how could one expect him to go to another man's house uninvited he was very very wealthy of course through marriage to rani rashmani's family i don't know maybe on his own also i don't remember at first he hesitated but then he said all right devendra and i were fellow students i will take you to him now it doesn't tell the whole story but uh when he went he had a long conversation with the bender a little bit impressed that he asked him something about his idea about god and he gave this idea to the chandelier just to the chandelier all the lights of it illumine the chandelier itself something like that and taco said oh a nice idea and then uh devendra said we're having our brahmo samaj festival coming up soon would you please come because he knew that he used to go from time to time so taco said okay and then he said a very funny thing he said but please dress like a gentleman it was a taco he wouldn't wear a shirt unless it was cold but otherwise village people they didn't do that they would he would take the bottom part of his uh of his wearing cloth and throw it over his shoulder you've seen the picture like that and then what was his reason he said other people may criticize you and it'll hurt me i was not a very a little little bit of a funny type of answer what he really meant was it'll be a big embarrassment to everybody so so takwa said uh how i how can i pretend that i'm a gentleman this and that i don't know and so he went back and he said the next day a letter came don't come and you have to talkward doesn't uh talk about that here we get it uh in a different section he's just mentioning all of these different incidents another day i learned of a good man named nino mukherjee living at bhagwazar near the bridge he was a devotee i asked mathur to take me there finding me insistent he took me to dina's house and a carriage it was a small place the arrival of a rich man in the big carriage embarrassed the inmates we too were embarrassed that day dinosaur was being invested with the sacred thread so this will be a very important day for the family that's a very big occasion this is when the young boy he'll be initiated into mantra and they they may shave its head and they'll start to keep the nishika and everything and it's really the day that he is some something like bar mitzvah jewish tradition huh that uh he's considered a grown-up person and has responsibilities and duties and everything so it's a big thing and they'll uh they'll have invite people over and feed everybody and yeah did you have that all of that yeah yeah a long time ago yeah it happened to different ages and different traditions 12 years old some 9 years old 11 12 13 something like that yeah the house was crowded and there was hardly any place for dino to receive us we were about to enter a side room when someone cried out please don't go into that room there are ladies there now this was this was a time when there was this tradition about the inner apartment huh this is uh i believe that this was the influence of the muslim culture because there the zenina system was there it must be order word zanina system where women had their own private place to stay and the men don't go there now the one of the interesting things is that whenever tucker visited at devotee's home they would send him in there so that all of the women devotees could have them all to themselves and sometimes he would have his meal with them and chat with them and laugh and tell jokes and everything we think that he was never with women but it's not true and they loved him of course so this is the inner apartment ideas and in the system and the poor the system and all of that so so that was common among the hindu families as well so that would have been a great embarrassment if they'd walked into that that room with all the ladies there uh who knows if some were still getting dressed or what they were doing it was really a distressing situation returning matar babu said father he always called them yeah i shall never listen to you again i laughed oh what a state i passed through once kumar singh gave a feast to the sadhus and invited me to i don't know who this commercial is i found a great many holy men assembled there when i sat down for the meal several sadhus asked me about myself at once i felt like leaving them and sitting alone not such a bad thing very often uh there's one sadhu will meet another sadhu and they'll ask what is your son pradaya what order do you belong to even takwa did that when he met that satu uh near raman surendra's house he was on his way there and he met him and he asked them that question and the saudis said oh people call me a paramahamsa so it's not such a rude or out of uh extraordinary type of question but this was the state that he was in that uh he didn't want to hear any of these types of things at once i felt like leaving them and sitting alone i wondered why they should bother about all that the sadhus took their seat i began to eat before they had started the when the saudis get together they don't simply do brahmarpanam they'll they'll chant all of chapter 15 from the gita sometimes they'll do this this shiva tanda vestotra yeah if it's a big thing with with the sadhus i i got to attend several of these things fantastic and sometimes they'll do what they can do some other things and uh and they saw this even these old fathers if they have the stick danda they'll hold that and they'll chant this in tandem fantastic and they're all all the shiva the destruction of the universe it's kind of the national anthem for sadhus but nobody will eat before that food will be there well usually it's not even there but sometimes on the plate they'll have a little bit maybe the rice will be there and they won't serve anything else yet or it's a chutney or something it could be otherwise usually they'll come around with buckets and serve things that way the saudis took their seats i began to eat before they had started i heard several of them remark oh what sort of man is this it was about five o'clock in the afternoon srama krishna was sitting on the steps of his veranda hazra rakhal and em were near him azra had the attitude of the vedantist i am he the vedantist generally will find uh in in taquer's terminology in m it means an indoytan we know there are other schools of edanta but when they talk about vedante generally they mean the dua to it i am he and that means i am one with the absolute brahmin master duhazr yes all one's confusion comes to an end if one only realizes that it is god who manifests himself as the atheist and the believer the good and the bad the real and the unreal that it is he was present in waking and in sleep and that he is beyond all these now m himself wrote that that a hazra had the attitude of the vedantist i am he why did he write that because we very often find that srama krishna will speak to the attitude of a particular person so we don't have to necessarily feel that oh this is tako really believes this this is his final opinion he's doing this because hazrat is there and he knows that hazrat will appreciate this so sometimes and will actually say that that this uh omanilali was a brahmo therefore takwa spoke to him this way or the the the orthodox vaisnava so we spoke to him this way so that's that's why he'll talk about this strictly to it onto here now the another thing is that it says uh all once confused and comes to an end if one only realizes that it is god who manifests himself as the atheist and the believer the good and the bad the real and the unreal that it is he was present in waking and in sleep and that he is beyond all these now taka used to say that there are three different levels three different types of devotees that the lowest and believes that god is somewhere outside and the worship to god god sitting in in on a cloud in heaven something like that then the next is to see god dwelling within all the beings now for the dwight in this will be this will be the highest it's the dwight in that this identification of the jiva with with paramatman this will be the highest but taqwa says the highest this is saying that god himself has become all of this that will be our salvation doesn't give as much emphasis to that or places much importance on that idea that all this is verily brahman itself more this idea that all of this is transitory and unreal and that the soul reality is consciousness brahman itself he said that this is a higher state this is a vigne state when he comes down from from that state of oneness then he sees everything manifestation of the divine and he'll tell a story which we which we hear several times throughout the gospel there was a farmer to whom an only son was born when he was rather advanced in age okay so this is considered a great blessing the whole life they're hoping for for a son to carry on the family line no sign in the old age that means the family line ends there it's not a very auspicious thing as the child grew up his parents became very fond of him one day the farmer was out working in the fields when a neighbor told him that his son was dangerously ill indeed at the point of death returning home he found the boy dead his wife lived bitterly but his own eyes remained dry sadly the wife said to her neighbors such a son has passed away and he hasn't even one tear to shed after a long while the farmer said to his wife do you know why i'm not i am not crying last night i dreamt i had become a king and the father of seven princes these princes were beautiful as well as virtuous they grew in stature and acquired wisdom and knowledge in the various arts suddenly i woke up now i have been wondering whether i should weep for those seven children or this one boy then taku says to the gyanes the waking state is no more real than the dream state sometimes he says that the dream state is as real as the waking state sometimes the waking state is unreal is the dream state and you know we get the idea now the reason i mention all of this is that taqwa very often says i don't like to call this world unreal like a dream he's not denying that this is a legitimate spiritual attitude from one point of view it's true that uh unreal like a dream means a dream like transitory that at the end when everything we leave this world if we're in some other loca and we look back it'll appear like a dream but not 100 literally like a dream and he'll talk where that wasn't his attitude but because hazrat has that attitude he's telling the story also i think he tells it maybe to mani malik at another time but it will always be to someone who who has that attitude takwa did two things one he liked to encourage people to follow the path that they were on if they're ghani's he would say something to help them if they were booked there's something for them but if there was something lacking or if they were one-sided or a little bit biased one way then he would point to the other side he would say yes you can follow your path but understand that other pets are all fine too and that the sectarianism is a bad thing don't be too bigoted and everything so he would do both things god alone is the doer everything happened by his will now this is another teaching that can easily be misunderstood and this is something that comes when one sees god alone dwells within all beings and then of course it's true but this idea this and god in heaven who's pushing us around like pieces on the chessboard this is what we get in this kind of greek mythology that we have no say in anything we shouldn't make any attempt to do anything if we take it to mean that then it won't be helpful for us in our spiritual life we have to feel and taco would say no you have to exert yourself you've uh kubrok tai you have to great determination so how do we square these two things this is something of a very high point of view very often he'll say this is the final word is when we see that god alone is the doer everything happens by his will but it is very difficult to understand that so now he's going to point to the fact that well all these horrible things happen that uh catastrophes and and earthquakes all sorts of things happen people now this pandemic do we want to say that god's will that these people are dying and then what about karma this and that taco gives different answers at different times one time somebody was talking about this god's will and he said what was his answer he said if you if you eat chilis won't your won't your tongue burn so nannies are bringing in this this idea of karma and don't blame god for everything that there's cause and effect is there so he'll give different answers at different times but it is very difficult to understand that that everything is god's will take the case of the sadhu kailash how people tortured him and in a way killed him they had found him in samadhi so trying to bring his mind down even takur when he was in samadhi for those six months this one sadhu came and he would he would have to do something tap his body or maybe like a little stick something to bring body consciousness back so the mind could come down a little bit so at least he could take some food and swallow it and feed himself that way so they were doing they wanted to bring him down from that state of somati first they buried him then they put him under water then they branded him with a hot iron i don't know why they did all of this doesn't sound like it was just to bring his mind down really torturing him thus they brought him back to consciousness of the world so i guess that was the purpose but in the end the sadhu died as a result of these tortures he undoubtedly suffered at the hands of men though as you say he died by the will of god now this idea the will of god if we accept it then it's one of these theories that the mere accepting of it allows us to explain everything by it just like the karma theory if we say that well this is completely unfair then we can say that something done in the previous life will cause this to happen and it's actually perfectly fair if we accept it we can explain it that way same thing with the will of god we can say that well we don't understand the reason behind it that maybe it's for his good maybe he'll get the praise we don't know but it's the will of god now talker is bringing the karma the man must reap the fruit of his own karma so is the will of god or is it his own karma and sometimes we get this idea that this this karma theory is the will of god that the will of god means the plan of god and the plan of this universe is cause and effect these things are very hard to understand i don't how much free will is there this this is a question i don't like very much it's free will i i've spoken about this so many times i'll just mention one more time i take this free will as a question of more or less not do we have it or don't we have it and i i like the teaching of the gita that the more we're under the control of our own passions and strong desires and lack that center of discrimination the less free will we have this is this is psychological free will psychological determinism that if we automatically react to something then we have no free will the more we're free from the passions the more we can decide how to react the more free will we have so somebody who won't get insulted when you say bad things somebody won't get angry somebody who will always do the right thing the the holy man the satu not based on the scorpion stinging him or not stinging him that that person has a certain amount of free will they they give this example sometimes with the cow within that circle tethered to a post and the length of the of the rope will describe this circle within that circle he has freedom to roam around but can't go beyond it so it's it's limited but uh i take the case of say an athlete an athlete given the physical body that they have they can jump a certain distance off the ground these are basketball players huh but through training they can keep increasing and increasing increasing and you'll see these little kids sometimes and playgrounds and stuff with uh with a little step ladder and things and doing it to learn how to jump higher and so they all want to learn how to dunk so they're not restricted to the physical limitations of the body 100 but they can't jump 10 feet off the ground they'll never be able to but little by little they can gradually increase so he's saying man must reap the fruit of his own karma so that means maybe something in the sadhu's life meant for that to happen but as far as the death of that holy man is concerned it was brought about by the will of god now how we understand it i don't know the kavi rajas prepare makara draja in a bottle this is kaviraj this is was a type of medical treatment that goes back to ayurvedic treatment and and all the natural things and every non-allopathic medicine and not uh what's the other kind uh homeopathic yeah this will be kind of a local thing uh and yeah it'll explain how it happens the bottle is covered with clay and heated in a fire the gold inside a lot of it is metallic things the gold inside the bottle melts and combines with the other ingredients and the medicine is made then the physicians break the bottle carefully and take out the medicine you can't pour it out anymore it's become solid when the medicine is made what difference does it make whether the bottle is preserved or broken what a nice illustration huh so that means that uh the the inside of the sadhu has become gold he's attained perfection doesn't matter what happens to the body at that time some people think that the holy man was killed but perhaps his inner stuff had been made after the realization of god what difference does it make whether the body lives or dies in that state of samadhi this holy men won't even know except that this physical pain can bring the mind down even from that nearby culpa state this is what happened with srama krishna he himself says when he was in that six months nirvikopasamati that we get two explanations one he heard the voice of the divine mother remained in bahamuka that was one but alongside of that he says at that time i developed such a horrible blood dysentery as if the ants were crawling all over my whole body the the pain of that brought the mind down a little bit and i came down from that state of samati so even in that state just like in in the state of deep sleep you can hit somebody and and it'll bring them to the waking state so a little bit that to bring the mind down the sadhu of was in somanti there are many kinds of samadhi my own experiences tally with the words i heard from a sadhu of rishikesh he talked about five different types sometimes i feel the rising of a spiritual current inside me as though it were the creeping of an ant so this is all see that state of samadhi we can't say anything about it but going into samadhi and coming back down from it where did we read this we read this in vedanta sara i think that the tremendous joy comes from just before going into it or raja yoga one of them and then also coming back down from nirvikalpa samadhi tremendous joy now what happens during that nearby samadhi we can't say but we can infer that there also must be some type of joy something is happening there in order for us to be filled with joy when the mind comes down and a little normal consciousness comes to us so sometimes i feel the rising of the spiritual current inside me as though it were the creeping of an ant thakura could really feel this we talk about it kundalini as if it's just a theoretical type of thing but he could actually feel there's some something creeping up and going up in into the to the head he could feel it but it would do it in different ways so this is like an ant sometimes it feels like the movement of a monkey jumping from one branch to another again sometimes it feels like a fish swimming in water only he who experiences it knows what it is like there are other types he doesn't talk about all of them i think five and samadhi one forgets the world when the mind comes down a little i say to the divine mother mother please cure me of this i want to talk to people. now we're trying to get to that he was trying to keep his mind that because he he came for a purpose he had that sense of of mission although he'd never spoken those terms exactly but if he knew that he came solely for the welfare of others and that if he remained in that neighborhood samadhi state he was no use to others then naturally he would have this feeling when he had that six-month experience that there was a dwight sadhana we read and he says that during that period because not many devotees came it wasn't that he came down from that and then he was free from it he said most of the time he was in that samadhi state that people came he could talk to them he would eat his meal and then everyone would leave and then it would drift back up like that so during this later period the mind stayed down a little more because people were there all of the time and that was his prayer to the divine mother don't make me unconscious with in brahman ghana i want to enjoy the company of devotees and also for for the sake this is why they came none but the ish for the kotis can return to the plane of relative consciousness after attaining samathi another big subject and very confusing to most people we take this to maine of course the highest type of nirvikalpu samati because he makes many other statements so that we can we can enter into this state of samadhi but with our karma will pull us down a little bit the ordinary people ordinary people means anybody other than the ish what a koti ishwar koti means the avatar and his companions when we say ordinary people we're talking about the very highest type of spiritual seeker otherwise ordinary people won't get samadhi but he uses that term that he has to indicate that they're not these special the cardigan purusas so these uh those those ordinary people so-called ordinary people can attain to that state of samadhi but there's little karma that will pull the mind back down so they won't be able to stay in that state too long the point is if we enter into that state and it turns into that highest type of nearly called the somati there's no mechanism by which we can bring the mind back down there's no external force like karma or divine will whatever so the body will just eventually fall off this another way of looking at this is that this is the way a god realized soul leaves this world in the state of samadhi this is the way they die you can say the body can linger for 21 days but they're already gone at that point they're already merged even while living already merged in brahmin some ordinary men so this is what i said they're not ordinary at all it simply means not the ishvarakotis attain samadhi through spiritual discipline but they do not come back so this will other times they'll say some will come back because of this karma or they'll have some desire to work for the welfare of others these will be well the sattva types but when god himself is born as a man an incarnation holding in his hand the key to others liberation then for the welfare of humanity the incarnation returns from samadhi to consciousness of the world and even then taqwa felt that it was the divine mother once am said to sram a christian taco to ask him the question how he could come down from samadhi this and that and and said that you keep a little bit of the sense of ego and a little separation so you can teach others and live in the world and taka corrects him and says no the divine mother is the one who keeps it in me and not i couldn't do that so am to himself does the master hold in his hand the key to man's liberation these are rhetorical questions he's not really wondering he's he's believing it but amazed at that fact that he's sitting in front of a person who can do that hazrat the one thing needful is to please god what does it matter whether an incarnation of god exists or not this is what the taco very often says the the incarnation not for the gyani the gyanis don't pay too much attention to that the brahmos didn't believe in that not it's not such a universally believed thing uh within hinduism as we think the vast majority of course accept it but there were other different schools that either didn't accept it or didn't care much a lot of the vowels that everything was a lot of guru worship and other groups they didn't care too much for the for the incarnation and who were gods and goddesses they liked to worship in guru where god's running within mystical ideas now a little bit interesting because hazrat is always as i am here in the in the absolute brahman now he's talking about pleasing god hazrat wasn't always very logical and contradicted himself sometimes it was the day of the new moon gradually night descended and dense darkness enveloped the trees and the temples a few lights shown here and there in the temple garden the black sky was reflected in the waters of the ganges the master went to the veranda south of his room a spiritual mood was the natural state of his mind the dark knight of the new moon associated with the black complexion of kali the divine mother intensified his spiritual exaltation ya last night i don't know if anybody saw the beautiful full moon huh somebody was telling us this is saraswati and styatra this is this is during this full moon this is when it's very auspicious to take a bath in ganga or ganga sagar yeah and they'll also go there yeah and this is when holy mother first met first came to dakshin ishwar because from the from her village there was a group going they were going all the way to bathe i think in young where else did justin again i don't remember but so then she told her father baba can i go with them there's a good chance i'll have companions and everything and he said yes it's time anyhow and that was when she had heard that he was he was had gone crazy and she thought if my husband has really gone mad it's my duty and obligation to be with him and serve him so that was the time this nanjatra and this my full moon time anyhow this is the dark this is the the new moon i always wondered why they say new moon there's no moon no moon is no moon when the just before the first sliver will come out the next day so just darkness the dark night of the new moon associated with the black complexion of kali the divine mother intensified his spiritual exaltation now and then he repeated om and the name of kali he lay down on the mat and whispered to m master yes god can be seen x had a vision of god we don't know who this is could be rakhal but i'm guessing don't know who this is yx what does it say in bengali oh says omok that just means somebody yeah yeah some john doe yeah not giving the name but don't tell anybody about it so this is why he's not doing it he he even if takur had told him the name he's telling don't reveal the name so he's not doing it here tell me which do you like better god with form or the formless reality taco very often i asked this question sir nowadays sir nowadays i like to think of god without form when he first got there he didn't believe in god with form at all because he assumed it meant idol worship and now he has a deeper understanding but i am also beginning to understand that it is god alone who manifests himself through different forms so this was of course one of the great teachings of krishna that either we say god manifests himself in in different forms or that god reveals himself in the form the devotee wants to see or it's the it's the force of the devotion of the devotee which causes that infinite absolute reality to be seen in a particular way according to that form so slightly different ideas one that god will reveal himself in a particular form the other is that we're scooping the water with our own container and the water will take that form or if my devotion causes the water to freeze in a block of ice in the form that i want to see slightly different ways of understanding it but it but the uh the main idea is that even that god with form is still that formless reality it's that water takes the shape of its container when it's in a particular container it has a form but that's not an absolute form you pour it out it takes a different form it doesn't lose its formlessness even when it has form so god with form without form one in the same okay we'll stop here and i will close we bow our heads before surama krishna who is stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace be untold thank you everyone and have a good week stay well
