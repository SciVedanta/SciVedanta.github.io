[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (11/4/22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YetGWUshsrc)

foreign [Music] Souls they are praised by Poets and remove our sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel Sharma Krishna we are on the chapter Ahmed dakshines for part one and the date is Monday December 24th 1883. and this is uh getting towards the end of M's long stay at Dakshin it's where it's almost two weeks now that he's been with him and uh we're on page 363. and churama Krishna has been talking to m and who else is there we'll see who else is there later yeah the setting is that it was the evening and tirama Krishna was sitting on the floor of his room with the devotees as surrender is there I am and others and talking about the Shiva samhita foreign through the practice of spiritual discipline one attains Perfection by the grace of God but one must also labor a little now we are always have this this big conflict is it through effort is through Grace here is it both it's if we if we feel the inspiration to struggle to realize God that's also a type of Grace the desire for Liberation that for logged me for realization is a type of Grace So takor as much as he talks about Grace he also also emphasizes spiritual practice and with the great because if we have tremendous longing for something won't we do something about it it doesn't do to just simply have a great longing for God realization and and not strive for it so Taco puts the equal emphasis on striving and it's that striving which will uh awaken that Grace So through this the practice of spiritual discipline one attains Perfection by the grace of God one must also labor a little now tacos understanding of what a little is in our understanding are completely different for him labor a little probably is way more than we're willing to do if if we think of what he did in his life and what he he had the direct disciples do and his other disciples didn't do is a tremendous amount so it's a little bit in comparison with what we get in return if we talk about we have to pay a little bit to get something of Great Value it'll be something like that but uh it's a little bit deceiving false advertising and labor a little bit it means start start a little bit and then as you get to taste for it increase and increase then one sees God and enjoys Bliss if a man hears that a jar filled with gold is buried at a certain place he rushes there and begins to dig he sweats as he goes on digging see it's not so easy as he goes on digging after much digging he feels the Spade strikes something then he throws away the spade and looks for the jar at the side of the jar he dances for Joy then he takes up the jar and pours out the gold coins he takes them into his hand counts them and feels the Ecstasy of joy Vision touch enjoyment isn't it so um yes sir the master was silent the moment and then went on master those who are my own will come here even if I scold them look at narendra's nature at first he used to abuse my mother Kali very much one day I said to him sharply Rascals don't come here anymore he slowly left the room and prepare to smoke he was once owned will not be angry even if scolded what do you say there was another period when that's Rama Krishna also tested Narendra I think it was something like a month that he kept coming and taco wouldn't look at him wouldn't talk to him or anything and Andre he would just come and bow down and stay for a while maybe go talk to hazra come back but he kept coming so one day Tucker asked him why do you keep coming I don't even look at you and he said I don't come so you'll be nice and sweet and talk to me I come to see you because I love you taku was very happy he said I was just testing you so he who is one's own will not be angry even scolded what do you say em that is true sir mastered Narendra is perfect from his very birth he is devoted to the ideal of the formless god am smiling whenever he comes here he brings along great excitement it's ramakrishna smiled and said yes excitement indeed the following day was Tuesday the ekadashi day of the lunar fortnite it was 11 o'clock in the morning and the master had not yet taken his Meal m rakal and other devotees were sitting in the Master's room Master to m one should fast on the 11th day of the lunar fortnight akadashi that purifies the mind and helps one to develop love of God isn't that so M yes sir Master but you may take milk and puffed rice don't you think so yeah I was so surprised when I first found out what it meant to fast especially I don't know about the rest of India but especially in Bengal you can fill your stomach with that type of fast mostly you can take rice and then there may be other things that you can't take but eating Luchi and fruit and all sorts of things also consider the type of fish when when I first read talk was one of his analogies is he talks about the mother-in-law and the daughter-in-law observing the fast uh separately on the same day even though it's good I was thinking what's the difference they're not eating anything but it turns out observing the fast means that you're still preparing some things and eating some things so Taco was never never one to press this idea of that type of austerity in fact he used to tell women that women deputies that he didn't like to see them come fasting that it hurt him a little bit he didn't and if if the mind was only thinking about food then it's not such a helpful thing otherwise a little bit of of self-control and everything is good to be able to be able to do that on special days to do that type of fasting and Tucker told them on another occasion also that he should observe this ecology so at least in his case Tucker recommended that we're in a new chapter chapter 18 and reduction is for part two now why it's broken down into part one and part two after M has been there already for uh about 12 days I'm not exactly sure but that's the way that uh he arranged the chapters so now it's December 26 1885. so uh on 25th we don't have anything the list list the entry was on the 24th I think oh that's interesting okay we'll have to find out what what huh yeah sometimes it'll it'll it'll be skipped sometimes you'll be put in some other place but for those who don't know what's happening one of our devotees is following along in the Bengali and there is an entry for the 25th how much is it is it just a few lines okay so it may not be anything of great significance and yeah this is a page 365 and reduction is for part 2 chapter 18 December 26 1883. it's ramakrishna accompanied by manilal Malik M and several other devotees was in a carriage on his way to rahm's New Garden this is ramchandra datta this uh this garden house is something that uh Rahm had had purchased and and build up and everything during tuckworth lifetime this is the first time that ramakrishna is going there uh this isn't a place called Concord gachi and we know it as yoga The Garden of yoga it's a very very significant place in our order that taco went many times and uh a good portion of his relics are interred there and the property it's one of our big centers many of the vice presidents of the order stated there was a tradition for a long time that at least one of the vice presidents would stay there as the head of that Center and uh is it really one of the great pilgrimage places we have I wanted we've probably done it before but I wanted to go through a little bit of of the biography of ram Chandra because he plays a very significant role he's he's mentioned many many times in the gospel Tupperware uh with a very uh he was very beloved to sarama Krishna and sarama Krishna was really everything to him he was one of the the early ones outside of the of course the pundit too came earlier but of the later devotees to Proclaim shirami Krishna as in Avatar so let me read just a little bit he came from a very devout division of a family uh at the beginning of his life as a result of it's still a lot of intellectual types of thinking he became a very logical person but uh atheist gnostic so we find it then with many of them that before they came to shramakrishna they had no faith or some hidden type of Faith but nothing at least intellectually uh agnostic we can say then suddenly uh one of his daughters died and this was the beginning of his uh search into the real meaning of life was that mean yeah cousin on the mother's side or something yeah so the cousin on the mother's side and it was with him that he first went to dakshineswar this is in 1879 in order to cease ramakrishna they all felt that this would help him get over his uh his grief if he went there and as soon as he saw him he felt some peace at heart and he began to go very often and uh soon began to look upon him as the objective is worship we can say very beloved to him and takur went to his house and uh anyhow as a result of all of this he underwent a great change in his life and uh they went together to oh the two of them started proclaiming him to be an avatar and even give lectures during talk with lifetime they would speak publicly they would speak publicly about him as an avatar Taco would get annoyed sometimes is this but anyhow they would do that and during sarama krishna's lifetime he wrote several things he wrote it actually one of the early biographies of Swami Krishna and he wrote a book about the teachings of Swami Krishna and he published a monthly magazine so we did a lot of things and then with with the tacos uh permission or if it was Grace then he bought this garden house which we know as Joker Dan and uh Taco of course went there and after giving up his body then this one deer the temple was established there and most most of you know the story that after talk was passing away when the relics were there they didn't know what to do with it that the householder deputies who were all a little older than the future monastic disciples they all agreed this ROM said we'll keep the relics there at the uh this Contra gachi his garden house there and the young boys especially Narendra they said but taku told me that wherever you place me carry me on your shoulders that's where I'll stay so they had this big dilemma what to do they didn't want to see it buried there they wanted the relics to be at the be able to be kept at the future monastery of the of the order so secretly they removed the actually the greater portion of it and it wasn't just householders versus the monks because uh M was also involved in I think they kept it above around Bose's house at some time and then later of course that was called the aparama that was used for worship the terms of initiation then with the bellarmat it was installed but a good portion there of tacos relics the ashes and everything are still that is congregachi and he passed away in 1899 on 17th in January so that Ram Chandra doesn't mention it here but he was a relative of Narendra the same that the family I don't know how close it was maybe not sure what the relationship was but they were definitely relatives okay so that's Ram so the garden which Aram had recently purchased was next to surendras this was a very common thing in those days people with a little bit of money this we know with jodu Malik he had his house in Kolkata and he had his garden house right at the south southern entrance to the dakshineswar temple the surrender also did the same thing so then Ram did it also they were kind of you could say outlying suburbs of Kolkata at that time these areas ramadur the master as an incarnation of God he visited sarama Krishna frequently adducts in this world Manila was a member of the Brahma samaj the brahmos do not believe in Divine incarnations many things they didn't care too much about they didn't like the guru worship with Guru they didn't like all these gods and goddesses uh they didn't like any type of image worship and uh extreme non-dualism also they didn't like I am he they worshiped formless god with loving attributes a little bit they they felt it was the upanishadic ideal and kind of looking upon God his father a little bit of a Christian idea a little bit of the upanishadic ideal without this this this real Oneness Master to money log in order to meditate on God once you try at first to think of him as free from upatis limitations no we know takur when he spoke to individuals he would speak to them knowing what would be helpful for them and knowing what their spiritual ideal was and looking at it from their point of view and at the same time if he felt that there was anything lacking he would try to correct it so he did two things some sometimes he would encourage them along to follow that same spiritual ideal and if he felt that they were too one-sided or they were missing something then he would also try to fill that in correct that a little bit so here he's saying at first I want to try now is is this so that we'll realize how difficult it is or is it that it'll be a good helpful way to begin meditation on God with form is not clear here but do we know uh many many of the gurus of our order will ask us to meditate on God a formless aspect of God you know like the ocean and then see that forms the waves of some Divine form something like that different techniques of the entering into this meditation on God with form and you know he says in order to meditate on God once you try it first to think of him as free from uphad these limitations God is beyond who parties so this is this is not our imagination to try to think of God free from our parties it's it's it's the truth if we want to think of it that way we're not saying that just imagine this he's trying he's saying look at that aspect of God that this is the Transcendent aspect of the near Guna Brahmin God is beyond new parties he is beyond speech and mind but it is very difficult to achieve perfection in this form of meditation so he's always telling the brahmos that what you're doing is good but it's a little one-sided and it's a little dry and it's difficult this this idea of worship of the infinite the near Guna Brahman is difficult goes back to the uh Gita and other texts you get to the very strong we know in our chapter 12 that Glacier that is just it's more difficult to do and uh it's only for those who have a great deal of renunciation non-attachment to the world uh not much the ambition to do anything in the world other than God realization it's really traditionally it was for the Sawtooth and on only those certain types of sados that could really really bold and heroic that can live under a tree and not care for anything otherwise we we accept this Guyana yoga and try to incorporate it we try to have a little bit of a nice integration of all the different yogas we're talking about here this exclusive following of Ghana yogas very difficult thing but it is easy to meditate on an Incarnation God born as man now easy in the sense that we have something to focus the mind on if we sit and try to to focus the mind on that which is formless then uh the mind is nothing to hold on to unless we use some type of symbol we think of that their sky or the ocean something like that but if we're if we're thinking of it Incarnation Avatar and then especially in the case of ceramic Christiana holy mother we have their photographs and everything we have their words so relatively easy I think about meditation is easy but relatively you see yes God in man the body is a mere covering it is like a lantern with a light burning inside or like a glass case in which one sees precious things foreign so this is taking place while they're in the carriage this this is all the M records of this little conversation arriving at the Garden the master got out of the carriage and accompanied RAM and the other other devotees to the sacred Tulsi Grove one of the things for advice to the family so one of the things that he did there's a little Pond there and there's a little Tulsi Grove this is considered a very sacred thing especially in vaishnavi families that Tucker liked all these things also he was very very Charmed when he went to this Concord garage house standing near it he said ah how nice it is a fine place you can easily meditate on God here SRI ramakrishna sat down in the house which stood to the south of the lake Rahm offered him a plate of fruit and sweets which he enjoyed with the devotees after a short time he went around the garden so this is the first time there he's going for to see everything there next the SRI ramakrishna proceeded toward surrender's Garden I've never been there I don't know if it's still there is it there not there don't know but apparently it was just right next to that neighboring property He Walked on foot a little distance and saw a sadhu sitting on the couch under a tree at once he went up to the holy man and joyfully began the conversation with him Master to which order of monks do you belong have you any title giddy Puri or the like in monastic traditions we have the different some Paradise there are they talk about four main some paradise and division of a tradition and then the shankara's sampradaya is all different these These are uh traditions where not not only the acharya who founded it the tradition that goes to him they'll trace it back to some Divine source they'll take it back to the Divine mother herself uh shankaracharya they take it back to the tatreya I think so so there's some tradition like that within the shankaracharyas there are ten different uh monastic Traditions there and they all have a different last name gidi Puri like that so he's asking about that uh we we're Puris because of total body so and each one of these has its own one of the four matters that's uh that's considered home base somehow so we belong there shouldn't Getty right and the Puri sample which is part of the tsunami uh shankaracharya this is this is really a kind of courtesy they meet among very often they'll they won't ask about uh where were you born and anything what was your primonesic life nothing like that but they can ask what is your song what what do you belong to so I do people call me aparama Hamsa no he's not bragging or anything but this will be also uh maybe not an official type of some reliable but it means free from all of these uh different outer marks of the thoughtu this is that way it doesn't even have to wear Garrow if he doesn't want to it doesn't have to have any marks on the forehead or do any of those rituals or anything really a very free type ever considered very high type generally they'll also not be very ritualistic not be very dualistic so suramakrishna is is assuming that he's a real gyani Yogi master that is good I am Shiva that it's a good attitude but I must tell you something else now this is what I said before he'll he'll uh Inspire him yes this is a very good attitude but don't be too one-sided but I must tell you something else the process of creation preservation and destruction that is going on day in day and night is due to Shakti the power of God so there'll be some and then ghanis who don't care too much for this idea of Shakti if they have to explain this the creation of the universe they'll say that it's uh due to Maya some false reading not exactly real not completely unreal but they'll have their own type of interpretation and surama Krishna for him he felt that the easiest and maybe best way to understand this is in terms of Shakti that there's a power within Brahman that at least this power to create the universe and this power to dwell within the universe to pervade the universe and then with the draw the universe upholded and pervaded to enter into everything but also be the ground of everything the Shakti so he liked this this idea we were talking about this the other day this we we call this a shakta philosophy but I don't know that there's any real uh authoritative text or authoritative commentary anything comparable to what we have with these other with these commentaries on Brahma Sutra and upanishads and Gita and anything thank you probably some of the tantras but uh automatically that doesn't have the same Authority uh in this in The Vedic tradition it has to go back to the Shruti for it to be for the very Orthodox people to consider it authoritative is to to to be considered a real sampradaya you have to have a commentary on on the pristana the punished judge they will they will just ask the uh chaitanya if he has one at all this uh goswami and everything they trace everything back to the mahavata and then try to show the bhagavadas it's considered the fifth Vader so they also they'll try to tie it in and then later they also have commentaries on the gramasutra and everything but the very Orthodox people won't accept it they'll yeah they'll also do that they'll try to connect they didn't care probably and I also don't know very much about it this is German acharya or uh who they were somebody would have to ask somebody authoritative who can explain it to us please yeah [Music] I don't know the instructive philosophy I mean if if we if we think about it uh this idea of Shakti goes all the way back to ancient idea that even with all the deities brahmanaswati they'll all have their Shakti associated with them this is combination is very ancient it uh we we see in this Mahindra daru and the other archaeological digs this uh images and things of sheep and Shakti this idea so it's a very ancient idea also that everything is seen as a combination of the male and the female Shivan Shakti that idea so I must tell you something else the process of creation preservation and destruction that is going on day and night is due to Shakti the power of God this Primal power and Brahman are one and the same or this is this idea one in the same not not that they're identical but they're inseparable not that we can't understand Shakti is a different substance and attribute or different things but but they're Inseparable we can't have one without the other Shakti cannot exist without Brahman Justice waves cannot exist without water there cannot be an instrumental music without an instrument so we we never find any attribute that's not an attribute of a substance and we never find any substance without an attribute we can have a chair that doesn't have a certain shape and form and color and we will never find a color that's not an attribute of an object even if it's the sky or the ocean or something there's got to be of something so these two things go hand in hand not not that they're identical in the sense that we can't distinguish subject and object but we can't think of even think of one without the other so that means that consciousness and the creative power could not be two separate things they fire and the power to burn that it's conscious if Consciousness alone exists then where does this create power well and hear how how do we understand it if not as uh in hearing within Consciousness itself so Consciousness there has to be the power to project thought or project this this kind of universe something like that so is the only reality who is not getting the full weight of the Bell fruit that we have to understand both belong to the same form and formlessness to the same reality this is the one of the really main teachings if if we have to try to find the philosophy that we can say was drama Christian's philosophy this is the closest that we can come to I think otherwise he accepts everything he likes all of them all the paths but this seems to be the one that I he feels most comfortable with at least as long as God keeps us in his relative world so long do we feel that there are two Shivan Shakti that there's this see her in the scene there there's uh purushi that will make that type of Distinction and also that there'll be distinction or everything between ourselves and other people and if one accepts Shakti one accepted Brahman as well if one is aware of night one is also aware of day so they're not identical in that sense but we can't have one without the other there are two sides of the same coin if one is aware of knowledge one is also aware of ignorance but there is another state in which God reveals to his devotee that Brahman is beyond both knowledge and ignorance it cannot be described in words what exists exists so the difference between ramakrishna and many dualistic devotional teachers is that he equally accepts and not only does he accept the truth that Disney are going to Brahman but that everything ends in that everything ends in Oneness his point is what is the easiest way to win to reach that to get to the roof what latter is easiest latter or do we want to just climb a rope most of us can't do that we're not strong enough so he's still he's talking to this uh this satu he's still talking to him trying to uh see he's never met him he hasn't asked him what is your spiritual idea all the authorities are part of Amazon so he Taco didn't have to ask all of these questions he he could sense by seeing a person so he's he said uh somehow he must know that this isn't ideal and really the tattoos at that time aside from the these vaishnabisadhus in Bengal who were part of this chaitanya movement he's right agnis other than that from the shankaracharya tradition they were mostly these non-dualists staunch non-dualists so he's saying yeah that's fine that I I also accept that but you have to accept a relative as well as the absolute Niti and Leela that was one of the things that that's why he he was so broad-minded and he didn't see anything from a limited point of view so everything from every angle nitya equally real that Transcendent a reality and that the imminent uh God dwelling within everything and manifesting is everything after a pleasant conversation with the sadhu the master returned to the carriage the holy man walking with him SRI ramakrishna looked upon him as a friend of long acquaintance and they walked armed and armed now this is this is a very interesting thing that uh there's a certain Bond among uh those who renounce everything we've met different monastic Traditions even in among different religions I've seen this these Interfaith conferences and things that if if we meet monks from other traditions we fill a bond with them some somehow we know that they've renounced everything whole life is is devoted to the ideal we feel some type of closeness with them if we're if we're traveling in India and we see a sadhu and we're in garoa and we find that always a markotheramic Christian order a certain special we we feel something with all monks but a certain special feeling closeness so takuram of course he loved everyone filled wonders with everybody meeting another sadhu he feels some very special bond they they form friendship so quickly he invites from the dark Genesis or he comes later and everything yes ramakrishna looked upon him as a friend of long acquaintance and they walked arm in arm the master arrived at surendra's Garden the very first thing he talked about was the sadhu Master now the sadhu he's just under the tree he doesn't live there he probably hasn't been invited in those days probably today in some parts of India if sadhu came and there was a little cut set up under a tree they would go there they could stay there uh very often saw those would stay in somebody's garden and they'd have a garden house or something like that and people would be happy they wouldn't ask questions not everybody of course but uh so it's very interesting there not that he's invited inside to the house or anything like that but also not kicked out so you're just staying there maybe he just he'll just wander away another day and look for another tree to sleep under God they just wander in the sky that roof the grass they bid foreign there's a line in the song to the effect that a man cannot recognize a holy person unless he is Holy himself unless one is simple one won't recognize the simple one one of the names of God the simple one the sadhu believes in God without form probably they had a longer conversation together and and probably didn't hear everything also that is good see he's not criticizing him that is good God is both formless and endowed with form he has many things more now the form this was the first thing that the end when first and first heard that he said these are two contradictory things How can there be form and formlessness at the same time but I like this example Taqua says what is Brahman like Brahman is like water huh the water never comes without a form but it's never restricted by a form so it's formless even when it's in a cup and has a certain form it's still formless in essence in nature you remove that cup and it just goes and Spills out and everything if it really had that form it would remain with that form so the essence of it is formless but it takes every any form this is the house ramakrishna his understanding of the environment will take any form and whatever color we want to die that'll take that dye for us God is both formless and endowed with form he has many more things the absolute and the relative the absolute and the relative belong to one and the same reality so when we talk about ishwara this is Creator we talk about Brahman there are not two different things they're one of the same when we talk about Virat there's a whole universe a manifestation of the same infinite power that same Brahman what is beyond speech in mind is Born In the Flesh assuming various forms and engaging in various activities from that one have sprung Om Shiva Om Kali and om Krishna suppose the Master of the House has sent out a small boy of the family to invite people to a feast or look on the boy with great fondness and affection because he is the son or grandson of a prominent man so this Avatar that we understand this Avatar is kind of God's representative on Earth so somehow we don't have to have any very clear understanding of how it works now other how is it different that Divine manifestation into ramakrishna and then God dwelling within all beings beyond our ability to fully comprehend how that works and how that happens but to have that faith and to recognize the difference between these great souls and ordinary Souls it's enough we don't have to know the process by which it takes place and everything uh in order to get the benefit from it because the the life of uh Avatar and of course for us the life is from a Christian and holy mother the the Divine qualities we see in them are more than we can imagine even and talk question is by worshiping the Avatar we're worshiping God Swami swanse he used to say that Avatar is as good as God he had a very simple way of putting things as good as God that means don't bother too much don't make a big distinction you you're meditating on the charama Krishna on Krishna and Rama is it different for meditating on Shiva or Durga is that different from meditating on the near Guna Brahman saguna Brahman we're we're trying to fix our minds on on divinity and that's enough it'll accomplish the same goal Thursday December 27th 1883 so that's the end of that day we have a new day the temple Garden so now they're back in dakshineswar what's filled with the Swede music of the Dawn service which mingled with the morning Melody from the nahabad leaving his bed she Rama Krishna chanted the names of God in Sweet Tones then he bowed before the pictures of the different deities in his room and went to the West Port to salute the Ganges English some of the devotees had spent the night at the temple Garden who had spent the night at the temple Garden came to the Master's room and bowed before him yeah when they spend the night at the temple Garden some may sleep inside of his room some under Veranda there are different porch areas that they can just set up beds anywhere very informal type of thing spread out a mat and that's that's your bed put a blanket down whatever and that's your bed Raquel was staying with the master and baburam had come the previous evening these were the two of course future Swami brahmananda and Swami premananda these were the two that stayed with ramakrishna most often at that time along with LA tu meraj he also this time was more or less there permanently occasionally probably he went back to rahm's house to run errands and things but mostly staying at that time positive was there who else was there or ramlal would have been there at that time other Temple workers of course M had been staying there two weeks so this is now two solid weeks that em is staying spending every day and every night with ramakrishna the only time that he did that the induction is for the long period surrounded ceramic Krishna said to him I've been invited to ishan's this morning baburam will accompany me and you too and made ready to go with the master now the ishan had just met ramakrishna I think the same year it's amazing how close they became in such a short period of time how many times he went to ishan's house not as many as mother of the house but still and and how often ishan came and how they had such a close-loving relationship and uh I mentioned last time that a taco is a little tough on him and uh trying so hard to get this big job and everything but I talk we loved him very much it was really a wonderful wonderful devotee died young also at eight o'clock The Carriage hired for the master stood waiting in front of the Norman on all sides plants and trees were in flower and the river sparkled in the sunlight of the bright Winters a day then Master bowed once more before the pictures then still chanting the name of the Divine mother he got into the carriage followed by m and baburam the devotees took with them sarama krishna's Woolen shawl Woolen cap and small bag of spices SRI ramakrishna was very happy during the trip and enjoyed it like a child about nine o'clock The Carriage stopped at the door of ishan's house ishan and his relatives agree to the master and led them to the parlor on the first floor was introduced to suramakrishna the young man practiced law at alipur he had been a brilliant student having having stood first in two of the University examinations but he was extremely modest this seems like the first time that ramakrishna is meeting him because he's asking questions and everything but it also seems that he'd liked him very much and he saw the very high qualified person highly qualified person to Sharice what is your profession I'm practicing law at alipur Master 2m for for such a man to be a lawyer now there's two things here one for such a man that means that he sees that uh he's a good person what what he sees we don't know but that some High Caliber qualified person that's number one number two all right sravakrishna had a certain understanding about lawyers and doctors lawyers and doctors that doctors they made their living off the sickness of other people and if he felt that they were making excessive process the uh because of the illness of others and he said if if they're doing it out of a spirit of service and not charging too much money then it's a wonderful thing but if they're doing it become rich huh that way yeah some people will say well my child wants to be a doctor please but something that will be successful so I think with the holy mother said how can I do that that means that I'm praying for people to be sick anyhow with lawyers also the idea is that somebody may be guilty of something and you have to try to prove that he's innocent so how can one practice truthfulness and everything and involved in lawsuits in in the during tuckworth's time for some reason they were lawsuits already left everyone was engaged in lawsuits huh yeah so uh mostly just to get money so Taco didn't have a very high opinion of lawyers now if anyone out there is listening who's a lawyer that if you know how many good lawyers there are who who really defend uh people who need someone to help them in the civil rights laws or so many different things that I'm sure he would appreciate that also for such a man to be a lawyer to shri's well have you any questions to ask perhaps you want to know how to live unattached in the world isn't that so and now how does Kaku know what he wants to ask huh he do these things that it was a gift some some special power not a psychic power but just he could he would say he could see the insides of a person the way we could see the inside of a glass case we can see you know the the China that's kept there in the cabinet and everything he had that that ability Charice under the pressure of Duties people do many unrighteous things in the world further some are engaged in good work and some in evil is this due to their actions in previous births is that why they act this way now srirama Christian is usually pretty good at answering questions huh every once in a while he won't answer the question exactly you know maybe he'll know that that's not really the question that you want that you're hiding something a little bit or that's really not so important so he won't waste his time too much so it's very interesting here he doesn't exactly answer the question but he gives a beautiful answer probably what is most helpful master how long should a man perform his duties see nothing to do with the Christian now one thing is probably in his mind he's saying you worry about yourself don't worry about what other people are doing too much that could be part of what he's thinking we can only guess but anyhow his answer is interesting how long should a man perform his duties now this is can probably a young man not that he's ready to retire or do anything like that but chocolate must see something in him he must really feel this is someone qualified to lead a a good spiritual life who should even now not get too entangled in things that's in his duties a little bit as long as he has not attained God duties drop away after the realization of God then one goes beyond Good and Evil the flower drops off as soon as the fruit appears the flower serves the purpose of begetting the fruit how long should a devotee perform daily devotions such as the Sandhya this was a very common example for takur because he saw this many times devotees would come to him and if they were Brandon especially they would say oh please excuse us now sir we have to go and do our son yeah the sun would go down at that time and sometimes he would say oh because here he's sitting there talking they can have his company which is more important sometimes he would say is not so important uh other times I mean he knew what was everyone was was fit for but it was a common theme that really stood for uh too much of ritual because I don't know all the rituals but uh those who do it uh can take a long time to do all these rituals and things and then repeating Gayatri some will go uh even go chest deep in the ganga with just looking at the sun ahead and do it at that time I do know some deal I'm gonna take a long time to do yeah so it's a big thing so the taco didn't emphasize his rituals so much how long should a devotee perform daily devotions such as the Sandhya as long as his hair does not stand on the end and his eyes do not shed tears at the name of God yeah so he's not yeah there must be some in between also that see because Jose you can give up this San Diego don't give up Gayatri then you can give up Gayatri and just to home then you can give up by the time we're ready to give up home then we have to have the hair standing on it but but it'll be a gradual thing as as we go a little deeper in spiritual life then we could lessen the rituals accordingly that way these things indicate that the devotee has realized God so he's not saying continue with all of these things until you realize God but once someone realizes God these four things fall off completely absolutely unnecessary otherwise there's some value to these things but he says let this this long ritualistic thing and let that just be merged and just repetition of gaiety that's enough and then if you really go deep in that or repeat home that's enough that'll be a very final High stage there's always a question many of the monks who join uh the Brahmin Voice who were initiated with the Gayatri and everything and very often they after taking initiation or even rheumatoid after taking initiation should we continue with this Gayatri and generally I think they're told yeah there's no harm we can continue with that huh this is your family tradition and everything after Sunny asked a different story but of course during the the four years of ramacharia the part part of the brahmacharya ceremony is upanayana is getting the sacred thread is is getting Gayatri Mantra and we have to do it for those those years until we take the sunny outside yeah yeah without doing all the rituals of sandhyavandra but reputation of Gayatri Mantra but some before brahmacharya before getting that who have taken Gayatri initiation as a child or have the sacred threat and everything they they asked that question should we continue to do it so these the hair standing on the end shedding tears these indicate that the devotee has realized God from these from these one knows that he is attained pure love of God realizing God when goes beyond virtue and voice Dharma that doesn't mean we can do bad things it means that whatever we do will be good that we don't have to consider these things can also mean what we find in the scriptures that we have to do this we can't do that we go beyond this scriptural injunction then Tucker sings the song right about my head says Prasad before desire and Liberation knowing the secret that Kali has won with the highest Raman I have discarded once for all both righteousness and sin the more you advance toward God the less he will give you worldly duties to perform so the question was about uh people doing bad things and everything and tuckworth is really telling him don't worry too much about that but you'll see that uh what you think is your duty and your obligation all of these things that uh you'll realize that the main duty and obligation is is God realization these other things will start to gradually fall off it is extremely difficult to proceed toward God while leading the life of the householder Master why so what about the yoga of practice now it's extremely difficult to proceed toward God that we can all agree but while leading the life of the householder this is a Tucker's Point even leading the life of a householder everybody can find time to do the spiritual practice and this yoga of practice of Piasa yoga this we all have to do we have to just keep trying to improve our concentration and and devotion and change the samskadas through constant practice at kamarpukur I've seen the women of the carpenter family selling flattened rice let me tell you how alert they are while doing their business the pestle of the Husky machine that flattens the Patty constantly falls into the hole of the mortar the woman turns the Patty in the hole with one hand and with the other holds her baby in her lap as she nurses it in the meantime customers arrive the machine goes on pounding the Patty and she carries on her Bargains with the customers she says to them okay the few pennies you owe me before you take anything more you see she has all these things to do at the same time he's talking about all the worldly duties that householders have nurse the baby turn the Patty as the peso pounds it take the flattened rice out of the hole and talk to the buyers this is called The Yoga of practice 15 parts of her mind out of 16 or fixed on the pestle of the husking machine lest it should pound her hand that means we can keep what is that 15 16. there's more than 75 percent sometimes we hear 75 percent we can keep that that amount of the mind on God and our spiritual practice with the little remaining concentration if if it's concentrated we can do all of our worldly duties with only one part of her mind she nurses the baby and talks to the buyers likewise he who leads the life of a householder should devote 15 parts of his mind to God otherwise he will face ruin and fall into the clutches of death he should perform the duties of the world with only one part of his mind okay then it goes on we'll stop here hmm full stop yeah yeah so this was the way they they would do percentages out of Sixteen fifty percent and marijuana is 75 percent so this Panorama 15 16ths so they didn't do things with 10 20 30 if they did it out just the way they did it foreign [Music] who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of our worship [Music] peace peace peace
