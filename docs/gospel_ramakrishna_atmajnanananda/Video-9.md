the work otamatone kept even a copy very idiot and gozman shavon shavon among golems Shri Mata item movie Vernon T hurry dad Takata meritum your words are like nectar top dodgy venom bringing life to those who were scorched with the mystery of the world Kabir a dictum praised by poets column is sharp 'him they put an end to sin saravana Mangalam auspicious to hear srimad artem magnificent and exalted who we gone untii a hoodie doubt you know those who will spread these words throughout the world or the greatest benefactors of mankind this of course is the verse that is chanted before study of the gospel of ramakrishna from the go fajita address to Shri Krishna and chose these words to be addressed to Shri Krishna as well okay last time for those who were following in the book we stopped on page 94 this is the chapter in the company of devotees and the date is April 2nd 1882 ceramic Krishna was sitting in the drawing room of Kashyap to Anderson's house in Calcutta it was five o'clock in the afternoon when acacia was told of his arrival he came to the drawing-room dressed to go out for he was about to call on a sick friend now we cancelled his plan the master said to him you have so many things to attend to besides you have to edit a newspaper you have no time to come to Dakshina Shore so I have come to see you when I heard of your illness I vowed green coconut and sugar to the divine mother for your recovery I said to her mother if something happens the Keysha with whom shall I talk in Calcutta now because kay Schwab plays such an important role in the divine play of Shri Ramakrishna I wanted to go to the ceramic Krishna the great master this is we can say the companion text to the gospel of ramakrishna it's a biography but much more than a biography because it explains all of the intricate philosophy and and all of the high levels of devotion all of the very subtle truths of spiritual life that we learn about through Ramakrishna and it was written by Swami Chidananda who was a God realized soul of a very very high order because he said that he himself had direct and experience of the different states that he's writing about and the great master so that means that he also not not that he's comparing himself to Shri Krishna but he knows what he's talking about we can say that much at least and this was written while he was looking after the holy mother at the ODE votin and they had a debt to pay off this was the house that they had made for a holy mother so she would have her own place to live in when she was in Calcutta when she was not in in Jordan Bharti and so it served a dual purpose this brought in some income to pay off the debt and there was a great need for a very authentic biography life of Shri Rama Krishna others had come out smaller things some written by people who didn't have first-hand information there was a doubt and a fear that all sorts of miraculous stories would come out and legendary things that weren't very accurate so he felt it was very important swami vivekananda who would passed away much earlier also felt it was very important that the life of ceramic be presented to the public in a very clear straightforward unadorned fashion just the truth as it was so we have as a result of that this wonderful book it was translated originally by Swami jagadananda ji a disciple of Holy Mother and more recently by Swami Chidananda ji and that's also available to us under the name Sri Ramakrishna the divine play and the advantage to his translation is that the original Swami shattered and eroded in very long complicated sentences and Swami Shaitan and he broke it down into a more readable way and he'll both are very good this is from the original translation and yes so we have some understanding about this very sweet relationship between K shamans Ramakrishna because K Shaw was world-renowned that doesn't mean he was known in every household but there were people who looked upon him as as the rising star and spirituality in Calcutta of the day and he had traveled to England he had did meet the Queen so he was really very well known so this is from the great master page 4:35 an important event took place in the master's life by the will of the Divine Mother a year before his mother passed away in 1875 there arose a desire in the master's mind to meet cache of gender ascend the leader of the Brahmo Samaj of India while the master was in ecstasy he received the direction of the universal mother in this matter and knowing that k shot with his disciples was then engaged in spiritual practices at joy Gopal sans garden house in Bulgaria a few miles to the north of Calcutta he went there with every door and it says in brackets from whom we have this information in captain Vishwanatha carriage and reached there about 1:00 p.m. the master wore that day a piece of red bordered cloth the lower extremity of its front tucked in fold was thrown up over his left shoulder and it was swinging behind his back this is what we know from all of the pictures that we've seen I I spent I've spent quite a bit of time in India and in Calcutta and only once do I remember seeing this I remember so clearly that I saw somebody walking down the street the same way with this is they call it a duty the way it's tied and thrown over his shoulder and I just thought it was so interesting to see that and yeah it goes on that free toys generally would go and meet somebody first either that or he would go first to introduce his uncle that means Yama Krishna so sometimes a talker would send somebody and say let me he wants to meet a pundit you say let me know if the pundit has any spirituality does he have any humility if he's if it's if there's no renunciation and dispassion here was no interest in seeing him but if he found that pundit had all these other qualities then he was very interested he would go anywhere he loved to meet holy people or people well versed in the scriptures Vidyasagar will see so many people that he would would go and in those days you know you didn't just show up and there will be times when there was great embarrassment because he liked to just show up and this happened on a couple of occasions he would ask mother Babu can you take me here can you take me there so in this case he sent every toy to meet them and usually this is what every toy would do he would say I've come with my uncle he's heard that the case job likes to think about God he also likes that he'd like to meet him is it okay if you so I think they have chuckled and because they saw him and he would say my uglies a great lover of God he wouldn't say too much else that he's a man of samadhi that he's taken sanyaasi he wouldn't say or all of these things so taqwa came he showed up and they weren't terribly impressed he dressed like an ordinary person villager actually and we know he spoke a little bit of a village Bengali and had a slight stammer so they weren't very impressed Taku came deck a ship and it said is it true gentleman that you all have the vision of God I have a desire to know the nature of that vision that is why I have come to you so this is how we raised the topic perfect humility and simplicity and possibly a little exaggerated humility and simplicity because he wanted to see if they could judge him and he wanted to let them feel free to say whatever they wanted to then so there was a short conversation then Tucker sang and this is what very often what happened he would sing and then of course he would go into ecstasy so he's saying that the song cage on a collie come on two songs it comes up many times in the gospel who knows of what mother Kali is like you will not get her vision through the study of the six darkness you won't get her darson through the any of the six of darkness and immediately he went it's her Auntie now it says I'm reading again when they saw that state of ecstasy of the master K Schwab and others did not regard it as a high spiritual State they thought it was mere feigning or was due to a derangement of the brain with the view to bringing him back to normal consciousness corridor now began uh during the Pranava ohm front of a-- into his ears at this his face brightened up with a sweet smile thus regaining partial consciousness the master now went on explaining profound spiritual matters in so simple a language with the help of common examples everything we find in the house that all were charmed and sat looking steadfastly at his face nobody noticed that the time for bath and meal was long past and imperceptibly the hour for the next prayer was almost come seeing that mood of theirs the master said if any other animal comes to a herd of cattle they go forward to Gore it but if a cow comes they lick its body and it is there's our case is just the same today then see now gradually we're saying that case of is starting to understand somebody specialist come the others were slow to understand then talk were made of a funny statement to them he said Keysha I see that your tail has dropped off not what to make of it of a statement like that so again half of them thought that he was interesting character the obviously a spiritual person but a little bit cracked in the head just make a statement like that so they none of them really understood and K Shah now he said don't be so fast to judge let's see what he really meant by that and it says the others looked annoyed when the master charmed them all by explaining its significance to them look here he said as long as the tadpole has its tail it lives only in water and cannot come up on land but when the tail drops off it can live on land as well as in water even so as long as a man has the tail of ignorance he can live in the water of the world only but when that tail falls off he can as freely move about in the world as in satchitananda existence knowledge to bless your mind ok shop has now attained that state in which you can live in the world as also in such hidden on the existence knowledge bliss the Masters spent a long time discussing various topics like this and came back to Dakshina swore that day now that goes on it's a long section will find that oops there's so so much mention of acacia and of the case of disciples also in the life of Ramakrishna so I mentioned last time what an important role they played in making talk were known to the the people of Kolkata of the day so we see here that Keysha was was ill and he was only this is 82 he passed away in 84 I believe so only two more years and talk will of discussing spiritual matters with him there were a few people like that Israelis know each other and there were a few outside of his real inner circle that he just enjoyed their company and we find on several occasions some reference to at takua making some more offering or pledging to offer something this was this was a procedure that was done in those days probably still today that and rather than going to the temple telling the divine mother mother I brought all of these offerings to you please see the Acacia was okay you go and say mother first you make him okay then I'll give you the offerings so this is what he did there are times when he would ask em to make offerings the house that where I am lived this what is it guru Prasad Chaudhary Lane I think very small Lane in the area called Tonto near near this there's a Tonto Nia Kali temple very close to the m's house and Sri Ramakrishna went there because sri ramakrishna lived not far from Emma's house really when he lived with his brother in Kolkata and for the few years before they went to maybe not few years but the time before they went to the Dutch Danish war and stayed there so he knew that temple and and the priest there he would mention it several times and he would ask him to go there sometimes and make some offerings and do this pledge for the Keysha he used to say casually 50 M dies who will I talk with when I go to Calcutta so he loved this case of so much Sri Ramakrishna's spoke to Pratap this is a prototype madam door these are all characters that play a role in the future he also went to to Chicago for the Parliament of Religions he was very helpful in the beginning and writing something to help publish publicize Ramakrishna but the little jealous of Swamiji and his great success in the Parliament of Religions so cost a little bit of a problem there but talk would like to all of them he recognized that these were in his inner circle disciples that the others were to come but he did have some level of respect for all of them and some really deep affection so Shri Ramakrishna spoke to Pratap and the other brahma devotees m was seated nearby pointing to him and the master said to Keysha will you please ask him why he doesn't come to Dakshina soir anymore now he could have asked him directly but this is another way of getting getting the job done so slightly embarrassed in front of case job because am also had tremendous respect for it for Keyshia we already found out earlier that there was a family relationship through his wife and others and he also used to go to the Brahmo Samaj so that relationship was there ask him why he doesn't come to Dutch channel anymore now this is only April 2nd right so how long could he have stayed away a couple of weeks maybe at that at the most February March he probably came the end of February or beginning of March he came I think four or five times before that so it's not that he's been away a long time but he came so frequently in the beginning and taqwa was so the fond of him he knew that they had a turn of connection relationship so and and he used to say in the beginning it's good to come more often we get that with was it last time with Narendra in the beginning when two lovers meet each other the V&A they meet each other a little more often then continuing again he's talking de queijo but within the hearing of em right in front of him he meaning em repeatedly tells me he has not attached to his wife and children so again he's ribbing him a little bit that probably hasn't come because he wants to be with his wife wife and children M had been paying visits to the master for about a month that's all so sarama Krishna had asked em to write to him if his if his coming were delayed so imagine how awkward how close he felt to em and how concerned he was about his welfare he know intuitively that one end came that there was great turmoil in Em's mind and he knew that he had left home and that he was staying with the in-laws and all of these things were known to him so he wasn't had great concerns great concern for the family after and son dies later a tremendous concern for Em's wife who practically went mad so taka really was intimately involved in the family life of many of his disciples we don't think about that so often but he on every level he had that concern bonded Samadhi ie was present will get many references to this pondan Samadhi he was one of the the priests they would have these what they call a priest or minister really they weren't priests the way we understand the temple priests but they were the ones who would conduct the services and do whatever small that puja they did for the Brahmo Samaj mostly they would lead of what they called up asana Hoopa sana was the term they used a little bit like a congregational type of worship that we find in the West Pandit Samadhi he was present the brahma devotees introduced him to sri ramakrishna as a scholar whoa in the Vedas and the other scriptures now Parker was very humorous he's gonna make a great statement that only those who really knew him will understand what he what he means the master said yes I can see and I can see inside him through his eyes as one can see the objects in a room through the glass door now is he's not making any statement whatsoever about him but we can assume from this that he doesn't have a very high opinion of him and that will be borne out later tonight Loki is saying now this trial okiya he was the main songwriter and singer further Brahmo Samaj he probably would led the coup they had their own choir see a lot of this would church influence stuff they had their own choir today look it was the main songwriter but not for long because but rabindranath tagore was at that time probably 22 years old and also it just started writing different songs so naturally of course we know his name and most people don't know the neighbors tyrell okiya but he was one of the BrahMos that taqwa also loved very much and seemingly he had that same respect for Shri Ramakrishna more than some of the others perhaps and a great transformation took place and the types of songs that he wrote one of the songs he wrote this am ia park Walker did a map ago quarry mother make me mad with I love this was written after he met sri ramakrishna if I remember correctly and taqwa loved this song he was very often I asked him to sing that song so the songs were a little bit I don't want to say dry before that but not this ecstatic type of love they say that aqua taught them how to call on God his mother so this that element was added to it also so there's Tara lochia he sang at aqua loved it singing suddenly the master stood up and went into Samadhi repeating the mother's name remember they're in ketchups house now coming down a little to the plane of sense consciousness he danced and sang I drink no ordinary wine but wine of everlasting bliss as I repeat my mother Kali's name it so intoxicates my mind that people take me to be drunk first my guru gives molasses for the making of the wine my longing is the ferment to transform it knowledge the maker of the wine prepares it for me then and when it is done my mind imbibes it from the bottle of the mantra taking the mother's name to make it pure drink of this wine says Ramprasad and the four fruits of life or yours ROM Prasad was talk wars he doesn't say it but we assume a favorite poet songwriter and taka always looked upon him as some type of model role model because his whole life was the divine mother and he had various visions of the divine mother his life is very interesting well many of the songs came out of the different experiences that he had the one that I remember is that he was building a fence one day he was a householder he had a daughter and he was he needed help on the other side so he saw his little daughter had come on the other side and and would hand him things and he would do something and they would work together and then afterwards he went in the house and he saw his daughter there and he thanked her and she said Baba it wasn't me I was inside the whole time so he felt that the divine mother herself had come to to help him with his with his work he built his own Panchavati just as a taqwa did many's dissimilarities the master looked at Kashyap tenderly as if Kashyap were his very own he seemed to fear that Keysha might belong to someone else that is to say that he might become a worldly person looking at him the master saying again we are afraid to speak and yet we are afraid to keep still our minds or other half believed that we are about to lose you possibly he felt that he might pass away also we tell you the secret that we know the secret whereby we ourselves and others with our help have passed through many a time of peril now it all depends on you will will hear talk or sing this song much later in Kashi poor when narendra was there the the the period when taqwa was ill with cancer was a very traumatic period for all of them but especially for that indra later strongly they can endure because he had to deal with this poverty issue with his family his father died earlier and the tremendous burden of trying to find a job which was very difficult in those days to get a job and to to make sure that they had enough food and clothing and everything they were really reduced to poverty instantly overnight when the father had passed away all of the relatives took advantage of the situation it was very terrible situation and during that period he had to study for his exams he was studying to be a lawyer because his father was a lawyer and that was the profession that either he felt he should follow or was he was encouraged to follow and the great burden on his mind because the whole time he wanted to be with Ramakrishna here he stuck with his with books and everything one time he he said he reached such a state where he just threw his books down and ran the whole way to see sri krishna but at the same time he had the tremendous desire to leave everything and to renounce the world and had some slight secret plan we don't know much about it how definite was we know at one time that he did leave and go and pilgrimage to Bulgaria he went with his brother disciples Kali and Tariq as formulators for me waiting on the ends for me a shivananda some little plan that he would just take off and being a be a wandering saw - so Tucker sang the same song and the render knew that it was addressed to him what he meant had both started crying his love of talk or didn't want to seem that under leaf and he knew when there had to stay and take to the license and Yasir but within that circle and be the leader of all the young boys so this is that song we find that Sri Ramakrishna love the the all Ram Prasad songs kamalakanta songs and others the rest address to the Divine Mother but equally so all the songs about this Krishna Leela the Radha and Krishna songs and so many wonderful songs on the life of chaitanya Deva one of the the great things about this caitanya Leela was that there were tremendous songwriters that among his disciples and and the later deputies of of their community so we have a beautiful song - about their life of chaitanya daehwa quoting the last part of the song he said the key shop that is to say when it says now it depends on you renounce everything and call on God he alone is real all house is illusory without the realization of God everything is futile this is the great secret now all else is illusory I made a point of checking the original Bengali on this because there's something very significant on that the language the taqwa uses and most of the time he will not use this illusory generally we take to this Mattia that the famous statement that brahma satyam jagan mithya the ramen alone Israel in this world is mitya illusory it's very very tricky concept and it's taken in so many different ways but generally Sri Ramakrishna will not use that term unless he's saying according to the Gianni's if he if he does it then it's okay otherwise he'll always say uh Nydia so I happen to look it up and this all else is illusory he actually says an idea here it gets translated as as losery so he has three different terms that he uses unlit tea is the one most often and actually therefore terms what is Mattia but that's not the one that he likes then an idiot transitory then sometimes he'll talk about certain asset we discriminate between the real and the unreal and then he'll save us - and of us do that the substance in that which is lacking in substance so generally Sri Ramakrishna did not emphasize the metaphysical question what is the status of this world and whenever he did he always would qualify it according to the Gianni's where the Yanni's like to say this world is unreal like a dream or he would say i don't like to call this world unreal like a dream he wouldn't say that that's not a legitimate philosophical position if one wants to follow it because for him everything is automata thought everything was the path to God realization but he always emphasized this idea that this world is transitory and of us - that there's nothing substantial in it and it's constantly changing there's there's nothing to hold on to and our life is constantly fleeting so he would will always emphasize that and that it will not satisfy us it won't fulfill us the way that this this inner reality can fill this so he alone is real all this is illusory without the realization of God everything is futile this is the great secret the master sat down again and began to converse with the devotees for a while he listened to a piano recital enjoying it like a child I always find this curious but pianos were available because the the British they would they would be sent to India as civil servants and may spend their whole life there so they would send their things over and the pianos and other things and probably they even had piano makers there in Kolkata at that time so for a while he listened to a piano recital enjoying it like a child then he was taken to the inner apartment where he was served with refreshments and the lady saluted him now the inner apartment this was the area where the men were generally not expected to go this was the safe haven for the women the women were with two things one was they were definitely restricted so from that point of view it was a little bit that they were they were held in jail inside but the other was that this is a place they could just be themselves they didn't have to bail themselves or covering themselves or hide themselves they could speak freely and Sri Ramakrishna I would always go whenever he went to a householders home devotees home yeah he would go usually take his meal there where they spend some time just with them we don't have the accounts of that because M wouldn't be there at that time it would be wonderful if we did how he would laugh and joke with them and how they they loved his company and how he loved them otherwise we get it sometimes people think a picture of someone who are only interested in the men and looking upon the women is an obstacle in spiritual life but those who were there I remember one statement it was either yoga and Margo Padma she said we laugh when we read that talk war wouldn't mix with women how closely he mixed with us there's one very nice scene where again I don't remember it could have been yoga and and copolymer I don't don't remember exactly but they were sitting in stalkers room having a nice conversation and laughing and joking and everything and some men devotees came and quickly they hug them hid underneath the bed and they had to stay there for a long time till the men left then she came out and talked her laugh today so he would do that he would go into the what was called the inner apartments and he would use this example this is where God dwells in the inner apartments that's it within the depths of the heart that this is where we have to go Kujo nature until putting he said where do you want to find God you have to search within the depths of your heart that inner apartment so there he was served with refreshments and the ladies saluted him as the master was leaving qdubs house the Brahmo devotees accompanied him respectfully to his carriage this is a week later April 2nd now it's April 9th so we don't have the day but it must be a weekend because now probably a.m. school has started again and he can only come money oh I'm sorry it's a Sunday yeah so it says it's specifically here Sunday April 9th 1882 so one thing talk what we do when the young disciples would come on weekend he would say come some time on a Tuesday or sometime during the week on an auspicious day when the others aren't around so we get of course these these burning words of renunciation here but apparently when it was just the future monastic disciples it was raised to a much higher level even though it was far me frame Ananda or Yogananda preeminent I think who said yes the gospel is nice but it reads like this is some ordinary lectures you should have been there when we was just the disciples themselves not that the message was so different but the emphasis would have been much more on renunciation Shri Ramakrishna was seated with his devotees in the drawing room of pran Krishna mukajee's house and Calcutta we have all of these characters bran Krishna he was the fat Burman huh the motohama tiger had nicknames for all of these people these were all the the devotees not necessarily disciples of Ramakrishna but this this first group before all of his intimate disciples came then we'll see also this kernel vishwanadh so ceramic christian was seated with his devotees in the drawing her with Quran Krishna mukajee's house in Calcutta it was between one and two o'clock in the afternoon since Colonel Vishwanath so this Colonel vishwanadh Upadhyaya it says he was a resident of the Nepalese government in Calcutta and a devotee of the master he was a colonel but taqwa always called him captain I don't know why Colonel vishwanadh lived in that neighborhood the master intended to visit him before going to seek a job at the lily collet cottage this komoku tear this was the place where kind of a garden house where they would all go the BrahMos and have had meetings there sometimes they had their own Hall but they also met there and they also met in different homes of devotees a number of neighbors and other friends of pran Krishna had been invited to meet you Ramakrishna they were all eager to hear his words master glory and his God was God in His glory so he shot and Aishwarya God in his glory the universe is his glory people see his glory and forget everything there's another theme the taqwa they used to say that you see BrahMos they would give their lectures and he would say yeah it's fine but why do you talk about all these how great is this creation and that what wonderful things you've done you know if you go to the garden don't simply go and see the flowers and praise them and everything try to find the gardener it's either one responsible for all of this so God in His glory this universe is its glory people see his glory and forget everything they do not seek God whose glory is the world all seek to enjoy lust and gold but there is too much misery and worry in that this world is like the whirlpool of the beshallach Chi Vishal aqui there's a very small temple if you if you go to visit chakra the birthplace come or poke or then within a couple of few miles there's a very small temple that to the divine mother that is very important because of ceramic Krishna's experience when he was a young boy I don't remember how old he was seven eight nine young boy that all of the ladies of comb or poker there's a lot of family and others who loved him very dearly they were planning to visit the temple make some offering make a little picnic out of it it's a nice walk it was a beautiful day so taqwa went with him a little boy god I went with them and they all had their memory their fried Rice's their eating and everything and suddenly the sky turned black if you've been in India during the rainy season you can see that these dark rain clouds come so so the sky just turned practically black with these these thick dark rain clouds and these beautiful white cranes flew and that seeing the white cranes on the background of the black rain clouds the little boy he went into an ecstatic mood and he fell down and remained unconscious with his Maria all over the ground and everything and it lasted like that for sometime so this Vishal Aki temple and and walking there along that the open field has that other special significance it's near the the river humble Don and you have the river and there's a little Eddy a little whirlpool there that if anyone fell it into it something fell and it would disappear so the talk would use that that illustration very often this world is like the whirlpool of the Vaishali Chi once a boat gets into it there is no hope of its rescue so advanced that we we get drowned in the world we get sucked in this is the thing we get a little bit too close we don't realize that it's so dangerous and the boat gets a little bit too close and next thing we know it's out of sight the habit of can happen very quickly again the world is like a thorny bush you have hardly freed yourself from one set of thorns before you find yourself entangled in another once you enter a labyrinth you find it very difficult to get out living in the world a man becomes seared as it were a devotee then what is the way sir will this was the one question that comes up over and over and over again people here are these wonderful teachings of sri ramakrishna and then they feel a little bit helpless then how do we get out we accepted what we're saying we know it from our own experience we've been scorched in the world enough to know all of this but what is the way for us we're householders we have our responsibilities or duties they're all householders they're so ceramic krishna says prayer and the company of the holy men now we've seen already that taqwa has is his list and company of holy men usually number one solitude usually number two but he juggles the list sometimes prayer is number one here he says prayer first sometimes repeat the name of God is number one but almost always we'll have the company of holy man this seems to be the one that always makes the list solitude is usually there but this for him was the simplest and the easiest and best answer to this question when very came up then what is the way he would say the company of holy men you cannot get rid of an ailment without the help of a physician but it is not enough to be in the company of religious people only for a day you should constantly seek it for the disease has become chronic what is a chronic disease yeah I have a chronic cough is not bad but I can't get rid of it i little phlegm comes up and then X stays same thing same a little bit the same thing a very minor thing did nothing for anybody to worry about but chronic that means that we just can't get rid of it somehow it seems to linger that we think we can take a little medicine we may have a very bad disease we take some medicine we get over it a very small thing a little arthritis rheumatism something that it's become chronic that means that whatever we do it stays with us it becomes our constant companion so he's saying this with the worldliness we haven't noticed it these are the attachments and everything that they don't leave us they get ingrained they become part of us so leg I hae would say rogue leg a I achieved that this disease has become chronic again you can understand the pulse rightly unless you live with the physician moving with him constantly you learn to distinguish between the pulse of phlegm and the pulse of bile and devarti what is the good of a holy company oh so this is this is a very good question so talk to this holy company but how does it work is it some magical thing if we we have the company of a holy man or a holy woman some magical thing that our worldliness will leave us how exactly does it work so Shri Ramakrishna he gives the big secret here it begets yearning for God it begets love of God there are two terms I don't know if these are the exact terms but two terms that talk we use it very often this vyakulata we know we've seen this several times and Anurag o P oculata is this tremendous urgency for God realization and this anguish of heart well we saw as an example of ringing there's a wet towel there's gum cha they're ringing it this felt feel that our heart is like that where they had pushed underwater by the Guru they were gasping for a breath of air well there's an alga and yes the heart is filled with such tremendous love and longing to for union with the beloved that we can't think of anything else the the the level of intensity has to be dialed up tremendously whatever we feel now whatever long and we feel for God realization it has to be increased exponentially if we want to have that type of vision of god this is what taqwa is telling us now how does the holy company he says it begets yearning for God it begets love of God because we see that this holy company means somebody who has gone through that who has had that tremendous longing for God who has a tremendous love of God and who has had that realization of God and we see that that tremendous anguish of heart gets replaced with tremendous joy and a sense of fulfillment and a sense of satisfaction and the feeling that these things of the world this is a worldly attachment that used to be chronic or it disappeared don't have it anymore so if we see that in someone then I if we have some inner stuff in us will feel attracted who feel attracted and will feel yes how can I become like that look at Buddha all he had to do was see a monk walking one day and he said look at that look at the joy look at the contentment I want to be like that I'll do whatever it takes to be like that I left everything behind so this is this is the advantage of a holy company that we have the living example of somebody who has been through that who has gone along this path of spirituality which led to this is very rare Nicolle change of intense longing intense love Allah and who has had that experience so we know it's true we know it can happen and they'll tell us did you also can do it I've gone along that path I know where it ends there's it's not a dead end I know what it ends with the realization so we get tremendous faith that way and there's something about just the mind being lifted up in the presence of these great souls so what is the good of holy company it begets yearning for God it begets love of God nothing whatsoever is achieved in spiritual life without yearning we can do things in a routine fashion and it serves a purpose there's no question about it but compared comparatively the purpose that it serves is very minimal we shouldn't think if we sit for meditation we do a job and the mind is wandering that we've wasted our time something has been accomplished holding mother always gives the example whether you dive in the water you're pushed in the water you get wet both ways so we've repeated the name of God something will come of it but it's it's relatively small compared to what will come from repeating the name of God with concentration and with love if we can do it that way then the results are tremendously greater than if we do it mechanically but this is also the result of practice and the result of grace we shouldn't give it up because in the beginning it's a little mechanical it starts out that way actually sometimes it's the opposite sometimes it starts out beginning of spiritual life with tremendous fervor tremendous longing and this is the taste we want to have that realization and we don't get it then but we after that we have to have that dedication and patience and go on with our spiritual life knowing that that will come back again that will have the realization this is sometimes called the honeymoon period we have that I used to think of this as as in the old days if you if you joined a new bank they may send you a toaster or give you some present or a gift or something then after that no more gifts they start charging you they check that you're right so we then we start taking our dues so sometimes it's the other way in the beginning tremendous fervor but if we don't realize God in the beginning this is the test did we give it up you know and we have to be very steady in routine and that forever will again grow and grow and grow till we get this this real longing for God then we'll get some examples this yearning is like the State of Mind of a man who has someone ill in the family his mind is in a state of perpetual restlessness thinking how the sick person may be cured or again one should feel a yearning for God like the yearning of a man who has lost this job and is wandering from one office to another in search of work now it doesn't sound like a very good example till we think this Narendra what he did how old barefoot really they were reduced to extreme poverty he would really go in the hot Sun walking from one place to another practically begging someone to give him a job he was a young boy he didn't have he hadn't finished as a higher education or anything at that time very difficult to find something but tremendous yearning to get that job because he knew that family was starving and they all depended upon him if he is rejected as at a certain place which has no vacancy he goes there again the next day and inquires is there is there any vacancy today there is another way so remember that the first thing he said was prayer and then the company of holy men now they'll go back to prayer there is another way earnestly praying to God God is our very own now prayer and meditation we tend to think that meditation is somehow higher that it represents more mature sand state stage of spiritual practice actually prayer has many advantages we don't have to have that great concentration of mine and we could speak freely to God we can open up our hearts we can use that emotion so prayer is extremely important talk were emphasized it so much if we go back to our laundry list of things that how to realize God prayer will usually come before meditation not that taqwa doesn't emphasize meditation especially for as those who are to be full-time monastic members meditation is extremely important but this prayer can really open up the heart center in a way that nothing else can we really open up our hearts we are deeper feelings whatever the depth of emotion we have we can speak freely to God internally taqwa would do it the active he would speak out loud he would go to a state of ecstasy and he would pray to the divine mother for our benefit otherwise I he always said keep everything within don't make a show of spirituality the more we make a show of it with the more we lose it it should be something very sacred and private for us so there's another way earnestly praying to God God's our very own we should say to him Oh God what is thy nature reveal thyself to me da cudahy used to use this expression all of the time and Akkad I'll reveal yourself mother revealed yourself I want to have your vision I want to know who you are I want to have that experience thou must show thyself to me for what else has thou created for why else has thou created me some seek devotees once said to me God is full of compassion I said but why should we call him compassionate he is our Creator what is there to be wonder that if he is kind to us parents bring up their children do you call that an act of kindness they must act that way therefore we should force our demands on God he is our father our mother isn't he if the Sun demands its patrimony and gives up food and drink in order to enforce his demand and the parents hand his share over to him three years before the legal time or when the mother demands some pice the child demands some pies from his mother and says over and over again mother give me a couple of pies I beg you on my knees I mean by a party with a six-person then the mother seeing his earnestness and unable to bear it anymore tosses the money to him okay we're gonna stop here and we're gonna go back next time to this this paragraph because there are TOC words understanding of compassion daya there's a very a very subtle thing he uses the term in in in different senses and there's a little bit of a tendency to think that perhaps taqwa didn't care so much for this idea of compassion he criticized the Sikhs you're saying Doyle are you why are you saying he's compassionate that will you say the mother is compassionate to the child if she if she looks after it so slight tendency to think that on the other hand he'll say that this compassion is a minimum the one who has no compassion is not even a human being so and a lot of nice things about this jebadiah compassionate living beings so we'll start with that next time we'll stop here on the bottom of page 96 this is Sunday April 9th 1882 that would be for next Friday and I will close with our closing chance neuron genome determinant open dr. who come her terrific currently he saw avatar incarnation medium term Ramakrishna Marissa we've our heads before sri ramakrishna who is near on even who was perfectly pure newton-metre knows who was the embodiment of compassion for the devotees who was the Lord Himself the worshipful one we bow our heads
