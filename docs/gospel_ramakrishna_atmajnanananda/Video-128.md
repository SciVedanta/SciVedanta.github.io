[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (04/21/2023)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wffIQevVFUk)

foreign Souls they are praised by Poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls Welcome to our class on the gospel of Krishna we're on the chapter rules for householders and monks the day it is March 23rd 1884. and uh it's page 411 and shivrama Krishna has been talking to mostly mahim mahimacharun was uh a householder devotee a little older than you know the younger ones who used to come to him who was very fond of uh path of of knowledge and a little proud of his learning and uh he's all the books that he read and everything but Tucker liked him for some reason and he he was came quite often to shramakrishna wandering monks this is ramakrishna this is part of that long section talking to mahima wandering monks while searching for a sadaborative this is an aiding place where food is supplied free to monks in Beggars yeah we often hear about is amongst having to make their food most of the time it's not really begging their food if you go to these places in other places it's not like they have to go from house to house and door to door and everything that any of these places where sadhus go and stay arrangements are made people Pious and will to do householders if they want to gain to marry it or just do some nice thing that they'll [Music] start these places where sados can stay or where they can take their food so if you if you go to some place like uttar Kashi you'll see around 10 in the morning all the sadhus are out on on the road walking towards there'll be several different ones walking there with their little Tiffin carriers and they'll go and they'll get some very watery doll and some old chapatis some places maybe a little milk uh not too much else but there'll be places like that the Laha family in kamarpukur had had done that a place for wandering sadhus to stay in and take food that's how srirama Krishna made so many of these wandering sautus and learned so much he would would spend as a young boy on all of his free time when he could with with them so much so that they found they got a little nervous one day they dressed them up in the garage and everything and but this is that type of arrangement now this is just to give some context here uh shirami Krishna was talking about the advantages to the householder that sometimes Sawtooth they'll spend all of their time trying to figure out uh where's a good place to get food and uh I myself saw this uh in in rishikesh especially I remember the satus would all get together and say where's a good place today there's someone out of here and somehow and I even it became almost certainly not begging your food places where you go the day before you get a token even so that they could show up with their token and then they'll get their food and everything so others other places very traditional places you would really go from from door to door so I'll do it go from door to door we had have a tradition in our order that at least for three days at the time of Sanya so that we do this go banging and uh there's a rule that you can't take food from more than three places and you can't uh how was it you can go to more than five places so if you go to five places and don't get anything that's it and the first three places you get something then you're done but everyone goes back and shares so it doesn't really matter so these are these these places where the sados can go and get some food sometimes there are big Feasts and then the the householder will arrange it and no problem and he'll he'll give some uh some prenata everybody I I remember very funny to me it seemed very funny I went to one of these places and afterwards they came around everybody got I think one rupee and a bar of soap yeah because yeah because they're thinking it's out too is the people really wondering with nothing what will be a useful thing for them so I I remember that I thought that was very interesting it's a small little piece of cloth and and maybe rupee in the bar of soap so anyhow Taco were saying that the householder life if one doesn't have to worry about food where the next meal is coming from the mind is free and the more time couldn't be spent on spiritual practice hmm wandering monks while searching for uh may have to go to Six have to go six miles out of their way I've seen them traveling along the regular Road after their pilgrimage to Puri and making a detour to find an eating place you were leading a householder's life that is very good it is like fighting from a fort there are many disadvantages in fighting in an open field so many dangers too bullets may hit you now what does it mean Taco uses this example many times I I've always found it curious that it is one of those things that's not so simple to understand what he meant what exactly does it mean when he says the householder it's like fighting from before it and the Asado like standing out in an open field without that protection around him what does it mean persona anybody have any idea yeah yeah [Music] I think it means more that the sadhu doesn't have any place to go to fulfill any desires and this uh there was no place to hide his life is an open Life everyone can see what he does the householder uh they're permitted to have some enjoyment they can get a break they can uh sleep late one morning it's not such a bad thing that uh and and the sadhu has to constantly do battle with these inner things I I mentioned the last time or the time before uh is very nice explanation given by uh Saint Teresa of Avila yeah that probably many of you haven't heard this somebody was asking her about uh there's a monastic life what what is it like and she said uh living in the world it's like you're outside and you feel that you're being followed the thief is following you someone wants to rob you or even kill you something like that so she said I feel like that I start going faster and faster and faster and quickly I get to my house and and I unlock the door and I get in and then I close it and lock it very fast and I think ah now relief and everything then I realized that I locked the thief inside the house with me so that means that uh now that the battle is an internal battle and there's no way to hide from that internal battle and there's there's no vacation or holiday for the Nissan I think it means something like that I know anybody have any other ideas otherwise it's not such an easy thing to understand that you're leading a householder's life that is very good is it like fighting from a fort so some family protection uh some ability to have some enjoyments and things the different different ways of understanding this there are many disadvantages in fighting in an open field so there was no place to hide that just directly in battling with uh with desires and passions and controlling the mind or all sorts of things like that but one should spend some time in solitude and attain knowledge then one can lead the life of the householder now Taco makes this type of statement uh many times in in different ways sometimes he says first realize God and then live in the world now then we get completely uh depressed who who will realize God first and live in the world here he says spend some time in solitude attain knowledge then one can lead the life of okay that's a little easier it ain't not it's still hard other times he says first uh I get a little devotion a little bhakti and then live in the world so we don't have to take it so strictly that we want to be a good householder first we have to go over the Solitude realize God then then we can live in the world again after that it's too difficult no one will be able to do that very few but once it's been some time in solitude and attain knowledge then one can lead the life of a householder Janika lived in the world after retaining knowledge now this is another big point that there's a a great controversy among the different schools of vedanta can one detain the highest knowledge through Karma alone this is this is what the uh Gita says to Karma alone Johnny and others that they attained perfection and uh srirama Krishna always adds yes but how much austerity he did before that because one cannot practice real Karma Yoga unless one has some control over the mind and and one does some some spiritual practice so drama Christian really combines the two others will say shankarachary and others that through the practice of Karma Yoga he purified the mind and then could have that realization so the different ways of understanding this but this is this is always Yannick is always the example uh of somebody who uh even after being a real life soul that he ran a whole Kingdom without any attachment anything like that whether Janika of the upanishads is the same Janika of ramayana we don't know exactly upanishads was a highly perfectly realized Soul who used to give instructions even to the other sages dialogues back and forth and we don't know who he's teaching who yeah Great Soul so we find in both this uh reminder tradition and the upanishadic traditions [Music] yeah yeah so that'll be which tradition that will be more vedantic tradition I guess but still yeah Jonica lived in the world after attending knowledge when you have gained it you may live anywhere then nothing matters now again what does this mean nothing matters whether we get good food we get bad food well there's nice weather bad weather that and external things won't affect anybody in that state because the mind is is everything the mind is controlled the mind is happy then we're happy this mind is concentrated mind is resting on God and then nothing else makes any difference it's not that one doesn't care that others are suffering or is it there's Wars and and uh all sorts of disasters going on of course that affects them but personally nothing will make much difference whether good food comes based because it won't make Anya this this type of ideal foreign why does a man become deluded by worldly objects now we can we can give many different answers to this uh this this is the nature of of the human Constitution this is the nature of Maya this is how we're constructed this human being that we're constituted that way that the Mind goes outward through the senses that uh enjoyment brings attachment and desire and all of these types of answers says it is because he lives in the mid in their midst without having realizing God now he's giving me a very practical reason for all of this explanation very practical explanation we may say that it's not a very deep psychological explanation we want to be very deep pleased analytical and psychological we talk about the nature of the mind this and that but the very practical point of view the this desire for things grows when we have contact with them and when we don't have contact with them it's not that it'll Disappear Completely but uh we're not feeding into it we're not feeding into it this is why is ramakrishna is always talking about uh putting a fence around ourselves protecting ourselves why environment is so important in the early stages especially like the the small plan that won't be able to grow into a big tree because it'll be gobbled up by the cows and goats so these cows and goats are desires and temptations and and uh and not having a good environment not having that protection around us so this is why uh holy company is so important being very careful about the types of things that that we read and see and movies we go to all the internet things and uh how how much of an effect all these these violent internet games have had you know in this country on young kids and everything so environment is a very very important thing uh we may say that well everything is the mind of course everything is the mind but the mind is is not strong enough and when we're young especially so the environment is very important so uh it is because he lives in their midst without having realized God so this is what we're saying after we realize God then we don't have to worry so much then he says when the Banyan tree is Big then uh you don't fence it around you can even tie an elephant to it nothing will happen so that means we can go anywhere live anywhere and we won't be affected at all I I always like this statement that the swamiji some of you they can understand that when I was young I wouldn't walk on the same side of the street where the theater was theater was was always associated with uh these women of ill repute whether it's their fault or not it doesn't matter but anyhow they had a bad reputation and so he would keep away he would walk on the other side and then he said now I can live in a home with prostitutes and it won't affect me at all mine has become so strong and we know there was one very nice incident when swamiji was in Egypt probably Cairo and they were just walking all around they found that they had walked into a red light district without knowing it and these women were out there kind of laughing and teasing and calling them over and everything and somehow they recognized it he was a holy man and didn't bowed down and touched the Hem of this of his cloth and everything so yeah Taco had a thing about prostitutes he saw the Divine mother in them of course in India is a very sad thing nobody wants to take to that type of life it's poverty and it's the culture and all sorts of things class and cast and everything so talk were never made those when when we hear that he couldn't bear the touch of impure people it was it was never that type of feeling because uh when he went to the theater very often Giddish would invite him to the to the theater afterwards uh all of the actresses would come and they would bow down to him some even touch his feet other times we see the very prized people and they'll he'll have some reaction we know with the rendez which is a maidservant he had the terrible reaction but uh this question of Purity uh has nothing to do with with cast or with occupation or anything uh so uh for the theater talking to you ramakrishna is is kind of you can say patron saint of the theater in Bengal at least every theater will have his picture there they'll all bow down before it so how did we get on this topic uh yes different kind of like you know I'm not able to understand clearly is telling that because they live in the midst without having realized God that his problem but then how is householders life really fighting from within the Fortress because again like you know you're constantly maybe you get out for Holy company a little bit but otherwise you're just in like you know you're in the midst of world after fighting from a fortress is also not that easy you can be attacked from all sides they could shoot arrows over and everything and yeah it doesn't mean that it's so easy but there's a little protection yeah a little protection uh say even something like sadhui is no doesn't know where he'll sleep at night the household release they have a comfortable place they don't have to worry about so those worries are all gone but it's not not saying that it's easier for the householder to realize God than this is not saying that it's saying that the sadhu has to undergo certain other types of austerities which may also uh be time consuming and and create some weary and everything where will I stay this and that so no I mean he'll actually say that those who renounce everything but for them the the path is much more maybe not easier but open sometimes he says even those who don't do any austerities this having renounced the family life and everything that this means that they've progressed a great deal of course on the other hand he said those who renounce the word and don't do spiritual practice then they should really be look down upon so yeah we have to look at all of his statements taken together certain advantages of the householder plus he's encouraging this mahima he's trying to encourage him a little bit so he's talking in that vein when he talks to the the young boys about renouncing everything he'll say yes that don't even think about enjoyment or worldly Life Family Life anything like that yeah but the house over there she would never feel like a second-class citizen that this is a equally that has to be followed it's a question of some Scholars a question of many of these circumstances all sorts of different things so this this was the question uh sir why does a man become deluded by worldly objects it's ramakrishna says it is because he lives in their midst without having realized God so the point is that uh after the realization of God the environment doesn't make such a difference now the householder doesn't have 100 freedom to choose environment you have your job you have to go to work and mix with the worldly people and everything but when we do have a choice then we have to be careful outside of work the friends that we have the places we go to read that that's under our control to a certain extent of course man never succumbs to delusion after he has realized God The Moth no longer enjoys the darkness if it has once seen the light so this means that after God realization that there's no falling back from that once once we attain that then there's something permanent about that nothing will always be in some idea or Bliss or anything like that but uh there's there's some radical transformation that takes place so that what has been achieved will always be achieved now the path of devotion there may be a lot of ups and downs we see in the life of caitanya Deva and some others there may be uh periods tremendous longing for God after realization and then that feeling of Separation comes yeah right then Krishna that type of thing that that comes but the doubt that we have before about the possibility of God really all of those things that's gone that's gone and uh whatever Karma we had that to burn so all of these things these These are radical Transformations that take place after the god realization this is this is how uh we we can have some standards to judge whether we have achieved something or anyone has achieved something what type of transformation is taking place this is the ultimate test or have we have we become free from from doubts that we've been become free from all longing and desire are we free from ego do we do anything out of self-interest all these are these These are the key things that will be signed whether we've really achieved something or not we denied how long we can sit for meditation I'll do these things many people sit for meditation long time and then they go out and cheat people and do other things so there has to be that transformation okay now I'm going to skip this section here because this is really meant yes for for satus we'll go to page for 12. the devotees would go on to the panchavati to visit the hati all now there's a whole story about this hate Yogi and this uh uh he was staying in the point of Rd as he was given permission to say and he's wandering monks and sometimes they they could stay there and uh he needed his American opium every day and he needed a certain amount of money for that and this uh who is the son of uh Krishna Kishore hey we'll hear about him uh became very much attached to him so was trying to get some raise some money so this is a little bit of theme of this of this chapter so the devotees who would go under the panchavati to visit the hatayogi came back Master addressing them well what you think of him I dare say you have measured him with your own tape now what does this mean yeah let me measuring tape that we we all have our own standards by which we judge other people and what he's trying to say is I don't think that your standard is is uh is the beginning the end of everything this is according to you this is why he would say everybody thinks that their clock tells the right time but nobody's watched tells exactly the right time you have to check with the son sometimes so this is this is also a very very uh important point for everybody to think about not just people who are trying to lead a spiritual life but this distinction between uh opinion and belief this is a very very important distinction there's a nice incident in the life of Swami turiananda he was in The Shanti ashram in California and you remember that story and he was walking with one young woman devotee I think this is her name and she this is her reminiscence she's writing she said in the Swami suddenly turned to me and he said uh when it comes to opinions then uh flow like the river and when it comes to belief or conviction be firm like The Rock don't move and then she said in this one sentence he gave me enough for a lifetime very beautiful so this is a big mistake that all of us make at different times that if I don't like something that I don't say I don't like it I say it's no good we say how was the food last night it was terrible yeah I would say I I didn't like it but the others liked it now is it possible that it's terrible I didn't like it and it was terrible but they liked it there's something wrong with them so so we we have to make sure we understand that yeah that according to me I know another nice story one of our old sadhus nobody is special that anybody knows but I I was told this story he had a uh a habit when he was talking to somebody and getting some type of argument a philosophical argument monks like to talk about these things yeah and at the end he would say foreign according to you in your opinion don't worry about the in your opinion according to you yeah what you say is perfectly right it's perfectly true according to you that that means don't think that everybody will accept what you said but this is your conviction that's fine but understand this is just in your own mind there's no objective uh truth to these different types of things so how did we get to this so he said yeah so with his Yogi and nobody likes him maybe he's a good person but uh yes from there judging from their own standards with their own prejudices because this is what we do we we judge based on our own prejudices now Prejudice we use this term Prejudice it sounds like a terrible term it just means prejudging it may be that prejudging is based on experience and and we have to do that every time we're faced with a situation we compare it to some other experience we had this is the way we make decisions and the way the mind works otherwise if every new situation we have to start from scratch we won't be able to come to any conclusion about things yeah I've been in this situation before I know this type of situation that this is what usually happens we can come now we may be wrong we may be wrong it may be that uh We've we've met a half a dozen people who come from from the same place and we formed an opinion about that anybody else from that place we say oh I know what these people are like now this is really Prejudice this is from the negative point of view but uh otherwise uh we we remember things that we learned and that helps us make a judgment of this is this is the way we were only we have to keep that mind open a little bit so with this Yogi is saying yeah I know none of you are going to like him that either asking for money he gets a little angry sometimes I know you're but don't think that this means that what you think about him is is the beginning in the end this is the final truth that is according to you using your own measuring tool it's very nice the way he says it I dare say you have measured him with your own tape ceramic Krishna saw that very few of the devotees were willing to give money to the hatayogi yeah nobody likes to part with their money Master you don't like Asado if you have to give him money yeah Taco used to joke that so many people come here because we don't ask for any subscription we don't we don't have a money box to collect any money you don't like the sadhu if you have to give them money draws a salary of 800 rupees a month at that time it was a huge amount a huge amount we hear about some of the Deputy magistrates and things making 300 rupees a month and this is a big amount or authors saying they were kept trying to get that money it would have been something like this so it's a big amount of money he has been to allahabad to see the Kumba Mela I asked him well what kind of Sawtooth did you see at the fair rajendra said I didn't find any very great satu there I noticed one it is true but even he accepted money I say to myself if no one gives money to Assad who then how will he feed himself there was an earlier conversation with surrender huh so too high we surrender that he also went and he said he was going to leave it the next day and he left the day before yeah because he didn't want to give money he got a big scolding he felt very embarrassed also but here he's just saying to himself on the ax he's not saying to himself he's telling everybody I say to myself so they're all hearing it of course I say to myself if no one gives money to asatu then how will he feed himself uh if there is no collection played here therefore all come and I say to myself alas they love their money let them have it now this also may sound a little too harsh but if his his deputies disciples were very very generous and uh generous to a fault that same surrender who got scolded for not wanting me to give money to sadhus he gave so much money for suramit Christian so many of them were very very generous the master rested a while a devotee said on the end of the small couch and gently stroked its feet the master said to Him Softly it may be him of course he doesn't say that usually that which is formless again has formed now is forgetting all this other stuff and going to some philosophy that which is formless again has formed one should believe in the forms of God also now if this is M or even this mahima chakravarti this is he was kind of a traditional way dances but also a western educated modern type person so uh whether strictly Dwight in or whether people brahmos so much people like that it wasn't fashionable to believe in God with form and it was connected associated with image worship this is this is uh one thing that we learned at the very beginning that when SRI ramakrishna would say that this the worship of God with form in the minds of most of the people at that time the first thought was image worship remember the the first conversation the the long conversation that M had with the srama Krishna he said well then should one go do a temple in Bow Down shouldn't people be told that the image is not God when he says this God with form is much higher type of of uh understanding he's not talking about just going into a temple with some of the image there he's talking about his Brahmin uh will be both uh with attributes without attributes that both are equally real that Brahman can manifest as the whole universe that's also formed that Roman can manifest as they did all the different deities that's also formed it's not just this clay image and things like that which many of them thought at that time now this if this is a m of course M now doesn't really need this type of exercise he's learned he understands this one of the important teaching of Swami Krishna that which is formless again as form one should believe in the forms of God also by meditating on Kali the aspirement realizes God as Kali next he finds that the form merges in the indivisible absolute that which is the individual is verily Kali now we have two basic ways of understanding this idea of God with form as the different deities and takura doesn't seem very interested in in saying that one is better than the other it'll it'll give alternatively he'll give him types of explanations one is that uh we're the ones we're the ones that because we want to see God in a certain form God will see God in that form so he gives different examples that through the uh intense devotion that devotion is is like this cooling power that will make the water form into blocks of ice and it'll take the form that we want to see this is kind of the subjective type of thing or his example of uh people going to the a pond and taking water and it will come out in a different container whether they use a bucket or they use a pitcher or whatever it'll take that shape and it'll take the name of the name that they give in so this is kind of a subjective thing the other way is that God himself will reveal himself in the form that the devotee wants to see this is more of an objective type of thing of which one is true God knows we don't we really don't have to come to any strict conclusion about that the war philosophically inclined people will probably say that there's a psychological element to it a subjective element now this is or we have a vision of God subjective element doesn't mean that it's false because that block of of ice is water it's the same substance where this is how we're getting it how do we get water out of a pond it has to take a form whatever container we use it'll take that form there's no other way of getting it the other option is we dive in become one with it this is uh there will be some at least conception of God some some picture in our mind it doesn't even have to be in the form can be we can think of God a Divine mother without thinking of any form just the mother idea in the uh Sufi tradition they very often picture God as the Beloved now do they have any image of uh male or female in their mind probably not it's not part of their tradition but at the same time some idea of the Beloved is in their heart somehow and if there's no subjective element then we can say I worship God as mother you worship God his father you're wrong and I'm right if it's really objective so there has to be a subjective element but this subjective element doesn't mean that there's something false about it it means that it's not absolutely true for each and every person for me it's absolutely I want to have my East finish time when I have my devotion to that form of God that I Want To Worship all right but if it's if it's absolutely and finally true it won't melt back into the ocean and become formless again so this when when Takara says that Roman is like water it can take all different shapes water is both formless what is what is the nature of water is it formless yes but that's not the final truth it takes the shape of the container this is one of the definitions of of a liquid that a solid will keep the same solid shape but there's water whatever shape it's in uh top will be flat and it'll take the shape of the bottom even the ocean the ocean is not formless if we could freeze the ocean and remove it we'd see all the different curves and everything at the bottom the top will be flat except for the waves okay so this is the way Taco explains both are true equally true if if with form is true without the formless then we're stuck then my conception is the only conception every religion that says uh I worship God Yeshiva it has to be Shiva this this is the that Wave It's a permanent wave it's not going to change it's not going to melt it's not going to turn out it's a permanent thing if we understand that both are true then uh we can respect every tradition that worships God in any form with any name now we can say the name is arbitrary but it's also but it's necessary arbitrary and necessary because we need a handle we need something to to uh to repeat somebody to bring that image to the mind and every so Taco is understanding is so subtle brilliant and beautiful the way he explains all of this so let me read this again that which is formless again has formed one should believe in the forms of God also now can we believe in the forms of God as eternal and real yeah we can talk with says in some places it's so cold that it never melts back and in some places it actually turns to Crystal something like that he's not very clear about that but yeah we can that there are all different uh we shouldn't think this is the only level of reality that's that's possible is the Earth's reality we know that we these different locals and everything uh they have the equal right to exist is this we can't say too much about that bye that'll be limited that'll be the Devas and Davies and everything he's talking about really this infinite absolute reality that we're trying to uh make tangible in some way so that we can approach it and we can have a relationship and we had love for it and then ultimately realize it so he says that which is formless also its form one should believe in the forms of God also by meditating on Kali the aspirement realizes God is calling next he finds that the form merges in the indivisible absolute that which is the indivisible is verily Kali now Taco ahead there's an argument with the Narendra so many times because Narendra he hated this idea of Kali when he was younger the the bloodthirsty goddess and what is all of this with the with the Sword and the skulls and the arms cut off and everything like that sravakrishna used to say that what you call the Brahman I call Kali only that Shakti aspect is is manifest this uh this near going to bromine that shut the aspect is is a dormant at that time but present if it's going to be active it has to be there in some dormant form so he said what you call the Brahman I called Kali don't think that it means this a goddess with four arms and all of that ceramic Krishna was sitting on the semi-circular porch west of his room talking with magnivan and other devotees about the hatayogi the talk drifted to ramprasana the son of Krishna Kishore Krishna Kishore was uh also there were many of these householder devotees who were also great Giannis and and very quiet Souls and taco had a relationship with many of these these different types so we'll talk more liked them very much and because of that he liked his son also but the sun really just kind of got drawn in to this maybe a charismatic Yogi or something and uh really became like his disciples you could say Master roams about aimlessly the other day he came here and sat in the room but he did not speak a word he pressed his nostrils with his fingers practicing pranayama you know how we do that with things like this like this I offered him something to eat but he wouldn't take it on another occasion I'd asked him to sit by me he squatted on the floor placing one leg upon the other a little bit of of kind of the pride of the Yogi the way they do it with or a half Lotus posture or something like that he was rather discouraged to Captain I weep at his mother's suffering now the captain kept in I don't know what the connection was exactly uh maybe Krishna Kishore and kept in with friends or something this Captain is this vishwanath upadhyay he was some high at a very high government position uh in Nepal so that meant that he had to come to uh Kolkata from time to time on business and things like that so he would come to srama Krishna and uh uh Tucker liked him very much he was a very kind of Orthodox Brahman he believed in a lot of the Orthodox things but also pious so uh sometimes he would call srirami Krishna for keeping company with keshav that Keisha was that he had fallen for that he wasn't a real Hindu and everything so Taco would scold them sometimes and say yeah I go to see Keisha because he's he's a great Deputy of God you go to that whoever was in Nepal for to earn your money and you're criticizing me anyhow this was a captain there are a lot of these characters in this Leela and this play Captain was was one of them so anyways it's mentioned this captain asked me to speak to you about the hatayogi the Yogi's daily expenses or six and a half honors there's nothing huh I know even then it's probably not too much huh is it a lot a little bit yeah it's not it's not like yeah it's not jump change it's this is a little bit but still they were talking about people who make 800 rupees a month yeah so yeah it's it's uh maybe if we're just some wandering so I'll do or Yogi or something yeah it's more than it would cause just I mean he could just get this get his food for free it doesn't work they're feeding places he doesn't have to worry about that at all so it's a little bit yeah a little bit extra the Yogi's daily expenses are six and a half honors but he won't tell you about it himself it's a little bit proud so he has his disciples going about trying to get money for him who will listen to him even if he does entered the room with several friends one of whom was a physician when he asked The Master about his injured arm the doctor did not approve of the medicine prescribed by Pottermore the master said to him why should you say that but the top is no fool yeah there's another case of somebody coming not knowing much about the whole situation to hear something another Diamond starts to criticize so Taco didn't like that type of attitude suddenly lotu cried out oh the medicine bottle has dropped and broken it was not yet dusk the master Seated on the couch was talking to him was on the semicircular porch engaged in the loud discussion of the scriptures with the physician friend of money Sen yeah this was this he was very proud of his learning to how many scriptures he had read we don't know that Narendra went to his house once you remember the big library books and he started taking the books off of the shelves in in those days you know you had to cut the pages that uh they they would be folded so that when you open it up there would be two together it would be folding you had to cut the top in order to turn the page to read the book so he found it under the pages have been cut that man he just kept them for show yeah my imaginal was on the semicircle the porch engaged and allowed discussion of the scriptures with the physician friend of money sense ramakrishna heard it and with the smile said to em there he is delivering himself delivering lectures delivering himself that is the characteristic of rajas see sarama Christian was no fool we think oh why does he like him so much it doesn't mean he doesn't recognize that he has these these Tendencies and everything he knows all of these things likes of despite of it that is the characteristic of rajas it stimulates the desire to lecture and to show off one scholarship but satwa makes one introspective it makes one hide when the virtues but I must say that mahima is a grand person he takes such a delight in spiritual talk entered the room saluted the master and sat by m side he had not come for the past few days we've seen so much of the other other than and he came to srama Krishna I think 1883 something like that and within a very very short time he came so close to him Tucker went to his house many times he went to dakshines for so many times and talk where it's Omni discussions with him about getting money and all of these things and everything and then died very young and taku knew somehow so we we when we read the things that taku said to him uh it makes more sense if we realize that he's talking to a young man who he knows will not live long and it's a time for him to call on God is earlier than for most people so he says hello why haven't you come all these days other sir I've been busy with so many things I had to attend the conference of the school committee and various other meetings master so you completely lost yourself in schools and meetings and forgot everything else other everything else was hidden away in a corner of my mind how was your arm Master just look it is not yet healed I've been taking medicine prescribed by put it up after a Time the master suddenly said to other look here all these are unreal meetings school office and everything else God Alone is the substance and all else is illusory one should worship god with one's whole mind others said without speaking a word master all else is illusory now do we want to take that attitude no people who have their household or Duty their whole life in front of them career and everything they just they dismiss everything it's an illusion why should I bother and everything this is especially for this other we have to remember that there's a footnote here I'll read also he says all else is illusory this moment the body is and the next moment it is not one must make haste to worship God in this footnote a few months after this conversation author died if it was a horseback riding something that fell off the horse and didn't recover from that you know then he continues but you don't have to renounce everything live in the world the way the tortoise does the tortoise roams are bad on the water but keeps its eggs on land its whole mind is on the eggs and where the heart is and where the mind is is everything the external circumstances are secondary what a nice State of Mind Captain has developed he looks like a Rishi when he is seated to perform worship he performs the Oddity with lighted camphor and recites beautiful hymns when he rises from his seat after finishing the worship his eyes are swollen with emotions as if bitten by ants besides he always devotes himself to the study of the Sacred books such as the Gita and the bhagavata once I used one or two English words before him and that made him angry he said English educated people are profane one day when young devotee came from Nepal and we're introducing himself and he said that my great greater great great grandfather was the one who Taco Captain I said oh he says yes and so a direct relative of his and they said their family had started a Kali temple in Kathmandu I don't know if it's still there or anything but after A While others said humbly to the master sir you haven't been to our place for a long time the drawing room smells worldly and everything else appears to be steeped in darkness the master was deeply touched by these words of his devotee he suddenly stood up and blessed am and other in an ecstatic mood touching their heads and hearts in a voice choked with love the master said I look upon you as narayana himself you are indeed my own okay we can stop here a few more lines again a little bit of this is religious uh not so appropriate I feel so I will start next time with this chapter 21 in the induction ishwar we have a few minutes if anybody has anything to ask yeah [Music] um in matters of things flow like the river something like that yeah [Music] that means we have to understand that this is just my opinion my likes and dislikes there's nothing so so wonderful about it and there's something I like today I may not like tomorrow that I shouldn't get stuck in that and and I shouldn't printable is something that I have to be in flexible about but uh opinions they come and go they change there we shouldn't confuse it with facts we shouldn't confuse it with uh some deeply held principle that we have uh or likes and dislikes we have to realize that these are actually a type of bondage for us yeah but how do you make a differentiation between what is our life in the site versus what is uh like some principles are very easy to distinguish like like ideal Institute or not feeling that's very good sometimes we have a very difficult to believe and we think it is a principle but it's yeah we can we can have some opinions that we know are just our own opinions and we can be firm with those things but we shouldn't feel that this is the the uh some universal truth other people also have to believe it even with principle these are private things individual things but the real answer to your question is is simply introspection we have to analyze our minds we have to analyze the the type of belief that we have is is this something that really I have to cling to uh is this something that I can be flexible about that uh something that just uh yeah uh I really don't like to attend these these certain types of meetings they're worldly people and everything but uh for the good of the family for the work and everything I have to do these things okay I'll do it but some other things say no I won't do it that I have a very firmed principle about this I I won't do it so some things we have to be flexible about that's all uh and we draw the line ourselves it's a bit subjective we have to just analyze and try to discover on our own no he never called him and he is these are all Playmates in his Leela huh these are all I mean he he had his role to play he was definitely we can say antarranga see there's another category is very restrictive only six then nithya said there may be a little bit more but this is this will include many of the householder uhm and mother rambos and around many of them other I think we have to say definitely I would be part of this Inner Circle tantaranga yeah and those who are also come and within that that big circle but they're a little bit on the uh takur says this not one deer has some filters that support everything so I'm just for sure yeah or the elephant has the teeth for chewing and the other tusks pictures so uh I would say that definitely he has to be considered part of that inner circle that along with Adam and others yeah in my opinion okay then we'll stop here um [Music] foreign who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts and sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace I think everybody knows everybody who's listening there watching that tomorrow we have the funeral for our beloved dear Swami Brahma rupananda ji and uh we won't be able to do it live streaming because mostly it'll be viewings and other things but we'll have a memorial service that will be live streamed for out of town people that'll be May 7th and uh we know that those who can't go in in person that they'll be there in spirit and everything so thank you
