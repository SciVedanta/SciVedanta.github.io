[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (6/3/22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_T57VrNqntY)

[Music] foreign your words are like nectar bringing life to squirt souls they are praised by poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of srama krishna we're starting starting a new chapter tonight chapter 16 with the devotees of the chinese were part two and it's sunday december 9 1883 suramar krishna was seated on the small couch in his room with adhar mano mohan rakal and other devotees by now we know all of these people was the deputy magistrate looking for the big job who had come to sram krishna not too much earlier but became very very close and very dear to him in a very short time and we see takara going to his house and other things manomohan and rakkal were brothers-in-law and it was actually through monomohan that rakhal swami brahmananda came to meet suramar krishna and bono was also related to ramchandra so there are a lot of inner connections among the devotees even family connections and of course and harish used to stay with sriami krishna for some time off and on he was was married but he was drawn to monastic life and other devotees it was about two o'clock in the afternoon the master was describing to them the exalted state of sri caitanya now m is going to make a comment later that is very much appropriate that i think that half the time when taka wanted to explain his own state of mind he would talk about caitanya's state of mind and all of the descriptions that he gives will be things that apply to him as well so he says master caitanya experienced three states of mind first the conscious state when his mind dwelt on the gross and the subtle second the semi-conscious state when his mind entered the causal body and was absorbed in the bliss of divine intoxication third the inmost state when his mind was merged in the great cause now we have lots of connections here with the two doctrines of the different bodies the sharia the suksma sharia and the the gross the subtle and the causal body and then of we'll get with the five coaches also but beyond the causal body uh is maha karuna is the great cause or if we think of it in terms of the different states of consciousness turia or the the ultimate merging in in divine reality so the conscious state the mind dwell on the grossness so that means awareness of the physical body and of course the mind and everything second the semi-conscious state when the mind entered the causal body so this means that there's not even uh awareness of internal thought somehow it's it's uh almost almost our nearly called the samathi but something like that but uh then the third which goes even beyond that so that will be uh really the mind completely lost and uh in the great cause so this will be that that uh the highest type of samanthi so now we so we have the three bodies here and taquer says this agrees very well with the five koshers or sheaths described in the vedanta this is a teaser i'm not going to say too much about this because this is my topic for for sunday and probably next it'll be a two-part topic because i i love this this uh theory of the the five punchy kosher doctrine the five sheets and just to give a little foretaste of what it will be this the doctrine of the five five koshers five seeds which tucker talked about in terms of the onion and peeling the onion uh it it it's appropriate and helpful in so many different levels uh with regard to this personality of the individual with regard to this analysis uh with regard uh to trying to find the real self for the ego within to find this relationship between the superimposed aspects false identification so many different things even when when the jiva leaves the body at the time of death and catching off the under my kosher but maybe keeping this uh manomaya kosho all of these things uh or can be explained in terms of this idea that we're covered by five different layers and the the innermost will be this uh anandamayakosha which is something like the subconscious mind and the corona and then we have the big yanamaya kochamanomayakosha which will be like the subtle body sushma and then the pranamaya kosher and the under my kosher this body and and life and everything and that'll be the stool that'll be this physical body so these these two doctrines they dovetail they're almost identical only one is divided into three and the other is divided into five and they will correspond to the the three states of consciousness where you can stay dream state dreamless sleeps so they all dovetail they all work together and of course the turia state which is beyond all of them so uh thakur says this agrees very well with the five koshers or seeds described in the vedanta the gross body corresponds to the annamaya kosha and the pranamayakosha the subtle body to the manomayakosha and the vikyana maya kosher and the causal body to the anandamaya kosha ananda is the sheath of bliss because somehow it's the closest it's the if we think of these these different layers and levels is the closer to the center and reflects the bliss of brahmin more than the others but it's also the one that's that's characterized by thomas and darkness because it's the state of deep sleep and uh when we're not aware of the mind is not functioning an ordinary way the great cause is beyond the five sheaths when caitanya's mind merged in that he would go into samanthi this is called the nirvikalpa or judas so if we go back the three states of mind the first will be uh when caitanya deva or takur is aware of external things the second semi-conscious state mind enters the causal body so that will be of samadhi it'll be bliss there'll be some experience and then the third mind merges in the great cause even is beyond any experience because there's no i at all in that state don't exactly uh correspond to the bhava samadhi and other this is uh on the uh according to the school of uh patanjali's raja yoga the sub occult so we call personality there'll be some sense of individual awareness that uh i am having this experience some sense of i was very pure which is not identified with any external thing the best way i find of understanding this at all because this is just all theoretical for with us until we get some experience is swamiji's him or samantha so he says in that state there's just the flow of i i i just pure i know that i exist and then even that eye center of eye disappears that'll be the near recovery somati in this bhava samanthi there's all sorts of things that can be going on all types of experiences and visions of gods and goddesses and he'll be talking to the divine mother she'll be talking to him he'll have all sorts of visions and things but no external awareness the mind is gone from this physical plane not connected to the senses it's in some divine realm i don't know exactly what uh how we explain that but that's that's the experience generally uh with those following the path of devotion that they will be the ones who will have this type of bhava samanthi so most of the time when it says taka went into samantha in the bhagavad-gita and then afterwards he'll say do you know what i saw in that state and he'll explain something like that of course he would go into the highest type of samadhi from time to time at one point we know he was in that state for six months more or less and that after that this is a period before the all the devotees started coming after that it was hard for him to keep his mind away from that state that he used to say most of the time he was in that near recovery state that the mind had the tendency to just go up and disappear disappear into that ultimate reality then the devotee started coming he made a great effort to keep his mind hold it down to the world for so he could talk to people and he used to say enjoy the blessed bhakti and bhakta the company of the devotees and and devotion so yeah they they correspond but they're not identical that means there's something going on in the mind the mind there's some functioning of it but it's not connected to the senses or it's not the ordinary thinking of the mind but some sense of i some some awareness that uh i'm having this experience but this nearby culpa salanti the salt doll is one with the ocean at that point there's no way to explain even if one comes back from that no one to explain what takes place in that state only the feeling of joy is there tremendous joy so we know it's not just a blank state it's something that very and not just feeling of joy but transformation takes place so we know that this is the ultimate state so this is a little bit unusual talking about caitanya deva and nirvikalpa the those following the path of devotion they'll be more interested in this and have a vision of krishna in his case and things like that while conscious of the outer world caitanya sang the name of god while in the state of partial consciousness he danced with the devotees and while while in the inmost state of consciousness he remained absorbed in samati m to himself is the master hinting at the different states of his own mind this is this uh these are rhetorical questions this means that m is convinced this is what he's doing but he's putting in stating it as a question there is much similarity between caitanya and the master so i think that not only is em right he's hinting at that but i think this is his way of doing it as a way of explaining to them uh what what his different states of consciousness are by talking about chaitanya they were so similar in so many different ways with this this being able to see something that triggers something else with this tremendous viacolota the longing feeling of separation longing for realization they were very very similar in many ways master caitanya was divine love incarnate he came to earth to teach people how to love god one achieves everything when one loves god there is no need of yoga now this divine love incarnate we we have a couple of different theories about the avatar one is almost a historical imperative idea that the forces of history make it necessary for the divine to incarnate because of dharma and adharma one idea and the others that they come as as a living example and teach us how to love god this is more along the devotional path and i think srama krishna also prefers that interpretation uh we don't hear him talking too much about this idea and gita whenever there's uh too much udharma that the avatar takes birth but this idea that they come to teach people how to love god and to set that example to uh to give us that mold that we can uh mold our lives within this is this is how we feel of course about takur's coming and it seems to be the way he understood it also then hatha yoga now we know of our yoga because of uh [Music] all the asanas and health benefits and everything in sram of christmas day we have to know the context there were people who they become fanatics about these things it wasn't that they were doing it just to have a good health and they could sit for a long time and they did their meditation this this was their full-time almost profession and doing all sorts of strange things swallowing the cloth and thinking of all sorts of things like that and with the with the goal of of getting some type of cities or powers or something so when when taquer speaks negatively about the hunter yoga we shouldn't take it to mean that we won't get any benefit from doing these asanas because even many of our monks in the order they'll do some some of these just to keep good health and of course asanas is one of the limbs of raja yoga that we want to be able to keep the body in good shape so that we can sit comfortably for a long period of time so there's no harm in practicing some of these things for for the sake of health but uh the goal of life is not just to have a healthy body it has to be secondary to uh spiritual practice so deputy asks sir what is hatha yoga like master a man practicing hatha yoga dwells a great deal on his body see there was one hatha yoga who used to come and used to stay in dakshineshwar during this period and who was it was a harish no someone was very devoted to him was trying to collect money for him yeah and he used to take opium and milk that was his diet so something like that so uh and he he did some strange things and and wasn't really a spiritual as pirate so that was kakawa's experience with these yogis i don't know i i mean he won't he definitely won't fall under this glass of matayogi he may have known he may have been expert in doing those things also but he was very very sincere yeah and and highly relay soul yeah this of course belongs to the sankey yoga school as as because it falls somehow falls under the asana the ashtanga yoga but it became a science under its own self this what is it oh i don't know that much about him so he he was more of a yogi according to that that system huh yeah well we know that um he was i think he think it was a lawyer huh embarrassed or something like that earlier and uh he he lived in a house that had a basement it was half a cave wasn't it like he lived in a cave it was this is the cellar uh i've never been there but i i know people have gone to visit ghazipur who's not far from banaras and towards the end of his life he wouldn't meet people or talk to anybody he would talk from inside and swamiji of course we know went and spent a long time with him and we hear that he kept a picture of srama krishna near his bed and there are a couple of stories i've told this story before that uh swamiji heard this from one satu that uh once a thief went in to steal things from bhavari rabbah and bhavariba saw him so he started to run away and he dropped some of the things so he grabbed them and ran after the thief to give them to him and he thought the thief thought that he wanted to you know give him a thrashing ability to give them to him and he became so overwhelmed by his dispassion and love and everything that he renounced the world became assad so swamiji how did you hear this story how do you know about that and he said i am that satan so he actually met the person who did that and here lots of stories about he was very very highly respected he's the one huh when was bitten by a snake yeah and they asked what happened he said a message from my beloved it covered me so he was considered a very great soul so a man practicing hatha yoga dwells a great deal on his body he washes his intestines by means of a bamboo tube through his anus he draws ghee and milk through his sexual organ he learns how to manipulate his tongue by performing exercises he sits in a fixed posture and now and then levitates all these are actions of prana a magician was performing his feet when his tongue turned up and clothed to the roof of his mouth immediately his body became motionless people thought he was dead he was buried and remained many years in the grave after a long time the grave somehow broke open suddenly the man regained consciousness of the world and cried out come delusion come confusion or laugh all these are actions of prana these are the footnote this is what the magicians say when performing their feats in order to catch the spell on the spectators and you know the taco's point is that they're not making spiritual progress they're not getting any type of realization through this that it's all the play of prana and that they may get some powers and things like that but it won't be helpful uh in spiritual life can be harmful because just as we read in the on the chapter on cities that these things people get attached to them and they get attached to the body and they lose sight of the real goal so there can be dangerous things but not our normal hatha yoga that people do so don't think there's anything wrong with that srama krishna was standing in the road by the side of the nahubat he was on his way to his room having come from the pine grove he saw em seated on the veranda of the nahavut behind the fence absorbed in meditation master hello you are here you will get results very soon now you can imagine how him felt just try to picture how him felt here he's just he was he was sitting there in meditation and he'll hear something open his eyes and hear these words from krishna you will get results very soon if you practice a little then someone will come forward to help you of course that means ramakrishna himself m looked up at the master startled he remained sitting on the floor master the time is right for you the mother bird does not break the shell of the egg until the right time arrives what i told you is indeed your ideal now this is december 9th 1883. i think em goes back and comes again but this is this is the one time when he spent a long period three weeks or something with shiramakris the only time that he really had the solid period when he stayed with him kashipor of course he spent a lot of time he would spend nights there and everything but this was a very very important period in the m's life everything got solidified i think during this this one period this of course is over the christmas break they all would get because it was under the british so that would be the time when the schools were closed and businesses were closed and everything now what is m's ideal taco gives hints every once in a while sometimes m will say that uh he likes a little bit this this uh formless god this uh infinite absolute brahmin at the same time i think he likes this servant-master relationship and the mother child because he was very much attached to his mother who died very much attached to his mother at one time he asked and he meditated on his mother so uh and whatever takwa told him that of course is a secret that he won't divulge and taku won't divulge but what i told you is indeed your ideal sriramic christian again mentioned to him his spiritual ideal master and spiritual ideal can can take different forms spiritual ideals can we can we can like to feel god dwells within as our very self and at the same time have the mother child relationship master servant relationship it's possible it doesn't have to be a monolithic one thing because we have different moods at different times master it is not necessary for all to practice great austerity but i went through great suffering tucker did everything so the he used to say i've done it all so you have you can just do a little bit i'm in all 16 honors so you only have to and to set an example and because his realizations were so intense and everything that he had to do all of that i used to lie in the ground with my head resting on a mound for a pillow i hardly noticed the passing of the days i only called on god and wept oh mother o mother m had been visiting srama krishna for the past two years since he had been educated along english lines he had acquired a fondness for western philosophy and science and had liked to hear keshav and other scholars lecture and was one of many many who came because of keisha and uh kesha did a great service by actually through his humility he was so much more famous than srama krishna and had such a big following and he easily could have been very proud but as once he realized taco's greatness he really told everybody you go there you want to see the real thing you go to srama krishna he had articles written in in their their periodical and everything so he he played a very important role he he had true love there was a very sweet relationship between takur and kesho plus am had a family connection through his wife with with keshav's family a lot of connections uh if we we look at that relations and everything uh suramar krishna would address him now and then as the englishman since coming to suramar krishna m had lost all relish for lectures and for books written by english scholars the only thing that appealed to him now was to see the master day and night and hear the words that fell from his blessed lips and constantly dwelt certain astronomy krsna's sayings now this is also very interesting in the in m's journal that he he used to categorize things that some of the things that suramar krishna said he would he would categorize as its teachings uber deja some things were commands he would tell him you do this or that adesha then he had some things he called mahavakias that taku would say something that to him was as holy as as the maharaki is from the upanishads so he would categorize these different things little things that takur said that seem insignificant to us a tremendous meaning for him the the very first meeting when he left what did taka say to him it's a very insignificant thing for it's almost standard if you don't say it to somebody it's almost rude it doesn't mean much come again but for him he's aha he told me to come again i'll have to come again he took that as something very very significant then another very interesting thing that first uh first visit was it a second visit when uh m went back and he asked ramakrishna will there be any more singing tonight he said no then he thought but i'm going to someone's place a ball around both that you can go and and and meet me there there'll be some budgets and things like that and everything so then uh and said okay then he came back and he thought uh this strange person's house can i just show up something like that and taku said to him and just mention my name take my name and for him another thing that just to repeat the name ramakrishna that is like a like a mantra he took that as somebody with a great significance so and we solved such a sensitive thoughtful soul and this relationship between the two of them was so beautiful that really uh of all the relationships there's some special ones of course but i think m's relationship with srama krishna has to be considered one of those very very special relationships do you know whether they have captured these categories somewhere yeah uh swami prabhupada's book huh which one is it you remember anyhow there are books i and i there's one book book just on on on m that uh was put out by i think that uh three months the trust something like that where it talks about this and gives a list of i i have it somewhere i can i can find it there's also an english one there's more about krishna that's in english and bengali i think yeah so yeah these things are available not the fullest uh swami prabhupada uh he was a master at getting a hold of things that were hard to get hold of and the family of m guarded these journals with their life very hard to anyhow somehow he managed to to get a hold of them and uh he wrote a couple of books this uh anti-lila about the final days that the things that he found in the journal that em never wrote that he never put in uh they were very cryptic and everything but he could make out somehow so uh he wrote some did a lot of he was a great well he is a great uh researcher and historian that's why the wonderful swami yes yeah about the final the the kashipur period that's not much much of that is not included because a couple of reasons one probably israeli krishna for long periods of time didn't say anything because he couldn't speak the doctors told him not to speak and then second thing was it was so painful for them to see him in that condition that probably was too painful for him to even write about it and it was afraid that you know wouldn't other people would feel pain to hear about how much he suffered and everything so a lot of it is is not in here so am constantly dwell on certain of surrounding krsna's sayings the master had said one can certainly see god through the practice of spiritual discipline and again the vision of god is the only goal of human life now this first one one can see god through the practice of spiritual discipline takara talks about this but there's a very funny thing that uh ultimately he'll say and all the great teachers will say that nothing can can give us god realization except for grace but we can't get it without satan we have to do that in order to get that grace unless we're born with very special types of of some scottish so we have to do our spiritual practice this was this was the emphasis that tucker gave knowing that grace will have to be there yes this is grace we deserved and we have to be ready for it we have to be uh be able to to appreciate it this is that effort to raise the sale grace is always there but we have to do our part and uh one very nice thing i just read i'm always referring this framing position on the g because i'm reading his book he says that those who have god realization through tremendous spiritual practice they know that the uh all of the hard disciplines spiritual practice that they did are not even close to uh to making us worthy to have that type of realization that's why that feeling of grace comes that whatever we get we feel is so much more than we deserve or earned through our spiritual practice but we have to do it this this is why i like the tacos story of the bird and the mast of the ship because uh if if we just say well the bird we all know the story the the ship goes out to sea and the bird tries to find land and flies in every direction can't do it and then then practices self-surrender it just stays if if we say well the bird could have done it in the first place that why go to all of that trouble bird could have simply said yes wherever the ship takes me i'll be happy to go but there are two things one we have to try to do whatever we can to realize that it's something beyond our power we have to really do our very best before we understand that uh we we simply don't have the ability to kind of force this god realization with whatever we do it seems like it won't be enough we have that that type of realization but the flying in all directions that bird has to become transformed through that so it's not that we do our meditation day in and day out to finally realize that i'll never do it through meditation that my mind is just as restless as it always was that realization will come that some grace is necessary but at the same time some transformation takes place through all of that some tremendous love and devotion and and uh conviction all of these things come through that spiritual practice so that we're ready to to renounce we're ready to practice surrender or that vector comes the tremendous longing for god comes so something comes so the spiritual discipline is necessary taqwa never says oh you just said and call on god he said you can repeat god god god it won't do anything you could repeat this he said he said he but unless you take it said he's intoxicated you won't get that intoxication so we we have to do as much spiritual practice as we as we can understanding that ultimately grace is necessary it'll be more than what we do but we can't eliminate it so this is this is true exactly uh of course what he says that one can certainly see god through the practice of spiritual discipline that that's a necessary factor but ultimately the grace will have to be there and the vision of god is the only goal of human life now only goal people wonder about this that means that having a family and having a career these aren't goals of life these are goals of life this means the ultimate goal that ultimately everything else they're good goals and they're subsidiary but they have to lead to this ultimate goal master to m if you practice only little someone will come forward to tell you the right path observe the ekadashi in bengal is is not so difficult there's a fasting they're all different levels of fasting the uh somewhat the complete fast their jala that they won't even take water and then there are others that can take some lucies and fruits and things like that and there are others they can eat almost everything except rice so all different different ways of doing it tucker wasn't much in favor of uh very harsh types of austerities and and fasting and especially for women he didn't like to see them fast but at least to do something that day to uh a little bit of discipline is helpful so for some reason he told m we don't find him telling this to anybody and everybody but this was for m then he goes on m must have just been an ecstasy you are my very own my relative otherwise why should you come here so frequently while listening to the kirtan i had a vision of rakhal in the midst of sri krishna's companions in brindava the renderer belongs to a very high level hirananda too how child like his nature is this will meet in kashipur we we don't because he he was a native of sindh and lived there but he did this college in in kolkata and was very close with kesha the member of the brahma-samaj and would visit krishna and he had a very they had a beautiful relationship taco loved him he loved takur and when he went back he went back to sin he was very highly educated a lot of degrees and things and ran several newspapers he was very busy family and everything yeah don't think he was a swami heron on death that was just his name but he made a special trip came all that long distance over a thousand miles to see srama krishnan kashipur taku was so happy to see him and he wanted to bring him there to send to look after him and everything and so they had a very uh very nice relationship and after tapwar passed away whenever this hirano became he became very very friendly and close with swamiji with narendra and he would go to the barangar mutt and and meet with him there and and so he really became very close member of that circle even though he lived so far away and with cindy it was uh from uh that that part of uh of india close to the maybe even pakistan in those days in lahore karachi here and under two how child like his nature is what a speech sweet disposition he has i want to see him too of course wants to see something it'll happen so that desire was fulfilled later in kashiport once i saw the companions of caitanya not in a trance but with these very eyes now tucker made a distinction between two different types of visions that he would have the one was where he saw everything else and he used to say the first type of vision he had like that was the vision of sita he was at near the panchavati and he sees a woman walking near him very majestic and beautiful looking and everything wondering where she came from who is she and then he sees that one of the monkeys jumps from the tree and rolls in front of her as if making pronounce something like that and then he realized he was seeing sita and he noticed her bracelets the diamond cut and had the same type made for holy mother later so he used to say that that was this version of that time most of the time he would have visions of course he'd lose all outer consciousness and then have some type of vision like that he had that type of vision when he fell and broke his arm and then he said mother is trying to tell me don't have those visions anymore see god dwelling in everyone with your eyes open so anyhow he said once i saw the companions of caitanya not in a trance but with these very eyes formerly i was in such an exalted state of mind that i could see all these things with my naked eyes but now i see them in samadhi so that'll be the bhava samanthi i saw the companions of caitanya with these naked eyes i think i saw you there and balarama too now this is one of the only times that i can remember and and takra mentions it many times when he says i think there's some somehow he he doesn't remember he's not quite sure that uh if he saw him but he thinks he saw him there and and sometimes he said i saw balarama and i think you too so anyhow what this means is that uh if m was a companion of caitanya deva that means that he's he comes with the avatar that means he's antaranga the the parts of the the almost eastward okay we can say almost these categories aren't so hard and fast that you either are you are and we don't know about these things but he saw that that balarama also balarambos who we don't call anishwada koti but could still be part of this divine play leelahurst you must have noticed that when i see certain people i jump up with a start do you know why a man feels that way when he sees his own people after a long time now remember then was in deep meditation and suddenly israeli krishna comes up and starts telling all of these things i used to pray to the mother crying and how he remembers to write all of these things it was an unbelievable memory that he had mother if i do not find the devotees i'll surely die this is after his all of his realizations that he had this tremendous desire to find people to share these things with who who could understand them and appreciate them and and spread them to others and and put them into practice he felt he had gotten this tremendous treasure he wanted somebody to give them to he would go up to the roof the coutinho come where are you come come i'm waiting for you when raquel came he said how cruel why did you make me wait so long you used to say things like that so i used to pray to the mother crying mother if i do not find the devotees i'll surely die please bring them to me immediately in those days whatever desire arose in my mind would come to pass i planted a tulsi grove in the panchavati in order to practice jump in meditation i wanted very much to fence it around with bamboo sticks soon afterwards a bundle of bamboo sticks and some string were carried by the flood tide of the ganges right in front of the panchavati a temple servant noticed them and joyfully told me in that state of divine exaltation i could no longer perform the formal worship talker used to say that we reached a stage stayed in the stage in spiritual life where things fall off we don't decide if we don't say okay i've been doing puja every morning for so many years and i do my job every morning then i've done enough now i'll stop what happens is we reach the stage where uh either we can't do it anymore or it's it's just superfluous because the mind is so absorbed in god all of the time so he calls the first lady bhakti and the other anuraga he uses different names for it but it just happens automatically so in sram krishna's case it happened very early he did the worship of of mother kali for a few years then after his realization everything others had to take over for him rahm lal and he got other people to do it because it was just impossible at that point so in that state of divine exaltation i could no longer perform the formal worship mother i said who will look after me i haven't the power to take care of myself i want to listen only to talk about thee i want to feed thy devotees i want to give a little help to those who are my chance to meet how will all that be possible mother give me a rich man to stand by me that is why mathur babu did so much to serve me taka used to say that one after another these these these people who were their role in this divine leela was specifically to look after his needs physical needs and everything and he pointed out three of them who were they this uh mother babu then shambhu malik then the ballroom bose and surrender half so the three and a half something like that yeah and it's funny that he always called balarambos that's very miserly but he was very he wasn't i don't know he used to say that for some reason his problem was that uh his family was very wealthy and they knew he would spend all of his money on taqwa so they kept him on a tight leash he got a small allowance i think and wasn't able to spend as much as he wanted but it was very generous i said further certainly i shall not have any children mother but it is my desire that a boy with sincere love for god should always remain with me gave me such a boy that is the reason rock called came here those whom i think of as my own are part and parcel of me so he would have these visions ahead of time and then when rachael came he saw that it was him he had the vision of course of the great sage and samantha before swamiji came and recognized that this is him sometimes he would doubt and sometimes he would test so with narendra especially that in the jojo molek's house how we touched him i asked him all of the questions that uh why did you come what is your mission in life how long will you live all these different questions and after he said i was satisfied that he gave me all the right answers swamiji didn't know he was giving answers he was he was in some trance-like state as if hypnotized just by the touch talk which is touched and he said i'm not going to let this madman play these tricks with me anymore that the first time he touched me and i lost the consciousness i'm not going to let it happen again i'm going to be on my guard second that he touched him he had no there's no possible way of of withstanding that power tremendous power that tucker taqwahead the master started again for the pantavati accompanied by m no one else was with them srama krishna with a smile narrated to him various incidents of the past years of his life master you see one day i saw a strained figure covering the whole space from the kali temple to the panchavati do you believe this and remain silent with wonder he plucked one or two leaves from a branch in the pantavati and put them in his pocket okay now this is this little section here very small little thing is my favorite part of the whole gospel of srama krishna to me this is the sweetest and most beautiful little incident in the whole thing whenever i read it i just uh it is so touching so master see there that branch has been broken i used to so let me read it again uh he plucked one of them he plucked one or two leaves from a branch in the panthabati and put them in his pocket master c there that branch has been broken i used to sit under it m i took a young twig from that tree i have it at home master with a smile why am i feel happy when i look at it after all this is over this place will be considered very holy so this is really i am starting to understand this idea of lila this idea of leela that when the avatar comes next thing you know it's gone it's all over taco used to say that that uh and uh i i saw this one time that uh there's a little band of bowels that they'll just show up someplace they they look a little strange they'll sing and dance they'll play this little instrument and everything you won't know where they came from the next day you know they're gone so taco used to say this this is the avatar it's like that so m has some feeling that yes the next thing i know it'll be over what will i have to remind me of all of this so we took that one twig a very beautiful thing so he said i feel very happy when i look at it after all this is over this place will be considered very holy master smiling what kind of a holy place like pani hati now he could have said like benares but he says like paniati's of course compared to the chinese wars is very insignificant during taco's time uh for a certain class of people for the the uh vaisnavas it was a very holy place uh tucker went there every year i don't know how many years in a row once a year there was a big festival there and there's a couple of chapters on that where there would be great kirtan and when taco would go immediately he would go into an ecstatic mood and he would sing and dance for hours and big crowds would come around and circle him and just to watch him and everything and it was a tremendous sight the last time he went it rained and uh this was right before tucker developed it cancer the sore in his throat and he thought one one of the one idea that he had was that it was because he got soaking wet in in the rain and blame the rom he said these young boys they have no sense but you're a little bit older you should have known that not to let me stand out there singing dancing getting soaked in the rain everything of course it had nothing to do with the rain that it turned out to be the throat cancer and everything but there's pani hati so takua a little bit of his innocence that he's not thinking that oh i'll be so famous it'll be like like dave and puri or sri krishna and vindavan it'll be like this bunny hati thing but uh is thinking no it'll be more than that so what kind of holy place like panihati almost every year for some time past the master had been attending the religious festival at pani hati it was the evening sriami krishna was sitting on the small couch in his room absorbed in meditation on the divine mother the evening worship in the temples began with the music of gong and kancho and was going to spend the night with the master after a time srama krishna asked him to read from the mala a book about the variation of a saints amrit there was a king named jayamal who loved krishna with all his heart he followed with unfailing devotion or the riots and ceremonies associated with the adoration of krishna whom he worshipped under the name of completely satisfied with his own ideal deity he never directed his attention to any other god or goddess one of the inflexible rules of his devotion was to worship the deity daily until almost midday he would never deviate from this practice even at the risk of his wealth or his kingdom learning the secret an enemy king invaded the kingdom during the morning hours jayamal's soldiers could not fight without his command so they watched the invasion silently slowly the enemy surrounded the mode of the capital yet jaimal did not come out of his shrine room his mother came to him and wept bitterly trying to persuade the king to fight he said to her calmly why are you worried i shall gave me this kingdom what can i do if he has decided to take it away on the other hand none will be able to harm me to do me harm if he protects me our own efforts are in vain and actually in the meantime inshallah the deity himself had taken the king's horse from the stable and had ridden fully armed on the field alone he faced the hostile king and alone destroyed his army having crushed the enemy forces the deity returned to the temple and fastened the horse nearby jaimala completing his worship came out and discovered the horse there pending and covered with sweat who has been riding my horse he demanded who brought it to the temple the officers declared they knew nothing about it in the pensive mood the king proceeded to the battlefield with his army and there found the enemy with the exception of their leader lying dead he was staring uncomprehendingly at the scene when the enemy king approached worshipped him and said please permit me to tell you something how could i fight you have a warrior who could conquer the entire world i do not want your wealth or your kingdom indeed i will gladly give you my own if you will telling me about the blue warrior your friend no sooner did i turn my eyes on him then he cast a spell on my heart and soul jaimal then realized it had been none other none other than shamala sundara that had appeared on the battlefield the enemy king understood too he worshiped jaimal and through his blessings received krsna's grace now takur is going to test them this is very interesting master do you believe all that do you believe krishna rode on that horse and killed jaimal's enemies now remember this m highly scientific mind highly historical mind highly logical minded study all of the western logic and other things what's he going to answer so he gives an interesting answer em i believe that jaimal the krsna's devotee prayed to him with the yearning heart okay we can accept that but i don't know whether the enemy really saw him coming to the battlefield on a horse krishna might have come there riding the horse but i do not know whether they really saw him a very strange answer and i wonder sometimes uh how honest and was maybe he had he was afraid to simply say no i don't believe any of it but maybe he's thinking now that now i've seen israel i'm a christian i know that anything is possible with god we don't know what's in his mind but tucker turns out to be smarter than everybody this is very interesting with a smile he says the book contains nice stories about devotees but it is one-sided so basically he's saying don't take these things too literally just for the devotees for devotion and everything but it's one-sided also it abuses those who differ with its views the following morning the master and m were talking in the garden em then i shall stay here master well you all come here so often he was to spend the night what does it mean people visit a holy man once at most but you all come here so often what is the significance of that and remains silent the master himself gave the reply master could you come here unless you belong to my inner circle so we have this idea of these ishwara koti's these will be those who are already perfect we don't know the real real distinction between all of these things anyhow the term used here is andaranga these antarangas whether it's their first birth with with with takur or they've come before whatever it is uh they're essential to this leela and talkwork considers them as his very own so could you come here unless you belong to my inner circle that means you are all my own relatives my own people like father and son brother and sister i do not tell you everything if i did would you come here anymore he has his role to play there's a [Music] who's going to write down everything one sukadeva went to janaka to be instructed in the knowledge of roman joniga said first give me my fee but said why should i give you the fee before receiving the instruction johnny laughed and said will you be conscious of guru and disciple after attaining brahmagyana that is why i ask you to give me the fee first it was night the moon rose flooding all the quarters with its silvery light and was walking alone in the garden of the temple on one side of the path so the panchavati the buccal grove the nahubat and the master's room and on the other side flowed the ganges reflecting millions of broken moons on its rippling surface em said to himself can one really see god the master says it is possible he says that if one makes a little effort then someone comes forward and shows the way well i am married i have children can one realize god in spite of all that and reflected a while and continued his soliloquy surely one can otherwise why should the master say so why shouldn't it be possible through the grace of god here is the world around me the sun moon stars living beings and the 24 cosmic principles how did they come into existence who was their creator who am i to him life is indeed vain without this knowledge srirami krishna is certainly the best of men in all my life i've not seen another great soul like him he must have seen god otherwise how could he talk with god day and night addressing him so intimately as mother otherwise how could he love god so intimately such is his love for god that he forgets the outer world he goes into samati and remains like a lifeless thing again in the ecstasy of that love he laughs and cries and dances and sings that's the end of that day of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace be on tour and yeah and stream not yet head in and
