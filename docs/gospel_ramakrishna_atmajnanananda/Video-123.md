[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (02/10/23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnOKR1JcN8s)

foreign [Music] Souls they're praised by Poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls and welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of Sharma Krishna we're on page 392 towards the bottom and the Day this Sunday February 14th 1884 the chapter is the master and his injured arm so we saw the last two times How shramakrishna uh went into an ecstatic mood he was outside he fell down and broke his arm and there's a very painful type of thing doctors are coming and putting on a splint in the bandage and other things okay 2m oh we'll find out that this was a very very significant event this breaking up his arm in his in his mind about the change of his spiritual attitude to him since my arm was injured a deep change has come over me I now Delight only in the Lila the human manifestation of God nithya and Leela the nithya is the indivisible and the Leela or sport takes various forms such as the Lila as God the Lila as the deities the Leela as a man and the Leela as the universe this is uh very typical language that geometry uses this idea of nitya and Leela the absolute and the relative but this Leela of course gives this idea of some type of sport and play so I talk with idea was that we're looking at the same thing from two different angles that's all knotted one is a illusory in the other Israel they're both real for him and one is the Transcendent absolute reality and the other is that relative point of view we we have the same thing even within shankaria this is that we can look at something as pure being we can look at it with attributes but one of the same we're looking at it just from two different points of view but for sure Krishna it also meant that to see this nitya his mind would soar to some other realm where he wasn't aware of anything of the external world so what he's saying and he mentioned earlier in the other times that Divine mother was telling him he felt the Divine mother was telling him that you don't have to see me in that ecstatic mood where everything else disappears and you have different Visions so that this Lithia state for Islamic Christian is not necessarily this nearby samadhi or anything that for him it's that said also that state of power where he's experiencing the Divine uh in some Transcendent manner that means not seeing anything with eyes closed he used to say if we see God with a guy's clothes can't we see God with eyes open so this was is a way of saying that and now he would rather see God dwelling within this universe and seeing this universe as a manifestation of God these these two aspects for him represented Lila and this not a Leela this also has has two different meanings that one is to see God dwelling in all living beings human beings especially if they're all living beings and the other is the avatar special manifestation of God in in human form srirama Krishna uses these interchangeably when he talks about this sometimes he's talking about this is special manifestation God manifesting in in all beings is one thing but a special manifestation as the as the Avatar so both of these will generally fall under this category of not a Lila so we have all of these different types this Leela as ishwara that means this Divine Play we have all of these quranic ideas also as the deities that that type of sport uh this if if we want to be very specific about it we can make a distinction between this uh this is Lila of Sri Krishna and this Leela of divine mother he's kind of making a little bit of Distinction like that and one is a develila and the other is not a dealer because one takes place on Earth with the human manifestation and the other in some Divine Realm otherwise he doesn't make any distinction really it's not a very strong type of Distinction and I think the substantiate yeah now this is a very interesting point that for ceramic Christian he says that a very deep change but Tucker always saw God dwelling within human beings he always uh I think that the change is uh is a subtle change he says that a deep change but I think just in in the tendency of his mind and I think we see it more strongly in kashipur and kashipur it was always saying God dwelling within saying uh we have that nice illustration that I like so much that latu is sitting like this and taqwa says you see La too with his chin on his hand I see it Rama alone he would make statements like that so I don't know I don't think that it's uh uh a radical change in his way of thinking I think it's his attitude now is more in that direction that's all the other thing is that he used to say towards the end his mind was going more towards the infinite absolute yeah which which was the sign that he was about ready to give up this uh human body in this in this that Leela on Earth so on one level it's not something new or different yeah yeah but a deep change he says it in several places and as if Divine mother was telling him now don't see me just with eyes closed and with the visions and everything see me dwelling within all the beings so a little shift I would say yeah it may be overstating it when he says a deep change has come over me I now Delight only in another leader now does that mean that after this he doesn't have visions of divine mother and all that he still does but a little bit of a shift huh so Dubai what do you think yeah but for him this this is a a real historical point where he can say that that after that happened after I broke my arm and he really felt that this was a sign from Divine mother so once he says after he they had this vision of Sita his life was mostly suffering the yeah so many many different yeah if if we really want to examine all of the different visions and experiences and how it changed his spiritual attitude yeah he he did go we can do it we may be wrong [Laughter] and maybe our guess yeah uh I think no we I think we can see trends that uh aft after totapari left and he came down they say that the tendency of his mind was to go right back in the nearby Corpus fromati that lasted for a long time until the devotee started to come so I think he did go through these slightly different changes in periods and he always created somebody was a good friend he was he was a spiritual leader and takura respected him very much the uh tradition that that he was a leader of uh was a little bit sketchy they did a little bit of wine drinking and other things and everything but still Taco was a very respectful towards him so he says used to say that one has attained perfect knowledge if one believes in God sporting as man yeah so takur this is not new for him right but this this idea of perfect knowledge I wouldn't admit it then but now I realize that he was right in light pictures of man expressing tenderness and love yeah this uh sect this karta means the guru mostly they they prefer to see God dwelling in human form as the guru it seems to be the uh the tendency that they had even though a lot of it was this rather Krishna and everything to Manila it is God himself who was sporting in the form of man it is he alone who has become money Malik the sheikhs teach the word sachidananda yeah this of course a very very standard wait on the it's not it's not a new idea or anything is it just he feels that it represented a little shift and the direction that his mind was taking now and then catches a glimpse of his real self now just to go back one more time this idea of God dwelling within man uh was was uh the the idea that inspired swamiji more than any other idea and he got it directly from sharami Krishna he says in many places that is through the grace of sir I understood this that the highest worship of God is service of mankind and so yeah it's it's it's not it's not that he didn't have this realization before in this conviction and experience before a little slight change I say now and then man catches a glimpse of his real self and becomes speechless with Wonder at such times he swims in an ocean of Joy it is like suddenly meeting a dear relative to him the other day as I was coming here in a carriage I felt like that at the sight of a baburam Swami premananda sarama Krishna felt was the purest of all the disciples the Purity was very bones so much so that and this is another instance Tucker went through all different phases and sometimes he couldn't touch metal or couldn't touch money at one period when he was in samanti no one could touch him except even even swamiji and uh raccoon and all of the others who he designated as as perfect so as he sort of quotations and everything uh it had to be the barbaran because he was so pure and innocent foreign when Shiva realizes his own self he dances about enjoy exclaiming what am I what am I the same thing has been described in the the Atma ramayana was very very fond of this this text Narada said or Rama all men are thy forms and it is Sita who has become all women when looking at the actors in The Ram Leela I felt that narayana himself had taken these human forms the genuine and the imitation appeared to be the same I shall not go to this was one of Tucker's little Expressions that when he would go to the theater and they would ask or what did you think chaitanya Lila and everything he would say see the actors it was like seeing them it's really seeing chaitanya Devan of it that was the tendency of his mind that even the imitation thing would awaken the idea of the genuine thing now here's a translation I don't like at all it says why do people worship virgins it sounds very strange to me it really means what did they do Kumari Puja this this not really means this is what it says in the in the original is Kumari Puja uh is worshiping the Divine mother in the form of a young girl is not that it's a woman who's remained uh celibate or anything like that it's a pre-adolescent Europe usually five six seven eight something like that that age limit we we remember that haridoy that he wanted to worship a young daughter little girl uh that same way so this is a very standard thing it's not just ramakrishna it's done this is the most important part most popular part at least of the Puja every year where a young girl will be all dressed up and they'll carry her and put her in the chair and everything and they'll they'll actually worship her as uh image of the Divine mother so this uh there's nothing very strange about this it's it it sounds strange but uh so why do people perform this Kumari Puja all women are so many forms of the Divine mother but her manifestation is greatest in pure sold Kumaris we can say young girls those who are pre-adillac sin not just uh girls even boys first ramakrishna those who hadn't reached the age where they had any concept of of sex anything like that that he felt that there was a certain purity of mine before they reached a teenaging age or adolescent age 2m why do I become impatient when I'm Ill because the mother has placed me in the state of a child we've seen this many times that ramakrishna partly because the spiritual attitude that he has as a child of the Divine mother partly because of that and partly because it was just I think his nature is natural to him that he would behave the way a child would behave a young boy and he used to say that this is a one of the signs of the programs likes to keep five-year-old boys near him so that he can feel himself to be the same and almost imitate him to see how Carefree the young children are and everything so this was this was very natural for us ramakrishna he had to have some very strong uh personality traits otherwise his mind would just go straight up would would emerge in the absolute he had to have some way to keep the Mind down and to really feel that his human side so this human nature for him very often uh manifested as as being a boy young boy this and and as it's a very typical of what Taco causes this idea that we look upon God as our very own mother and look upon ourselves as small usually boys women can do it the women the standard thing is looking upon God as their child because we have you show the mother your shoulder it can be done either way but the standard thing usually this is an attitude that very often men will take who worship the Divine mother if they want to worship her in that particular way they have to look upon themselves as small children this is the distinctive feature of this concept of bhava that it involves equally a concept of God and a concept of ourselves and this is why that any time takur undertook any of these these spiritual practices with these different Bahamas vaisnavas and everything that first thing he had to do was was remake his personality re-identify with the ideal worshiper so if you wanted to worship Rama he had to become Hanuman so he did everything he could and dressed like kind of he wrapped his cloth around so it was like a tail in back it would hop from place to place where they live on fruits and things and uh everything so that he could feel himself enter into the mindset of the Hanuman as the ideal servant of Rama so in order to worship the Divine mother according to this type of attitude he had to look upon himself as a child and it became a very natural and natural attitude for him so why do I become impatient when I'm Ill because the mothers placed me in the state of a child the child depends entirely on its mother so look at the difference between Dasia bhava and this is that one stands in one's own feet and says who are I have to do everything to protect the master this is the opposite that I'm the helpless child I have to rely 100 on mother so they're all beautiful spiritual attitudes and they just work better for different people the one of the unique features of ceramic krita's life is that they all worked for him he he would do one after another they and it was never anything forced that once he got into that mood it was 100 in that mood so that was really we don't find this uh manifested this way to this extent anywhere in the religious history of the world that I I know of it really is something remarkable how take attitudes that seem so opposite uh to the worship the Divine mother is mother Kali and then to to worship Ram is is the little baby all these things he none of them caused any type of contradiction in his mind one after the other he could do them and because he knew that they were barbers he knew that this was he used to repeat that all the time that depending on our spiritual mood we'll have some type of realization we'll get something depending on that on that mood if somebody believes that God is is Krishna and nothing else and then they're stuck with that one mode and then they won't have too much sympathy for people with it with another mood those who understand this this whole idea that God the sport takes place in so many different ways and the infinite varieties and everything and they're they're all paths to God realization and then they can enjoy all of them yeah envy and Islam right he didn't really practice Christianity sometimes we say that he listened to some readings from the Bible and he got into that mood and failed that pull in that attraction and then while looking at the painting of the mother and Madonna and child then he had that experience light came out and everything so we can't really say that he practiced it Islam he did practice the Sufi tradition of Islam that was a little bit more of real satana where he would dress like the Muslims and and he would take food actually he wanted a Muslim cook and then the the authorities at the temples said no that's too much so they got a Muslim cook to direct a Hindu I don't know what it means the the style of cooking Is Not So Different yeah I I doubt it reading motherboard who actually isolated him not to eat me because he asked them to provide yeah that I don't know yeah goat made and everything yeah it may have been just cooking with onions and garlic it could have been I've never read anything about the beef certainly huh goats of course yeah no I think it's just the the style a little bit more maybe spices are a little different more on onion probably they didn't cook with onion at the temple his feelings were so intense that he didn't want to enter the Kali Temple yeah he took all the pictures out of his room of the gods and goddesses yeah because he was following the tradition tradition of Islam is there's no uh human representation of God he took all the pictures out wouldn't go to the temple yeah he he did that that was standard with him yeah it was very dangerous he was yeah right and with with uh going into a church he said the mother let me let me look from outside that may be too much for them if I go into church they may ask me to leave the temple [Music] the child depends entirely on its mother the child of the maidservant when he quarrels with the child of the master says I shall tell my mother I was taken to Radha Bazar to be photographed it had been arranged that I should go to rajendra mitra's house that day I heard that Keisha would be there I plan to tell them certain things but I forgot it all when I went to Radha Bazar I said oh mother thou Wilt speak what shall I say now this was I mean there there were certain things that I think especially after his first vision of mother Kali that became standard with him this idea that she was the real operator and he was like a machine that this I think was was something that I remained throughout sometimes he would have different moods but almost always after the different spiritual disciplines of things he would fall back to looking upon God his mother that seemed seemed to be the kind of default setting for him and this idea this because really on some level Ram Prasad was his ideal and this was his attitude and he got from all of the songs yeah Kamala kante is also very similar things but a typical attitude but uh he really almost looked upon Ram Prasad as his prototype he says whether you've revealed yourself direct why not to me you would about a hundred years before previous no come along it was later Ram Prasad was a uh the earlier Century but both were before him yeah I mean a couple of times yeah poet Saints you can say yeah but with Saints Ron Prasad for sure that he had so many visions of the mother and the wonderful death he waited out the gandhis of ways to iron it were chest high and everything passed away yeah so many visions of divine mother so yeah yeah yeah yeah so a poet saying you can say yeah that could be here to see us I have not the nature of a guyani he considers himself great now Yani can either be someone on The Path of Knowledge or someone who would attained wisdom here it'll have to be somebody else on the path maybe they've attained some type of wisdom but the real Yani will have no ego either so this is a little bit uh we have to take it in that sense that he considers himself great he says what how can I be ill coercing once said to me go or sing there was a whole community of of Sikhs that used to visit ramakrishna that they stayed in barakpur and there were a whole division they were all soldiers and Tucker loved them and they were very very uh devoted to him they would all come as a group there was one instance where and if they were all marching and along and they could see the dakshines where they would stop there was one instance when they all wanted to stop and make pranam and and the uh head of the Battalion the Englishman he she said no you can't do that and then somebody warned him he says you you let them do that otherwise they'll they'll kill you yeah so he was very and this coercing uh was I guess one of the spiritual leaders of their group talker liked him very much they had a lot of conversations together they also I guess some time to time had to be in that magazine compound north of the temple so he would see them then and uh yeah there are a lot of nice things there's a very nice article by Swami prabhananda I think about sravakrishna and and the Sikhs I give a talk one time it's very nice there's so many nice incidents so of course seeing once said to me you still worry about your body but it is my nature to believe that my mother knows everything it was she who would speak at rajendra mitra's house hers are the only effective words one ray of light from the goddess of wisdom stuns a thousand Scholars the mother has kept me in the state of a bhakta a vigyani now this is also interesting because I think it's one of the few times when takura equates the two words usually he'll talk about them in separately for him the vignani is someone who's had the highest realization he's gotten to the roof he's realized that perfect Oneness he's transcended everything that nothing in this whole universe disappears in that state and comes back down and usually he talks about uh two different types of vigyanis the one is the follower of The Path of Knowledge and he keeps the ego of knowledge and he talks about shankaracharya and the other is follows the path of devotion and keeps the ego of devotion and that ego of devotion can manifest in dozens of different ways and the child of God servant of God it doesn't matter depending on what one's spiritual attitude is so is every vignani a bhakta in the in a larger sense but still we have that distinction say shankaracharya he had his devotion of course but coming down from that state everything will be soham and this is the universe is a little bit like a dream he can still he could still write beautiful hymns and things like that but the uh the ego of the of the gyani taco used to say is different that he has his own type of ego the Eagle's defective but they're both vignanies they're both free Souls real life Souls we can say even muktas or even higher they're they're perfect Souls but they have to have a certain type of ego to live in the world and if they're devotees it's this devotional type of ego if they're Giannis it can be that ego that I won with that absolute reality that can be their type of ego but it's interesting here that he says the mother has kept in the state of akhta of vigyani that is why I joke with Rock Island the others had I been in the condition of a gyani I couldn't do that now joke with rakal this really means joking to even some off-color jokes and things we don't know exactly what it was but he would have them in stitches they would just be rolling on the ground and left her we don't know exactly what he would do and mimicry and everything he could do all these sorts of things he prayed to the mother don't let me become a drag Yani and a dry sadhu and that prayer was really answered in his life yeah had I been in the condition of igyani I couldn't do that in this state I realized that it is the mother alone who has become everything I see her everywhere now talk with I he would see everything is a manifestation of the Divine mother and he would see the Divine mother drowning Within everyone so two slightly different things we don't have to make a big deal about the difference but he would see this whole physical universe as not a chin mind nothing but this manifestation of Consciousness or manifestation of the Divine mother but when he looked in the eyes of everybody and saw that light coming out that was the direct presence of God dwelling Within so both in inevident inanimate things and also in In Living beings this this uh vision of God so he would say I see everything God has begun everything and I see God in everyone slightly slightly different way of understanding it so I realized that mother alone who has become everything see sometimes he'll say Brahman alone has become everything Eastward alone God alone has become everything this idea of mother alone has become everything makes more sense from a philosophical point of view because mother is also divine nature and Shakti and everything I see her everywhere in the Kali Temple I found that the mother herself had become everything even the wicked even the brother of bhagavat Pandit I don't know who this is right we read that the other day yeah once I was about to scold Ram lao's mother but I had to restrain myself I saw her to be a form of the Divine mother again I did do this Kumari Puja I was a virgin because I see in them the Divine mother my wife Strokes my feet ceramic Christian never referred to holy mother by her name this was a very common thing to to not mention the name of anyone that one has respect their reverence for so taqwa we never hear him talking about always and for holy mother it was almost always that ramble's Aunt that he would refer to it that way and ever since he shot about anything like that for generally a wife won't call her husband by refer to him by his name in front of other people husbands aren't disrespectful as wise but uh any of we talk where he would never do that so sometimes he would say my wife so the holy mother my wife Strokes my feet but I salute her afterwards you salute Me by touching my feet but had freediving here who would have dared to touch them see some sometimes I think we we fail to realize how Freedom really tortured ramakrishna and how uh terrified he was of him when when the holy mother came that one time and redoed insulted her and she said that she's leaving we sometimes think how is it possible that takur allowed that to happen why didn't he stop I think we we really don't understand that he was mortified that he was really the sridori was was would Yes actually torture him he said he tortured him to such an extent not physically that he wanted to drown himself in the Ganga yeah nephew but they were the same age more or less the same age yeah within a year or he thinks something like that yeah but he was big and strong and not very smart and in the beginning did tremendous service but then got very proud because sometimes these attendants that they'll get all puffed up and everything and he was very controlling and so he says that he didn't really didn't like people to touch his feet and everything so it would have been a big problem he wouldn't have allowed anyone to do it I have to return your salutes because the mother has placed me in a state in which I see God in everything you see one could not exclude even a wicked person a Tulsi Leaf however dry or small can be used for worship in the temple now how do we say God dwells within the wicked person that's consciousness as the real self within and not so much all the coverings coverings we can say it's also part of that Leela but if we're talking about really the the divine presence within equally within everyone only this the manifestation of satwa will be different in these great Souls that's a question of the of the the physical make of Mind mental makeup and everything is how how pure hearted they are and how loving and everything the other distinction is uh there may be two people they're both very esotric one has tremendous power used to use that expression there's a distinct difference in in spiritual power we've we've had many great souls in this world who have had God realization we don't know much about them where they had a small following something like that and then some others that are millions hundreds of millions of people will worship them within a hundred years of their passing some type of power spiritual power is there okay that's the end of that day then we go to Sunday March 2nd so this is uh so a week has gone by yeah this now we're going back to M coming on weekends we we had that long period I think 24 days or something when he was with him Sunday March 2nd 1884. suramakrishna was sitting on the small couch in his room listening to devotional music by Terrell kiss Daniel of the Brahma samaj he had not yet recovered from the effects of the injury to his arm which was still supported by a splint many devotees including Narendra Surendra and M were sitting on the floor narendra's father a lawyer of the high court of Calcutta had passed away suddenly he had not been able to make Provisions for the family which consequently faced gray financial difficulties the members of the family sometimes had to go without food Narendra was therefore passing his days in great anxiety some of you I know have seen the ancestral home of swamiji they were very well to do families a big joint family something 55 rooms or something it's a huge place and his father made a good living and everything seemed fine but the father it turned out was supporting all of these relatives who didn't want to work some of them had very bad habits the drinking and other things and it turned out that his father not only gave away most of what but was in debt and the other relatives absolutely took advantage of the situation that because of that they wanted to kick out that swamiji's family her mother and that's wrong with his brothers and I don't know if the sisters were living at home then or or married but anyhow uh the family and it was a terrible thing and it went on throughout swamiji's life huh we we read the very I think the day before he passed away he had to go to to the court to finally settle it one and in particular they had so they had to uh Sue and and everything and anyhow it was it was such a burden on swamiji throughout the rest of his life uh first of all trying to get a job and for some reason uh I I mean he was qualified but he didn't have his degree yet he didn't have a law degree he was still working on it for some reason it was very hard for him to find a job he went from place to place and uh would go barefoot he would lose his shoes and it was a terrible period and he would go without food his uh he would go home his mother would ask did you eat something today and he would lie yeah I took something you you can all eat whatever is there so that the others would have something to eat so it was really a horrible thing and he always had a little bit of this this guilt feeling that he used to say I was nothing but suffering to my mother let me do something for her at the end of her life and everything but what could he do he's a takur laid the whole burden of this whole spiritual movement on the shoulders so what a terrible dilemma that swamiji had to face really we can hardly imagine and at the same time doing intense spiritual practice and having all sorts of realization some audience all sorts of things so this was possible only for for swamiji he was really others helped uh I am and a few others would give a little bit of money finally the lawsuit was settled this Maharaja ketri he used to give money every month M secretly would give a little money and uh foreign yeah then from the West some maybe Josephine McLeod and cerebral that they also helped out but talk we're blessed them they bless the swamiji that your mother family will never want for simple food and clothing so that was more or less passed away that was a big blow because that money stopped also the the one kept that up so somehow managed in swamiji he was very very careful that not a penny that he raised for the work would go personally to his to his mother so none of that could be used all of that handed everything over to uh Raquel for the work so some somehow they managed his other two brothers were never very successful there we go I don't know how long she lived afterwards did anyone remember see our lives Pharmacy of course video somebody no so this was a terrible period for for Narendra and uh he found out who was real friends were also and many of them just kind of gave him up and they're all sorts of rumors came about he was keeping Bad Company all sorts of things it was just a horrible period for him yeah hardly imagine but takur never lost faith in him is somebody they were gossiping about him and this and that and he said don't you talk to about my narender that way in front of me so you you have to there's one other time somebody was criticizing him and then he left and taco said go bring some Ganges water and sprinkle it on that spot where he was sitting and they said why he said don't you know Shiva himself was criticized today there's probably good search and he said I know my and none of these things can be true he never lost faith in him and this he also said I know him he's not such a weird person people thought he's running around with somebody bad character and everything and so they rendered his father a lawyer of the high court of Calcutta had passed away suddenly he had not been able to make Provisions for the family which consequently faced grave financial difficulties the members of the family sometimes had to go without food the renderer was then passing his days in great anxiety now we're going to get a whole bunch of songs and everything so this seems a little bit out of place here but we'll come back to it it'll make sense later we may not get to it today but but this also this also had a little hidden purpose because through this that under the accepted mother Kali that that swamiji asked will you please he says I don't believe in mother but you believe in her so you pray to her now what if funny that means that he he must have had some faith in her yeah but he has to Faith and talk with prayers to Mother he had that some feeling he said you talk to her he did that he didn't know and then Tucker said she doesn't listen to you because you don't accept her she won't listen to me either because you don't accept it so you have to go anyhow that he had that experience in the Kali Temple that night and everything changed and later of course we know that this worship of mother Kali became very important in front of his life he didn't talk about it very much but he would say it's my special fad he used that expression foreign about the Divine mother oh mother I hide myself and thy loving bosom i gaze at thy face and cry out mother mother I sink in the sea of bliss and have lost to sense in yoga sleep i gaze with unwinking eyes upon thy face powerless to turn away oh mother I am terrified by this world my spirit trembles and cries out in fear keep me sweet mother in thy loving bosom cover me with the spreading skirt of thy love these are probably his own songs his own compositions that are looking he started writing about the Divine Mother after coming the ceramic Christian at least one of them he knows his the master said tears of love and cried out army army today again O Lord destroyer of my shame who but thyself can save the honor of thy devotee Thou Art the ruler of my soul my very life support and I thy slave forevermore he continued seeking a shelter at thy feet I have forever set aside my pride of caste and race O Lord and turn my back on fear and shame a lonely Pilgrim On Life's way where shall I go for soccer now for thy sake Lord I bear men's blame they rail at me with bitter words and hate me for thy Love Of Thee both friends and strangers use me ill Thou Art the guardian of my name thou mayest save or slay me Lord upon the honor of thy servant rests O Lord thy name as well Thou Art the ruler of my soul the glow of Love within my heart do with me as it pleases thee once more he sang Lord thou has taken me from home and made me captive with thy love Shield me forever at thy feed o thou beloved one upon the nectar of thy love feed me both day and night and save Prem Das who is thy slave that was this is a pen name the master again shed tears of joy he sang some lines from a song of ram Prasad glorient I don't think this the brahmos they sang These wrong Prasad songs or anything so it must have been his his composition so the master again shed tears of joy he sang some lines for us from a song of ram Prasad glory and shame bitter and sweet are thine alone this world is nothing but thy play then why o Blissful one thus thou cause a rift in it addressing trilokia the master said ah how touching your songs are they are genuine only he who has gone to the ocean can fetch its water was very fond of the trilokia sang again thou it is the dancest Lord and thou that singth the song thou it is that clap is thy hands in time with the music speed but man who is an onlooker merely foolishly thinks it is he though but a puppet man becomes a God if he moves with thee Thou Art the Mover of the machine the driver of the car but man is weighted down with woe dreaming that he is free Thou Art the root of everything thou the soul of our souls Thou Art the master of our hearts through thine unbounded Grace thou turnest even the meanest sinner into the mightiest saint the singing came to an end and the master engaged in conversation with the devotees master God Alone is the master and again he is the servant you know this this goes against everything with this this idea of involvement relationship where we identify fully with the servant and God is completely the master but from this highest point of view this is that that play is not allele it's a play God himself has become both the the the mother and the child so this is this is from the very highest point of view God Alone is the master again he is the servant God dwelling Within has identified with this human body and looks within and sees that divine presence and worships it as a god with all that that play this attitude indicates perfect knowledge at first one discriminate not this not this that means first we have this feeling of Separation that I'm one thing and God is something else and then we try to remove all of the outer coverings to find out the real nature of the self so at first one discriminates not this not this and feels that God Alone is real and all else is illusory so this first ramakrishna this represents a stage in spiritual practice he says this is for the sake of Santana this is for the sake of of climbing this this belongs to the to the stairs to the latter stage he doesn't take this as a final final position at first one discriminates not this not this and feels that God Alone is real and all else is illusory afterwards the same person defines that it is God himself who has become all this see we had before brahmanent itself and we've had the Divine mother herself announcing God himself who has become all this the universe Maya and the living beings first negation and then affirmation so this is that negation is uh in in order to disengage see we falsely identify with everything we have to uh be able to separate this process of discrimination uh find out the real nature of the self in order to see how that self is also the self of the universe and how that can manifest when the mind is mixed up with everything when I think of myself as his mind and body then I can't say I am Brahman I can't uh I I have to work it out from this dualistic point of view so we start out from a dualistic point of view and that gets higher and higher and higher and that starts to to disappear we peel away the outer coverings and everything and we realize Oneness so it is the same thing that vedantic people say in 1880 yeah in the 1880 it's a type of spiritual practice where we have to ask ourselves uh what is the real I Within what is the my real feeling that I have of existing is it based on this physical body is it based on even the mind and personality and we eliminate one by one uh do I have a sense of existence that's free from the senses if I lose my sense of sight am I not the same I if this body turned go to old is it not the same eye we discriminate that way and then realize this I is the real self which is has been the witness of all the changes throughout a whole lifetime that's the real eye so that's that process of 1880 it can be done with the external universe everything is changing but really it is applicable but better uh with this idea of peeling away the the uh all of the upadhis the superimpositions to find the the real substance underlying it this is the view held by the puranas now by the puranas this this will really it'll come to mean here see what he says he means uh devotional and dualistic and ramanuja we call it qualified non-dualism but it's really a dualistic system ultimately there are many jivas and there's a reality to the external world and everything all right so he'll give the example of the Bell fruit and this is a very typical way of looking at things from the point of view of this qualified non-dualism so first negation and then affirmation this is a view held by the Piranhas a filled with fruit for instance includes flesh seeds and shell you get the flesh by discarding the shell and seeds but if you want to know the weight of the fruit you cannot find it if you discard the shell and seeds just so once you detain sachidananda by negating the universe and its living beings that means we have to peel it and we have to get out of the eliminate the seeds and everything to get just the flesh but after the attainment one finds that sachidananda itself has become the universe and the living beings it is of one substance that the Flesh and the shell and seeds are made just like butter and buttermilk it may be asked how is become so hard this Earth doesn't does indeed feel very hard to the touch the answer is that blood and semen are thin liquids and yet out of them come such a big creature as a man everything is possible for God first of all reach the indivisible and then coming down look at the universe you will then find that everything is its manifestation it has got a loan who has become everything The World Is by The World by no means exists apart from him this is this is not different from the edwardic point of view only the attitude is a little different either we we say this is the outcome of Maya or the manifestation of the Divine mother they're not very different if we if we say it's like a dream one will say that means it's unreal another will say that no this is this whole universe uh is is like a dream but a dream is also something that we experience the dream it's not just something to be dismissed we have a dream we experience it we can say that the dream world is just as real as the waking State dream state is just as real as the waking state or we can say the waking state is just as unreal as the dream state the two different attitudes first Ramen Christianity like the other one that the dream is also real so that it's not that uh There's no distinction between this uh Brahman and and the and the universe the universe is a constant state of flux everything will disappear that that's completely recognized but this is also part of that Divine Play it's not something that we can just pretend doesn't exist or is imaginary or an illusion even if it's some type of Illusion where does it come from this is illusion environment alone is the source of everything it has to come from Merlin so I we can we can disregard all of these things I can say that this physical body of mine I'm trying to realize the real nature of the self I'll eliminate it doesn't mean I'm going to kill it I'm going to eliminate this personality I'll I'll try to transcend all of these things but it doesn't mean when I come back down that I'm not a composite of that that real self and this this appearance of the real and the appearance Health belong to one in the same reality they're not two separate things we can't just but we can't we can there there are any who will do that will really pay no attention to the to the world uh they'll just accept it as as the play of Maya but uh even that has to have a source so the the worshipers of the Divine mother they say it it comes from the Divine it should be divine that's all that we we see it as uh as a manifestation of the play play of the mother when we get to the details of it then it becomes hard who is that suffering and mystery and everything the magical Act is as real as the magician yeah so see I talk about talking both both ways he'll say don't get lost in the in in the beauty of the garden try to find the gardener try to find the owner of the garden but he'll also put it the other way that look at the Garden is that is the manifestation of the work of the gardener look it depends if someone is too strong in One Direction he'll push he'll talk the other way uh he'll always correct people foreign yeah and we have to remember that this word real uh has some very strict parameters to it it has to be unchanging it has to be permanent can't be uh the the result of a combination of Parts can't be the the effect of any cause it has to be absolute so uh even the dualists can say this world is is not real from that point of view but it has a reality anyhow these are all not so much philosophical differences as as emphasis is different I think okay we can we can stop here then this is the bottom of page 395. uh not next Friday the Friday after that 24th uh instead of our regular gospel class we have a special guest visitor speaker this is Swami
