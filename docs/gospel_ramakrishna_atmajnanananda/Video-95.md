[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (042922)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6hYCioOzOA)

[Music] your words are like nectar bring life to squirt souls they are praised by poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of sramakrishna last friday we started chapter 15 the last visit to keisha and this was wednesday november 28 1883 and uh keshub lived in just another two or three months after this so this was tucker's last visit and uh the the setting of it is a little bit dramatic first of all i am got there very early and he was pacing back and forth in front of uh that keisha's house and uh he doesn't say anything but it turns out it was the three hours and while he was was waiting he happened to notice that the neighboring house that different people came and everyone was very somber looking and he realized that someone had died and that uh funeral was was about to take place and then when trauma christian finally goes to keshob's place uh they make him wait for a long time because keshob is so ill and he's trying to get ready in and they want to make him look a little presentable and and to have him visit ramakrishnan in the the drawing room and everything and tucker is getting very uh anxious to see him and says what's the reason for all of this let me go and and just see him in this in his own room i don't have to we don't have to keep to any formalities or anything like that and then they start talking to suramar krishna about kesha now he talks to mother divine mother and everything and sram of krishna goes into a bit of an ecstatic mood and then finally when kesha comes it's just as the sun is setting and srama krishna really goes into a deep spiritual mood and jazz kind of a soliloquy talking to himself or to the divine mother however we want to understand it but with hardly noticing who's in the room or anything kashup has come and strong fish is sitting on the floor kesha with great difficulty sitting on the floor in front of him and takur in this highly ecstatic mood is just uh words of wisdom are flowing from his lips in front of keshav and it's really almost like the vision that tupper had in that at the time of death when shiva will come and give that liberating mantra that is if takur is just removing from keshob's mind and the last bit of attachment and just putting him in a deep spiritual mood so the uh the saying is wonderful this is one of the many places in the in the gospel where we can really use this as a kind of meditation just to try to imagine the same to picture sriram krishna hardly aware that kesha was there talking to him somewhat mostly talking to the divine mother so this is where we left things yeah just a constant flow of words how am was able to keep all of this recorded it's really miraculous so this is page 321 and shirami krishna he's yes talking about the highest wisdom not asking keshav how are you doing how do you feel so sorry to see you in this condition nothing like that he who is a brahmin is the adhya shakti the primal energy when inactive he is called brahman the purusa he is called shakti or parakuriti when engaged in creation preservation and destruction these are the two aspects of reality purusa and prakriti he who is the purusa is also prakriti both are the embodiment of bliss if you are aware of the male principle you cannot ignore the female principle he who is aware of the father must also think of the mother keisha bless he who knows darkness also knows light he who knows night also knows day he who knows happiness also knows misery you understand this don't you now srama krishna his mind has come down enough so that he's talking to keshav now not not just talking to the divine mother this of course is one of the great themes in surami krsna's spiritual outlook we can say he loves this idea this really really shocked the ideal tantric idea of seeing a reality in terms of male and female the conjunction the two aspects of that one reality as the male principle which is sometimes thought of shiva female principle the shakti or in the sankhya system is these these terms that he's using are not being used in in any very strict technical sense when takara talks about purusa and parakleti it doesn't mean that oh now he's talking about the sankhya he's these are interchangeable terms for him all of these they all indicate uh that aspect of of the divine which uh has some power to it that aspect which can create this universe and project this universe out of itself and preserve it and withdraw it and the other aspect is the unchanging aspect which is ever present unchanging as this is either brahman and maya according to the vedanta or this buddhism according to the sankey system the tantras will talk about shiva parvati all different ways of understanding it we have three three basic ways of trying to understand this relationship one is that they're side by side this is sankia they'll be side by side the other will be that they'll be inseparable uh but as as a husband and wife or inseparable they'll be they'll be together we have our uh what is it not a narisura krishna he'll talk in those terms sometimes also but for him it's not even two it's not two that are separate or two that are joined together there's only one there's only one so his point of view is that uh when it's active we use a different term for it when it's inactive we use a separate term so the brahman and chakti are not two separate things shakti it's confusing because shakti is using two different senses if we say shakti means power then it's something that power that belongs to brahman if we say shakti is brahman together with its power that means that saguna brahman then it's not in conjunction with with the brahmin it is roman so this is this is that idea of the of the the mother and the woman they're not two different things they're not joined together there's only only the woman who when she has a child his mother also so this is this is the way that taqwa saw the thing this was his world view and if this is true then this prakriti this which also means nature not just divine mother the nature that all of this is is the divine mother herself and taqwa saw everything that way that everything was divine for him everything was a manifestation of that divinity so this this is how we we may think these are all there's fine philosophical points that don't make too much a difference for us they don't make too much difference but for srama krishna it was seeing the divine with eyes open it would just throw me into an ecstatic mood so it was a tremendous import we may think that oh what's the difference the philosophers will argue about these things a little bit that's true to a certain extent but in his ecstatic vision then just just seeing uh a massive people would throw him into ecstasy i mean everything was was a manifestation of the divine for him the ishta devata can be anything uh in the devotional schools it depends which schools in the in the divisional schools it'll be rama krsna's something like that a shock to school uh so there's there's nothing very particular about that that uh the ishta devata generally we think of ishta david as a personal god uh those who like to meditate on the infinite absolute reality it won't be the same type of dualistic meditation picturing the dwelling within the heart it'll it'll be more the soham i am that we can say that brahman can be the ishta devata but it's not a very conventional way of speaking usually it's some manifest form some some tangible form that we can have some devotional relationship with so keshav replies yes sir i do the question was he who knows happiness also knows you understand this don't you in case of yes sir i do master my mother who is my mother now one thing that we'll we'll quickly learn is that suramar krishna had a very highly sophisticated philosophical understanding of this idea of the motherhood of god and at the same time an equally deep personal relationship with the god as mother and in the most intimate possible way we can imagine where she would speak to him and supply him with all of the words that he had to say that she would guide him in every way he felt that she dwelled within the heart making him do whatever he did the most intimate type of personal god relationship that we can imagine together with the highest philosophical understanding how both of these things worked at the same time with him is really this is a mind-boggling thing so who is my mother ah she is the mother of the universe it is she who creates and preserves the world who always protects her [Music] so look at this she's creating the whole universe at the same time each and every deputy who feels that that she's my very own mother so he looks upon the divine mother as the embodiment of all power we can say kali something like that at the same time he looks upon the divine mother as a small child looks upon its own mother yes that's what we fall we start to cry we uh all we want is to go to the mother and have her take us in our arms and and uh smooth and caress us and make us feel better than mother so she was both to him so it is she who creates and preserves the world who always protects her children and who grants whatever desire whatever they desire dharma moksha that's a mother that we can ask anything of see taqwa is very particular when he prays he would say i only prayed for pure devotion i won't pray for anything else that i'll give up anything just i want pure devotion at the same time the small child can ask his mother anything and all of these beautiful songs around prasad and the little stories that taco tells how the child will target the mother and say mommy i want this i want this until finally she she gives it so for both of these things are true that who do we turn to those who the mother is everything for them who do they turn to if they if they're in danger or if they need something they'll also pray to mother we have this dilemma sometimes then within the monks of the order devotees of the order that uh we want to rely fully on god and pray to god for anything at the same time we want to ask only for pure devotion what do we do so you know the answer that we get many times pray to taqwa only for pure devotion pray to holy mother for anything because taka and holy mother this is our brahmanan shakti non-different but the attitude can be a little bit different that's all so is she who creates and preserves the world who always protects her children and who grants whatever they desire dharma a true son cannot live away from his mother the mother knows everything the child only eats drinks and makes merry he doesn't worry himself about the things of the world there are many advantages to worshiping god as mother one is that we free ourselves completely from worry and anxiety that this full reliance on on mother means that she'll do whatever has to be done for us we don't have to think about anything if we really feel helpless in the world we really feel that uh unless mother helps me to do it i won't be able to do anything then uh whatever happens we take is is the work of the mother so this is why tucker always talks about the the kitten was equally happy when the mother cat puts it in the fireplace in the ashes of course not when the fire is going but in the ashes or on the master's bed sitting on the pillow lying on the pillow equally happy because this must be the best place for me this is where mother put me so the devotee who follows this taco calls it the attitude of the of the child to the mother uh has this automatic surrender and acceptance and contentment contentment and yes always feels protected never feels alone mother is always there we have that beautiful song that my mother is there i'm her child and i'm there so what is what is there to worry about there's nothing to worry about and mother is there so this is the attitude that takwe had and that we see towards the end that keshav also has this attitude now relying fully on on the mother the mother knows everything the child only eats drinks and makes merry he doesn't worry himself about the things of the world kesha yes sir it is quite true while talking srama krishna regained the normal consciousness of the world we can see slowly coming down because in the beginning he's just this talking to the divine mother and then with others there he's starting to talk to keshav but still in that ecstatic mood coming down to the normal plane of consciousness is not our normal plane of consciousness he's still seeing god everywhere still that exalted state but at least he's now on for him the normal state so srama krishna regained the normal consciousness of the world with a smile on its earth that means he can see everything he knows who's in the room aware of things with a smile on his face he conversed with queso the ruined room full of men watched them eagerly and listened to their words everybody was amazed to find that neither keshav nor the master inquired about each other's health they talked only of god mastered the kesha why do the members of the brahmo-samaj dwell so much on god's glories is there any great need of repeating such things as o god thou hast created the moon the sun and the stars most people are filled with admiration for the garden only how few care to see its owner who was greater the garden or its owner now if if we didn't have the example of swami krishna and teachings we would assume that the owner will never be seen i mean who who really thinks that god is is uh is something that can be available to us to have some direct vision of course vision doesn't mean seeing with these eyes or or ordinary understanding but he brought this this is another gift he gave to the brahma-samaj and really to all of us that the experience of god is tangible that it's something that is is life-shattering it's something that i will this is why when he said to narendra yes i've seen god i've seen god more tangibly than i'm seeing you the deeper stronger types of experience that this is a real if we understand that then of course we'll we won't care so much for seeing the garden we'll want to see the the person who who made the garden the owner of the garden so this is this is uh what tucker is telling them because the brahma-samajis they didn't have this this idea that god realization is is not just the goal of life but it's something that is that it's possible it's possible it's a rare thing of course but taqwa gave us that faith that this can be done and will be done eventually by everyone and this is something that is is the one thing worth striving for in this life because it's the one permanent thing one thing that will remove all of our dowel and our misery and our anxiety and suffering and everything and the whole reason why we go through all of this we're in this world to to lose our attachment to see the attractions of the world is is so meaningless next to the reality of the divine so he says who was greater the garden or its owner after a few drinks at a tavern do i care to know how many gallons of wine are stored there one bottle is enough for me we we see so many times when trauma krishna goes into this ecstatic mood that the almost the only way we can explain it is the type of intoxication this term un-mada or mata this is mad it also means intoxicated mother is wine the drink and everything so in many religious traditions that this is one of the few ways that we can understand that god intoxicated state as if one has drunk too much and says you know and for ceramic because he would actually wobble back and forth like a drunkard and sometimes he would tell his his disciples no don't hold on to me now they'll think that i'm drunk but he would really stagger like like someone who had too much to drink so it was a very apt uh illustration about after a few drinks at a tavern do i care to know how many gallons of wine are stored there one bottle is enough for me when i met narendra i never asked him who is your father how many houses does he own there were one or two exceptions huh it was tarak swami shivananda or was it with the shashi one of shashi swami shivananda because his father yeah his father because he admitted his father his father came he was a great tantric devotee and so because he said yeah for some reason i feel like asking you that i normally don't do that now with swamiji he didn't ask us simple things who was your father where do you live these are just niceties these are not very important but we remember the meeting in jodhu malik's house when he really wanted to know from swamiji not who father but who are you who are you really and why have you come to this earth how long will you live well he asked him all of those questions and he got all of the answers that he was expecting to get and he realized that his vision of swamiji was real and true that swamiji was born to do tucker's work and he doesn't say too much but probably knew that he wouldn't live long he used to say when he knows his real nature and i take that to mean when he knows his mission in life that why he came as a companion of srama krishna then he'll refuse to live in the body any longer and he only lived as long as he did because tucker put that little spell of maya on him otherwise he could have cast off his body almost any time he was he was of a different nature swamiji shall i tell you the truth man loves his own riches and so he thinks that god loves his too he thinks that god will be pleased if we glorify his riches once shambhu said to me please bless me that i may die leaving my riches at the lotus feet of god i answered these are riches only to you what riches can you offer god to him these are mere dust and straw once a thief broke into the temple of vishnu that means they rather come to temple and stole sorry and robbed the image of its jewels and i went to the temple to see what was the matter mature of course was he was a proprietor he was the manager the one in charge of all the temple doings and everything all of the priests and everyone the temple officers they all worked under him addressing the image mutter said bitterly what a shame lord you were so worthless the thief took all the ornaments from your body and you couldn't do a thing about it thereupon i said to shame on you how improper your words are to god the jewels you talk so much about are only lumps of clay lakshmi the goddess of fortune is his consort do you mean to say that he should spend sleepless nights because a thief has taken your few rupees you must mustn't say such things can one ever bring god under control through wealth he can be tamed only through love yeah this is a very common day what was the temple one of the temples maybe 10 15 years ago they they dug up and they found somewhere in the south tirupati was it huh [Music] oh and i don't think even another one oh i went there yeah oh and they found just a fortune in things that people had given uh very expensive gold jewelry and everything that somehow people thought they'll get tremendous amount of merit by by giving very expensive things there and just worth millions of dollars i don't know it is for the fortune is in bengali there's a nice story about this temple with uh you know about that towards the end of his life he uh some somehow he he must have gone there and uh he he asked them to bring a picture of it and they kept it on his wall and then he said in this hong kong this is a image of mother kali that now you have to give offerings at night to the jackals sheba the jackals to come and and he would ask did they get did the jackals take it and they said no they left these oh you're giving me the wrong things you have to give some me lucci and goldman it's very interesting i won't say he got seen at the end but towards the end of his life you know is this his imagination [Music] what's that yeah he had some vision of course but uh he he got it into his head that they had to do offerings every night to the jackals who were the companions of mother kali [Music] so can one ever bring god under control through wealth he can be tamed only through love what does he want certainly not wealth he wants from his devotees love devotion feeling discrimination and renunciation yeah these are all these are called the treasures all of these things somebody one looks on god exactly according to one's own inner feeling take for instance a devotee with a with an excess of dumbest he thinks that the the divine mother eats gold so he slaughters one for her again the devotee endowed with rajas cooks rice and various other dishes for the mother but the satwik devotee doesn't make any outer show of his worship people don't even know he is worshiping if he has no flowers he worships god with mere ganges water and the leaves of the bell tree his food offering to the deity consists of sweetened puffed rice or a few candies occasionally he cooks a little rice pudding for the deity he he always saw that same divine presence within everyone and yet he was also so aware of the personality distinctions and things and and how uh some will have uh an excess of thomas budd he would talk about the bhakti of thomas the bhakti of rajas that they could also be good devotees that everyone has a different nature and they express their their devotion in different ways it is interesting that he wasn't very fond of the roger type of devotion where there's a lot of show and uh wearing silk cloth and all the things but thomasic type of devotion he loved the the the way of the dakoid you would say that your mother revealed yourself to me or i'll uh i'll kill you or i'll cut my throat that you have to do it the force the demand he somehow he liked that attitude and of course the southwick attitude that he used to say the less people know about our spiritual practices the better that there's a great tendency to not show off exactly but they know that we spend a long time in spiritual practice a little bit of satisfaction comes that oh they'll have a high opinion of us that we're real devotees this and that he said they're very harmful that the less people know people think see the example of the satwik devotee is people think that he overslept he gets up early and stays in his room and meditates on his bed under the mosquito curtain and nobody knows anything and he doesn't care he doesn't you know he'll never say yeah of course i got up early i was in my room you think i just sleep late doesn't care so that's the thought to it liberty there is also another class of devotees those who are beyond the three gunas they have the nature of a child their worship consists in chanting god's name just his name so we see in tucker's case that he exhibited a little bit of everything of course the rajisik not much we don't find that but definitely this the satwik type of worship rajasik if we want to say i mean he did the formal puja at one time but it was never the way that he explains it this thomas this this uh he had that attitude mother you have to reveal yourself to me animal sacrifice didn't get too much involved as there were times when uh i think one one kali puja night it wasn't done or something and tucker said you have to keep the customs of the of the temple the way things were started he understood it uh a period came where he he couldn't be present he couldn't couldn't watch it he couldn't bear to watch it and he used to say at that time even to cut a lemon i could do it with great difficulty saying joy kali so yeah he grew up with it i mean this this was part of the culture in bengal balidan you know that of course and uh so he was never a reformist who said that we have to outlaw all of these things these are barbaric and everything he understood that this was people with this domestic nature and thomasic attitude that this is how they felt that this was their offer actually goes back to the vedic period these all can all be traced back to the early vedic period when the animals were sacrificed goats were they were tied to a post and there were all sorts of things like that so it's it's not something that we think is just some aberration that how it got introduced that it's so much against the tradition it has its roots in the old vedic period in the young yids and things but he took no joy in it yeah and then this uh the devotee was beyond the three ghouls as the nature of a child this was really uh the default attitude of sramakrishna even when he did all of the other spiritual practices he did these other things he he took the attitude of the mother looking upon god as a child with ramallah and the dossier he did feeling himself to be like another one but we see after all of the different practices he seemed to go right back to looking upon god's mother so that seemed to be the most natural attitude for him he liked all of them practiced all of them but that was the one that resonated resonated most with him i would say ducatia with a smile why is it that you were ill there is a reason for it many spiritual feelings have passed through your body therefore it has fallen ill at the time an emotion is aroused one understands very little about it the blow that it delivers to the body is felt only after a long while i've seen big steamers going by on the ganges at the time hardly noticing their passing but oh my what a terrific noise is heard after a while when the waves splash against the banks perhaps a piece of the bank breaks loose and falls into the water tucker uses this illustration in a second sense he talks about these great souls that come and make a big commotion and they get a big following something like kesha and he said but with the avatar it's a different thing it's like the big steamer that has to be in the middle of the river the others can come close to the bank and that and the waves come the wake of it will come and everyone will see it but this big steamer by the time those waves come the steamer's out of sight so this is why the avatar is all mostly not recognized during his lifetime but the effects are tremendous afterwards so he uses that illustration both ways yeah uh kako used to say that uh this this human frame for most people is is not capable of withstanding the higher types of of baba mahabharata all of these things just uh he'll give the illustration here an elephant entering a hut creates havoc within and ultimately shakes it down the elephant of divine emotion enters the hut of this body and shatters it to pieces so when tapper talks about this aadhar this is this is one of his favorite uh illustrations the size of a container so for someone like uh swamiji narendra then uh he says another time when an elephant goes to a big reservoir you hardly see splattering of water in the small one that'll be so uh somewhere like swamiji he could withstand the tremendous spiritual emotions and and samantha and all these different things whereas for others it would be too much and even pharmaceutically is his health failed partly because of that especially that visit to omarnot we we know that that was probably the most earth-shattering and physically shattering experience that he ever had when he went into the temple of omar not and had the vision of the shiva lingam and everything that uh after that is his heart expanded and uh the blood clot in one eye you could hardly see after that in one eye and uh all because of that spiritual emotion from that one experience so he's telling keshav he's trying to explain he'll give two different reasons one all of these spiritual emotions and the other mother is is ridding him of every last bit of karma before he goes we'll get to that do you know what actually happens when a house is on fire at first a few things inside burn then comes the great commotion just so the fire of knowledge at first destroys such enemies of spiritual life as passion anger and so forth then comes the turn of ego and lastly a violent commotion is seen in the physical frame you may think that everything is going to be over but god will not release you as long as the slightest trace of illness is left you simply cannot leave the hospital if your name is registered there as long as the illness is not perfectly cured the doctor won't give you a permit to go why did you register your name in the hospital at all all left keisha was uh he was a very special soul and tucker looked upon him that way but topper knew that he had his few little things he had this little desire for name and fame and to have an organization and all of these these things and what he's trying to say is that you you won't get released until all of these things are burned up and this illness was really allowing him i would i would think allowing him to to have that ultimate liberation somehow that he she's saying that you're not going to be released that means that there'll be more physical suffering and everything but this is a very nice way if we we see people suffering at the end we can feel how much of the karma is being burned up before they give up the body we wonder sometimes why there's so much suffering at the end so at least one way we can get a little bit of consolation when we when we have to see that suffering so when he said why did you register your name in the hospital hospital at all all that keshav laughed again and again at the master's illusion to the hospital then shiramakrishnan spoke of his own illness to kesha freda used to say never before have i seen such ecstasy for god and never before have i seen such illness i was then seriously ill with stubborn diarrhea it was as if millions of ants were gnawing at my brain but all the same spiritual talk went on day and night dr rama of natagur was called in to see me he found me discussing spiritual truth what a madman he said nothing is left of him but a few bones and still he is reasoning like that yeah srirami krishna had a very weak stomach power of digestion and everything and suffered from dysentery so many different times and how and why he was able to come back from that six months in samadhi that that whole period a very odd thing for us to understand where everybody else was and what was going on at that time and why some wandering monk had to come and try to feed him every day and uh it's to me very mysterious that period maybe friday had was gone at that time but everyone was there the other temple priests and everything but somehow they say that this wandering monk came and kept his body alive and everything and how the mind came back uh we have two things at the same time one of course he heard the voice of the divine mother remained in bahamuka but then he also said that his body came down with his dysentery and the pain was so tremendous that he brought the mind back to the body consciousness that that so maybe that was how the divine mother did it i don't know exactly but uh but throughout his life he he used to have this problem with digestion and everything a dysentery masked master ducatio all depends on god's will o mother all is done after thine own sweet will thou art in truth self-willed redeemer of mankind thou workest thine own work men only call it theirs the chocolate is the famous rampersad song in order to take full advantage of the dew the gardener removes the soil from the rose down to the very root the plant thrives better on account of the moisture perhaps that is why you too are being shaken to the very root keshav and the master laughs it may be that you will do tremendous things when you come back now i don't know why tucker says that does he think that maybe he'll recover from this it's very hard to to know well what's in his mind at that time we would assume that he knows it's the final illness but uh doesn't mean when he comes back reborn again or uh is not at all clear what he means and why he says it exactly is he trying to give keisha a little bit of hope i really don't know why he says this but this is that idea being shaken to the root so that all of this the last drop of attachment of the attachment and desire for name and phase all of these things the last bit of that will just be completely rooted out and then he'll be released from the hospital that means he'll be freed from this this song it will be able to go back to where he came from his real abode whenever i hear that you are ill i become extremely restless after hearing of your last illness i used to weep to the divine mother in the small hours of the morning i prayed to her oh mother if anything happens to keshav with whom then shall i talk in calcutta coming to calcutta i offered fruit and sweets to the divine mother with a prayer for your well-being the devotees were deeply touched to hear of srama krishna's love for keshav and his longing for the brahmo leader master but this time to tell the truth i didn't feel anxious to that extent only for two or three days that i feel a little worried now does it mean that he thinks that he'll recover or does it mean that he's resigned no that he knows this is the final illness so keshav's venerable mother came to the east door of the room the same door through which keshav had entered umanat said aloud to the master sir here is mother saluting you srama krishna smiled omanat said again mother asked you to bless kesheb that he may be cured of his illness master to keshav's mother please pray to the divine mother who is the bestower of all bliss she will take away your troubles now for one thing the takur didn't like to take the role of the guru he used to say guru baba karta these three words he couldn't bear them that's just stung by a horned fish i very rarely would he would he say outright that yes i bless you you would say the lord himself holy the divine mother will bless you and everything at the same time it can also be that how can he order these words when he knows that kesha won't live and we'll get the story of the the doctor he knows that he won't survive so he's saying that pray to the divine mother she will take away all your troubles does that mean she'll save kesha he's going to die eventually but praying to the divine mother at least some comfort may come to keshav don't spend long hours in the inner apartments you will sing down and down in the company of women in her apartments in those days they had a little bit of it they called it this was the muslim term that the women had their own separate inner apartments where they stayed so that they couldn't freely mix with each other but out of sight of the men and even at that time in kolkata they had that tucker would almost always when he went to somebody's house the women could see they'd be in a room they could look and see him but then when it came time to eat he would go and spend time with them so they could get his company off so we don't know what he said because am wasn't there all we know is that they loved him and he was so fond of them and had that very sweet special relationship with them that lost to us unfortunately because am was not allowed to go back there he would go on his own sometimes they would hear laughter and everything and so he was very free with them we we don't get that picture just because em couldn't be there at that time but he's telling him that now is the time you're facing death don't let the mind get attached again you will feel better if you hear only talk of god the master uttered these words in a serious voice and then began to laugh like a boy he said to keshob let me see your hand he waited playfully like a child at last he said no your hand is light hypocrites have heavy hands all left yeah tucker used to do this it was quite a common thing he would say let me fill your hand i don't know we could tell umanat again said to the master from the door mother asks you to bless keisha master gravely what can i do god alone blesses all then he quotes again from the song thou workest thine owned work men only call it theirs now he'll give this very harsh truth god laughs on two occasions he lasts when two brothers divide land between them they put a string across the land and say to each other this side is mine and that side is yours god laughs and says to himself why this whole universe is mine and about a little clod they say this side is mine and that side is yours then we get the second half of this god laughs again when the physician says to the mother weeping bitterly because of her child's desperate illness don't be afraid mother i shall cure your child the physician does not know that no one can save the child if god wills that he should die all are silent so it seems clear to me that tucker knew this is the final illness doesn't know exactly how long it'll be of course but uh and he's preparing and he wants gaza to prepare his mind for that final journey just then kesha was saved seized with a fit of coughing which lasted for a long time the sight of his suffering made everyone sad he became exhausted and could stay no longer he bowed low before the master and left the room holding to the wall as before some refreshments had been arranged for the master keshov's eldest son was seated near him umrita introduced the boy and requested srama krishna to bless him again asking for blessings the master said it is not given to me to bless anyone with a sweet smile he stroked the boy's body gently now in india when they ask to bless somebody very often they don't mean say yes i bless you that means put your hand on him if you put put your hand on the head and tuck his case now he's rubbing the body so they're kind of laughing he just said no i won't bless anybody but they see by doing that he's blessing him with a smile all right then do as you please so he's he's satisfied that tucker has given his blessings master to the devotees i cannot say such a thing as may you be healed i never asked the divine mother to give me the power of healing i prayed to her only for pure love is keisha of a small person now he's he's kasib is no longer there this is all for the benefit of the family members and the very close disciples and devotees of kesha now he's really trying to console them in case of a small person he is respected by all seekers after wealth as well as holy men once i visited dayananda who was then staying at a garden house diana in those days was probably one of the two or three most famous spiritual leaders in india the artist yeah diana and keshav and one or two others so he was a real renowned figure in those days i saw he was extreme so he's going to show that even he how much he respected kesha i saw he was extremely anxious about keshav's coming he went out every few minutes to see whether he had arrived i learned later on that keisha had made an appointment with appointment with him that day keshav i understood had no faith in the sacrifices and the deities mentioned in the vedas yeah the diana uh idea was some somehow to revive the old vedic tradition with the fire sacrifice hublins and things like that which involved the vedic deities not so much with the modern puja and image worship or things like that this in place of image worship things were offered into the fire so this was their version of a reformed society parallel to the brahma-samaj in bengal so they shared things in common with keshav keshav i understood had no faith in the sacrifices and the deities mentioned in the vedas referring to this said why the lord has created so many things could he not make deities as well good point continuing the master said keshav is free from the pride of a small-minded religious teacher to many people he has said if you have any doubts go there to have them solved that means this really krishna he sent so many people to talk with it is my way too to say what shall i do with people's respect that kasem's virtues increase a million fold keshav is certainly a great man see kesha was one of the very few of the members of the brahmos so much who would know jealousy that he he loved srama krishna bj goswami also with some of the others we see a little bit of jealousy they wanted to to have everyone feel that oh no kesha was the one who influenced ramakrishna not the other way around and how much talk were learned from him and how great he was a little bit of that type of feeling and then some of them uh later with the swamiji also there's the tremendous resentment for not respecting keshav or joining their group or anything and a very funny type of attitude kasim didn't have that at all thus detroit krishna praised kesha before the latter's disciples after partaking of the refreshments the master was ready to leave the brahmo devotees accompanied him to the cab which was standing in the street while coming down the stairs the master noticed that there was no light on the ground floor see they were all wrapped in attention with listening to ramakrishna i'm sure completely unconscious of how late it was getting in the dark outside and everything like that no one had lit to live he said to amrita and keshav's other disciples these places should be well lighted a house without light becomes stricken with poverty please see that it doesn't happen again then srama krishna left for dakshineshwar with one or two devotees okay we can stop here this is uh we're still in the same chapter but now he leaves keisha we get a a little bit of a different topic here uh he's on his way back to dakshineshwar from keshob's cottage and he's going to make it suramar christian will make a stop at joy gopal sen's house there were so many devotees in calcutta that taco would would stop and pay visits to and many of them were members of the brahmos homage and they used to invite him when they had festivals and things and uh so he's going to make us stop there okay we'll also stop [Music] [Music] we bow our heads before srama krishna who was stainless of infinite nature whose hearts meld in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace this
