[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (10/01/21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52fXw1IzvJ4)

[Music] foreign your words are like nectar bringing life discord souls they are praised by poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls good evening everyone we are reading from the gospel of srama krishna the chapter the festival at and this is saturday july 21st 1883 we're continuing it's i mentioned before it's all in the same chapter festival in panihati but the festival was actually on june 18th and there's some other there's a july 14th and a july 21st entry also so this is what we're what we're up to sri ramakrishna had come with ram lal and one or two other devotees from dakshineshwar and they were actually going to make several visits that day and happened to be walking there and they saw him and they said come on and get hop in we're going to others house so they went to otto's house and yeah the initial conversation was in the carriage itself okay this is page 260. carriage came to the crossing at shobha bazaar in calcutta the master continued saying sometimes i find that the universe is saturated with the conscious consciousness of god as the earth is soaked with water in the rainy season this is really a very beautiful beautiful image especially we know how much rain comes in the rainy season and how everything is just saturated you can walk uh on the open field and feel the water like a sponge coming back up so this was this was that vision that tucker had where he would see everything as chinmaya everything is is endowed with consciousness or sometimes he would say that this is i see the divine mother manifest everywhere different ways of of understanding it and different experiences but this was not a philosophical position with srama krishna it was an experience he actually saw and felt and realized the essential nature of this universe to be not what we take it to be of course we don't know anything about this universe what we get through the senses all comes through the mind and we only get the appearance we only see the outside of things what the the thing is the thing in itself is something that is never uh available to perception it's something that uh we speculate about but these these mystics they would have some special vision where they would feel and they would see this consciousness of god he says so that divine consciousness or sometimes the divine shakti whatever it is you would see that pervading everything as the earth is so soaked with water in the rainy season well i see so many visions but i never feel vain about it and with the smile that you should speak of vanity sir master upon my word i don't feel vanity even in the slightest degree em there once lived a man in greece socrates by name a voice from heaven said that he was wise among men socrates was amazed at this revelation he meditated on it a long time in solitude and then realized its significance he said to his friends i alone of all people have understood that i do not know anything but every man believes he is wise in reality all or ignorant socrates was the father of western philosophy all of western philosophy they say goes back to either sometimes they say aristotle or plato but socrates we know because of the dialogues he had with plato so these were the ancient greek philosophers and they really started everything they started the whole democracy in the government and other things the ancient greek civilization was with something amazing [Music] yes they had the content the concept of atman or the soul this is something that is not so unusual almost every they had they had a belief in reincarnation transmigration of the soul the the distinct feature of vedanta especially the vedanta is that the same self in all beings and and one with a brahman that probably they didn't have exactly it was more this idea of all the individual souls that dwelling within the body it will give up the body and take another body what we read in gita so they called it transmigration of souls and plato and all the platonic philosophy they they stress this very much this is how it actually came into early christianity the influence of plato and plutarnus and others then it kind of dropped out a little bit master and now and then i think what is it i know that makes so many people come to me was a great pandit he used to say to me i can find in the scriptures all the things you talk about but do you know why i come to you i come to hear them from your mouth the variation of charan he is a very interesting character he was one of the early pundits who came many in the there were different waves that came to see swami krishna in their very early period the pundits came and then later the brahmos came then his direct disciples came but of all the the pundits who came uh many of them developed a kind of friendship with srama krishna some were greatly inspired by him uh one of them which one was it actually renounce the world i can't think of his name now uh anyhow but there's a vision of chad and they had a friendship and tucker would go to different places with him sometimes and he was leader of one of these uh sect one of the different sects there they did funny things with it with uh with the tanking wine and men and women together and everything uh but thakur didn't why he was innocent like a child and and he quotes him many times that some of the great teachings of takur he'll say the vaisnavcharan said this you know i heard this from his lips or he said when you realize this is not a leelah seeing god in men the highest way of worshiping god then you'll realize that the highest truth so he would say yeah now i know vaisnav chatham was right this is taco humility it's a very interesting how he he loved to to give a source for everything and there were some people we don't know too much about them that they don't seem to have played a very important role but he'll always he'll always do it uh what is his teaching about uh giving a twist to the passions he said he heard this from one get in there somebody and then he'll say the wanderings i'll do for a mercy kiss that he said from from uh from benares and you give up the body after 21 days all these different things he would quote sources but he realized them that was the difference and uh because he realized these things then they had a different impact when he would talk about them this is what vaishav chatter was saying m all your words tally with the scriptures goswami also said that said that the other day at the festival at pani hati you told us that day that by repeating the word gita a number of times one reverses it and it becomes tagi which means renunciation this of course was the totopuri's teaching like we have this mantra so uh saying that or totopuri really and tuck were accepted of course that the essential teaching of the gita is renunciation now we shouldn't take this to mean this formal renunciation because gita actually is a little bit i won't say anti but in but in the context in the context of of the battle and and talking to akshatri and everything he praised the mental renunciation more than external renunciation and he said that those who can renounce everything mentally that means have no attachment to the fruit of action do everything as an offering that these are the best sannyasis the sannyasi and a yogi not those who simply give up this this cloth and don't do anything no ritual or anything like that verse chapter 6 verse first verse is very important verse and otherwise the renunciation in the in the gita is the renunciation while performing duty while performing duty it's not the same emphasis that shankaracharya will give of really formally renouncing and removing oneself from society and everything it's it's a type of renunciation within the world and uh this is also uh what krishna taught to his householder disciples and interestingly enough this is what swamiji taught to the monastic order to not withdraw from the world but to uh to serve to uh do with the social service to worship god dwelling within all beings anyhow krishna goes on renunciation is the essence of the gita noble goswami this is am speaking supported your statement from the grammatical standpoint now this is a very uh unimportant point but he's saying that if you repeat the gita it becomes doggy it doesn't become tiagy in bengali there's not much difference in the pronunciation tagi and tagi but he said that this is but there's also a root thug which will give doggy i don't know i've never seen it or anything with anyhow this is really not the point of it whether the grammar is right or not the idea is a beautiful idea the the essence of gita's renunciation this is also what holy mother said about shiramakrishna that somebody they were talking to her about taco's teachings and she says yes everybody says that his man contribution was the harmony of religion but i find that his main teaching was renunciation the most gave that that stress renunciation of the ego and pride and everything and the selfishness and doing everything is an offering leading a dedicated life that type of pronunciation the master still speaking to him have you found anyone else resembling me any pundit or holy man em god has created you with his own hands whereas he has made others by machine all others he is created according to law master laughing to ramallah and the other devotees listen to what he is saying suramar christian laughed for some time and said it last really and truly i have no pride no not even the slightest bid yeah there's so many stories that we hear how taquer early morning he would be going to pick some flowers for puja and everything and some a rich man would come and they would think he was the gardener and say oh can you pluck some flowers for me it was uh yeah sure he would do it it didn't care didn't didn't want respect from anybody or anything why did he ask all the time what do you think about him yeah why did he ask this is the way he could judge the uh intelligence and and the spiritual maturity of the people how how much spiritual insight they had how much spiritual insight they had that because he looked like an ordinary person he nothing so special about him even his dress he didn't dress like a sanyasi or anything and many people went and they thought he was a madman or they weren't impressed so it wasn't that his feelings would be hurt or anything he knew that in order to recognize a holy person one has to also reach a certain stature so this was his way of testing them em knowledge does it's good in one respect at least it makes us feel that we do not know anything that we are nothing so this goes back to that humility and to that socrates thing this is really true that uh if we if we really delve deeply into some of these the philosophical questions and think very deeply about these questions was this world created did it is it spontaneous is there a god behind it do we have free will who's in charge all of these types of questions what's the point of anything why is there evil in the world we go deeply into all of these questions and we realize that we can't answer them we can't answer them we can come up with answers that are more or less satisfying but we're not going to come up with a definitive answer that will solve the problem forever and that everyone will accept we'll develop an attitude and a certain understanding a world view that works for us and we like it and it's helpful and and we see that it makes sense and and uh it fits in with with uh circumstances that take place but is it the only explanation for things no even takur he'll talk about everything as well of the mother and then he'll say but if you eat chilis won't your tongue burn that means karma is there also the type of cause and effect is there other times they'll say just to play you know all different possible explanations but we we realized that these aren't the result of of some perfect logical system that takes into account every factor and we can say yes that is absolutely true it's not like the theoretical mathematics or anything like that it is more like uh the social sciences different theories and things that work better at different times and different models and everything we we look at uh the weather report we have the european model and the american model and different things and they'll give slightly different forecasts some will be a little better some will be a little bit worse or economics all these different models that we can use to try to predict the future sometimes we're 100 wrong brilliant people brilliant people can take all the factors in and use their model and and plug everything in and they'll and it'll be wrong we've no we have no way of knowing really what uh how how cause and effect works so this is a very important stage i think in spiritual life when we can finally say okay i'm not going to bother about this anymore i'm not going to count the leaves till i can come up with the definitive number of leaves on the trees that uh this isn't what it's about there's no the final authoritative answer and uh i'll i'll have a spiritual attitude that works for me i won't care if it's objectively true or not and these other things i i won't bother with this is this is what tucker means when he tells m don't reason anymore he doesn't mean don't be a fool he doesn't mean don't constantly uh consider what's real and what's not real that's that we have to do but there's these other questions these philosophical questions that are endless that we can't come to a final conclusion about we should just forget about and people don't do it they're constantly asking if god is good why is there evil in the world taco sometimes he'll say who can understand the ways of god we really can't we don't know why swamiji likes to say don't blame god for these things we ourselves are creating all this mischief and everything but so this is a very good statement by by knowledge does it's good in one respect at least it makes us feel that we do not know anything that we are nothing master right you are i am nothing i am nobody then tucker says do you believe in english astronomy i don't know why tucker will ask these questions and then get bored the animals will feel some responsibility to try explain these things and then the taco will say stop my head is reeling m it is possible to make new discoveries by applying the laws of western astronomy observing the irregular movement of uranus the astronomers looked through their telescopes and discovered neptune shining in the sky they can also foretell eclipses master yes that is so because in india at that time they could do it now yeah it's an old thing how they could no i don't know how they do it they had a good good knowledge of these things yeah i remember remember when talker was asking about what was it about the high tide and the low tide and the full moon and everything and talking to stops that's too much the carriage drove on they were approaching other's house so all of this this in the beginning of the chapter we we see that uh this this day tucker is is on his way to other's house all of this conversation is taking place in the carriage itself and him with that brilliant mind how he remembers everything they were approaching others house surrounded krishna said to him dwell in the truth and you will certainly realize god this is something that takur i emphasized so much especially for the kali yuga now why for the kali yuga because at least in the theory is that we don't have that same uh spiritual capacity the the ability to do uh different types of austerities to practice meditation for long hours that were limited with our attention span all sorts of things so that repeating the name of god is enough shedding tears is enough and if we can maintain truthfulness for 12 years he says this enough but what is truthfulness this is another big question we we think that it means okay uh i won't tell any lie this is truthfulness but then we stop and think if if i say that uh you hit me and you you you hit my body you didn't hit me is that a truthful statement or not a truthful statement why did you hit me the other day and you could say oh i didn't hit you i hit your body now you're being a smart aleck but it means that it has to mean some type of authenticity not just we refrain from telling lies but remaining somehow in living authentically that means not identifying with with all of the roles that we play and all these external coverings and everything this will this will be a higher level of telling the truth and uh of course we know there are times when we can we can tell little white lies if it's for the benefit of or to save someone's life or something like that that's a different thing but but living a truthful life an authentic life and genuine type of life is a very very high standard if we really think that it involves constantly reeling on the self constantly thinking not identifying with anything false we identify identify with false things and we refer to ourselves in that sense it's not really a truthful statement of course we don't want to go around saying you know my odd man and this and this body you know all of that but but we at least know have some idea so he's telling him dwell in the truth you will certainly realize god and you said the other day that noah deep o god i want thee please do not delude me with thy world bewitching maya i want to realize thee master yes one should be able to say that from one's innermost soul this is another thing that takur used to do very often that someone would repeat what he said or would to repeat some type of teaching that they heard from him or even try to explain what he meant by something and they may say something that's true and then taco would say yes but you must assimilate it a bit of a put down it's almost like saying yeah anyone can parrot these things and anybody can say these things but you have to realize it so a little bit of of this uh yeah you have to be able to say it from one to innermost soul it won't do to just to go about saying i am i am the self you can do whatever you want it won't touch me this and that when we're so sensitive to everything so what we say it may be true but we have to also uh be sincere we have to realize that it's true there are people who go around that they won't refer to themselves as i they'll refer to themselves in the third person this humble devotee i know somebody like that this humble devotee is willing to serve and to give this much money to help and everything tremendous ego behind that the ego of humility so we don't fall into that trap but at the same time we want to at least in our own mind understand that the truthfulness really means some type of authenticity authenticity this is a term that's used very much in the existentialist philosophy to lead an authentic life that means a lot to uh to get fooled by this role that we play in life there's a very interesting section in the book by sartre the great french existentialist being a nothingness he says he goes to the to the cafe and he sees the waiter and he sees the waiter moving in a certain way holding the tray in a certain way everything and then he realized that this this man has become a waiter the whole being is a waiter that's his whole sense of identification nothing else he's become a waiter so this is what they call inauthentic living authentic living is to know that i am that wind of consciousness blowing towards the world a very beautiful beautiful idea ceramic christian arrived at other's house and took a seat in the parlor ram lal aadhaar and then ramallah was accompanying him on a lot of these things these trips uh probably he he took over a little bit from hridoy when everybody had to leave then at least for the ones there he would be the one to accompany suramar krishna otherwise before that reader he was always by his side and in those days he had frequent some aunties and everybody had to be there so he wouldn't fall down and everything and uh then during this period this is just when sharon krishna is telling everybody look i need somebody to stay here he wanted a lot too to stay eventually he did he wanted rakal who stayed off and on until he finally did and then baburang so this is the three the monastics and then one would always be with him and he wanted swami prema because taco went through different phases now when we say that he couldn't bear the touch of of any impure soul when he was in that state of samantha what about ridi he was the one who was always by himself holding him up there so this was a phase that he went to during that period of his life this is he needed to have babaram there because he went through different periods different types of sensitivity even truthfulness he he himself says that this truthfulness for him was a type of body like shuchibai that it he became so fanatical about it that it was it was it was almost silly he said now it's lessened a little bit so that meant that if by chance he said something like oh i i have to go to the pine grove vanguard means go to the bathroom and then he said but then i'd get up and i realized i had no urge to go i thought i did i didn't know where to go still i had to go because i said it so he said now this is not so strong anymore it's uh a little bit of fanaticism with regard to that but taco did everything literally he did that to set an example of what it really means to to keep the truth so surrounded krishna arrived at adora's house and took a seat in the parlor ramla and the other other devotees sat near him rakhal was staying with his father in calcutta so they had their home in the village kulingram now one of our centers where swami sabi devranji served for for many years and then they had their house in calcutta and uh then rakkal also uh had his young wife at this time so sometimes she would he would be with with her also master to adhere didn't you let raquel know that i was coming under yes sir i have sent him word what they did when taka would go to somebody's house in calcutta and because most of it was was north kolkata or bhagavathar and uh there were devotees who all lived within the easy distance there so he would expect them to send word out to the others so that they could all come and meet him there sometimes he would even mention somebody and they say oh okay we'll go we'll go get him and somebody would run out and they'd go to uh they'll bring narendra they'll bring the any of them and we find that happening so this is why tucker went he went it called kata so that those who couldn't easily see him in dakshinishwar could come and visit him there and he liked them all to get together he liked the devotees to be friends to to form the family relationship we do too like this here finding that the master was eager to see rakhal although it once sent his carriage to fetch him see other had been yearning to see the master that they this he had just seen him a few times it recently come and he formed this this loving relationship with tagwa so quickly we we sometimes uh get the wrong impression oh he only cares about getting this big job and he's pestering takur and tako keeps telling him you know don't be so selfish and everything you have a good job already sometimes we think oh there wasn't anything special and taco didn't care for him so much the opposite how taker loved him same thing with his uh isha how he gets scolded horribly huh we think we're talking but it turns out tucker really loved him and he was a great great deputy and a great wonderfully uh charitable person until she's person and everything so how quickly they formed that relationship that takwo was yearning to see him altair was yarnigasi takur we suspect that we suspect that that the whole time that he's so anxious to to get a good job and going about and asking people to recommend him and everything that tucker somehow knew that he his life would be very short oh anyhow he passed away during tucker's lifetime right yeah fell off a horse i don't remember that saying that but anyhow no [Music] they lived with god okay mentioned there yeah yeah he he used to say the real guru is the one who knows the past present and future of the disciples when swamiji also said that yeah he had that insight we don't know how other you haven't been here for a long time i pray to god today that you might come i even shed tears oh sorry before that it said mother had been yearning to see the master that day but he had not definitely known that shurami krishna was coming it's not like they could pick up the phone and call or send a text message i'm on my way the master was pleased and said with a smile you don't mean that it was dusk and the lamps were lighted srama krishna saluted the divine mother with folded hands and sat quietly absorbed in meditation then he began to chant the names of god and his sweet voice it would have been nice to be with srimad krishna when it sunset because he always went into a spiritual mood always some type of intoxication so that spiritual ecstasy would come to him then he began to chant the name of god in this weird voice govinda govinda everywhere he uttered showered nectar on the ears of the devotees ramallah sang and praise of kali the divine mother now we get a very very long song now romney had all these things memorized how all of them they all had great memories huh they didn't carry their their little song books with them i don't think at least by name i've heard o concert of shiva is the destroyer of our fear and so in thee i cast my burden save me save me o kindly mother this song will go through all of the different chakras the different layers of the kundalini out of thy womb the world is born and now it is the dust pervaded ortho kali who can ever rightly say there's a whole school that likes to play between there's a mother kali and uh and krishna radha krishna in fact there was a book that somebody wrote years ago it was called the sword and the flute it was mother kali with their sword and krishna with his food and they're both isham and chama krishna krishna they're both in black complexion and we have these different songs that uh uh oh mother why are you uh have you given up your your uh male 1 of the necklace of skulls and have put on the wildflower and you know just how christian kali uh some somehow belong to that same reality otherwise they like to fight each other the vice numbers and the shaktis but we have this this other tradition where they kind of see them all belonging to the same ultimate reality so arthur kali who can never rightly say mother and every living creature thou dost have thy dwelling place as kundalini now the slave and the lotus of the mullah we we have so many different ways of thinking of mother kali or the divine mother one way is dwelling within this physical body not just dwelling within the heart and the source of consciousness but as shakti within his physical body dwelling in muladhara and working her way all the way up to the sahasrara where she will achieve union with shiva shiva dwells here and and mother kalishi joe's wherever we are see for suramar krishna she also dwelled up there but for us tako says for most people within the three lower chakras but uh for the spiritual aspirants then we at least we try to get up to the heart center and everything as kundalini thou dost live in the lotus of the muladhara after it lies this swadhishtana where the four petaled lotus blooms there also thou thus make thy home o mystic power of kundalini so she dwells in all of the chakras we talk about uh transcending one if we if if we go up to dark center that means that the mind is no longer in the lower ones but potentially she dwells within all of them in the four petals in the four petals of that flower and in gerasana six petals at the navel is manipura the blue ten petaled lotus flower through the pathway of sushumna thou dost descend and enter there yeah this is another kind of physiological theory and also spiritual theory swamiji likes to take this as actually part of the physiognomy of of the of the spinal cord we are ida pingala they go and kind of figure eight and then the empty hole will be sushumna and when this this spiritual power rises in that special way it goes through the middle otherwise it goes around and there's these other two nerves and different nerve plexus flexes whatever plexus is that we have he says correspond to the different chakras and levels of kundalini tucker doesn't go into that so much he says we have a spiritual body with a love body he says sometimes where these things dwell trying to below the two bodies or even in pranayama how do you do it in those i have no idea the pranayama is the different techniques and things to awaken i i don't know about these things we taku didn't emphasize these at all he refactored very much against uh hatha yoga and a lot of those practices because we become too body conscious with all of these things always thinking nostril this natural that means we're thinking of the body the whole time so is it better not to do too much through the pathways to shumna they'll thus descend and enter there o lady of the lotuses in lotus blossoms thou dost dwell beyond them lies the lake of nectar in the region of the heart where the twelve petaled lotus flower enchants the eye with scarlet flame yeah all of these chakras is all part of this tantric philosophy they all have a certain number of lo of petals and a certain color i met somebody once who was asking about all these things and then he rattled them all off that oh this is how many lotus leaves and how many and what color each one is and everything as if that he knew something he was thinking yeah you could get you could get a 10 year old to memorize those things these are very subtle things to uh to to have some conception of what it means is really you have to have some mystic vision otherwise uh i've no conception how they came up with these things maybe the yogis can see these things i don't know how they came up with this so beyond them lies the lake of nectar and the region of the heart where the twelve petaled lotus flower enchants the eye with scarlet flame when thou dost open it oh mother touching it with thy lotus feet the age-long darkness of the heart instantly scatters at thy site yet tucker says when the mind rises to a certain area we have different experiences sometimes we see everything as light or the universe starts to vanish these are all correlative to different levels of spiritual experience mind rising to different states we don't have to bother about this individual thing in the body different rungs of the ladder getting closer to the roof the age-long darkness of the heart instantly scatters at thy sight above in the throat is the sixteen petaled lotus flower of smoky hue within the petals of this flower their lies concealed a subtle space transcending which one sees at length the universe in space dissolve so that space within the heart did we redeveloped and even indeed who punish it and the higher yet between the eyebrows blossoms the lotus of two petals where the mind of man remains a prisoner and past controlling from this flower the mind desires to watch the sport of play of life highest of all within the head the soul enthralling center is where shines the thousand petaled lotus mahadeva's dwelling place having ascended to his throne o spouse of shiva sit beside him he is addressing the divine mother thou art the primal power o mother she whose senses are controlled the yogis meditate on thee as uma great himalayas daughter thou who art the power of sheba put to death my ceaseless cravings grant that i never fall again into the ocean of this world mother thou art the primal power now the five cosmic principles who can never hope to know thee who art beyond all principles this is another very nice idea that devotees of the divine mother emphasized the inscrutable nature she's maya muhammad inscrutable nature by definition beyond our ability to comprehend with the mind inscrutable a cynthia only for thy book the sake thus thou assume thy various forms but when the devotee's five senses merge in the five element mother it is thyself alone that he beholds as formless truth this is how the chakras the devotees of the divine mother can accept god with form and without form can accept this duality and can accept oneness and all the level of the kundalini all this this state of mind that as long as the mind is still not at the highest level then we see god with form we see difference in distinction when it goes even higher that then it's just merging in that oneness so we have that one beautiful song in dense darkness mother thy formless beauty sparkles therefore the yogis meditate on the in the deep forest cave where there's no not you don't see anything that's the formless form of the divine mother they say with ram prasad that as he got older towards the very end of his life that his songs were all about that kind of formless aspect of mother and his mind was drawn towards the head that was a sign he was about to leave the world and what taku as ramallah sang the lions above in the throat is the sixteen petaled lotus flower of smokey hue within the petals of this flower their lies concealed a subtle space transcending which one sees at length the universe in space dissolve the master said to him listen this is known as the vision of satyadananda the formless and brahmin so this is not even but this will be our subject we can say that that realization with a little awareness not completely merging and disappearing in it this is known as the vision of satyadan under the formless vermin the kundalini rising above the vishuddha enables one to see everything as akasha so just infinite vast empty space it's another way of understanding the formless m yes sir master one attains the absolute by going beyond the universe and its created beings conjured up by maya by passing beyond the nada when goes into samati now why does he use this term nada we don't find him using this term it's not not a very common thing at all right now that we have this idea of nadaberman the to this ohm and this idea of vibration and sound and everything i take this is meaning somehow beyond name and form something like that by repeating om he because om it's not really a name and it stands for that which has no name it stands for that to the estate so by repeating one goes beyond the nada and attains samathi other serves foreign christians with fruits and sweets the master lives for jodhu malik's house now we know jada malik he had a house just walking distance from from takwo's room in dakshineshwar but he must have had at his main house in calcutta they did that this is a very common thing for wealthy people to have one city house and then kind of a garden house probably the duck chinese foreign house yeah and that's very famous because taco would go there very often and that that meeting with the narendra that when they went there no one was there and and the gatekeepers always let takori in because they all knew him and that was when the narendra said i'm not going to let this old man play his tricks on me again he's not going to touch me and then send me into samadhi anything like that i'm gonna i'm gonna make sure because i'm strong and i have tremendous willpower and tucker muttered something and touched them and so on he was gone and the curious thing was that he put questions to him so narendra our future swamiji is uh as as if under hypnotism we are hard to imagine answered all of the questions and what were the questions who was he why was he born how long will he live what is his mission in life what is his relationship all of these things and tacos said afterwards he answered all of them correctly and i found all of them to be true see this is this is what we made by leela this is divine play we can't explain it how taku would recognize these great souls that were born only for his sake only to carry out his mission these yeah they they were all connected you know they have this uh aquatic plant they call me shock that it looks like they're all separated you look at the surface but if you pull one out all of the others come along with it they're all connected underneath so he used to say that that was his relationship with all of this his direct disciples that way so that that was malik's house in the in the chinese war but this will be somewhere near i'm assuming world somewhere in north calcutta so here he goes one place to another place maybe another place so the master left for the other malik's house sriram krishna entered the room in jodhu's house where the divine mother was worshipped he stood before the image which had been decorated with flowers garlands and sandal paste and which radiated a heavenly beauty and splendor they had an interesting relationship the yadu was very very free and informal with srama krishna he didn't show this tremendous respect and bow down before him and all of that more like a friend and was attracted to him but was a very very wealthy and worldly man and takur would sometimes say well what happened to these old spiritual tendencies now i see you only care about keeping these flatteries you'll we'll see that why do you keep all these flatterers around that uh all that he's talking about his money and this and that there's one incident where somebody was talking about selling something and he says oh well you give it for this much and taco said why are you bargaining you don't even want to buy it yeah this is my nature so surrounding christian entered the room in jodhu's house where the divine mother was worshiped he stood before the image which had been direct decorated with flowers garland and sandal paste and which radiated a heavenly beauty and splendor lights were burning before the pedestal a priest was seated before the image the master asked one of his companions to offer a rupee in the shrine according to the hindu custom srama krsna stood a long time with folded hands before the blissful image the devotees standing behind him gradually he went into saranti his body become emotional motionless and his eyes fixed when he was in that state there was no awareness of the world at all and i unless somebody was there he could easily fall and it happened on different occasions we know that he cracked his tooth he broke his arm this is why he had somebody with him he could just fall over anything could happen with a long sigh he came back to the world of the senses and said still intoxicated with divine fervor mother goodbye i don't know what he really said maybe ashi also come again yeah in bengali probably other indian languages they'll never say i'm going they'll say i'm coming i'll come again i'll see you again yeah one time and taco would tell them if anybody saw me that's i'm going he said no no don't say that one time somebody said the holy mother that i'm leaving and she said oh okay y'all and go and then she said oh why did i say it that way and that person exit died after that not because she said it not because she said it she's those words came out of her mouth because the person was faded to to give up the body at that time so ashima so mother goodbye but he could not leave the place he remained standing there addressing ramallah he said please sing that song then i shall be all right saying o mother concert of shiva thou hast deluded this world the master went to the drawing room with the devotees every now and then he said oh mother please dwell in my heart this is a very common thing that especially after the immersion that people get so attached they'll they'll have an image in their home they'll set it up so attached to that worship that they can't bear the thought of of uh the immersion and this happened with with the mathura that's this is exactly what he said and tell the mother let her dwell within your heart and then sometimes they would decide to just have year-long worship and do it and do it every year keep it there jodo was sitting in the drawing room with his friends the master sat down still in an ecstatic mood and saying o mother ever blissful as thou art do not deprive thy worthless child of bliss it's friends these won't be really devotees there'll be other wealthy people who like to hang out with wealthy people and maybe tucker is a curiosity who knows why he invites them why do we have to immerse them when we know these gods and goddesses are living i mean they are there always in you know other worlds why do they immerse them what will we do with the image we're trying we're trying to say that this isn't the divine mother we've invoked the presence of the divine mother for these few days of worship and a worship is over there's no point will you will you keep this physical body around after you've left after you've departed and moved on physical body it's not as useless at that point worship is over that mother goes back into our heart then this is just just a mud it's just clay there's nothing to it we why worship there's there's nothing different from any other piece of clay at that point this is the the idea behind it so then we simply immerse it why immerse it in the ganga we don't want to just put it somewhere people will step on it anything like that not that it's a holy thing at that point holy in our eyes because we we perform worship through it what divine divine mother is invoked into it and then with the drawn and then plays it back into our heart afterwards so there's nothing special about it and unless we want to turn it into something like you know a regular morty that is kept all the time and worshipped all the time but that's not the tradition there will be durga temples of course but the durga puja that church and ganesh put to so many different things with the immersion yeah nothing special just dwell within the heart yeah [Music] so anyhow talk we're singing this is this uh beautiful kamala kante uh oh mother ever blissful as thou art do not deprive they birth as child of bliss finishing the song he said still in a state of divine fervor well sir what shall i sing shall i sing mother am i thy eighth eight-month child he sang mother am i thine eight-month child thy red eyes cannot frighten me this this means a premature baby who needs extra care and a little bit helpless more helpless than an ordinary baby my riches are their lotus feet which shiva holds upon his breast the ramp yet when i seek my heritage i meet with excuses and delays a deed of gift i hold in my heart attested by thy husband sheba i shall sue thee if i must and with the single point shall win if thou dost oppose me thou will learn what sort of mother son i am this bitterly contested suit between the mother and her son what sport it is says ram prasad i shall not cease tormenting thee till thou thyself shall yield the fight and take me in nine arms at last yeah this every every spiritual relationship has a different type of attitude and a different level of intimacy everything is so attuned to the to the nature and personality of the different types of devotees that there are things that this is this or some blasphemous you know somebody who's thinking of the master servant that hanuman will talk to rama that way or did radha will talk to christian but it's so appropriate and fitting and beautiful with this relationship of the son to the mother huh it is beautiful coming down nearly to a normal state the master said i shall take some of the divine mother's prasad then he ate a little of it malik was sitting here with several friends among whom were a few of his flatterers yeah hangers on the people who they'll get a little crumbs from the table master with a smile well why do you keep these buffoons with you in bengali suppose they are now i think he says in the bengali i think he says so that you may save them how does it how does he say it [Music] okay there is another time that i think this same conversation takes place twice he says why do you keep this performance with you the other with a smile suppose they are won't you redeem them master smiling the water of the this is a very important statement the water of the ganges cannot purify a wine jar see we we think this is this anything can be purified but and like tucker would say that when the malaya breeze comes that all the trees are turned into sand we'll send it with trees except that cottonwood tree and some others yeah so that means there has to be a little bit of inner stuff that they can have the holy company of taquer and all of that won't do any good if if they're just not ready for it if they've no stuff within the water of the ganges cannot purify a wine jar jadhaw had promised the master that he would arrange a recital of the chandi in his house some time had elapsed but he had not yet kept his promise that's a very bad thing master well what about the recital of the chandi jadhu i've been busy with many things i haven't been able to arrange it master how is that a man gives his word and doesn't take it back the words of a man are like the tusks of the elephant they come out but do not go back a man must be true to his word what do you say and they'll do with the smile you were right yeah this is that yeah yeah yeah so if the words come out of our mouth we can't just take them back and say oh i didn't mean it that uh forget that i said it i changed my mind and everything talked we're very strict about these things okay so we will stop here oh [Music] who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship [Music] peace peace peace be on tour
