[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (08/12/22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qAErvXjh5d4)

[Music] your words are like nectar bringing life to squirt souls they are praised by poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of srama krishna we're starting a new chapter this is chapter 17 m at that chinese war part 1 and there have been a couple of smaller chapters but it's all uh part of this one long stay that m had uh dakshinashar with swami krishna i don't know why exactly they split it up this way possibly because uh uh not all of the sections were contained in in volume one when when em wrote the gospel in the beginning he did it in stages so possibly part of it was in one part of it was in another and when they collected it it came out of the different chapters but it's really uh in in terms of em's life it's one long chapter this this special stay at dakshinashar with uh with shirami krishna so we're on page 348 and it's tuesday december 18th 1883. suramar krishna was seated in his room with his devotees he spoke highly of de bender tagore's love of god and renunciation and then said ponytal and the other young devotees they render as a good man but blessed indeed are those young aspirants who like sukadeva practice renunciation from the very boyhood and think of god day and night without being involved in worldly life now this is december 1883 when did shiraman krishna go to meet was it before this or after this saturday do you remember let me because this is important i meant to look it up before let's see if it's in here 235 yes so this was this was after that i don't know when exactly it was but on june 5th 1883 srama krishna is talking about that visit that he had it may have been much earlier in fact but in any event we we know it's interesting that takur is speaking out so highly of tagore's love of god and renunciation when they met it was a interesting visit during mata babu's time yes right so it was much earlier yeah i should have known that yeah what happened oh okay what happened was we know that assurance had a great interest in meeting all of the important people the dependents or or religious leaders or social leaders so that he met vidyasagar he met many of these the other pandits what milotia and others and so he had the desire to meet devendrana tagord who was he was known as the maharshi at that time he was very very well known he was one of the most important figures we can say in the modern bengal and starting with ram mohan who we can say really was the [Music] initiator of the movement that grew into the brahmos homage and he was the vendor not was uh inspired by him swami vaikananda that spoke very very highly of ram mohan roy uh this he didn't mention him very many times but he spoke very highly he was very pleased a significant role in bringing the study of the upanishads to bengal because he he was the first to translate them and from sanskrit into bengali and so that was very significant before that there wasn't so much interest in that type of study more interest i would say in bhagavata and ramayana and other things like that so he played a very important role at the vendor not so they that was the beginning he was the founder of the original brahma-samaj adi brahmos and then chandrasen was inspired by him so then he took over after that and of course we know revenge or not was the his most famous son of all the different sons that he had and then there was the big split so there there's all so many different versions and then it became sad and brahma samaj and the uh vidhan the new dispensation all different things like that but when shirami krishna wanted to see him in the there were two ways that these things happened one was he was esridoy and perhaps this was before mathur's time i don't i don't remember but he would say go and meet this pandit go and meet this person and tell them that your uncle is thinks of god and would like to meet them that's how he met keshav also and so this time it was mature he asked and he said he hesitated and then he said actually we went to college together they were they were classmates or something in college so he said okay so they went and taku spoke to him a little bit impressed and and then he said raise your shirt he wanted to because tucker had this way of of uh by and to seeing somebody's fig physiognomy by the shape of their head shape of the chest and everything that he could judge them and you know he he had a nice impression of him we can say uh but then uh tucker sometimes he would say i got into that state where i can look into a man's heart and his mind as if looking at objects inside of a glass case we'd sometimes wonder how talkwork would sometimes maybe misjudge people or would have to ask questions and everything he wasn't always in that state but sometimes he would say i got into that state so then he saw that depending on how much he had enjoyed of the world enjoyed the world also but in any event they talked about some spiritual things and taku was impressed and everything and then uh tagore invited him to come to there was an upcoming celebration brahma's celebration but he said a very interesting thing he said but make sure that you wear some upper cloth taco very often wouldn't would just throw you know the bottom half of his of his dhoti over his shoulder and he gave a very interesting reason it would hurt me very much if i found other people being critical of you a little bit disingenuous the way he did that so then tucker said oh i can be a baboo i can't promise i don't know when my cloth is on my body or not it's something like that so then they left amicably and he said the next day a letter came telling him not to come so that uh anybody else would have taken that a little bit personally but here taco is just praising him his love of god and about his renunciation he said yeah he renounced the who enjoyed the world more than he did of course after that you can easy to renounce and then he gave the example of the man who stopped uh this elaborate pooja with offering of goats and all of that uh why because his teeth had all fallen out he couldn't chew the meat anymore so he's comparing it a little bit to that but anyhow uh de mendona he played a very important role uh and uh he and others like him vidya uh social reformers and also spiritual leaders both so they tried to combine combine both things but and and this is now he's comparing the binder not and rakal and we know very often he would compare keisha and and swamiji and narendra and here are two of the most famous figures the two young boys who were nobody at that time and narendra swamiji he used to complain how do you compare me to keisha they said no i know that if if he has you know one virtue you have 18 virtues something like that and he was right of course so takur he could see the difference between those who renounced from childhood from a young age and those who at the end of life after enjoying everything green nuts because they were very wealthy family and big landowners the worldly man always has some desire or other though at times he shows much devotion to god once mature babu was entangled in a lawsuit he said to me in the shrine of kali sir please offer this flower to the divine mother i offered it unsuspectingly see another case we think that he always knew what was in the minds of people most of the time he was in that mood of a child that he wouldn't question things he was very some people would say gullible or naive but just that that simplicity so he said i offered it unsuspectingly but he firmly believed that he would attain his objective if i offered the flower what devotion rati's mother had now this is another interesting person this first of all it was it was very common in in those days even today to a certain extent to not refer to a respected person or an elderly person by their name so very often they'll say somebody's mother even holy mother thakura we said ramallah's aunt he never never called her by name so the rati's mother the interesting thing about her is that uh when takur uh went into samanthi and we know there are three different times when he heard the voice of the divine mother say remain in one of them he said that mother came in the form of mother to do that another time with some man with a long beard and the last time it was just just the words that he didn't see that was when he was in that neri called the samadhi state so tucker had some type of regard for this mother whoever she was she she had a connection with vaisnavchan let me see i wanted to say a little bit later okay yeah she belonged to this and it was that mean that she was a little bit orthodox and fanatical now it's it's surprising because this isn't the typical orthodox group the this we know this vicente challenge group that they would take wine and do other things but at the same time she was a very strict vegetarian and followed some other kind of strict rules so it was a funny kind of of combination between the two but they didn't lead a very pure type of life they would do all sorts of kind of tantric types of practices and things it says takur one time saw bhavatarani the mother kali uh dressed uh as mother in in ecstasy but she was she was very orthodoxy so we'll we'll find out what happened with her with uh catching taquer taking non-vegetarian food anyhow what devotion that his mother had how often she used to come here and how much she served me so they had some real connection at one time we don't know much about her afterwards she was a vaishnava one day she noticed that i ate the food offered at the kali temple that means non-vegetarian they the the the rani rashmani sheed i had an arrangement so that those who took strict vegetarian food would get the prasad from the radhikam to temple and those who took non-vegetarian could take from the kali temple so one day she noticed that i ate the food offered at the kali temple and that stopped her coming her devotion to god was one-sided it isn't possible to understand a person right away so this is a second case we see that the he gets an impression of somebody and unless as i said he gets into that mood and kind of looks deep within them he's he just uh accepts people like a child like a child without overly judging or assisting he didn't have a suspicious mind at all very pure type of mind it was a winter morning and the master was sitting near the east door of his room wrapped in his moleskine shawl he looked at the sun and suddenly went into somati now we know that the sun has so many associations with the brahman and uh as as a brahmin boy he had his sacred thread ceremony in gaiatri mantra and worshipping the sun so all the connections with the sun as would bring some spiritual awakening so he looked at the sun and suddenly went into samati his eye stopped blinking and he lost all consciousness of the outer world so this samati we know is so many different types the one thing they all have in common is that there's no consciousness of the outer world what's happening within that we don't know and this taku will tell us afterwards otherwise that's where that's not information that's available to us it may be the mind is perfectly empty and nearly called the samanthi or did some visions or all sorts of things happen after a long time he came down to the plane of the sense world raqqa hazra m and other devotees were seated near him master to hazra the state of samadhi is certainly inspired by love now this this means that shirami ramakrishna is definitely including within the term samadhi the bhagavad-gita is more uh something we see in the devotional schools we don't find this term in our yoga systems or anything this will be just filled so much with love and devotion for god that one loses all awareness of the external world maybe visions taking place inside uh we we don't know exactly but it won't be our strict nearby copa samadhi that that we find in yoga system and other systems so the state of samadhi is certainly inspired by love wanted chambazar they arranged a kirtan at natabar gosvami's house there i had a vision of krishna and the gopis of vrindavan so that will also be a type of bhava bhava when he has these visions when he's not aware of the outer world it loses all the outer consciousness senses aren't functioning at that time i felt that my subtle body was walking at krsna's heels i went into samadhi when similar devotional songs were sung at the hari sabha at jorah shanko in calcutta that day they feared i might give up the body see taco went to all of these different places uh whenever there was any it didn't make any difference this would be vaisnava group but it didn't matter to him where is that that that they feared i might give up the body see when taku would get into the state of samadhi if it lasted a long time uh they would have trouble seeing any signs of life that uh you could hardly feel any pulse hardly see any breathing and everything even body would get a little cold that's why when he passed away they really for long hours they they thought that perhaps it was just a deep state of somati and they did all sorts of things to bring consciousness back they were ghee on his back and and tried to bring down the kundalini all sorts of things till finally dr sharkar said no that his body is gone that he passed away even swamiji when he had his samadhi and and kashipur the the border gopal he had some fear that swamiji was was dying and swamiji cried out something like that he went to suramar krishna so this is another sign and we know that one time one one of the doctors maybe one of them he actually pressed his finger to sramakris eyeball he just did such a sensitive thing to see if there was any reaction so that means that even somehow the prana and the connection between the sense of touch and everything is disconnected at that time there were no signs of life at all at that time then gradually the mind comes down after the master had finished his bath he again spoke of the ecstatic love of the gopis he said to him and the other devotees one should accept the fervent attachment of the gopis to their beloved krishna now this is a statement that he used to make to keshav and and the and the brahmos that even if you don't believe in this krsna-lila even if you don't believe that this actually took place that this is all the myth it's all made up still try to imagine that longing that the gopis had for sri krishna when they were separated from him there's a virus and the joy they had when they were in union with him that milan of these these two different two different moods that we find in this division of a tradition so this is a very nice this is the what taco used to call aropkura to try to adopt that at it try to feel try to feel other way or try to imagine how would radha feel when she was longing to see shri krishna if we try to imagine that that means that we'll feel that so he's saying try try to superimpose that mindset they'd rather had onto our own mindset somehow so that we can also feel that yearning and longing if we can identify this is part of that whole system of the different providers identify with the the ideal worshiper with radha then we can feel that same longing that she had to realize krishna and for takur the longing it was the main thing so here he's telling them also this is a very same thing that he says to kesha on another occasion so one should accept the fervent attachment of the gopis to their beloved krishna seeing songs like this telling me friend how far is the grove where krishna my beloved dwells his fragrant fragrance reaches me even here but i am tired and can walk no farther again he sang i'm not going home oh friend for there it is hard for me to chant my krsna's name srama christian had vowed to offer green coconut and sugar to siddhis woody the divine mother for raquel's welfare now this this is that same temple the tontonia kalibari they're very close to em's house and uh this was in the family of swami subholtan this is this is exactly what he did for keisha and he used the m to do to do it to get to buy some this dab genie just sugar and coconut water green coconut water and offer why he saying for raqqa for rockhold's welfare i i really don't know rachael is no longer when he was in vrindavan and he was very ill maybe he's still not over his illness but he's there he's present there uh so i i really don't know huh if it if it has to do with his marriage that let him not be too much too attached to the world but he never seemed to too concerned about the marriage he never expressed too much in fact he even said go home and have fun with your wife a little and next thing you know he had a son yeah so he never seemed very very concerned about that so i don't really know why any theory no it's interesting curious you see i i've been reading this book so many for so many years and it's never struck me before this uh so he asked him whether he would pay for the offerings um the date oh december 18th 1883. that afternoon the master accompanied by m rakal and some other devotees set out in a carriage for the temple of siddhaswari in calcutta my last trip uh to india for some reason i spent a lot of time there i was with swami sarva devandiji and one of yeah one of his former teachers lived right near there and we went a couple of times for him to see and then finally he just went and the whole time i went and i sat in the that kali temple there's a tremendous tremendous atmosphere but it's just it's right on the street corner all the vendors are right there busy dirty noisy but tremendous atmosphere very old very old temple yeah you can miss it yeah it looks like just another shop on the corner yeah it's very small doesn't look like a temple or anything i don't remember seeing anything special about the building but a beautiful image inside and everything and many people with great devotion go there yeah so that afternoon the master accompanied by m rock calls he's even taking rock call there he must have been embarrassed offering for his sake rock call and some other devotees said set out on the carriage for the temple of siddhaswari in calcutta on the way the offerings were purchased when reaching the temple the master asked the devotees to offer the fruit and sugar to the divine mother they saw the priests and their friends playing cards in the temple it's not unusual in in india the priests are not necessarily this is their profession most of them are good people of course but uh they're they're not the ones who are supposed to be the keepers of the spiritual tradition that the monks are supposed to do that and they're mostly the family people and everything and they this is the way they make their money and everything and they have to pass the time play cards so they saw the priests and their friends playing cards in the temple suramar krishna said to play cards in the temple i want you to think of god here from the temple the master went to malik's house now all of these things are in that same neighborhood and it's very close to where sramana krishna lived when he came with his brother rahm kumar before they went to the dakshaneshwar temple and in jadha malik we know him more from his garden house see the wealthy people they would have a house in the city and they'd have a place in the country this garden house was suggest despite the southern gate of the dakshineshwar temple compound so tako generally went to see him there but now he's going to see him here the other was surrounded by his admirers well-dressed dandis he welcomed the master that he was very wealthy a very wealthy person and yeah these people uh they they failed some special connection with srama krishna even though they weren't really very spiritual people they had some interest something but they could have a friendship with him i i saw this with swami's fahrenheit that there were there were several that maybe the the wife was it was a devotee the husband didn't really care too much but we'd love to spend time with them just just chit-chat and talk about things and go for a walk uh who's here oh okay saturday you're doing that yeah they had such a nice friendship they would hang out together and everything otherwise he didn't care too much he wouldn't go for lectures and things like that really but they had that quality that they could just mix with anybody so the jadu malik he loved to have ceramic krishna around sometimes to show him off a little bit maybe not all so sincerely and everything his mother was was a great devotee mother was highly devoted and all of the the uh servants and and workers and everything uh especially in in the garden house they all love strawberry krishna so he he could go whenever he wanted he could just hit free access to the house and we know that's where he went that uh the second visit when swamiji came when he touched him and swamiji lost consciousness and he asked all of those questions how long he would live why he came who he was before all of those things and satisfied them with all of the answers and everything so a lot of there's a leelah talk with leela that's so many different little side uh excursions that we can go off on so many nice nice little things so he played an interesting role in malik taco there are many instances and tucker always refers to him that if you if you want to know how many properties and everything jodhu malik has you have to somehow meet him yeah so if we want to know about god's creation then we have to realize god first so he would use this illustration of jonathan master with a smile why do you keep so many clowns and flatterers with you the other smiling then you may liberate the laughter master flatterers think that the rich man will loosen his purse strings for them but it is very difficult to get anything from them once a jackal saw a bullock and would not give up his company the bullet roamed about and the jackal followed him the jackal thought there hang the bullock's testicles sometime or other they will drop to the ground and i shall eat them illustration when the bullets slipped in the ground the jackal lay down too and when the bullock moved about the jackal followed him many days passed in this way but the bullock's testicle still clung to his body the jackal went away disappointed all that this also happens to flatterers so jadoo he wasn't about to get whole he was always wanted to have more and more money jado and his mother served refreshments to suramar krishna and the devotees now we get the next day part of the same chapter wednesday december 19th 1883. so uh nine o'clock in the morning so this means that am again spent another night there one after another during this vacation period it was nine o'clock in the morning suramar krishna was talking to m near the bell tree at dakshineshwar this tree under which the master had practiced the most austere sadhana stood in the northern end of the temple garden when you go there you can still see that the areas is is kept as a very sacred place all of the tantric sadhana was done there under the the brahminy so that the beltry is considered very auspicious for the tantric farther north ran a high wall and just outside was the government magazine government magazine means the fireworks were stored there the gun powder and things like that explosives yeah yeah this is why uh when swamiji used to tell srama krishna they will go is in kashipur that they would go to the chinese war and meditate and start a dhuni start a big fire there and sit around the fire and meditate he would warn them be careful the authorities you know will get nervous if you do it near this this magazine because you can have a huge explosion west of the bell tree was a rose a row of tall pines that rustled in the wind below the trees flowed the ganges and to the south could be seen the sacred grove of the panchavati the dense trees and underbrush hid the temples no noise of the outside world reached the bell tree master to him but one cannot realize god without renouncing lust and gold o rama you may renounce the world if the world is outside god now m is quoting srama christ's own words and taco says this on several different occasions and probably he said it a lot more often than we because we only have a small fraction of the things that he said all the things he said when there wasn't there or you know we we don't know that but he would he would give that illustration that at one time uh rama felt tremendous renunciation yeah and wanted to renounce everything and uh so the king nasrata had vishishta broad who was the guru you could say and he said now reason with me if this if this world is outside of god then you can renounce the world so he was saying that god is everywhere where do we where do we go where god isn't there so what is this giving up the world leaving one thing going to something else god is everywhere so tucker would use that illustration uh to show that there's no place where god isn't and that uh living in the world or outside the world who can renounce the world if sadhu doesn't renounce the world in the sense that he's living outside of it it just means renouncing world family life that all that it means so i am saying so i've made a good point i'm simply quoting tucker's words he said this so many times then he'll get a shock master smiling he said that durama so that rama might destroy ravana romney accepted the life of a householder and married to fulfill that mission so now he's saying it was a ruse it wasn't a hundred percent uh that he's just giving you some very higher teaching that the highest teaching is remaining in the world don't think about renouncing the world you can realize god just as easily all of that they say okay that that of course there's some truth to that but there was another purpose rama was born for this mission he was an avatar that he had to destroy ravana and that whole play all of that so uh this will be a big shock to him he's he's thinking that taco will back him up now we have to remember so many things happened during this period that uh we we can only explain as shock treatment that tucker somehow is is taking this period to really melt down him and recast him in a new mold somehow that he's putting him through so many different changes with regard to to renunciation and living in the world and doing your duties being a householder being among the m's head must be spinning but by the by the end of it it's at the end he'll say and now do now you you see now you have some experience of things now you know you can go back live with family and all of that and says yes sir so whatever he'd done he's like he's he used to compare himself with the spiritual teacher to the doctor they first lets the boil come to a to a head and then lances it so he's doing something like that with him so master smiling no he said that to rama so that rama might destroy ravana rama accepted the life of the householder and married to fulfill that mission m stood there like a log stunned and speechless we have to feel sorry for him here he married the family children everything and he's getting these strong teachings about renunciation and he's in that's been on his mind any health that tremendous dilemma in his mind suramar krishna went to the panchavati on his way back to his room m accompanied him it was then about 10 o'clock m sir is there no spiritual discipline leading to realization of the impersonal god now remember when trump when the m first came to sramakrishna that he fought argued with him about the impersonal formless nature of god not so much impersonal but well without form that was the further argument that he had and uh uh still he never lost that that appreciation for that that infinite transcended that soul attitude uh he gained an appreciation for the others also the attitude of the servant and the attitude of the child to worship god his mother tucker one time says yes you're a worshiper shakti to him but he never lost this that the other side and tapu didn't want him to take never wanted uh anybody to to say no that near guna brahmin i'm not interested in that he wanted to uh to broaden them so that they accepted everything master yes there is but the path is extremely difficult now what srama christian is going to say is exactly what we read in gita that uh the path of the infinite absolute uh it's it requires a very high standard of detachment and renunciation that it's not for everyone it's not easy for everyone that the path of devotion is an easier path but certainly god can be realized to that path so he says yes there is but the path is extremely difficult after intense austerities the rishis of olden times realized god as their innermost consciousness and experienced the real nature of brahman but how hard they had to work they went out of their dwellings in the early morning and all they practiced austerities and meditation returning home at nightfall they took a light supper of fruits and roots but an aspirin cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline this is our jana yoga yana yoga raja yoga some type of combination this the spiritual disciplines will be mostly deep meditation and then also a deep reflection on the nature of the cells and other types of austerities so an aspirin an aspirin cannot succeed in this form of spiritual discipline if his mind is stained with worldliness even in the slightest degree the mind must withdraw totally from all objects of form taste smell touch and sound now the reason for this is that the uh path of of knowledge and the path of devotion has one very important distinction the the path of devotion we can start with our present understanding of everything we can start with our feeling that god is far off on deity he created me but i don't feel that presence within i want to worship god in dwelling in vaikunta we can start out with with that with a 100 belief that i am this body and everything we can start out like that and we go step by step by step and we start feeling that the distinction is to disappear swamiji says this love becomes like a rope drawing us closer to god and and gradually we we start the higher and higher and higher and we start feeling god is not there god is here god dwells within god dwells everywhere and so we can do that step by step stage by stage the path of knowledge we're supposed to be able to accept that ultimate final truth at the very beginning and act on that so that means that the very beginning if i if i start out with zoham i am he uh and my feeling of i is is with attachment to the body and attachment of the body made attachment to the world attachment to near and dear ones and friends and and sense pleasure and all of that then i won't be able to do it it won't it won't make sense it won't be true this when i say i am that and that that means brahman and i means this person yeah it's not true that the i as the as the self that atman we're talking about the admin which is completely uh unattached to body mind senses and everything that's one with the brahmin so unless we understand that at the very beginning we'll have a false understanding now we can we can have a good intellectual understanding and a desire to realize it and conviction and still have some attachment if everybody has some attachment of the body and practice this it's not that we we have to become perfect before we can even practice it but there should be some special sense of detachment and special type of renunciation and this is why this path of knowledge was traditionally restricted to the sannyasins now everybody can practice it in everything and and swamiji himself he wanted everyone to at least have that understanding of the of these highest truths he wanted to bring it down from the mountain cave to the marketplace of the world and but not that everyone can can follow it exclusively this is why uh talk would like to have this beautiful blend of devotion and knowledge however we call it but now he's talking about this this exclusive path of ghana yoga so the mind must totally withdraw from all objects of form taste smell touch and sound only thus does it become pure the pure mind is the same as the pure ottoman now we've come across this sometimes he'll say pure manis and shoot him on show the booty shoot out with pure mind if you're in lake and sometimes you'll say we merge the mind into the boutique we merge booty into odd now we have to understand that this is this is a different model this this isn't or the sankhya model or yoga model where the mind is an instrument according to the mind is an instrument it's composed of the three gunas it belongs to parakleti it's separate from purusha but purusa can be reflected in it this is that relationship that mind when it's purified will never be brahmin it'll be a perfect instrument which will allow us to realize our true nature but we won't identify that with with the brahman unless according to the sankhya philosophy so this is more this idea that we have this one ocean of consciousness and the mind is like that wave that we can distinguish that wave from the ocean but when that wave settles down and and loses itself in the ocean then there's no distinction anymore so that'll be like that pure mind uh you know swamiji talks about this i like that that example we can say uh air and ether if there are many pure space and air main air with air molecules and things like that if we if we have uh just a certain area and uh we can remove all of the molecules air molecules essentially create a vacuum then there's no distinction between air and space we have our air and space museum so they're all the one in the same so the space will fill 100 of the room and the air will will fill in the beginning uh save of course this won't be a scientific thing but say that each air molecule is that there's a 10 feet apart so let's say there'll be maybe 50 of them in the room something like that now this the space in between all of that is space but the air molecules are also within space so the space is always 100 always 100 empty space it's filled with that so that's not affected by no matter how many molecules or that's not affected that's completely but we remove all of the molecules and then there's no distinction whatsoever so when when the mind goes beyond all of these these modifications and that mind is just perfectly calm then that means the waves have just melded back into the ocean and that is one with the ocean but it always won with it it never separate from it so we can have air molecules where will they where would they find a place to to to exist if not in space they have to be in space so it's not like where the molecule is there's no ether in that point it's only in between it's everywhere so when we have a thought it's in within consciousness when there's no thought it's consciousness cosmic consciousness [Music] no means pure consciousness brahman the pure consciousness so you can take it even with you that you're you have this now everything that you experience is experience within consciousness but the particulars of it anything that you experience through the mind that'll be the chittakasha but you can't experience that without the witnessing consciousness there so the witness is always there if there's nothing to witness it remains there when there's something to witness it's not like it disappears it's it's not like if if you put objects in water you have a displacement theory that an object in water will displace that water so that you have the object in the water but the water won't be there when the object is there this is different this is space but not what no matter what you put in it it doesn't affect it so this is that idea gonna sudden this infinite absolute reality it's like they say sky but it really means this empty space this akasha i like this i like both models they're just different models they're both very very helpful we could think of the mind as the perfect instrument we're trying to perfect that instrument or we can think of it as just this wave on the surface of of this infinite absolute reality of a brahmin sachin and under that ocean of consciousness so the pure mind is the same as the pure ottoman but such a mind must be all together free from lust and gold because then again if we have these these passions these attachments again we're connected to the body and again uh the the mind will will start breaking out into these virtis these vasanas all these desires will come that type of mind won't be able to become still so that's that connection that's why this pure heart and pure mind go together for your heart means that uh we're free from all of these passions and attachments and desires and all of those things and that pure mind means a quiet mind this translucent this this uh prasada we have this in chapter two the beautiful understanding of that mind as perfectly calm and peaceful and perfectly transparent and everything this is the grace of the mind when it becomes pure one has another experience one realizes god alone is the doer and i am his instrument one does not feel oneself to be absolutely necessary to others either in their misery or in their happiness see this experience this if if the mind can become perfectly still and empty then we realize that this ego has no substantial value that that can disappear that there's there's no ultimate reality to this ego this ego is just uh an idea it's just this our sense of who we are it's very very much like the modern psycho psychological understanding of ego even freudian idea of the ego is self-image that's all it is there's no ahankara as a structure of consciousness within consciousness as we find in sankia ego simply false identification with all these with the mind with the with the or some scottish with our upadhis all of these things so when when we we realized that i still exist that real eye that higher i still exist when there's no sense of the ego and then then we know then we see that it's it's just uh a fandom a fandom ego but it causes so much trouble and then the taqueria is very practical they'll say and so if it's a phantom but it's not going to go east go away easily so utilize it take the help of it but here he's saying we have that highest realization first thing that will go is this this sense of identification with our personality uh with our background with our ethnicity all of these other things that go into this ego sense one does not feel oneself to be absolutely necessary to others either in their misery or in their happiness because there's a lot of pride there ah how will you get along without me i have to be there there so some humidity real humility will come from this once a wicked man made into unconsciousness a monk who lived in a monastery on regaining consciousness he was asked asked by his friends who was feeding you milk the monk said he who beat me is now feeding me um yes sir i know that story now you don't say that to srama krishna there's many many times that not just him others will say that i know that yeah i said yeah you know it huh you you have to assimilate that it's not enough to say i know it sam is still a little bit peaked from all of this he's been beaten up a little bit today yes sir i know that story master it is not enough to know it one must assimilate its meaning taco uses this word that we have to make it part of ourselves it's not just part of the intellect but part of the fabric of our being so that we don't think of ourselves as this ego sense it is the thought of worldly objects that prevents the mind from going into samadhi one becomes established in samadhi when one is completely rid of worldliness it is possible for me to give up the body in samanthi but i have a slight desire to enjoy the love of god and the company of his devotees therefore i pay a little attention to my body there is another kind of salati called one attains it by suddenly gathering the dispersed mind you understand what that is don't you am yes sir yes it is the sudden withdrawal of the dispersed mind to the ideal now taka talks about so many different types of of salanti there's one conversation when pandit comes and they're having a nice time uh do you understand jihad behind everything and then taku will start saying then there's this samadhi unmanasamati status all the different things and then this this the pundit says okay i don't know all these things they're too much but we don't how would taco know all these things i mean he knew through experience but even the terms of these things how much technical information he had we don't know what traditions all of these things are from i don't at least there's one mana samadhi and caitanya all these different things but this this is one way of understanding how the mind can come down from sahati we wonder can it ever come down taco says you'll get stuck there give up the body in 21 days but there are certain times and if we have a little desire there's a little karma if we don't get too far up we don't fall asleep on the roof we can come back down all different things that they'll talk about so this this type he says that samadhi does not last long worldly thoughts intrude now how worldly can they be if one has had samantha they won't be really what we think of his worldly thoughts it can just be you know of the family or something it won't be any low types of thought and destroyed the always slips down from his yoga at kumar pakura i've seen the mongoose living in its hole up in the wall it feels snug there sometimes people tie a brick to its tail they used to tell how the kids did they would play in the money comarch that they would do this then the pull of the brick makes it come out of its hole every time the mongoose tries to be comfortable inside the hole it has to come out because of the pull of the brick such as the effect of brooding on worldly objects that it makes the yoki stray from the path of yoga now this is after this somati so this type of somati it won't be that very highest type that when the mind really gets immersed in that it's very difficult to bring the mind back down but still any type of smart is good we don't know it has to be some transforming power from that worldly people may now and then experience samadhi now he's so confusing here we hear that he's absolutely free from all desires and everything to have that experience now he says worldly people mean now and then experience samanthi what does it say for worldly people so it really means worldly people sometimes we it may just mean people living in the world but here it means yeah be sure that people who have some attachment to sense enjoyment may now and then experience samantha the lotus blooms no doubt when the sun is up but its petals close again when the sun is covered by a cloud worldly thought is the cloud now we may say that the somati means yes mine gets gathered together for just a brief second or something some glimpse something like that very hard to know m isn't it possible to develop both guyana and bhakti by the practice of spiritual discipline so still by now emma has been with trauma christian for like a year and a half over a year now almost two years still these little questions are there and uh analyzing his own mind does he really like this path of devotion with his path of knowledge does he really like the impersonal absolute or this relationship with god all these things are percolating in his mind it seems master through the path of bhakti a man may attain them both if it is necessary god gives him the knowledge of brahman but a highly qualified aspirant may develop both gyan and bhakti at the same time so the first time he's saying that we follow the peter bhakti and then we get to the roof and then then we feel that oneness now we're saying that there's some who can do both at the same time kind of combine them in their spiritual practice such is the case with the ishwara kotis so now he's really restricting it caitanya for example ishwarakoti chaitanya he see the avatar is included in the ishwarakoti thakura always considered him an avatar also but the case of ordinary devotees is different there are five kinds of light the light of a lamp the light of various kinds of fire the light of the moon the light of the sun and lastly the combined light of the sun and moon bhakti is the light of the moon he goes cooling and gianna the light of the sun scorching it'll it'll burn up all the ignorance sometimes it is seen that the sun has hardly said when the moon rises in the sky you'll see both of them together in an incarnation of god one sees at the same time the sign of knowledge and the moon of love by the way this is this is rocky ponyva maybe last night in some places they celebrated in india yeah the full moon night and uh also the birthday is niranjana one of the direct disciples of srama krishna okay so we'll stop we'll stop here is page 351. [Music] foreign [Music] we bow our heads before srama krishna who is stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship [Music] peace peace peace oh
