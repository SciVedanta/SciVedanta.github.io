[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna with commentary by Swami Atmajnanananda (5/22/20)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aSexCWUjBI)

foreign um your words are like nectar bringing life to squirt souls they are praised by poets they remove all sin they are auspicious to hear they're wonderful and exalted those who spread these words are the greatest benefactors in the world welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of sriami krishna those who are following along in the book we're on page 91 and this is the chapter the master and disciple and this is one of the early visits of course maybe third visit of of them to suramar krishna and on that particular day there was a young man in the room by the name of narendra and this is uh possibly the first time it is a little surprising since uh narendra was a regular visitor to the brahmos homage and and was also very close that they didn't know each other maybe they'd seen each other before and of course ann was a little bit older but anyhow this is the first time that they're really uh being introduced to each other and getting to know each other and last time there were several conversations with regard to narendra and how he should behave in the world and sharam krishna had asked him to come again so we'll begin the bottom of page 91 narendra a member of the brahma samaj was very particular about his promises he said with a smile yes sir i shall try i've mentioned the brahmos homage before the the movement itself is not terribly important uh today but uh considering the the number of people uh direct disciples of ceramic christians that came through the brahma-samaj and the householder disciples and the close relationship between kesha chandrasen and shurami krishna the role of the brahma-samaj in the ramakrishna movement is very important and just keshav was really the first one to let the people of kolkata know about suramar krishna because he was so impressed with him and really so free from from jealousy it's really remarkable that he would send people to him and they wrote wrote about him in in their uh what is it called their their magazine that they that they published uh has wrote a small life sketch of swami krishna so many came through at keshav uh how narendra came we we have different uh scenarios you can say one is very well known that one day in his university his regular professor wasn't there so the principal of the school professor hair he came and the topic was about a word to earth and these poets who would go into ecstasy is looking at nature and the story goes that he mentioned if you want to see someone who has these exalted states of consciousness then you can go to dakshineshwar and see suramar krishna so this is one scenario that we have the other we know that the other beloved householder disciple surendra was having a meeting at his house and narendra who lived nearby was called there in order to sing and he met suramar christian the first time it wasn't a very dramatic meeting like the meeting in dakshinishwar but he met him then and srama krishna asked him to come and see him sometime at dakshinishwar so it could be through his professor it could be through that meeting it could be through his contact with the brahma samaj but in any event he started coming the year prior to m so he's already quite well known to srama krishna and we know of all the uh experiences that he had at the touch of swami christian and all of that so he's asking him to start coming more often narendra a member of the brahma samaj was very particular about his promises he said with a smile yes sir i shall try now not only particularly with his promises but joining the brahma-samaj meant really taking a vow really they even signed papers i think that they won't do certain things they won't engage in any uh image worship go into a temple of bao before an image it was considered a type of idolatry because the brahma-samad is very much influenced by western ideas and they didn't have much of a belief in this in guru system or the avatar or even even some of the ideas of a deuter the main way that god was worshiped was as a formless brahmin with certain types of attributes almost like the western style that we see in judaism christianity and islam and based mostly on the upanishads really the founder the initial inspiration was rajya ram mohan roy and then after that rabindranath tagwa's father devendranat and then it came down to that way and keshav became the leader during takur's time and then it split and we see vijay krishna gosvami who was the right-hand man of keshav he joins the other group it gets a little a little complicated but in any event we owe them a great debt of gratitude because they were very instrumental in making taqwa known because he had no interest in publicizing himself even though he had a great interest in his intimate devotees coming to him so much so that during a certain period of his life after he had finished all of his sadhana he told others matar babu and others that the divine mother said that my my real devotees are yet to come because the brahmos members came and he was very fond of them but he wanted someone those to come who would accept his ideal of complete renunciation for the for the sake of god realization so he was waiting for for them really his direct monastic disciples to come so he would question himself mother told me this how is it not true and every night he would go up to the roof there's a building just to the north of srirami krsna's room and the other side where matu babu stayed actually sriracha krishna stayed there his first i think 16 years he didn't move to his present room the one that we know of until after his nephew akshay died in in the other room and he didn't want to stay there anymore so he would go to the roof and cry where are you please come i've been waiting for you and then after that one by one they started to come two of the the two most important of course the render and rakal have already come and they were both friends because they knew each other from the brahmos homage and also a school they used to go to the same gymnasium in those days there was a lot of emphasis on on sports and wrestling and exercise and things like that so they they knew each other there we'll see rachael also today so he said with a smile yes or i shall try as they were returning to the master's room surama krishna said to em when peasants go to market to buy bullocks for their plows they can easily tell the good from the bad by touching their tails on being touched there so meekly lie down on the ground the peasants recognize that these are without metal and so reject them they select only those bullocks that frisk about and show spirit when their tails are touched narendre is like a bullock of this latter class he is full of spirit within the master smiled as he said this and continued there are some people who have no grit whatever they are like flattened rice soaked in milk soft and mushy no inner strength this was one of the uh favorite expressions of swami krishna he used to say kubrow that means that we have to have tremendous grit tremendous determination and swamiji he used to say that uh if somebody says that you have to empty the ocean with a blade of grass you can go and and you put a grade in one drop at a time and if you have that type of perseverance that you won't give up you can and then you can you can realize god so said because it's tough it's not easy we think we're making some progress and then we get disappointed and we fall back and we lose our enthusiasm so we have to have this tremendous grit swamiji had a couple of other nice expressions when people would say why do you keep leading this type of life if you're if you're not experiencing the highest uh realization and everything so he said uh just because i can get genji's water to drink should i drink dirty ditch water so and then uh what was the other one but ram and shyam huh if if i can't find my friend ram shall i just go to the other friend something like that anyhow the point point is that uh we we have to have tremendous determination taco gives another example if somebody takes up something just as a hobby somebody is a city boy but he thinks oh let me try to take up farming have a garden and everything and the first year he doesn't get any crop at all he works very hard and then he says okay i gave it a try and then gives it up but if someone is a farmer and they don't know anything with farming and their ancestors have done it year after year after year whether they have a good crop or a bad crop they'll continue because they're farmers this is what they do and this is this is this is their life so in spiritual life we have to have that feeling also whether we succeed or fail this is this is what we do this is who we are this is what our life is all about we have to have this tremendous grit determination so that means that at the slightest obstacle we don't simply give up we have to continue it was dusk the master was meditating on god he said to him go and talk to narendra then tell me what you think of him now takur usually he would say what do you think of me but this is this is his way not of judging narendra it's not that if m comes back and says oh he's an ordinary person that taku will say oh okay i thought he was something special but he's just ordinary he's testing m because he knows that narendra is something very very special and he wants to see if am has that enough of an insight to also recognize this in greatness of nurendra this is number one number two takur like to see his devotees form a certain type of relationship and friendship he wanted them all to feel like their one family but he also would pair them off together he would say i'm like the the housewife who knows what pot goes with what lid goes with what pot we have a whole bunch of pots and lids and they're all scattered about and we try and see which one fits we have that with the tupperware [Music] we have dozens and dozens of of things that people have brought food for us and they're all in our pantry and half the time the tops don't fit the bottoms and we have to figure out what goes with what so tucker would say the expert housewife she knows automatically what goes with what that meant that tucker knew that which devotees personality wise made a good pair and could help each other in spiritual life either because they were the same wavelength or they complemented each other and fulfilled their lack in the other but he knew that so we'll see what uh later with the bhavanat bhavanatan and narendra he was happy to see them come together but he also uh wanted to see em and narendra develop a friendship and i mentioned last time they developed a very very close friendship uh even to the point where i am used to give money to narendra's mother after they were in such a dire straits without saying anything to anybody so they they had a very nice relationship despite the fact that and was also a little bit slow to accept some of swamiji's ideas when he came back from the west two things in particular one was to start he wanted the monks to start preaching and the second was he wanted them to start doing social service work and m always remembered the srama krishna telling them that you need as a badge of authority before you can preach otherwise it won't make any difference to people no one will listen to you and also saying that first realize god and then uh live in the world and do other things but uh and and then wasn't the only one swami yogan on this one we primitive many of them but they all came around and understood that not only was this really brilliant on swamiji's part but it was very consistent with the teachings of suramar krishna and the wonderful thing is that the one person who had no doubt that this was tucker's work this so all of these things was holy mother she was the one who had that that insight more than even the other direct disciples did but eventually they all came to to appreciate of course swamiji's ideas and they all knew that swamiji was carrying the torch srama christian had told all of them that he'll be your leader you follow him that he's doing my bidding so they all knew that even though they didn't quite understand all the time so he wants the two of them to meet together evening worship was over in the temples em met narendra on the bank of the ganges and they began to converse narendra told them about his study in college his being a member of the brahma samaj and so on it was now late in the evening and time for m's departure but he felt reluctant to go and instead went in search of suramar krishna he had been fascinated by the master singing and wanted to hear more at last he found the master pacing alone in the not one deer in front of the kali temple if you go to dakshineshwar you'll see this big covered area by the open on the side some pillars holding it up they used to have jatras plays and musical performances anything the idea was that if you have some dance performance or something like that this is visible from the kali temple mother kali can see it this is also a type of of of worship uh presenting some enjoyment for the divine mother to watch and of course for the devotees as well so takur and others would sometimes sit there also sit there quietly you could sit there and meditate and from there looking upward you can see the image of mother kali a lamp was burning at the temple on either side of the image of the divine mother the single lamp and the spacious not mandir blended light and darkness into a kind of mystic twilight in which the figure of the master could be dimly seen em had been enchanted by the master sweet music with some hesitation he asked him whether there would be any more singing that evening no not tonight said shiramikrishna after a little reflection now we already know from the earlier visit that whenever it became dusk whenever the sun would set this uh chandrabala they say that the surrounding christian would go into a very deep mood he would this divine intoxication would automatically come upon him he didn't try or think about it or anything but it would just automatically come this this change from day into night that the mind would go in into some high spiritual mood so he was in that type of mood so he said after a little reflection as if remembering something he said but i'm going soon to balaram boasts his house in calcutta come there and you'll hear me sing am agreed to go now this balarambush he also plays a very very important role in this this ramakrishna leelah suramar krishna it's it's said went to his house stayed there a hundred times on a hundred different occasions more than any other place in calcutta and he loved the balarambo so balaramboch was i belong to a very orthodox division of a family in fact most of the members were so orthodox that they really were not very happy that he was visiting ceramic christian who didn't belong to their community their community was a very tight in ingrown type of of community uh even though suramar christian had tremendous love for caitanya deva and and this krishna leela and everything else uh they didn't have that same liberal attitude that srama krishna had of course that balaram bosu was different and extremely humble and extremely simple and very generous his house in calcutta became almost like a second monastery because many of the the monks would stay there that swami turian understood there swami brahman understand there latu murad stayed there kokomo many of them swami brahmananda was always hesitant to stay in berman during the rainy season because of malaria so very often he would stay there with them so the house was open it was like their own house they were the mother ominous his wife also who was was very highly devoted uh they they've just kept it as a place where any of the direct disciples could stay and they also had a relationship to a marriage with babur which swami prayment on his family so it was a little bit tight-knit there were different relationships uh swami ramananda was also through marriage related to mitra one of them anyhow so they they they all kind of got related a little bit and swamiji also were related a little bit distant i think but they were also related to each other master do you know balarambosch see em had agreed without really knowing who he was in those days of course there were many people living in calcutta but it's not like today and if there was a certain area and there were people who are well known you could probably find out people would know where they lived so it wasn't so unusual that he agreed to go without really knowing him so am says no sir i don't master he lives in boshpara well sir i shall find him as foreign christian walked up and down the hall with m he said to him let me ask you something what do you think of me so earlier he wants to see what do you think of narendra now takua did not lack in self-confidence he didn't need people to flatter him in fact he he he would make fun of flatterers very often jodo malek used to keep these flatters around him and he would say why do you keep these these clowns and bladders with you all of the time so they said so that you can save the funny incident but anyhow uh this was his way of of judging because uh there's a saying that only god really realized soul can recognize that god realized so now he's not trying to say is is there a god realized soul but if he has any type of of spiritual sensitivity he'll recognize the greatness of srama krishna and if he belongs to that place srirami krishna used to use that that expression that meant that someone was his very own there's a look he belongs to this place that means that they have this relationship not simply from this lifetime and takur used to in in his mystic vision he used to see what connection these all of these disciples had in a previous lifetime or what he just said what gore he used to use this term room that where they belonged someone belonged to this to the the area of radha for example or krishna or arjuna something like that not that they were necessarily the incarnation or anything but uh they they came from that that was their their their their nature somehow m uh and balaram boasts both of them he had a vision once with the caitanya deva was doing kirtan and there were all these people there and he said i saw balarambos was one of the followers of caitanya deva and he said i believe that i saw him there also very curious without without tremendous conviction but i believe that i saw him there also so the ballarambos was in grade one of the great householder disciples of srama krishna and was a very soft-spoken very humble type of person very sweet natured am well sir i shall find him as for i'm a christian walked up and down the hall with them he said to him let no sorry let me ask you something what do you think of me and remain silent again swami krishna asked what do you think of me how many of knowledge of god have i am i don't understand what you mean by anas but of this i am sure i've never before seen such knowledge ecstatic love faith in god renunciation and catholicity anywhere the master left now the honest of course this uh the old way of counting paisa in india that uh charana 4 annas is 25 paisa so 16 honest will make one rupee so if you say 8 honest that means 50 percent 12 is 75 percent like that now i'll tell you an interesting story uh this uh was a conversation that i had once with swami buddhist he was president at that time and he is the one who gave me initiation into brahmacaria and into sannyas both now whenever we went to bellarmore it's still the custom that all of the monks will go generally every morning unless there's some special occasion or he's giving initiation we'll go every morning just the monks will go and they'll make pranam and and then leave now during swami's position on his time he didn't like the monks to make predominantly leave he liked them to stay and ask questions and it was a tremendous experience because his his sense of humor and his his simplicity it is very naive sense of humor it was so sweet and uh his answers to questions were so insightful that the monks myself included i looked forward to it every day we couldn't wait to go and it would take about 15 minutes and it was just so enjoyable and wonderful that uh to do and most of these things have many have been recorded there's something called pariprashna and these these are recorded conversations that took place mostly during those periods the monks would ask questions and he would give answers but very sweet and simple half the time we would be laughing at him because of his simplicity not that he's telling jokes all of the time but i generally if if we were coming from outside of biller mutt the first day perhaps we would go and and not being back with everybody else to go in front and make pranam or the day that we left so this was the day i was i was leaving so they let me go and and actually make otherwise we're at a slight distance make pranam and touch his feet and i sat there and everything and he was speaking he spoke in bengali all of the time even though he could speak beautiful english he gave beautiful lectures in english also but everyone there more or less understood bengali so he looked at me and he said oh but he won't understand now i knew some bengali of course so the other monk said no no he knows bengali he knows bengali so he looked at me and he said how much bengali do you know so i said uh we do our donna that means fifty percent of that i could follow of what he said because uh he spoke quickly as uh he was elderly uh his speech wasn't so clear and everything so he laughed so much and he looked at me and he said baba we don't have anas anymore in india so this was the old style i of course didn't know do people still use that anymore to say fifty percent but and it was a very sweet memory of mine whenever i i read this about this uh how many honors of knowledge do i have i remember that incident okay so am also says i don't know what you mean by honest but of this i'm sure i've never before seen such knowledge ecstatic love faith in god renunciation and catholicity anywhere now the m was also not one to flatter anyone not one to exaggerate when them says this he means it he may be even understating it because when he saw srama krishna he felt that sukadeva himself or chaitanya david himself were there present before him he was it was that impressed at the very first meeting the master laughed and bowed low before him and took his leave he had gone as far as the main gate of the temple garden when he suddenly remembered something and came back to sryama krishna who was still in the not mandir now will get my favorite image in the entire gospel of srama krishna this is something that i have pictured so many times in the dim light remember that the sun has set and there are a couple of lamps burning in the natman deer and the light in the temple so it's it's quite dark in the dim light the master all alone was pacing the hall rejoicing in the south atmarama this state rejoicing in the self as the lion lives and roams alone in the forest the pashupati the lord of the jungle uh this this image to me is so sweet because uh we we get this this picture of srama krishna in a state of such a joy not in the temple not seeing the image of the divine mother but just the joy wailing up within so much so that he can't even sit still pacing back and forth walking back and forth if you've seen a lion of course not in the jungle we see him in the zoo but even then pacing back and forth with the tremendous strength and power within knowing that nothing can touch it fearless but also this this idea that there's everything is is within that joy is within so this is that atmarama state and if we want to have some some idea of what it's like we can picture sriraman krishna pacing back and forth hardly aware aware of where he is completely in drawn uh jesus filled with the bliss of the self estate in silent wonder m surveyed that great soul master to m so he wasn't he wasn't lost in ecstasy he was aware of what was taking place but the mind was a high level but he saw him what makes you come back and perhaps the house you asked me to go to belongs to a rich man they may not let me in i think i'd better not go i would rather meet you here see he had promised he said i will go he didn't want to not go without telling him so to give him a reason for that master oh no why should you think that now he says a very simple thing just mention my name just mention my name say that you want to see me then someone will take you to me years later and would look back and there's a very simple statement repeating the name of srama krishna this is repeating the name of sri ramakrishna is in itself a very sacred thing and even during holy mother's time she started giving his name as for initiation so srirami krishna felt that i don't know if he really felt it though now i've been initiated i should repeat his name nothing like that exactly but he took this as something very significant just as when tucker said come again he took that as something very significant that oh this this god realized soul he wants me to come again so he said yes i'll come here normally we've it's like you know see you later and say okay see you later we don't pay too much attention to it everybody says it average show it doesn't mean much but em uh whatever srirami krsna said really this was these were these were blissful words these were these were the gospel to him so he took that as something very very significant i mentioned i think in the first talk that and made a list of uh uh not only did he record all of the words he made a list of things which he called the upadeshas direct instruction whenever surrounded krishna said something to him that it was a direct instruction he kept that separate and when he made a great statement he kept that separate uh keeping a list of the equivalent to panasonic mahavakias so the words of srama krishna for m where holy is the vedas they've they carry tremendous weight so even just saying take my name let me when you go there they just say the taco told me to come that you'll be very much welcome there m nodded his ascent and after saluting the master took his leave this is the end of that chapter and now we'll find that uh m does go to balaram bose's house and this will be the uh the next meeting now uh we have the first time that m gives dates this is march 11 1882. if we remember the last time i think he just gave the month so march 11 1882 about eight o'clock in the morning suramar krishna went is planned to balaram boasts his house in calcutta okay so he wasn't going that same day he said i'm going soon to balaram boasts his house okay it was the day of the duljatra who became swami brahman and of course nitigopal and other devotees were with him m2 came as bidden by the master now he'll get to meet little by little some of the very important disciples and devotees of srama krishna here we have rama ram chandra i mentioned was a relative of swamiji uh suramar krishna went to his house often and he had a garden house built this was common for well-to-do people in calcutta that they live in the city but in the suburbs a little bit away from the crowded area they'll have a garden house where they can go and spend some time it'll be a quiet place they can have the shrine there and do their meditation and everything that house that he had built at garden house in a place called concor gachi is now one of the main centers of our order djogodan it's called and surrounding krishna went there many times and after his passing away when there was no place for the young boys to stay there was no monastery at that time and there was really no place to install the ashes of ceramic christian the relics after their cremation that uh rahm said i will keep it here we'll we'll have a special place made for it and it will be a sacred place everybody can come and we can have a worship here and all of that so it was agreed to but swamiji narendra and some of the others knew that sri ramakrishna and srimatu has said to swamiji that wherever you carry me on your shoulder there i'll stay now they took this as meaning that the relics this wasn't the only meaning of course but one way that they understood it was that uh he will dwell in a special sense manifest in a special sense where uh the the ashes and bone the relics will be kept so these young boys felt that if if the ashes are kept in rom's place and they'll be put in the casket it'll be in turret in the ground it'll be impossible to get them up that what to do so secretly they took a good portion probably a better portion of of the the relics the ash and and bone whatever was left and they kept it separately now we sometimes think that there was a little bit of a split between the monastic disciples and the householder disciples but actually m knew about it in badrambos also and if if memory serves me correctly i think that this portion that they kept they kept it mother ambose's house at that time eventually of course when the belarus was started or veronica was started first then they took those ashes and they had them in a container which they also called atmaram and this was the way that taco was worshipped mainly in the early days there was no image or anything there were photographs of him of course but this was the main thing and whenever there was an initiation or something they would always come and worship the relics now these relics the ones that were kept in in the congregation in ramachanda this house they're still there of course and the others are underneath there's a there's a kind of open underneath the area beneath the floor the main temple of bermud and this is where the other ashes are kept so that's ram then monomohan mitra he was the great householder devotee who was father-in-law of raqqa and this is another interesting thing that raquel's marriage we may say that uh what was the what was the point of all that he's going to become a monk it was through his wife's family that he came to suramar krishna so there was some instrumentality there any other of course and probably they came together uh the son-in-law and father-in-law nitigopal he is a very curious uh character in this divine play sriyama krishna had a very high opinion of him because he used to go into ecstatic moods he was also quite young he was probably around 20 or something more or less the same age as the other direct disciples and taco sometimes would say that he's in the state of the part of mahamsa because he would go into ecstasy missing that but he never became could say antaranga the part of the the inner circle the way the others did and uh this inner circle outer circle business this this kind of got uh fixed a little bit when takur had his final illness in kashipur and at that time we can hear the direct disciples talking about this nitigopal how he also didn't really become one of the inner circle at that time the other curious thing is bhavanat bhavanath who was great friends with narendra and taqwa loved him dearly and takur also looked upon him as initi siddha sometimes even included him as a ishwara koti he also drifts away a little bit at the end so there are always some curiosities in things that are a little hard to understand in this divine play like judas in the play of christ why he turns against them and turns them in and everything so this is nithya gopal now i i hear and that somebody showed me that there's even a movement in the temple that now he's considered by some to be a an avatar so i i don't know much about his later life but he did he was looked upon as as a as a guru and a spiritual leader and god realized so and had a a small following like that so m2 came as bitten by the master the devotees and the master sang and danced in a state of divine fervor several of them were in an ecstatic mood now we'll see this nithya this ecstatic mood of course when one goes in and tucker is there a little bit easier they all get lifted up as it were so it may seem strange how is it possible in one place that these people are having the ecstasy and everything but uh this this is a little bit contagious several of them were in an ecstatic mood nitigopa's chest glowed with the upsurge of emotion and roccal lay on the floor in ecstasy completely unconscious of the world the master put his hand on rachel's chest and said peace be quiet this was rocco's first experience of ecstasy it's also interesting in the dakshineshwara when rock all had his first experience of ecstasy there takara always remembered where he he was standing or sitting and he would point to that spot this is where rachael had his ecstasy here he lived with his father in calcutta and now and then visited the master at dakshineshwar about this time he had studied a short while at vidyasagar school at shampakur when the music was over the devotee sat down for their meal balarama stood there humbly like a servant nobody would have taken him for the master of the house m was still a stranger to the devotees having met only narendra at dakshinishwar a few days later even now we don't have the exact date for this one a few days later and visited the master at dakshineshwar it was between four and five in the afternoon the master and he were sitting on the steps of the shiva temples if you go to dak cheneshwar you'll see just south of tucker's room there are a line of temples that their line of 10 12 12. a line of six and then that opening to go into the compound and the south of that and another line of six so and and this is where the steps are to go down to the main area where the other temples are takwa very often would sit on those steps so the master and here we're sitting on the steps of the shiva temples looking at the temple of rata kanta so that means that his back is to the ganga and he's facing east he can see the temple of radha kanta and behind that you can see the spires the top of the of the kali temple looking at the temple of radhakanta across the courtyard the master went into an ecstatic mood since his nephew hridoy is dismissal from the temple suramar christian had been living without an attendant on account of his frequent spiritual moods he could hardly take care of himself the lack of an attendant caused him great inconvenience now friday dismissals from the temple this is also an interesting story fredoy we've met him already he was talk with nephew but they were more or less the same age he wasn't a very deep thinker he was more active type he wasn't very brave to be perfectly honest and takro himself would say that spiritually he had respect for srama krishna and everything up to a point uh but wasn't really a fit candidate he what didn't belong to the class of the other disciples of course once he wanted some type of ecstasy and he asked ramakrishna and very reluctantly krishna granted him some type of experience and afterwards he said this is not for me this is too much and you know his later life was a little bit sad also but what happened here at one time he had a great desire to worship the divine mother and as part of that worship a part of that is was what called kumari puja seeing the divine mother and a young girl and worshipping her as the manifestation of the divine mother now ridor got it into his head that he would worship the young daughter of tarelkyanat who was another son-in-law of the rani rani rashmuni and dave their family was very highly respected because she was was such a powerful woman and did such a tremendous feed with this this kali temple and served so many people but at the same time they did not belong to a high cast this kyborte cast the fisherman cast so for him to of course being a brahmin for him to worship the feet to worship this little girl who belonged to a much lower a caste was considered something very inauspicious and they were very nervous that something bad will happen and very annoyed and because of that they decided that that ridoid would have to leave now if i if i have my stories correct remember i am i'm getting to be a an old man now and i and my memory is not so good but if memory served me correctly this was the incident where uh somebody was told you tell this freedom he has to leave the temple precinct he's not welcome to stay here anymore that this person didn't know who hridoy was and he mistook srama krishna for friday and he told srama krishna that the authorities have decided that you have to leave the temple that you can't stay here anymore so srama krishna without any signs of anger or questioning anything they say he took his gamja threw it over his shoulder and started walking where would he go who no but he has such dependence on the divine mother and was so free from care and worry about what will happen that he'll always be taken care of that without thinking or anything he just started walking when word got back to the the temple authorities what had happened they of course they ran as fast as they could they fell at his feet and said no no it was a mistake it's not you ready please come back so he said okay and he came back as if nothing had happened so there's a very interesting story but this was the beginning of a very sad period that friday he left and went back to his village and and was not very successful in making a living and there's a very touching scene when he comes later to see suramar krishna and taqwa leaves the the his room and goes and meets him on the footpath em is also there and herrido falls at his feet taku says how are you doing he said no i'm not doing well and he said what's wrong and he said i've lost your company. he doesn't talk about there's no crop and we're not making money or anything the first thing he says is because i've lost your company and takur so sweet to him even though ridoi later in his stay with israeli christian as his attendant became very proud of being his attendant and became uh really very bossy and uh would actually almost torture sriami krishna there's so many incidents things that he did when taqweri had a very weak stomach he would get sick he'd always say look at me i can eat anything and shrimp krishna at one time said he was tortured so much by sridoy he was about to drown himself in the in the ganges and one incident which is very hard to understand the holy mother came one time and rito it was so insulting to her that she and her father that they turned around and left and taco was there and we everyone wonders how could he allow that to happen but the the real fact is that uh he he was so intimidated by this redoi that it was really necessary for the divine mother to create some type of circumstance where he would have to leave so it was good in that sense that that he left him but surrounding christian has no attendant so this is becomes a big problem some of you may have heard i spoke last night no wednesday night yeah i told the story about swami premana was one of the the young boys who came to sriami krishna who also became one of the attendants now there were many others lotto maraju was there rakhal stayed very often there were others who stayed there but when srama christian would go into samadhi his body was so sensitive that the touch of anyone uh who uh wasn't 100 pure in heart and pure in mind and simple that he could feel something some disturbance if someone was really a very bad character it could feel like he was stung by a blowfish something like that but he used to say this baburama is pure to his very bones and he always wanted him to stay so he was very happy when bhagavad-gita because he was the one when taka would go into samadhi that could hold him up earlier we see redoi doing it and everything but then takur he became even more sensitive to these things so there's friday left and there's no one to look after him at that time raquel will start coming and staying more often as i say the others will also start coming suramar krishna was talking to kali the divine mother of the universe so think of this they're sitting on the steps together he's looking at the temple he's going into some ecstatic moon and he's talking to the divine mother he said mother everyone says my watch alone is right the christians the brahmos the hindus the muslims all say my religion alone is true but mother the fact is that nobody's watch is right who can truly understand thee but if a man prays to thee with a yearning heart he can reach thee through thy grace by any path now of course uh everything has says layers of meaning this is also for m's sake all of this not that that tucker is pretending or faking or or creating this but there's also for m's not that m wasn't liberal he was also very liberal in his thinking but anyhow uh half the time we find taqwa talking loud to the divine mother is to teach others especially this prayer so many times that he'll pray to the divine mother that i pray only for pure love and pure devotion everything this is for the benefit of everything and for us mother show me some time how the christians pray to thee in their churches but mother what will people say if i go in suppose they make a fuss suppose they don't allow me to enter the kali temple again well then show me the christian worship from the door of the church now we'll get us another visit and and again we don't have a date now before this was march 11th the next day it will be april 12th but he says another day the master was seated on the small couch so that so far we've had like five visits something like that four or five visits without exact dates yet the master was seated on the small couch in his room there was a one little larger bed as we enter in his room on the western side of the room and then a smaller one right next to it where tako used to sit he slept on the other one and he used to sit and converse with the devotees on the small one just a wooden wooden bed they called it a couch small couch in his room with his usual beaming countenance and arrived with kali krishna this kali krishna is not later our swami virgin kali krishna kali krishna was a young student of m's and kali krishna and there were three or four of them who were all students of the m's who formed a very close relationship with them and several of them used to go to ram the ram chandra data after takwa passed away he was a little bit of a guru himself maybe even had disciples and many would go to him and am said to this khali krishna and his friends it's wonderful that you're going to him he's a great disciple that you'll hear everything about srama krishna but if you really want to know what taco was like you have to go and meet his monastic disciples so he's the one who sent them to meet swamiji and the others and that kali krishna was the first non-direct disciple of swami krishna to join the order he had to go back for a short period for some months because his health broke down and in the meantime this uh sudhir swami she joined so he was he became the first president after the direct disciples possibly because formerly he was a little senior and then this khali krishna swami virgin he became the second president of the order after the direct disciples but this is a different kali krishna i don't know who this one is emirates with kali krishna who did not know where his friend am was taking him he had only been told if you want to see a grog shop then come with me you will see a huge jar of wine there and related this to srama krishna who laughed about it the master said the bliss of worship and communion with god is the true wine the wine of ecstatic love the goal of human life is to love god bhakti is the one essential thing to know god through gyana and reasoning is extremely difficult now this will be a theme that will get throughout the gospel of srama krishna it's a theme that we find in the bhagavad-gita also that is a path of knowledge a little bit tough and it's for people with very special qualifications with people with tremendous dispassion and renunciation and not much body consciousness and thakura used to say in this kali yuga that we're on the whole life is centered in in the body and food and health and all of that so the people of this age are not very well suited to the path of knowledge even though most of what we get the teaching of swami krishna really are full of the wisdom of gyani yoga but he wanted that to be a foundation for this dualistic practice a non-dualistic foundation for dualistic practice of of devotion then the master sang who is there that can understand what mother kali is even the six of our sinners are powerless to reveal her this was one of the ram prasad songs that srama krishna is saying very often ram prasad was really a role model for srama krishna that ram prasad was in grade on devotee of the divine mother and really we can say a poet saint he was from a village or town now called the halishahora you can go there i went one time and ram versailles the house is still there and very close to the where he used to go for a bad bathing god where he would sing his songs and that's where uh the uh one of the local maharajas heard him singing and and uh gave him a stipend and helped him out and where he passed away i think it was his uh when he was 80 years old on the night of the worship of mother kali uh chest deep in the ganga passed away like that anyhow this is one of the songs of ram prasad taqwa used to say mother you revealed yourself to ram prasad why not to me so he loved him very much there's a this is a play on words here darshan means vision of god but darshan is also one of the philosophy there are six darsunas so he says you can scour through all of the six darsinas but you won't find the vision you won't get that direct division the darshana looking through all of the darshanas so the nice play on words in the song the master said again the one goal of life is to cultivate love for god the love that the milkmaids the milkman and the cowboy boys of vrindavan felt for krishna so this is when krishna went away to matara the cow heard roamed about weeping bitterly because of their separation from him saying this the master sang with his eyes turned upward just now i saw a youthful cowherd with a young calf in his arms there he stood by one hand holding the branch of a young tree where are you brother kanai is the name of krishna but kanai scarcely could the other was as much as he could say he cried where are you brother and his eyes were filled with tears oh late when him heard this song of the masters laden with love his eyes were moist with tears so very fortunate that we've reached the end of that day just when we're ready to stop so the next meeting that em will have with srama krishna will be the first where he gives the actual date it will be april 2nd and you know this is a great theme that this the path of knowledge sri ramakrishna used to say can get to the outer gates of the palace but devotion will get us to the inner gate now that doesn't mean that we can't have god realization to the path of knowledge but this uh path of devotion allows us to realize god in all aspects with with the power divine power with the shakti with all of the the manifestations and everything but we we shouldn't think that one is superior to the other taco we always said that it's a question of individual taste and individual powers of digestion so we will stop here i will close with the chant foreign [Music] who is perfectly pure eternal the essence of bliss whose whose heart melts with love and compassion for the devotees uh who is the divine incarnation himself to that uh worship the adorable srama krishna we bow down so i thank all of you and look forward to meeting you again the next class thank you very much
