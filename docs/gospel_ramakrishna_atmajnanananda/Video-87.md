[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna by Swami Atmajnanananda (01/28/22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3Jn5SyZ0fY)

foreign [Music] your words are like nectar and bringing life to scorched souls they are praised by poet and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of srama krishna we are on the chapter instruction to vaishnavas and rambos this is page 297 and it is wednesday september 26 1883. and just to go back it says that there were few devotees very few deputies with the master because it's a wednesday and most of them came on saturday or on holidays sorry sundays or holidays so suramar krishna is talking to them mostly mostly he's talking to an m but no all of them were there and he was talking about the interesting topic that uh this narada that he's talking about how he heard this from uh one sadhu who was from the panti group that means he was a sikh the father from the sikh group we don't hear too much about that nowadays but this was one of the teachings that tucker when we say he heard it from somebody or he says he heard it from somebody that doesn't mean that he it was something new for him or that something that he learned from somebody else he gives credit to him but this was a deep-seated conviction that he had about the bhakti yoga and really it's very much in keeping with what we find in the bhagavad-gita that all the paths are good path of gyana yoga is a little more difficult because it requires a little renunciation so adds this in the kali yuga we can simply take that to mean in the present age we don't have to get too specific about these different yogas although there are different teachings in the different yogas that uh one is donna one is bhakti i don't remember all of them but the different things are suitable to the review anyhow it simply means that at present is a path of devotion as taught by narada is the is the most appropriate now i was going to read it i forgot to bring it uh in the introduction to swami pradesh uh his commentary on the on the gospel he devotes a lot of time to this idea and very simply he doesn't take this in in too much of a technical sense that there's any particular teaching in not others that we have to point to mostly it means that devotion has to be motiveless it should be pure devotion excuse me maybe maybe try a glass of water do i have one i have one i have no no that's okay where are you going don't go upstairs this is right here so this is a pure devotion and that it doesn't seek anything other than love of god this is the main thing that we don't ask for anything short of that now we know that if we have a particular attitude that we can pray to god for anything but dr says that why pray for anything short of the highest that if you go in front of a king you won't ask for gourds and cucumbers and things thank you so uh but on the other hand there are a few special things in the bhakti sutras that are our special teachings that tucker gives also this thing about uh increasing the passions and give a twist and give them a new direction uh there's vyakulota that he talked about maybe half a dozen special things that takara also emphasizes so that i have my my doubt that perhaps thakur was more familiar with the not of the bhakti sutras than we think it won't quote them or anything but he was so familiar with so many different scriptures that there's every chance that he uh had had attended discussions and things about them about the sutras in any event this was what he learned from this young sadhu and then says are not sadhus of his class followers or the vedanta master yes they are but they also accept the path of devotion the fact is that in the kali yuga one cannot holy follow the path laid down in the vedas once a man said to me that he would perform the purist of the gayatri we finished with this last week you remember this has to be a reference to or the ishan again now that keeps coming up i said why don't you do that according to the tantra in the kali yuga the discipline of tantra is very efficacious now if we want to be very strict and say that naruto will be devotion to krishna because this this is what is most emphasized there then we can say that tucker didn't take it in in any narrow sense any concept of god so he's here he's emphasizing calling on god his mother this is not one of the five harvards and the in the division of a tradition but is is the same the same philosophy behind it that we can have different attitudes and different different relationships so takur he accepted uh these whatever we find in the not of the bhaktivedanta he didn't restrict it to any sectarian he removed any sectarian element to it so not just a division of a text but for anything it is so this is the new part that's what we finished with last week it is extremely difficult to perform the rights and joined in the vedas further at the present time people lead the life of slaves there's a footnote perhaps the master was referring to the foreign rule in india i would say that this is this is certainly part of it but also taco felt that putting oneself in what they used to call service in those days that means having some boss over you and it was a civil service system was highly bureaucratic everybody had a boss over them and he felt that somehow there was something demeaning about that type of work maybe it was a modern type of work maybe you know it wasn't something that maybe they knew about so much in the villages to do that type of work they were more farmers and things like that but we have a few instances where niranjin for example that takur knew that he would become a sanyasit and when he heard that he had taken service this is what he took a job that he said if i didn't know that he was doing it for his mother's sake there was no one to to look after the mother and he had to earn money he said i couldn't have looked at him that meant that he felt that it was a very demeaning thing uh to to have the type of job where there's a boss always bossing over you that that type of thing and this was most of the indians had jobs especially in calcutta with this type of bureaucratic civil servant servant type of job it is said that those who serve others for 12 years or so become slaves they acquire the traits of those they serve while serving their masters they acquire the regis the thomas the spirit of violence the love of luxury and the other traits of their masters not only do they serve their masters but they also enjoy a pension after their term of service is over there's also this idea that uh working for the sake of somebody above us is not the same as working for god is so little element of doing everything as an offering to god a little bit different difficult than that type of environment once a vidantic monk came here he used to dance at the sight of a cloud he would go into an ecstasy of joy over a storm he would get very angry if anyone went near him when he meditated now this is this is someone that takur is talking about as a high soul right he's not saying is god realized but but uh and yet gets angry so we have to remember that these even the great sadhus they can get angry sometimes that they're also human beings we have to excuse them sometimes so he would get very angry if anyone went near when he meditated one day i came to him while he was meditating and that made him very cross he discriminated constantly brahman alone israel and the world is illusory there's one nice incident when totopuri and takur were sitting around the sacred fire dhuni and this was really see uh i don't know how much influence of the artist hamas there was in in at that time maybe some who knows that he was from punjab anyhow this was the main form of worship with fire other than that it was also for shaivites and everything that anyhow so this fire is a sacred thing and who came free was it huh yeah one one of them [Music] one of the workers so one of the workers from the temple came and wanted to lie this is his tobacco his charcoal and he uses the charcoal to for his for his smoke and the sacred fire and total body got very angry and then takur sitting there just started laughing he said yes now we were talking about this nothing is real that ramen and here he wants to take the stream you get angry so anyhow just shows this that we all have a human mind so he discriminated constantly brahman alone israel and the world is illusory since the appearance of diversity is due to maya he walked about with the prism from a chandelier in his hand one sees different colors through the prism in reality there is no such thing as color likewise nothing exists in reality except brahman now this is a very nice way of understanding saguna brahman near guna brahmin and maya bear with me if we because very often we say what what is the best analogy for brahman the sun or light now does the light of any color okay so tucker says that light is invisible we can't see light no no we see things we see objects because light is there we don't see light itself if we saw the light we wouldn't see the objects if the light is is tinted then it distorts the color of the object if we want to see the object what we think is the real color then we have to have a clear light so light has no color of its own this is a talk word even says that it's invisible we can't see light this will be our near gona brahman now if we say that this is the beginning and the end of the definition of light that it's colorless we won't be getting the full weight because it contains every color of the rainbow within it even though we don't see it so that's the potential so light as containing all possible colors will be segundo brahmin now how does it manifest it has to pass through a prism this prism is maya the light on the other side of the prism is all the different colors the sun itself is unchanged even though the light is taking all the other colors there so the ergonomic is always there that sagono vermin is that which is allowing that potential of color to be seen on the other side and maya is that which makes the invisible light visible it turns that unmanifest into the manifest so this is a very nice way of understanding it we if we start out with pure consciousness and we don't admit the potential for that to pass through maya and manifest as the manifold universe then we don't get the full weight we don't get the full picture then we're just uh eliminating the shakti aspect or the saguna aspect of environment so this will be the teaching really of the uh shock to school that this this power to manifest dwells within but it needs the help of maya somehow so anyhow tucker liked that that way of understanding all of this more so than just a false appearance this video false appearance is very very tricky type of philosophy that really the rope never became a snake they just we were seeing it that way out of ignorance that no change ever took place this is a little bit more realistic that yes there is some change taking place when the light passes through the prism but the the sun itself is unchanged it's not that that is changed into it so this this idea of that brahmana becomes the universe it still remains exactly what it was before both are true the light is turning into all the different colors and it's also remaining unchanged anyhow this these are these analogies are meant to to help us understand something which is really beyond our ability to fully understand so one sees different colors through the prism in reality there's no such thing as color likewise not yeah what is color there's no such thing as color the light is bouncing off of an object and and some stimulus in the eye is giving a message to the brain that it's a color does the color actually belong to the object if our if our sense of sight were a little bit different we would see things as a different color there my my father was colorblind he couldn't tell between the red light and the green light many a many animals are colorblind they see everything in black and white but there's no reason to think that because we see the sky is blue and and the earth is brown and the grass is green that there's something absolute about that that's based on the way our things our senses senses function and i have no way of knowing if what i call green is what you call green see my father all these years he thought that uh what he saw is red that we also has red but he saw his green he had that red green type of color blindness yeah so uh so really there's the the color doesn't really belong to the object not even in the way that form we can say form there's something objective about it but color is such a subjective thing we take it for granted that uh we're all seeing the same color maybe we are god knows don't know what what anything looks like to anybody else's eyes likewise nothing exists in reality except brahman but there is an appearance of the manifold because of maya egoism now he's he's bringing it down to the maya as a type of ignorance that covers over us as individuals we have this cosmic idea of maya and this individual idea maya when when he says is maya is eye this ego then we're talking about that which is covering me as an individual causing my individuality but also as an individual not allowing me to see things as they really are difficult concepts this idea of maya so now it's identifying with egoism he meaning the sadhu would not look at an object more than once lest he should be deluded by maya and attachment okay this is a another meaning of maya very specifically used in in modern i don't know about the other languages but in bengali i've told this story before because i never knew this idea of maya when i lived and i spent one year in india staying in the ground floor of a small house then people lived upstairs i lived downstairs and i became very friendly with them they're very very nice a little bit older than i was and everything and one day the uh the father there was a husband and wife and a young daughter father said to me do you know the meaning of maya i didn't know what he was getting at i said yeah some type of cosmic ignorance and that and he said no he said we've developed a little maya for you that'd been attachment that meant a little loving loving attachment it's very sweet the way he said it that was the first time i understood how this that turmaya can be used at least in bengali so he would not look at an object more than once lest he should be deluded by maya and attachment so that means that uh things we like we get attached to also this this maya there's this sense of a high sense of ownership sense of individuality all of these things go into it he would discriminate while taking his bath at the site of birds flying in the sky now i don't know what this means birds flying in the sky and maybe [Music] just the soul flying in the infinite absolute or something not not sure exactly what what he's getting at here he knew grammar okay now for us to know grammar that's that's not a big thing in in india this uh biak i don't know this is a big topic they'll spend 12 years studying it and panini and everything that means quite learned he stayed here for three days that there are some sadhus who do that totopuri they won't stay more than three days in any one place the only time he broke it was when he lived with takur 11 months then of course when he went back to his own ashram he must have stayed there one day he heard the sound of a flute near the embankment and said that a man who would realize brahman would go into samati at such a sound while talking about the monk the master showed his devotees the manners and movement of a paramahamsa takur was a master at mimicking things the way people dance and sing and everything now he's doing it as the puerto rican the gate of a child face paint me with laughter eyes swimming in joy and body completely naked see tucker himself was a paramount we called him that for a good reason that he was like a child that half the time he didn't know if his cloth was on or not he didn't care about nigeria or anything like that he could look like an ordinary person for sadhu to wear these these polish slippers huh and to to wear a regular stitch shirt and everything these were not things that sadhus did in those days but would do it because they weren't bound by anything it's beyond all of these these rules then he again took a seat on the small clouds and poured out his soul and thr enthralling words master to him i learned vedanta from taco never called him by his name because it was considered a little bit disrespectful just like husband and wife also taqwa never called the holy mother of the devi it was always ramla's aunt he would never do that so it's a sign of respect to use some other way of referring to somebody so we all throughout we'll see the ganuz mother and this and that referring to people that uh it was a respectful way of doing it so he always referred to him as the naked one because that was the type of sadhu brahman alone is real the world is illusory the magician performs his magic now again when he says i learned vedanta this means we know by now that takwe had his kind of code words when he said according to the puranas it meant a dualistic devotional type of of teaching according to vedante it mentis yoga and and the magician performs his magic he produces a mango tree which even bears mangoes but this is all sleight of hand the magician alone is real the earliest use of the word maya in the in the is this idea of magic indirect it was magic things like that and then i'll be speaking on maya next month because people have been asking me so many things about it but uh it kind of disappears in the upanishadic period and we get it later upanishad but the earlier punishad we don't we don't run across it we don't have this idea of the world being illusory these are all contributions of chakra charia and and other indoitants and it seems that the whole of life is a long sleep this is a very good way of understanding maya we we don't need any metaphysics to understand maya we can understand maya just in terms of time we look at our lifetime and where did it go does everything seems so real and then it disappears swallowed up by time takur sometimes says that the time itself is minor a very good way of understanding it that's why he always talks about anithia rather than unreal impermanent transitory fleeting his life is fleeting not so much that the objects are unreal but there's life itself this this flow of time every day is just disappearing into the past flowing it's like a river flowing into the ocean disappearing forever the existing test is a faint memory so i am a very nice statement it seems that the whole of life is a long sleep this much i understand this is my favorite statement that em makes in the entire gospel this i fully support this this much i understand that we are not seeing things rightly this much we know that we're in confusion though we we perceive the world with the mind by which we cannot comprehend even the nature of the sky we go back to the sky again so how can our precept perceptions be correct you know sometimes we talk about the sky we see it as blue and yet we know that it has no color so how does that happen how do we superimpose this color on something that's colorless so this this is one of the examples we have for this superposition of master there's another way of looking at it we do not see the sky rightly it looked as if the sky were touching the ground at the horizon this is my favorite example i like this horizon example we think horizon is a line this meeting point of the sky and the earth but the sky is unlimited is they say that's the infinite it's the finite blocking the infinite somehow this is also a type of maya and that intersection is what we call the horizon and that's us the jiva is an intersection between the infinite and the finite and there's no reality to it to that line it's this is apparent meeting point the meaning point between the coverings and the cells so we do not see this the sky correctly rightly it looks as if the sky were touching the ground at the horizon how can a man see correctly his mind is delirious like the mind of a typhoid patient the master saying in his sweet voice what is the delirious fever is this that i suffer from o mother thy grace is my only cure continuing the master said truly it is a state of delirium just see how worldly men quarrel among themselves see we don't have to again go back to this delirium that nothing exists with roman but i'm superimposing objects it can just be or our failure to live in this world as as sensible people to attachment and through selfishness and passions and all of that just see how worldly men quarrel among themselves no one knows what they quarrel about oh how they quarrel may such and such a thing befall you how much shouting how much abuse em i said to kishori who is kishori his younger brother never mentions it not a single time but he loved him they came together so many times the box is empty there's nothing inside but two men pull at it pull at it from either side thinking the box contains money now what does this mean all of the things that we value that property and nice clothes and big cars and big houses all of this that we we think that these are so wonderful we'll be so happy if we get them that there's no substance the hollow almost tucker uses this term rastu and sans grade can mean real and avastu can mean unreal but it can also mean that which has some substance and that which has no substance yeah there's another thing i never knew but art i know it is a philosophical term and somebody told me that means a worthless person so this this of us do the things that we think are so wonderful turns out they're hollow inside we're assuming that we'll crack it open and it'll be so joyful and everything we find there's nothing there so it doesn't happen for everyone but for some people as they go to enjoy the world they'll find this the world is a hollow thing that it can what we're what we're seeking for what we want to satisfy us this world can't supply that so the very m is really uh making some nice statements this day m i said to kishori the box is empty there is nothing inside but two men pull at it from either side thinking the box contains money well the body alone is the cause of all this mischief isn't it the gyani see all this and say to themselves what a relief one feels when this pillowcase of the body drops off now remember this is m speaking not talk word the master name went toward the kali temple see em's life was very unhappy he suffered so much and it's a family life of course and death of children uh i his his wife one half mad he didn't get along with his his brother's older brothers and father and stepmother and everything he had to give up his job over a little quarrel with with yasugar one time and then that had nothing to do had to start his own school and just so many different things so he he knew not just that the hollowness of the world but uh the the danger of the world the the ability of this world to to really really strike us the master name went toward the kali temple master why should you say such things because it almost sounded like he's saying better to die to give up the body and everything so talk to why should you say such things this world may be a framework of illusion but it is also said that it is a mansion of mirth so there's a hollowness of the world if that were the only thing there then of course a depressing idea but if we find out the treasure is within us that real treasure that we're looking at the wrong place for then we know that uh this could be a very joyful thing if we can get hold of that real treasure let the body remain one can also turn this world into a mansion of mirth these are the two songs we we saw before em but where is unbroken bliss in this world master yes where is it absolutely agree with them krishna stood in front of the shrine of kali and prostrated himself before the divine mother m followed him now there was a a time in the beginning when em would sort of just observe because he was so trained in the thinking of the of the brahmos homage that uh they they wouldn't do it and they they had took a pledge not to do it i don't know if uh if the m was really you know if they had to sign an actual form and pledge that they wouldn't do it uh i know some swamiji themselves must have done that and rakhal must have done it because swamiji was was really angry at raqqa that here i see you're bowing down to the temple we took a pledge not to do it but tucker said this is his real nature don't don't worry about that so anyhow it would have been before this but there was a time when we hear em saying to himself that if srama christian himself is doing it that it must be something good to do so from that time one word he would also make predominant in the temple and do all of that there's one very nice incident i think it was in a kali puja night when he went there and ramallah was there and he's looking at the chamber and then ramallah says would you like to wave it in front of the image and then was very very happy to do that so there's joy and and some of this what we call image worship this this this type of puja and everything it's all the question of the heart of our feelings so suramar krishna stood in front of the shrine of kali and prostrated himself before the divine mother m followed him then the master sat on the lower floor in front of the shrine room facing the blissful image and leaned against the pillar of the natalman deer there's a big open hall with the outer pillars and her pillars and and they would have these jackets and things dance performances and things would take place there he wore red bordered cloth a part of which was on his shoulder and back m sat by his side m since there is no unbroken happiness in the world why should one assume a body at all i know that the body is meant only to reap the results of pest action but who knows what sort of action it is performing now that means who knows what type of karma we're accumulating now that's going to keep everything going the unfortunate part is that we are being crushed we can see m is not in a very good state of mind at this point that we don't know what's happening at home and everything uh i i i always have trouble keeping track when he's when he's at home and when he's not at home because when he first meets talk where he had left home and then so many conversations will you go back taco wanted him to go back to reconcile with his father and everything and live at home so he did go back at a certain point maybe he had gone back and he's unhappy there and then ultimately he goes out again and then he lives very often in the school where he taught that morton so he did different things sometimes we know he would go and sleep outside with the beggars and the homeless people and he has to feel what it's like to to be homeless to be like a sin to have nothing and to to be able to i feel so that sympathy and fellow feeling with poor people master if the pea falls into filth it grows into a pea plant nonetheless so i was wondering exactly what it what he means by this almost seems like a non-sequitur why does he bring this up i think i think what he's saying is that uh m uh has such a good tendencies good some scatters and everything he's been born into a family where there's so many problems and things but still that the some scottish will remain i say this because tako uses the same illustration another time with rachael that talking about his father's father a very worldly man but raquel was of course the ideal spiritual soul the companion of srama krishna so he uses that same illustration though rocco was born in the family of a wealthy person and everything still uh he'll there's some scottish that he had will grow into the same some scottish the the potential for the uh for the pea it won't grow into something else it'll go into a p so maybe he's trying to encourage m a little bit that way m but still there are the eight bonds master they are not eight bonds but eight feathers but what if they are these fetters fall off in a moment by the grace of god do you know what it is like suppose a room has been kept dark a thousand years the moment a man brings a light into it the darkness vanishes not little by little now this is also interesting because takur talks about different types of mukti how we get liberation or enlightenment and he says some is hot some just like that but others through sadhana that through the through long spiritual practice so how do we understand this my my way of understanding is that the the path may be a very long path but when we finally get there then it's instantaneous something like that so uh if we if we take this illustration of the dark room we may have to struggle for a long time follow a long path to get to the room we may have to even break the lock to get in and we have to search all around to find the light switch but as soon as we find it click it then flooded flooded with that experience so both are true they can be a gradual thing or some people they'll just stumble across it so he said gives the example that somebody's digging for well a long time to get the water another person starts and he happens to to break into a a little spring that's there and in the water it shoots up instantly so we have different karma different grace is a common factor in everything because this this ego has to die first then who was there to complete the job so this is why tucker talks about the the magnetic mountain we we have to walk close enough to it to get within the pull of that mountain but as we're closer and closer and closer the center of our eye gets less and less and less by the time that eye completely vanishes we're close enough for the for the magnet to pull us the rest of the way so both and we need both of those things have you seen the magician's feet he takes a string with many knots and ties one end to something keeping the other in his hand then he shakes the string once or twice and immediately all the knots come undone but another man cannot untie the knot however he may try all the lots natural ignorance ignorance come undone in the twinkling of an eye through the guru's grace yeah this is the knot of the heart that that means all of the confusion that we have and all of the bondage that we have all of the things that uh prevent us from seeing this is the highest type of truth that disappears when we have that realization when the light is flipped on well can you tell me why keisha sin has changed so much lately he used to come here very often now my guess is that keisha that tucker probably didn't know how serious keshav's health was at this time i don't think that queso really changed or lost his devotion to taco i think it became greater towards the very end i once taken found out then he was very concerned and he would ask everybody how is keshov how was keisha up and everything who will i talk to if keshav is there when i go to kolkata all of that i read another interesting thing and this is he said taqwa never prayed for anything but for the highest huh but but he prayed for kesha and and he told the divine mother that i promise you i'll give you this genie yeah it's green coconut and sugar if you save queso don't know why this is does the show is tremendous love for queso potassium he says yes but also queso was played a tremendously important role in his lila that how many young men he brought to takur so he recognized that also he had that role to play in addition to the fact that he just you know had this deep affection for him he meaning kesha learned here had the bow low before a holy man one day i told him that one should not salute a holy man as he had been doing yeah actually awkward would do it himself people would come and just go like this in front of him something like that he would bow down then gradually they learned this is how you make show your respect to a holy person but he says rightly all the checks must be approved here only then will they be cashed in the bank and listen to these words breathlessly he began to realize that sachidanda in the form of the guru passes the check we really can they they they use this this uh this term what is it uh uh what is it for it's gold in order to test gold yeah that taco is like that this is something that uh i don't know how it works that uh you you touch it to this and you find out if it's fake or if it's real so so i did a taco that's the one that this is how we know if if someone appreciates him if someone is really living up to his teachings has the real love for him that there's some authenticity something genuine about it master do not reason this is this is a statement that comes over and over and over again now we said what is he telling him he told swamiji narendra he said you reason everything out don't accept anything i say without thinking it through and if it's illogical then don't accept it this would be charter has two different different meanings we could say if it means that uh always reason what is real and what is transitory what has substance what doesn't have substance uh always think of of death always remember this this world is fleeting always remember that what the real goal of life is and all of that this is this is sadvichar this is a good type of you know what is and what is all of that if if this reasoning is is always trying to figure out how exactly why the world is the way that it is why god allows this to happen and not to happen and unfair things and everything there are no answers to these questions so these are the things that he's trying to tell him don't be too cerebral about everything to feel things you go deep go deeper go beneath this mind level that the mind was restricted it's limited in its ability to understand some of these deeper things we have to try to have some experience so do not reason who can never know god these are very important things because we ask all of these questions constantly constantly we're asking these questions that uh is was this universe created in time was it did it always exist how did god create it why did he create it this way why are there bad people all of these questions impossible to know these things so do not reason who can never know god i've heard it from nangta once for all that this whole universe is only a fragment in brahman hazrat is given to too much calculation he says this much of god has become the universe and this much is the balance my headaches and his calculations i know that i know nothing tucker speaking i know that i know nothing sometimes i think of god as good and sometimes it's bad what can i know of him now we we have to remember that the bengali has no he and she in it if uh it'll sound odd but i think it's more appropriate to say what can i know of her because i think when talker is speaking like this he has in mind this this muhammad he has in mind mother khalid his mother aspect of god which also always is accompanied by the by this idea that it's a chintya that is beyond our ability to comprehend this mysterious nature this is part of that whole concept of the divine mother is availing our ability to understand things and everything em it is true sir can anyone ever know god each thinks with his little bit of intelligence that he has understood all of god as you say an ant went to a sugar hill and finding that one grain of sugar filled its stomach thought that the next time it would take the entire hill into its hole master who can never know god i don't even try i only call on him or on her here it is i only call on him as mother it sounds odd to us i mean i only call on god as mother let mother do whatever she likes i shall know her if it is her will now he's using her but i shall be happy to remain ignorant if she wills otherwise i like that kamala khan to song though i've pondered my whole all throughout my life i don't even i can't even say is it is uh as god purusha park or the void now it seems to be one now seems to be the other though i've been thinking about these the whole thing is my mind is this i've become like a mad person trying to think of all these things this isn't an ordinary ignorant person these are highly ideal souls who can never know god i don't even try i only call on him on her his mother let mother do whatever she likes i shall know her if it is her will but i shall be happy to remain ignorant if she wills otherwise my nature is that of a kitten it only cries mew mew the rest it leaves to its mother these the two examples that takora used most often i would say for this kitten example and the other one will be no no no that's that's tied in with this the other one will be the maidservant in the rich man's house i think these are probably his two favorites that one is always that idea that we know nothing really belongs to us our home is in the village but this one is always perfect surrender perfect contentment and being happy wherever we're placed fully relying on god as the kitten does to the to the mother cat my nature is that of a kitten yeah he he contrasts it to the nature of of the baby monkey if you ever go to the zoo it's fascinating to see how the baby monkeys they'll cling they'll really grab and hold on some underneath some of the back everything the monkey's swinging around they're holding on for dear life but the kitten can't even do that the little baby kitten is beautiful and the mother comes and takes it by the by the neck and carries it and places it someplace and the kitten says well wherever the other places and it's okay if we can live like that we'll always be happy and we'll never be frustrated and we'll never have regrets and we'll never think oh what if i if i had done this and if i hadn't done that and uh we'll just we'll be we'll have contentment so santosh these go together if we can practice surrender we'll get contentment very simple formula even the child of the maidservant knows that he has a mother oh sorry i skipped some things okay the mother cat puts the kitten sometimes in the kitchen and sometimes on the master's bed other times he says and also in the ashes and the fireplace the young child wants only his mother he doesn't know how wealthy his mother is and he doesn't even want to know he knows only i have a mother why should i worry marcin it's a beautiful song the mother is there and i'm there so what is there to worry about nothing to worry about why should i worry even the child of the maidservant knows that he has a mother if he quarrels with the son of the master he says i shall tell my mother i have a mother my attitude too is that of a child suddenly srama krishna caught m's attention and said touching his own chest well there must be something here isn't that so it may sound to people who don't know better they're talk words a little egotistical that he wants to say oh yes how great you are and everything but when takur says there's something in here it means that his eye is not there it's it's it's the the height of of non-ego that mother alone is dwelling within and he wants i am to understand that for his for m's welfare and m's welfare is our welfare because he's the one who gave us everything and looked wonderingly at the master he said to himself does the mother herself dwell in the master's heart is it the divine mother who has assumed this human body for the welfare of humanity sri ramakrishna was praying to the divine mother o mother o embodiment of om mother how many things people say about thee but i don't understand any of them i don't know anything mother i have taken refuge at thy feet i have sought protection to thee o mother i pray only that i may have pure love for thy lotus feet love that seeks no return and mother do not delude me with thy world bewitching maya i seek thy protection i have taken refuge in the aqua never says this is how you should pray to god he does it it's just so hard to picture how someone can do it so heartlessly so guidelessly and simply that uh unjust in front of himself start talking to god like that but it's for our sake it's for our sake when he talks about he just begins to pray or sometimes he'll say this is how i prayed but he's teaching us how to pray he won't say to him pray this way but he knows that this and will get this message the evening worship in the temples was over srirama krishna was again seated in his room with em em had been visiting the master for the past two years and had received his grace and blessings did m ever receive any type of initiation from krishna he probably one of the things that he that he kept from us he must have gotten something yeah he must have whether it was written on the tongue we don't know we don't have any of these maybe it's written in some of the other books i don't know do you know anything like one place yeah he'll say even here now he'll say and now i know you belong to the divine mother no he tells him things like that but we we read of course with some of the others some very specific things he asked him to stick out your tongue and he wrote something on it that was the type of initiation i don't know i haven't read all of that srimadursan that if if any of it is in there if he says anything like that or not but anyhow we assume we assume that there is something even if nothing he was accepted by taquer as his very own yeah but did he initiate any householders back then yes of course yeah yeah yeah yeah huh well around many yeah and we we read a little earlier i forget who it was that he wrote something on his tongue yeah and probably did it then because he knew he wouldn't live long also of course tucker also wasn't going to live much longer so am had been visiting the master for the past two years and had received his grace and blessings he had been told that god was both with form and without form that he assumed forms for the sake of his devotees to the worshipper of the formless god the master said hold to your conviction but remember that all is possible with god he has formed and again he is formless he can be many more things master to him you have accepted an ideal that of god without form isn't that so um yes sir but i also believe what you say that all is possible with god it is quite possible for god to have forms master good remember further that as consciousness he pervades the entire universe of the living and non-living m i think of him as the consciousness in conscious beings master stick to that ideal now there's no need of tearing down and changing one's attitude you will gradually come to realize that the consciousness in conscious beings is the consciousness of god he alone is consciousness okay let us stop here but just just as a preview to the end of this the end of the day this is where uh surah christian says to him that is very good don't reason anymore you were a follower of shakti okay so we're stopping here this is page 300. [Music] of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace be unto him thank two
