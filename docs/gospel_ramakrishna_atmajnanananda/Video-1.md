[Introduction to the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YoVClNMZI4A)

good evening everyone it's actually 11 o'clock in the morning so I'll be a little confused this is the first time I've done this and I'm really not accustomed to speaking to a camera I have a completely empty room here except for Kumar who's here to give me some support and before I start let me first say that I hope everyone is well and everyone is safe and everyone is taking you all possible precautions and of course we pray to talk where ma Swamiji is it all of this will be over soon and everything can go back to normal I'm also not accustomed to not knowing who I'm talking to because I like to have feedback and interaction and discussion so all of this is new to me as it is to all of you I'm going to assume that there will be some people who are watching who do not come to our regular a gospel class and I thought that rather than just continue because what we normally do is is we go in order page after page rather than do that I would give a general introduction to the the gospel of ramakrishna to the compiler Mahindra coupe dose 3 ma m and they give a little background so that we really get an appreciation for what I consider to be the most important scripture and I think we can call it Scripture of our tradition because we get absolutely everything when we read the gospel as shown on Krishna anything that we want to get from the Upanishads from Gita from Shankar Acharya from any of the other texts that we read we'll find all of that in the gospel of Shri Krishna now I will start with chanting a verse which is traditionally chanted before any recitation of the Willis Ramakrishna this is from something called a gopi Geeta it's found in the Bhagavata Purana and it was M himself who chose this verse to be recited in the beginning it's written there in the very beginning of the gospel and also the title of the gospel in Bengali cotton Bharata is taken from this particular verse and I will utilize this verse to explain the relationship between M the compiler of the gospel and the gospel itself and she Ramakrishna and how the kind of history of how the whole thing came about so the verse is tava khatam bottom doctor given a copy very edit uncle misha Appa saravana Mangalam shreya madam this means your words are like nectar cotton burrito bringing life the squirts all stopped achievement of Cabiria editin praised by poets and the wise ones called me sharpen they remove all sin saravana Mangalam they were specious to hear srimad the exalted beautiful art Adam are the vast and deep booby guarantee every doubt you know those who will spread these words throughout the world or the most generous wonderful helpful people that we can imagine this is a very beautiful verse that was meant to be the words of the gopis talking about Shri Krishna himself and we understand from this that I am looked upon Sri Ramakrishna the same way the gopis looked upon Krishna himself and I we can also look upon this gospel of ramakrishna as being something as sacred as the Bhagavata Purana because it's included in the bhagavata the tradition among many raishin of us is that the Harvard apirana is equally sacred as the Vedas sometimes they'll say Pancham Aveda and from our point of view of this the gospel of Ramakrishna is equally sacred as the power button or all of the Vedas so this was a very very appropriate verse we'll find out how appropriate when we go through all of the different elements of this verse especially this dr. jay burnham bringing life to squirt souls I also wanted to emphasize one special thing we generally talk about the direct disciples and how wonderful they were and and it's true there's no question about that they were very rare souls but we don't often appreciate how great the householder disciples were and among all of the household all the disciples of Ramakrishna I would say that M was the greatest in fact if we look at all of the disciples of ramakrishna including the monastic disciples then probably after Swamiji himself and was the most important in spreading the teachings and and the life and the inspiration of ramakrishna through this this one book there's a gospel of ramakrishna in fact the talk where himself used to say that for four monks if they lead a good holy life and they do spiritual disciplines and everything there's nothing very wonderful about it they're supposed to do that if they do don't do that then everyone can say what type of people are they well it's a householder in the midst of all the heavy duties if they can call on God then he said this is something really wonderful so we look at the life of M and we see that he led an extraordinary life and the relationship we had with Ramakrishna is something really wonderful it's really a love story the the way that you ramakrishna really saved his life and really gave him a whole second life and the reverence that m had for everything that sherman christmas said not just the way he recorded everything but what it meant to him personally is something really really fantastic when we read the gospel of ceramic krishna we see that not only do we have the words of stroma krishna which in itself to something amazing but the the descriptive portions are also wonderful because this reading of the gospel that ramakrishna is a type of meditation it's not simply meant for gaining some type of understanding of the teachings it places us i in front of Ramakrishna in the very room with him we know who's sitting with him we know the phase of the moon we know the direction that the Ganges is flowing we know what the the phase of the we know everything and it's really something that allows us to feel that we're present at that time and the more we read the Gospels ramakrishna the more the mind on dwells there we find ourselves living there so the descriptive portions are also very beautiful and the m was a great writer he was tremendous poet when we read the descriptive portions highly sanskritic and we see them contrasted to the very simple village language of ramakrishna that contrast is so beautiful and wonderful that really there's no end to the praise that M God deservedly for the way he composed this and let me add one little thing that the English translation of the gospel of ramakrishna is excellent we we really get a wonderful feel for everything we don't miss anything with regard to the teachings but there a certain sweetness that comes from reading the original Bengali and this is my own little little bias that anyone who really really wants to feel that closeness with Ramakrishna trying to learn a little bit of a it's possible and tried to read it in the original I spent many years trying to learn Bengali only to read this gospel of ramakrishna and really is a tremendous joy to do it the English translation interestingly enough the gospel of ramakrishna tries the gospel to the Bible also we we saw how this verse Gautama little ties it to the bhagavata but it also with the aims way of saying that this is also on equal footing of the of the Bible so he's in his own little way saying that Muhammad Krishna is is that same soul who was born as Krishna and Rama and Jesus and also because this the title the gospel Rama Krishnan in English isn't simply the title that Swami Nikhil Ananda gave he was the translator but this is something that M I had is the original title and I'll get to how this was first published by M which was actually in English but let's start with top the given oh this means that people in the world are being scorched by all sorts of difficulties and problems in the m's life they were mostly family problems and even a means really restoring the soul bringing back that life to people who were being scorched in the world and this is something that had very very personal relevance in the life of M so I want to go through a little bit of the life story i M Mahindra gusto was born on July 14th 1854 he was very voted to his parents especially his mother the mother was very impious we find this in many of the families that the religion gets best to the mother more than the father but she passed away in 1880 and it was a great shock to Mahindra he was 26 years old at the time 1880 so remember this is just 2 years before his first visit to Ramakrishna it's a finished work now around the same time and became attached to the Brahmo Samaj this is a very important element in the life of sri ramakrishna because so many of the disciples came through the promised allonge the Brahmo Samaj was an organization that was founded much early we can take it all the way back to Rome Ram Mohan Roy and Devendra not Tagore but during his time it was a case of shunderson was the leader of the Brahmo Samaj he was a brilliant speaker ceramic Chris had great respect for him very pious person well known at travel to England he met the Queen Queen Victoria and the English educated young men mostly of Calcutta fell in love with him it was extremely popular so they flock to him his organization was more of a reformist organisation and they were very much against what they call the image worship idol idolatry and much care for the idea of guru and avatar and everything so there was a distinctive Unitarian type of flavor almost Christian type of flavor to the organization so M he became a member of the Brahmo Samaj at the same time during his school days it was a brilliant student and was well versed and and literature and philosophy both eastern and western are the English language things everything he married a cousin of gay shop so he was also connected with the case of through marriage the kanji Devi and he became a teacher and headmaster at his own school for some time because his mother passed away he was very unhappy at home the other members of the family were not interested in religious things he was very sensitive in nature as a school teacher he didn't earn much money so he was always being pressed to make some more money by this time he already had four children three sons and one daughter and reached the point where he felt that he simply couldn't live any more at home the way things were within that situation so decided that he would have a secret plan where he and his wife would leave at night and they would go and live in some other place so she had a sister who lived in barani Gor he left earlier and and she was secretly to meet him later they hired a horse carriage and they got as far as sham Bazar and there was some mishap the the carriage fell under the wheels broke and they had to get down it was already late at night and they had nowhere to go so M had an acquaintance who lived not far from there so he went there and showing up in the late night he got a very bad reception and this just made us Moody even worse somehow he stayed with somebody somewhere and they went and got a different carriage eventually he got to his wife's sister's house this was the house of Isan Kobe Raj who happened to be also one of Shri Krishna's and doctors where Nick wanted Devi was were not sure she was at a friend's house but in any case Emma got there he was exhausted he was very a drowned Harden and later he admitted that he really Kentucky contemplated suicide he was in such a state of mind that he was ready to take his own life fortunately he didn't that night the next day his nephew she knew she too could see that his uncle was very unhappy and he thought let me try to cheer him up he said uncle there are some beautiful places nearby there's some gardens some nice temples there's even a beautiful temple garden with the Potter Muhammad SAW there would you like to go so I am said yes that this was exactly what he needed they visited all of these different places and then at the very end and we can guess that this was probably late February or early March in 1882 they went to the temple garden duction eshwara and the Paramount of course was Sri Ramakrishna and this would be the very first entry we get in the gospel of stroma Krishna after this and was very very particular to note the date of everything and the time of everything and all the other details but because of its frame of mind and probably because he had no idea would be so significant in his life we don't know the exact date that he was there for that very first visit but the impression that this left on m's mine was indelible in fact we really don't have words because it was life-changing for him and and really saving his life and the change that took place when I'm walked into that room that lasted a whole lifetime we almost have to assume that this was no chance meeting that later when we look back we see that he was one of the main Lila sahaja is one of the main companions in this divine play of Shri Krishna anyhow they got to the temple they visited all of the rose gardens and and was very charmed it was it was still relatively new temple and a very beautiful place once they got in they went straight to ceramic Krishna's room and they looked in from the veranda the door would have been open so they looked in and they saw Strummer Krishna generally he would sit on the small cot there are two cups in his room he would sleep in the big one he would sit in the small card and he was speaking to a roomful of devotees and it was dusk this means that as soon as he walked in the room he would hear all of the conch shells blowing and the gongs going the Bell is ringing Oddity going on at all all of the temples so we can imagine this there's tremendous mood and atmosphere so we have in Em's on words this is describing his first visit and remember that M never refers to himself in the first person always the third person M as if he's writing about somebody else he didn't want to intrude he didn't want to place himself in the forefront of anything so he write today referring to him and his nephew they arrived at the main gate and went straight to Strummer krishna's room and there they found him seated on a wooden couch facing the east with a smile on his face he was talking of God the room was full of people all seated on the floor drinking in his words in deep silence and stood there speechless and looked on It was as if he were standing where all the holy places met and as if sukadeva himself were speaking the Word of God or as if Sri Chaitanya were singing the names and glories of the Lord in foody so this was Emma's first visit by this oh we we don't hear about him after that we don't know if he ever was inclined or went to see sri ramakrishna after that but he fulfilled his role so this is the whole idea of Leela everybody has a little part to play so I immediately felt that he'd reach some divine space but ramakrishna also when he saw him he recognized him as someone with tremendous spiritual potential and someone who belonged to him Ramakrishna had that power whenever anybody came he could tell immediately if they belonged he would say belong to this place if they were his very own so he saw these clear science and spirituality in em so for em this was really the veining main turning point of his life and really salvation for him other than this we don't know if he would have committed suicide actually or not but he himself always felt that taqwa not only gave him a spiritual eyes would be give him his life itself now this this difficulty that M had went throughout his life his difficulty with adjusting with it with it his brothers and his father and family at home we read in the gospel that he moved back with his father in March 11th to 1882 this is around the fifth visit because forever Krishna kept telling him it'll be more convenient to go back you won't have to worry about it finding a new place and paying ran and and all of those things you'll be able to pursue your spiritual life and good to have a good relationship with your father so we encouraged them very much so M went back it seems that he moved out later because we also find in April 1884 from Christian again telling him please go back and live with the family can can you go back and make amends with your father and everything so he did it again later he purchased a school called the Morton Institute chin and very often he lived there and he had a solitary room on the roof of the building he loved solitude he was never happy in family life he always wanted to be a sannyasi this was really the the great sadness of his life that he couldn't pursue that life of pure renunciation that he always wanted to see ramakrishna wanted him to remain in the world and to be a living example of a Greeson Yossi's that someone who really can have the spirit of a sannyasi but live in the context of the family life and M had such a tremendous desire to live a life of perfect pronunciation that sometimes he would sleep outside jest with the homeless people of Calcutta there was an open verandah at Calcutta University Senate Hall and he would just stretch out his blanket and sleep there with all of the other with the Baker's and the homeless and everything just to feel that he himself had no possessions and to feel that he was living a life of perfect renunciation we have a second example of how M was scorched in the world this is doctor given idea in 1884 one of the M sons died and with tremendous blow to M but even more so to his wife and we read that she practically became mad and again she Ramakrishna a tremendous compassion and did everything he could for her and really turned her over to holy mother and she became very close companion of Holy Mother and this really saved her also so in a sense her life was was saved dr. G venom bites from a Krishna also so there many instances when we reading the Gospels Rama Krishna and he had a habit of referring to himself sometimes with other nicknames of money money Mohan especially when there were times when they were in reference to the son who would die and his wife and everything so we'll see many times we'll talk about this is money Mohan or using another name about how he cried that morning looking at one of the books of the Sun or how his wife was practically mad and I will be many references there also so top to G even I'm Kobe BDD Tom praised by poets of course the gospel of Shri Krishna was praised by everyone but the words of Shri Ramakrishna covey doesn't simply mean a poet any wise person we see how all of the great pundits of the day they would come to Shri Krishna and sit at his feet like earthworms they would sit and for hours ask him questions and soak in that spirituality so he was recognized by some of the greatest scholars and pundits of his day so the coffee Beauty tongue column is sharpen his words had the power to purify us to cleanse us because they go straight to the heart and they have this power to transform us and change us sherilyn among golem so really listening to the to the words when we read this gospel as Ramakrishna it's a spiritual practice it's not like reading other books should have a mongol um there's something auspicious about it and like taking the name of God doing japa do our meditation same thing that we really should feel that this is one of the most important spiritual practices that we have and just hearing hearing the words of shri ramakrishna directly is is such a tremendous blessing can we imagine someone considered to be a divine incarnation and Avatara there were so many in the past these great souls with christ krishna rama that we guess of what their exact words were we have the exact words what a tremendous blessings sort of an among them it is for us to actually hear these now em it was even more so because the words of sri ramakrishna to him were everything in his life he not only collected all of the words which we have in the gospels ramakrishna but he kept separately all of the things that she Ramakrishna said to him directly he called his audition all of the things that were instructions then there were certain instructions that he called mahalia's that were the most important of all these instructions even a very simple thing the very wonderful thing to think about one of the early visits M went to some Krishna and said sir will there be any more singing tonight and he said no no more but I'm going to ball around BOCES house tonight you come and ugly more singing there do you know him he said no I don't know him but I'm sure that I can I can find out who he is are they asking that area so he said ok then M had second thoughts and he went back and he said perhaps it's better I don't go he may be some big gentleman to show up uninvited might not seem like the right thing to do so Sri Ramakrishna said no you go there just mention my name on mine Omkara now M took this is meaning when he said that that repeat my name take my name he took that almost as receiving mantra from him and also when he left the first time see Ramakrishna said operatio everybody says this come again to him this was a direct command that meant that you have to come again to see me you're my very own so these words are ceramic Krishna had a meaning to M significance to him that we can hardly imagine whenever anybody went to him he would only talk about Ramakrishna there were times when Ramakrishna would tell some of these young disciples that it's not always easy for you for you to come here your parents don't like it you'll go visit em and you talk to him and sometimes they would say but he's a householder what can you tell us and sure our virtue Ramakrishna used to say that he'll only repeat what he's heard here so you only get those words from him and then himself used to say I am an insignificant person but I live by the side of an ocean and keep with me a few pictures of seawater when a visitor comes I entertain him with that what else can I speak but his words so these words for EM were also mud we don't have any good English trends translation for this is something with the splendor magnificent and art of them they had a depth to them we we don't realize how some of the most difficult pedantic theories this is part even Vlado have a tale about this reflection Tyrael how simply Ramakrishna explains he's by the Sun being reflected in containers of water how deep he fools are sometimes with this simple language the depth of his intelligence and understanding how he was able to reconcile and harmonize all the different schools of Vedanta and and different religions is something really amazing this autumn this vastness of his mind is something really wonderful and then movie grantee a Buddha dodging are those who will spread these teachings spread the words of Ramakrishna in this case are really the most generous people in the world now this is something that am fully believed but in the very beginning he was very reticent about sharing any of this he was very hesitant to let others know even that he was writing something we read towards the end of the gospel Goethe skosh went to em and said I hear that you're writing something about you're on the Krishna will you show it to me and then said no I'm doing it just for myself I won't show it to anybody perhaps after I die you'll get to see it but we find out later that of course then change his mind and that and was born for that job this this whole idea of Leela is very fascinating that everybody has their role to play and this was really my Eames role he was the one who was born to record this and Sri Ramakrishna who was the least calculating person in the world and the last person to think about his legacy or spreading it message or anything intuitively know that this was meant for M and we see so many times they'll have a conversation and then she Ramakrishna will say did you understand and we'll say yes and then he'll say repeated back to me and and we'll do it sometimes he'll even make a slight correction here and there and M had a fantastic memory even from his childhood he could remember anything she had a photographic memory that's how we could recreate the situation in the room and everything so there are different times when we see others who started to do the same thing tada Swami shivananda Kali Swami of hidden under that Sri Ramakrishna saw that they were listening very carefully or jotting something down he said what are you doing and they said oh we thought we would maybe take some notes or so he said no this is not for you that meant a the M was already chalked out to do that job sometimes we find that if there was a very interesting conversation going on the room shoroma Krishna would which and M wasn't there would send somebody out and say well tell him to come there's an interesting thing going on here no and Swami Sivananda said we didn't understand at the time why he did that well he wanted him to be present during all of these conversations he said now we understand so as I said and we only find one reference in the Gospel to the writing of this gospel and this is April 23rd 1886 the very last entry in the gospel during ceramic Christmas lifetime and it reads to us almost like a kind of joke kid he said to him I understand you're writing something about the master is it true and who told you that it is I heard about it will you give it to me no I won't part with it unless I feel it is right to do so I'm writing it for myself not for others you tease what do you mean yeah you may get it when I die now how actually did the Gospel as Ramakrishna come about actually is very fascinating it was to M he would go back after meeting with Ramakrishna and he always kept a diary but it was very cryptic no one else would have understood it even if he had given it to get eesh he disclosed he probably wouldn't have understood what was what was written in it and explained exactly if this process he said I would carry the nectar like words kilometer of top gorg in my memory and would record them briefly in the diary on returning home the book written out from these notes appeared much later on every scene I had meditated a thousand times therefore I could create relive those moments by top words grace when I did not feel satisfied with my descriptions I would plunge myself into meditation on taqwa then the correct image would rise before my mind's eye and abrade real living form there's a very nice book it was called Bengali OTTI T and then the English translation is the story of an epic written by swami sharanam G about Swami the originally and he and many others were students of M so this is from that from that book one of the students was named Coggan Corrigan later because the games for me Ramon and you will see all of these became monks of the order he was a close friend of the Kali Krishna so I may be redundant and several other boys what became Bolton and et should run an EEG at modality precaution until all of them were disciples of either Swamiji or Holy Mother this was why Dan got this terrible reputation of being a kidnapper the parents were always afraid that this was even earlier during Shri Krishna's time that the kid would be taking this Ramakrishna and he would kidnap them that meant that they would want to become monks and leave home and he'll Cogan noticed that his English teacher Mahendra Gupta this was at the time of lunch when everyone else was eating he would slip away so he followed him one day and he saw that he went up to the roof of the building and he would sit there very quietly and he would take out a small notebook he would read a little bit from that notebook which now we know is the is the diary and then go into deep meditation and the students at that time had no idea what he was doing but this is how we did it wouldn't go into deep meditation he would recall the scenes and then he would write down the words several of these these boys know about Ramakrishna and many of them went to a Tom doctors house Rahm was one of the house ordered disciples of Ramakrishna and after the passing away his his garden house became kind of a strong he became a kind of a guru and he inspired many young men so and know about that he said very good you're going to see round the wonderful but if you really want to know what the Ramakrishna was like then you have to meet his monastic disciples so he sent them to another mutt to meet Swamiji and the others and of course this was it turning point in the lives of all of these young men because they all ended up joining the order after the passing away of Ramakrishna the very famous incident we all know about that Swamiji and some of the others went to art poor this was the village home of Baba Rama Rajyam apartment under this is was around the time of Christmas when they all took their vows of renunciation and took their names but one thing we don't always remember is that holy mother and aunt were both there at the same time when all of the young boys went and M bred out because he was everybody knew it and everyone wanted to know what is it what was he writing so he read out some of his writings from his diary notes of the conversations with Ramakrishna in front of holy mother and some of the others Swamiji at that time was observing silence he didn't say anything at the time but later he wrote to M thanks a thousand times master most of us are they they call them you will hit ram dish though we we know about his Ramakrishna this was the very kind of colloquial way but I'm Christo on the right point if you will ask you understand him yours Narendra yes my heart leaps in joy and it is a wonder that I do not go mad when I find anybody thoroughly launched into the midst of the doctrine which is to shower peace on earth Hereafter and the Holy Mother was was equally thrilled when she heard it and she later wrote to him of course she would dictate it someone else would write it Babaji bond my dear child whatever you would heard from him is nothing but the truth you need not feel any hesitation about it that made about publishing this at one time it would see who would place those words in your custody and it is he who is now bringing them to the light of day according to the needs of the time know it for certain that unless these were brought out mankind will not have its consciousness awakened all the words of his that you have with you every one of them is true one day when you read them out to me I felt as if it was he who was speaking so now it was encouraged now and felt that this was his duty and obligation so he started out of writing from his from his cryptic notes but he did it in English somehow there was still the feeling in those days for something to be really accepted and because it was under the British Raj and everything it should be in English and there was an english-speaking magazine of the order and those say it's called a Brahma God was the first one of the first publications of the order in Madras and in a October 15 - 1897 we find an entry quote leaves from the gospel of Shri Krishna so I am used this term gospel ramakrishna and everyone was thrilled with it but they all said to him I is wonderful but we really want to hear the words of Ramakrishna as he spoke them in the original Bengali so he began and began writing in 1898 what was later to be called Sri Sri Ramakrishna cotton rat oh the first name he gave was Lila Merida the nectar of the divine play perhaps he hadn't come up with the idea of cotton brando from the from the bog with a verse at that time but anyhow shortly after that was changed to cotton brat oh it was written and five different volumes the first four between the years 1900 and 1910 and the fifth much much later 1932 and really wasn't published until he passed away in fact the very last thing that M did before he died was to go through the proofs and after it went through the final proofs he felt his life's work was done and he passed away very shortly after that each one of these was chronological so that meant that he had to decide which events that would go into the first volume second volume third version we don't know why he decided this is an interesting study to try to figure out did he think that the first volume they were the most important things we know volume four is what he called Buechele katha the very secret things where I'm Krishna sometimes would say that okay you're all my very own people there are no strangers here I'll tell you something very secret so and waited till the fourth volume to put all of these there perhaps with some hesitation but then by that time he probably felt no everything should be made known we shouldn't hide anything anyhow when Tommy Nikhil Ananda did the translation he combined everything so now we have the whole thing in chronological order the main teachings of course well this is a big topic I won't go through everything except to say that if we see the conversation that took place on the second visit the M took to touch in Essaouira we'll find that each and every topic that forms the basis for the entire gospel is is covered there we can almost say that the rest of the gospel is an extrapolation there's a commentary on these simple questions that I'm asked and the answers that ramakrishna gave there were four main questions sir how may we fix our minds on God how are we to live in the world is it possible to see God and under what conditions does one see God and the answers to these give us or Raja Yoga karma-yoga jnana-yoga and bhakti-yoga now you'll forgive me I'll speak a little bit about my personal experience because there's a gospel of ramakrishna in my own small way really I think changed my life more than anything else and I've been reading it and studying it for now forty eight years and it's become a regular part of my spiritual practice and now we read in the morning and evening I always read it at night and in the beginning I would read it for hours on end I only had the the condensed version I would go through it so fast that of course I had to buy the big one and then I had to learn Bengali to be able to read it but I found this to be the most important thing in my spiritual life this was the best type of holy company that I could possibly have and I could relate to it so much because I also had that rare privilege of discovering Sri Ramakrishna's room and going there and even before I read the gospel just at the same time that M when I remember getting off the boat and hearing the conch shells and the bell ringing and everything and going into ceramic krishna's room and just the power of entering his room is something that is unforgettable and life-changing so i I can bear witness to the fact that there's magic in this book and that the more one reads it one gets purified and the more inspiration comes and the more the mind dwells there until we find that the mind is living induction you are with Ramakrishna of course there are many incidents in kashi 4 and Shamburger but mostly ramakrishna that period where he lived in the chinese world so i really feel that this book should be read as a meditation should be looked upon as a very sacred scripture the study of it is something there's not an academic study we do it as much for inspiration as we do for the beautiful subtle teachings that we get from it so I'm gonna stop here and what we normally do in this class is we just go through this is actually the second time we're going through it if we continue with this same type of format which it looks like we'll have to do for sometime we'll begin with chapter 12 this is what we're up to the festival is Bonnie Harkey and I'll see our Swami see is very good at all these things he knows some zoom technique something that when we do it next time perhaps we can do it with some interactive type of thing where I can get some feedback you can ask questions and everything but for now we'll stop here there's also a traditional closing Chad at the end of the reading of the gospel which I will do now shall we bow our heads before she Ramakrishna who is stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts and sympathy for his devotees who was an embodiment of the divine and the Supreme Lord and ever were worthy of our worship Oh Shanti Shanti Shanti peace peace
