[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (01/27/23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_S8X2pIm2YA)

foreign [Music] Souls they are praised by Poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls foreign Krishna we're on the chapter the master and his injured arm this is Page 386. and we're in the middle of it the uh date is Saturday February 2nd 1884. at five o'clock in the afternoon and Dr madhusudan arrived while he prepared the bandage for the Master's arm srirama Krishna left like a child and said you are the mother student of both this world and the next we have a little footnote also a name of Krishna smiling I only labor under the weight of my name Master smiley why is the name a trifling thing God is Not different from his name Satya bhama tried to balance Krishna with the gold and precious stones but could not do it then rukmini put a two sea leaf with the name of Krishna on the scales that balanced the Lord the doctor was ready to bandage the Master's arm a bed was spread on the floor and the master laughing laid down upon it he said in toning the word ah this is Rod's final stage but rinde says who knows what is yet to be now this is really remarkable to try and try to picture and picture this he is in terrible pain but it's a game to him like a child and he feels the pain but uh before this he raised his mind to a kind of a higher state and then he comes back down and he sees it all is kind of a play and now he's just kind of reenacting this play El Dorado feels when oh where's my Krishna I'm about to die all of his friends her friends are around and everything so it just kind of reenacting that the devotees were sitting around the master he sang you can imagine there's a very bad break of the arm they didn't have a cast they didn't have pain medication they wrapped it tightly a very painful type of thing and he's indifferent to all of it the gopis all were gathered about the shore of the lake this ramakrishna left and the deputies left with him after his arm was bandaged he said I haven't very much faith in your Calcutta Physicians when shambhu the shambhumalik became delirious and Dr sarvada he said oh it is nothing it is just grogginess from the medicine and a little while after shampoo breathed at his last had a lot of faith in doctors yeah far more than most of the others who came to him he used to say I look upon the doctors Narayan himself so he would follow very carefully what the doctor said and he would say call this doctor and that doctor so he he kind of he kind of liked having the doctors around him there's a curious thing because he was like a child he would get into that mood of a child a little attention and everything doctor's there and the devotees around there was a little play for him you could say it was evening and the worship in the temples was over a few minutes later other ride from Calcutta to see the masteron rakal and M were in the room now we've gone through all of these characters I'll just remind everybody about the other because uh I would say that adhar belonged to the Inner Circle I would say he was an antaranka of course we we have no way of knowing exactly whose Inner Circle who's Outer Circle or anything we we don't think of him quite as much because he died so young and he came to srama Krishna a little bit late he and M were practically the same age and and practically came at the same time he was probably I think 28 28 he was born in 55 1855 and emerald was also around 28 when he came so more or less the same when it was inborn 1855 yeah yeah and they both came maybe other came a year later something but even it says other came some time yeah they we don't know exactly when he came but anyhow he'd very quickly uh became so close to srirama Krishna would go there every night after work invited him to his house many times and taco initiated him he wrote something on his tongue and everything so he was very very dear this ramakrishna there's a play that goes on through the entire gospel about other trying to get a big position and talk we're telling him why do you try so hard and uh the other thing is that he used to have to go on Horseback to different places for Zia different types of work also Deputy magistrate and he did other things and taku warned him many times to be very careful about it he had a premonition or something and there's a other fell off the horse and and died from from falling off the horse there's that little that we just Taco went there towards the end it says oh and and he was the one who introduced bankim Chandra that took place in his house when bunky Chandra met the sirama Krishna introduced the two of them together yeah for his government work then uh uh let's see sure yeah he had he had to go on Horseback and Sharma Krishna many times warned him about this but at the age of 30 suddenly uh he fell off the back of the horse and because of that died at that time also sarama Krishna went to see him and and touched him with his eyes filled with tears that's all it says about that so he was a very very dear this ramakrishna he wrote some books of poetry and other things also in the beginning he was a atheist at the age of 28 he saw thrama Krishna for the first time Kaku Road and the Mantra on his tongue and stroked his chest and head in the state of ecstasy so he was really blessed by shramakrishna and talk about how many times he went to his house it said Taco looked upon the other as Narayan practically every day after very hard work at the end of the day he would go to dakshineshwar to make pranam this ramakrishna so he was very dear very wonderful devotee we we don't know that much as I say because he passed away so young and then mahimataran is also there he's also an interesting character he he fancied himself as an intellectual and a philosopher and a vidantist and everything and Tucker liked him and and kind of humored him a little bit and would ask him to recite things and everything so that's also part of this Leela this is how are you master affectionately look here how my arm hurts smiling you don't have to ask how I am but they're sad on the floor with the devotees the master said to him please stroke here gently father said on the end of the couch and gently stroked ramakrishna's feet is another indication of the love that taqwa had for him letting him render that type of service is really was really a great blessing the master conversed with of course a little older than the others I don't remember how old and you would remember master it will be very good if you can practice unselfish love for God a man who has such love says O Lord I do not seek salvation Fame wealth or cure of disease none of these do I seek let's see when Surah Krishna starts talking about spiritual things completely forgets his own health is pain everything many of the people who come to a rich man with various desires but if someone comes to him simply out of love not wanting any favor then the rich man feels attracted to him butlada had this unselfish love this pure love for god without any worldly end sat silent the master turned to him master now let me tell you something that will agree with your mood see as I say he fancied himself an adoiten or whether he really put it into practice or not but uh he's the one who had the library full of books and uh nothing went one day and and told from you yeah he had full of books but not a single one of the books has been they used to have to cut the pages in order to read the books that meant it was for show so that was a little bit typical of his character but anyhow he liked to think of it he memorized some Centric verses and things he had some some knowledge but and you know Taco is having a little fun with him now let me tell you something that will agree with your mood according to the vedanta and I've mentioned many times in Tuck was mine went on to men Eduardo that is always when he says according to vedanta he means according to Ghana yoga and according to the non-dualism we can make the equally strong case that ramanages their their writings and commentaries are all based on upanishads and Gita and brahmasutras and everything but shankaracharya his place in history of spiritual thought of India was so strong that vedanta came to me and Dwight went out in the minds of many people so according to the vedanta one has to know the real nature of one's own self but such knowledge is impossible without the renunciation of ego the ego is like a stick that seems to divide the water in two now srama Krishna is saying according to vedanta and I'm telling you something that you like but taku also likes this he gives this example over and over and over again so we know this is not something that he's only telling is mahima and he told there's a very standard illustrator and very very helpful a very helpful illustration the ego is like a stick that seems to divide the water in two it makes you feel that you are one and I am another when the ego disappears in samati then we know the Brahman to be one's own inner Consciousness now two reasons why this is important one is that this ego appears to separate the stick appears to separate two sides of the water without really separating it it's on the surface it's a superficial thing and the second thing is Taco will very often say uh this ego doesn't go is as if if you eliminate it then there's only this one body of water but they'll often after that follow-up but this is the ego keeps coming back it's not such a simple thing to to get rid of this ego and uh therefore utilize it so even for the path of devotion he utilizes this illustration that if I'm like that stick if that stick on the surface gives the appearance of two different sides then I'm in one side then I establish a relationship with the other here he says it makes one feel that you were one and I am another but he also says it makes one feel that uh I am one thing and God is another thing because this whole ocean of sachidananda this will also be other people and also be the whole ocean is the is God so because of the Stick of ego we feel separation because of that we establish a relationship if we follow path of bhakti yoga we try to eliminate it through reasoning if we follow the path of gyani yoga but says Gita says almost everybody says that's the more difficult thing to do because the natural tendency of the mind is for it to fall back into that Center of ego kindness ego consciousness one must renounce the eye that makes one feel I am mahima chakravarti I am a learned man and so on now when taqwa says renounce the eye that makes one feel taqwa distinguishes between different types of ego you write the ego one right beagle the ego of devotion the ego of knowledge all different things because ego simply means how we look upon ourselves so this is another way of saying to we have to renounce at least that very thick Thomas ego that filled with pride and arrogance and and desires and longing for power and enjoyment every that we have to all renounce uh we can hold on to that ego that that looks upon itself as a child of God servant of God but here he's specifically saying that ego that makes us feel I'm a learned it person and so on but the ego of knowledge does not injure one so Taco generally talked about two different types of egos ego of knowledge the ego of devotion the ego of knowledge if I say soham I am he that I is there also that the ego sent of the ego is there but it's identified with with the infinite absolute reality if I say dasoham I am a servant then uh these are I is identified with my personality a little bit with this with the my individuality but in that relationship that Master servant type of relationship and he he says even after God realization the state of vignana that uh one again uh lives with the help of that ego either devotional ego or the ego of knowledge and he always mentioned sacracharya this this is the ego of of knowledge secretary will be that standard for him the ego of devotion can be so many different ideas caitanya Deva and others but the ego of knowledge is not injure one shankaracharya retained the ego of knowledge in order to teach mankind so this what we call this ripe ego uh it's something that that we adopt and we utilize and cultivate and try to identify with to help us in our spiritual life to reach the the ultimate goal and after that it's something that we we utilize again to keep the mind on a lower level so we can live in the world so that we also utilize the right concept of the ripe ego even though we don't have a ripe ego so it means that really deep down my sense of identification is with his body and if you really press me with how good I am and smart I am and and tell us you have all these different if you really press but I'm trying to fight that and I'm trying to tell myself think of yourself as a child of God don't think of yourself as an individual who's either better or worse than everybody else so for us it's an effort this is talk what makes that distinction that we have one attitude at the time of sadhana and it becomes real after God realization we realize the truth of it so that ripe ego becomes a permanent permanently transformed the ego after God realization for us it's an attempt and we we take the help of that type of ego this is what he means by this that the help of that in order to progress in in spiritual life so he says Shankar to try to retained the ego of knowledge that'll be the vigyana state after realization in order to do what he did how active he was in the world starting the different monastic traditions and and the temple worship and writing of the commentaries and and poetry and everything one cannot obtain the knowledge of Brahman and last one is extremely cautious about women now uh I you know I always avoid this stuff whenever we we get to the comedy content I was told once by Swami's final energy that whenever reading the gospel or anything else and uh in company of devotees I don't say woman in Gold say lost in Gold so I always do that there's a few places where it's really hard to avoid so I thought even though I don't like to do it I would address the issue a little bit uh this what what talk were meant by comedy kanchan uh first of all the word common e uh I shouldn't say first of all let me say that uh we all feel that it's very unfair to women devotees when they read this always to me it hurts me to think that they will take it in the wrong way and I always wonder how many read the gospels for the first time and think what is he talking about women and then don't read it again give it up it's a very very unfortunate thing uh I would have preferred that the translation had been a little bit different but this is literal meaning now commonly we have the word Kami which means uh someone who has lust a lustful person comedy grammatically should be a woman who is a lustful woman but it doesn't mean that if you if you look it up in the dictionary it'll be more an attractive woman for whom a man may have lost now I don't know grammatically I don't know why it's like that but this is this is the way it is and we find this word commonly it's common in in many songs referring to the Divine mother and uh I remember I think it's uh second wife when he remarried her name is kailash comedy generally it's it's connected with with Kali we have that song who was that woman Yonder and the field of battle and everything so there's a comedy it's not a derogatory term this is the first thing that we should understand that it's not a derogatory term and uh that uh the whole concept is that those especially those who want to lead a life of renunciation a monastic life that this is a very natural tendency in the human mind working both ways but tuck was talking to men this is a problem when you're talking to women we'll get it from the other side holy mother spoke about it from the other side but we only hear it from when he's talking to men so it's always in these terms but his point is that if there's any chance of attachment at the early stages then you you avoid the company or the presence of that which can attract the mind and uh in most monastic Traditions there there are little bits of much stronger than we are actually I I was having a conversation today about this Swami Narayan tradition uh the monks of their swamis of their order uh will never set eyes on a woman devotee they may stay in their house they'll be invited to their house to live there the wife or daughter would cook all of the food and leave it for them and have to leave and they came so that they'll never have to to look at them there are many places yeah and the real monastic traditions in Christianity there will also be very strong on that and it's all because of the human tendency the Traditions that weren't very Buddhist tradition that it at one point the monasteries and Convention men and women they became almost joined together or close enough that uh the little degeneration took place ready opposed to he was very opposed to it and and many of the others as soon as they saw this happening they said it's a big red flag the beginning of the end almost yeah yeah so uh the problem is that if if if it's the really issue is that lustful nature of men and the women suffer for it if this is what happens that uh men shouldn't see the face of a woman there therefore they should Veil themselves or they should say then the women are suffering because of the shortcoming of men it's completely unfair it makes more sense if men are like that let the men blindfold themselves yeah but this is this is what's happened throughout history that in many different Traditions look at Catholic nuns also they'll have the same they they won't show their hair they'll cover their hair sometimes wear veils and different tradition even before marriage the bride has to wear Veil and everything so uh takur is is just explaining that this tendency of of the human mind is such that even for those who don't have these very strong tendencies that he says even for a lustful man the presence of a young woman can bring out this lust and the things it's not it's not that these are tempting women or anything like that we've seen that many many times in our monastic order that not many times but is not that uncommon that a monk and a woman devotee or a monkey To None even and some of our Western centers they'll end up working side by side and there that'll they'll be the ones who fall in love with each other so the the Temptation for the side of of someone who takes the spiritual life will be more for a spiritual person so not just a physical thing and uh there'll be some who is is not for physical enjoyment but uh they realize deep down they have a desire for family life and children so uh taqwa says that those who really want to lead this a spiritual life especially on The Path of Knowledge because there we have to completely get rid of this this uh ego which identifies itself with the physical body that it's important to be removed from society a little bit to to not keep the presence of uh the opposite sex we can put it that way because holy mother says the same thing for women holy mother is very strong especially with the child widows because they're always living in in society and men take advantage of them and everything and so he said especially for them it was very strong that if uh don't even look at a figure on the ground if God comes to you as a man don't look at him see that's in one place even so anyhow uh swamiji and all of the others uh replace comedy content with Karma content almost always and spoke in those terms we never hear swamiji say we're going to go it will be less than gold and we also prefer that so yes to uh to try to make it clear that takur he didn't look down upon women in fact he looked upon them as as the embodiment of the Divine mother and he saw that there was the Divine embodiment of the Divine mother even in the prostitutes and those that were looked down upon by Society thank you so let's get back to to this one cannot obtain an algebra meaning that's when it's extremely cautious about women now the other thing is of course we know that there are cases where the attractions between a man and a man or a woman and a woman it will be the same thing is the same thing whatever it is that that draws the Mind towards the world should be avoided in the early stages especially because he has this idea of hedging everything around protecting ourselves till we become strong therefore it is very difficult for those who live in the world to get such knowledge this we go all the way back to bhagavad-gita and everything we know that that this Path of Knowledge was not recommended for those who lived in the world and uh almost exclusively for the sannyasi that was a very traditional thing those who strictly followed The Path of Knowledge we followed the mixture of everything but that was because the very outside one has to identify wholly with this infinite absolute reality and not this physical body so the very difficult path however clever you may be you will stay in your body if you live in a city room the company of a young woman evokes lust even in a lustless man but it is not so harmful for a householder who follows The Path of Knowledge to enjoy conjugal happiness with his own wife now and then now sometimes we hear takur saying after the birth of one or two children live like brother and sister and then maneuver again I I shudder a little bit or householder deputies then they think well we have to give up married life and everything he said we have to look at all the things that takos says and not just just uh they'll say one thing one time but uh this is very important that uh Chastity among the householder means living a a life of moderation it doesn't mean the same type of brahmachary that the monk believes of course for those who can do it then uh really husband and wife on the same page and want to live a really strictly spiritual life then he does recommend that live like brother and sister that of course very high ideal that some reference to this um um it's solely for the sake of approaching it and it is as good as yes you may enjoy sweet meat once in a while laughs it is not so harmful for a householder but it is extremely harmful for sanyasi he must not look even at the portrait of a woman of course we we don't do that in our tradition but we try to follow the spirit of it we try to follow this this spirit and uh in impossible for us not to see the face of a woman yeah why you have to look upon them as your mother near her sister yeah if you if you can't do that if you can only look at them [Music] purify yourself and then become household yeah yeah yeah anyhow in in India especially are there certain rules that of course we follow that we won't write in the car and sit next to a woman devotees certain things like that we we follow the spirit of it but uh as I say other Traditions are much stricter even Christian Traditions some of them are very strict this malnathos as you mentioned that no woman has said foot and the mount ethos is a place in Greece uh they say not even that's like uh see among among the direct disciples we have two examples one is and they say in his ashram and not even the female fly can be found there yeah he was very very strict about that and the very interesting uh incident in his life uh he he was in uh and Kashmir when swamiji was there and the lady Liberties were there that was uh system the radiator and and uh Sarah Bull and Josephine McLeod and they they had a series of houseboats one would be for cooking one for the men to live one for the women one uh it's some type of arrangement there so swamiji knew how strict was and they wanted to play a little trick on him so somehow I don't remember all the details somehow he had the women stay in one place and told La Tu Mirage without his knowledge that you go there you remember the details he told the boatman's daughter as a Birdman's daughter oh anyhow as soon as you saw it he jumped overboard so but he whatever Taco said he took literally that was the specialty of uh we have a lot too much other otherwise how lovingly uh all the swamis treated the women devotees and really tried to look upon them as mother this is this is the other tradition you'll find a very nice thing there's a very elderly monks going up to a small girl and folded hands addressing her his mother a very nice idea so as sannyasi must not sit near a woman and talk to her even if she is intensely Pious no he must not talk to a woman even though he may have controlled his passion he said yasi must renounce both woman and gold as you must not look even at the portrait of a woman so also he must not touch gold that is to say money it is bad for him even to keep money near him now we don't follow this either but the spirit of it which means that we we shouldn't feel that we own anything we utilize money because it's necessary to to run to do the work that we do and everything so we really we try to understand the spirit of what Tucker is saying but the impossible unless the one really we announces everything lives in a forest it's impossible to follow these things it's bad for him even to keep money near him for it brings in its strain calculation worry insulin to anger and such evils there is an instance in the sun it shines brightly suddenly a cloud appears and hides it that is why I didn't agree to the marwadi's depositing money for me with redoid I said no I won't allow even that if I keep money near me it will certainly raise clouds now people would sometimes criticize ramakrishna and say European mom so you're beyond all of these things and he would say what can I do my child this is the way I am but deep down he would say I I have to set an exam very strong example for others that uh whatever I do if there's a little bit lapse they'll do it 10 times worse than me if I answer the call of nature standing up they'll do it from the the branch of a tree so he knew that he had to set a very very high standard why all these strict rules for us and yasi it is for the welfare of mankind as well as for his own good a sanyasi May himself lead an unattached life and may have controlled his passion but he must renounce woman in Gold to set an example to the world we had one monk that in Trabuco before I got there he loved to play tennis so he asked permission to play tennis grantingly they gave him permission and then there was one woman Deputy could he play tennis with her uh everybody thought not a very good idea but somehow he ended up doing it ended up leaving the monastery yeah so taku knew what he was talking about it's not that there's no truth behind it but to practice these things literally a hundred percent in in today's world is very very difficult a man will have the courage to practice renunciation if he sees 100 renunciation in a sannyasi so takur also fell always felt that the sanyasi had to set an example I remember a statement that Thomas you once made that one of our monks stopped coming to the shrine so Swami said I see you don't go to the shrine anymore he says I meditated my room and he said Taco said wanted medicine meditate in secret within the mosquito net and Swami Swan and he said look that people don't see you in the shrine they'll think there's no need to go in the shrine he said that sadhu life is a public life I always remember that we always think it's a private life our life is the interior life is it a public life that this has to set an example okay a man will have the courage to practice pronunciation if he sees 100 renunciation in the sannyasi and then only will he try to give up lust and gold if the sanyasi does not just set this example then who will one may lead a householder's life after realizing God now this is another very important thing because sometimes we think that forget about leading a householder life can we even come back to the world after God realization does a god realization mean we go into samadhi and that's the end of everything sometimes we get that impression that who is it could have the highest realization and live in the world so now he's saying that not just the sanyasi household or can also have the highest realization and live in the world so again we have to look at all of the statements that taco makes otherwise we jump to conclusions and it seems like there's there's really no hope for us we want God realization and then we'll we'll be gone in 21 days so this is these things are very important that uh one may lead a householder's life after realizing God it is like churning butter for milk and then keeping the butter and water Johnny could let the life of a householder after attaining brahmagana Johnny defense with two swords the one of Guyana and the other of karma the sannyasi renounces action therefore he fences with one sword only that of knowledge now this is of course the traditional sannyasi and renouncing action uh for the traditional sannyas he was more ritual reenouncing all types of rituals though the early days all the things that were necessary and come in for the householder this sanyasi didn't have to do any of those things the type of karma that we do as monks of the order is of a different nature this isn't really we don't practice karma yoga this is a type of worship we tried we tried to undo Services worship of God service to all living beings uh it's uh from the outside it looks like Karma we're serving in a hospital where we're teaching in the school the way anybody else does but the attitude should be different so this is again traditional sannyasi you won't won't have any obligations or any duties to perform they're free from all of those things a householder endowed with knowledge like Janika can enjoy fruit both from the tree and from the ground that means spiritual and also take some Joy from the world hold on the world with one hand hold on to God with the other hand something like that he can serve holy men entertain guests and do other things like that I said to the Divine mother oh mother I don't want to be a dry sadhu so now after praising this in your sin and free from all of these things he said I don't really want to be exactly like that and let me enjoy the company of the devotees let me enjoy the world see God and everything and everywhere so his attitude was a little different remember this is all this all goes back to let me tell you something that I will agree with your attitude good foreign one does not have to discriminate even about food The Riches of olden times endowed with the knowledge of Brahman and having experienced Divine Bliss ate everything even pork no I I don't know where Tucker got this from but even even swamiji says these ancient rashids would eat beef that they would uh any of these these things are uh we're very much cultural things then uh almost all the early Traditions uh before there was a lot of Agriculture they ate animals this was uh that was a a later much later stage in human evolution when we had agrarian cultures where people learned how to plant things and everything before that it was always uh these Hunters hunters and gatherers and then later there were Planters and things like that excuse later after they agree yeah of course even at that time they did know about crops and weed and planting things and everything yeah of course even even then but still uh the uh vegetarianism really uh flourished in India after the Giant and Buddhist traditions and then of course the vice never tradition picked it up to a large extent before that we don't find much about the vegetarianism to mahima generally speaking there are two kinds of yoga karma yoga and Manoa yoga mental yoga that is to say Union with God through work and to the mind yeah sometimes we'll we'll say there's a Path of Knowledge the path of devotion sometimes we'll break it down this other way the path of action and the path of of knowledge and different ways of looking at it we know we also have our four yogas of course there are four stages of life and sanyasa during the first three stages a man has to perform his worldly duties the sanyasi carries only his staff water pot and begging boat he too May perform certain nitya Karma but his mind is not attached to it he is not conscious of doing such work now the nithya karma this is a whole class of of uh actions that don't they're not based on any desire for anything they don't bring any special Merit we don't get anything uh positive out of it but if we don't do it we we incur some type of sin so it's not something that has to be done with uh longing for the fruits say if we if we follow things like serving a guest who will come to us we don't get any marriage for that if we don't do it we'll get some demerit so this is a nitya Karma so the sannyasis also can do all of these things they're completely with they're not sakama Karma they're not without any special desire but they don't have to they're beyond all of these rules and regulations they don't have to but generally they'll do try to be of of the help to the world work for the welfare of the world if they can to set an example to the world if a householder or man man belonging to the other stages of Life performs action without attachment then he is united with God through such action so the householder stage of life is really meant to be uh not just to enjoy and reach the end of enjoyment but it's also a life of sacrifice for the welfare of society uh husband for the welfare of the wife and children the wife for the welfare of the family that it's based on compromise it's based on sacrifice and this is how one learns to give up selfishness to the householder stage of Life those who don't go through it we assume have already learned these lessons previous life which is good sometimes we don't know but this this is the the beauty of this of the system that the householder stage of life we say common artist not simply for enjoyment and and fulfilling all of our desires but to learn how to sacrifice to learn how to compromise to learn how to put the welfare of others before ourselves Welfare Society welfare family wife and children and husband and looking after parents serving them all of the things that uh paying respect and honor to to guess all of these things are essential to the householder stage of life this is why that there were many of these sastra experts who said that sannyasa is not possible without going through all the other stages of life that one has to become a householder first and then one has to become and then one could become a sanyasan because they have to learn all of these these different types of uh lessons in the world and then others said that uh oh no they can go directly from brahmacharya to sannyasa then others said that at any stage of life that very day that you feel that Bernie renunciation to realize God you're allowed to leave the world so that means even with family even in the middle of the householder stage of Life although the generally there was a provision that after the birth of a son and this is to look after the mother and this is exactly what happened in swamiji's Grand Foods astrology's grandfather let's run as soon as soon as swamiji's father was born who could look after his his mother then uh swamiji's grandfather left him became a Wandering Monk so he fulfilled that at least that much should be done but those who have this Burning renunciation and feel this uncontrollable pull to renounce everything that somehow they're given the sanction to do it not everyone will agree of course many times people came and devotees came to him married devotees with his great desire to renounce and takur with scold them many times you you married in the family and everything now you want somebody else to look after them so they could get a good school thing that would em who was probably the most qualified of all the householders to lead the life of sanyasa to renounce really practically begged ramakrishna it seems like and Tako said no in the case of a paramaham said like shukadeva all karmas all Puja Japan sandhi and so forth drop away in the state and then communed with God through the Mind alone there was another incident in the life of srama Krishna after his mother passed away he wanted to do tarponent turpan you suggest you have to offer some water for for the welfare of the deceased and he tried many times but the fingers would open up and the water would flow through so he wasn't able to do it and he couldn't figure out why so he asked I don't remember who other than somebody and they said no this is called those who have have attained the state who've gone beyond the uh this worldly State who being taken the vouchers were not allowed to do it automatically the body won't allow it to happen so the water would just Escape through the figures before it could be offered how these things happen in Tucker's life even when he didn't know if he knew these things then we can understand it something that he wasn't even aware of how it happened and in such a literal way is is really a remarkable thing amazing to his actions validated his actions validate the scriptures yeah yeah it's true one thing to read about it and know about it and have in the back of your mind and psychologically you know your little question but without even knowing about it so this uh the the idea that after God realization or after renunciation that one has no ritualistic Duty anymore that uh this was something we we see there's a tangible example of this in Turkish life sometimes so in in this state a man communes with God through the Mind alone sometimes he may be pleased to perform outward activities for the welfare of mankind but his recollection and contemplation of God remain uninterrupted yeah we look at these these the greatest sannyasis Buddha and Christ caitanya Davis all of them they all did things for the welfare of because their heart was so pure and and full of compassion for others the the whole life was dedicated to the welfare of others foreign triggered by the presence of mahima and knowing that this kind of uh would appeal to him but at the same time go Way Beyond what he's thinking I'm sure because half of it is is telling him uh you're really not fit to be again to follow this path so both sides are there but he does it in such a subtle soft way that I'm sure it doesn't feel like he's being told you're not qualified for any of this whether he understood any of it or not we don't know he's a proud person it was about eight o'clock in the evening ceramic Krishna asked well himachalan to recite a few hymns from the scriptures read the first verse of the uttara Gita describing the nature of the Supreme Brahman he Brahman is one partless stainless and Beyond The Ether without beginning your end unknowable by mind or intelligence finally he came to the seventh verse of the third chapter which reads the twice born there's a footnote a man belonging to the Brahman chaturcast who has his second or spiritual birth at the time of his investiture with the sacred thread now there'll be people who will argue with only the brahmans who can do it and it'll take in different periods of time the history of India it was it was restricted to brahman's other times to the top three but in any event this is the this is Luigi uh worship the deity and fire so this means those really who uh have had the sacred thread I can recite this guy to the Mantra and have some uh obligations that they have to do nithya karmas keeping the sacred fire and everything and they'll do ritualistic worship and and this yagna so the twice born worshiped the deity and fire the Moonies the great sages contemplate him in the heart men of limited wisdom see him in the image and the yogis who have attained same-sightedness behold him everywhere no sooner did the master hear the words the yogis who have attained same-sightedness then he stood up and went into samati his arms supported by the splint and bandage speechless the devotees looked at this Yogi who had himself attained the state of same-sightedness and just that the pain of the arm was completely irrelevant at that point we could just raise as my he didn't raise his mind their mind got pulled up this is something good he would hear it or say it in the mind would just get pulled up after a long time the master regained consciousness of the outer world and took his seat he asked Muhammad to recite verses describing the love of God the latter recited from the Narada what need is their opinions if God is worshiped with love what is the use of penance if God is Not worshiped with love what need is their opinions if God is seen within and without what is the use of penance if God is not seen within and without Abraham and oh my child cease from practicing further penances hasten to shankara the ocean of heavenly wisdom obtained from him the love of God the pure love praised by devotees which snaps in Twain the shackles that bind you to the world he used to recite this for srama Krishna Tucker would like this very much but if I remember correctly there was some reference to this once and and he was saying yeah I don't really like these things this is too much too devotional that he was really thought of himself as a real Yanni I recite these because Tucker asked me said the word you remember it's not something about I think maybe when the notion went to his house one day maybe it was on that occasion Master ah when hearing these verses the master was about to go again into an ecstatic mood but he restrained himself with effort Martin might read from the yeti panchaka I am she the Divine mother now this is not the standard mood that the devotee has but this is also one of the traditions this uh saw him we have soham and saw him I am she and so some shaktas will practice that this wasn't a taqwa's attitude of course we know that generally they like that relationship with the mother but this is also something we find I am she the Divine mother in whom the illusion of the universe of animate and and inanimate things is seen as in Magic and in whom the universe shines being the play of her mind I am she the embodiment of Consciousness who is the self of the universe the only existence knowledge and Bliss so this is the advaita uh seeing through the lens of of the mother worship this feeling of one Oneness with the divine when the master heard the line I am she the embodiment of Consciousness he said with the smile whatever is in the microcosm is also in the macrocosm now this sounds like a little bit of a uh mystical type of statement huh what is he getting at exactly here but if uh if if I feel myself to be self within this body then uh the same thing will be with this whole universe and that self within this whole universe will be the same as as the individual self Within Me this type of idea that that same relationship will be there okay we can stop here next well you might read the sixth standard stanzas of Nirvana we'll start with that next time this of course is very maybe the most famous Hymn of shankaracharya um [Music] foreign Krishna who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of our worship [Music] peace peace peace thank you foreign
