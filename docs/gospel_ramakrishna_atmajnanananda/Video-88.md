[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna by Swami Atmajnanananda (02/04/22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGB5CHx0IJQ)

um [Music] your words are like nectar and bring life to squirt souls they are praised by poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of srama krishna the date is wednesday september 26 1883 and this is the chapter instruction device nervous in brahmos and we're on page 300. yeah passed away he had been living he was the last family member living there he lived there for yeah for many many years and he was so gracious he always kept the house open for visitors and showed people around i met him for the first time in 1978 when i went there yeah and then on my last trip to india who would strongly serve we also went and we we had a nice chat with him met with him and everything was very gracious so this is uh a big a big turning point in the history of the tamriel yeah which is the name that's given to the house where i am live i don't know what will happen now if uh if it'll be turned over and become part of it it was always uh open to the public but it was their private home also so i don't know what will happen it may become i'm just now part of the whole ashram because there's they purchased the house just down the street right next to it so i don't know but he was a very very gracious wonderful person and very great okay now this chapter is talking to him yeah the whole thing is is talking to him there were just a few devotees it's a wednesday so there were just a few deputies with the master and rock call and lotto were living there and then was there and so almost the total thing so far the conversation between christian the compiler of the of the gospel this is krishna speaking let me ask you one thing do you feel attracted to money and treasures em no sir but i think of earning money in order to be free from anxiety to be able to think of god without worry now this is always a big question it runs throughout we find it mostly with aadhar somebody is a devotee to what extent should they really make an effort to get a better job and to earn more money to what extent should they just be content with whatever comes so it's a balance it's a balance if uh if we take a harder job that brings more money and more responsibility sometimes we have less time and more anxiety so we have to balance which is more important to us sometimes we have no choice for the sake of the family we have to do it so m gives a good answer no sir but i think very much to be free from anxiety so this is perfect to be able to think of god without worry if if the whole mind is thinking about how to pay bills and everything that's also not a good situation so sherman krishna says oh that's perfectly not true em is it greed i don't think so master you are right otherwise who will look after your children what will become of them if you feel that you were not the doer now it sounds like a funny statement but he's getting philosophical on us that a stage comes in spiritual life where we don't feel that we're actually individual jivas the stage comes where we start to identify ourselves either as just the witness or we start to feel that god dwelling within is the real doer the divine mother or different attitudes may come but this is this is the stage where we start to practice surrender and acceptance and renunciation also this type of pronunciation it has to be tempered a little bit by uh our situation in the world our daily needs what the family requires from us and all of these different things so if usually someone feels they're not the doer this this indicates time for renunciation has come or one has reached another level we have this with this concept of reaching the plane of yoga so that there are those who are those who are trying to ascend to that plane for them they have to do action karma is the is the karma karnamuchidi so they have to do action but once they've reached this plane it's not realization they've reached a certain level then shanta then this quietude then the lack of effort just accepting things as they come and that becomes their path that becomes the means for them to get realistic so that's a higher level generally the way trauma christian explains it is that we don't decide that uh duties fall off on their own that we become incapable of doing things at some point and then the mother herself divine mother takes over for us so it's not exactly that we have to think have i reached that point where now i don't make any effort i simply accept things like that it's something that grows and happens naturally if it's done prematurely gives a nice illustration that we have a scab that the scab serves a purpose underneath it'll bleed again so and if we wait the scab will fall off on its own when it's healed underneath that means when it's time for us to be able to renounce so what will become of them he had several children he had duties in the world plus he didn't earn a lot of money he was a headmaster and he ran a little school he did different different kinds of work he was a businessman or something and made a lot of money but he led a very simple life he didn't have a lot of needs or anything them i've heard that one cannot attain knowledge as long as one has the consciousness of duty duty is like the scorching sun swamiji also said that like the the midday scorching sun of duty why is it like the scorching sun if if we're acting out of compulsion if we feel we have to do something duty has that implication that if we somehow not living up to the householder ideal or whatever it is that uh we have obligations we have debts close to this idea of duty a little bit of a lack of freedom now the gita ideal and another way of looking at it is that what we call what you call duty i call worship so we have these beautiful verses in vita that god can be realized and yes by a performative duty and no matter what our position in life no matter what kind of work we do that that can be done as as a worship and through that we can realize the highest goal but otherwise we we do have obligations to do this sometimes it's difficult sometimes do things that we don't feel like and we know what we have to do for the sake of the family this was actually m's condition he's not speaking just theoretically he had a great desire to renounce it's very curious that uh when they first met the first meeting of krishna and them when he came there and was asking or remarried now generally he didn't ask that question it's very the whole thing is very curious because we we have this idea that where he sees somebody he knows everything they pass their future and everything why does he have to ask that and why is he disappointed when he finds that m is married so it's not that he says i can look into a man's in a certain mood he could do it it's not that he was always doing it with everybody reading everybody's mind or anything and now in the m's case uh he saw that m was perfectly qualified to renounce that he could have been one of the young future monastic disciples and this is why he was a little disappointed when he heard that that was was married and then when he found that they had children that meant more entanglements so the curious thing is that when em finally says that no i really do want to renounce and he said no you can't do it as if he's not ready to do it or something but we have this idea that m had the role to play of to live like a sannyasi only was still within the household situation so he had to roll to play so master keep your present attitude it will be different when the consciousness of duty drops away of itself they remain silent a few minutes to enter the world after attaining partial knowledge why it is like dying and fully consciousness as in cholera okay now we have a few interesting things here one is that dying in full of consciousness is considered to be on the one hand a very high spiritual type of death a highly realized soul to be in full consciousness while leaving the body it's considered a very high type of thing but on the other hand then we're fully awake to to whatever pain and suffering there is at that time so from from that point of view it's not such a wonderful thing we think how blessed someone is they they went quickly and uh without any pain or if they go in their sleep something like that but there is supposed to be uh it's supposed to be a sign of a higher realization to go in full consciousness fully aware of what's happening like trying to do it several of us have tried that to remain fully awake to that experience of of of the mind kind of shutting down and it doesn't work of course the other thing is what does m mean by partial knowledge very interesting way he puts it i think his condition is that we know the ideal that we've we haven't enough understanding that we're no longer interested in the things of the world that we know what we have to give up but yet we haven't gotten the ability to taste that other reality that we're seeking we're in between this is why they say that uh two types of people in this world are happy those who are completely ignorant and those who are god realized the in-between people are the ones that have to suffer a little bit so for us uh we're always striving for an idea that seems a little bit far away that if only we could have that realization uh if only the mind would would some somehow cooperate with us we we know the ideal you know what we're supposed to do and yet we're constantly fighting this mind so we have that partial knowledge we have knowledge of the ideal but we haven't had that ultimate knowledge that realization so it's just like a struggle that way being very open with krishna that we have to always remember that he had so many family problems and at one point we'll find out that the son dies and that his wife goes practically mad and that he didn't get along with his father and other members of the family so he had a lot of problems why it is like dying in full consciousness as in color color is supposed to be a very painful type of condition people who die with cholera minister the idn m's mind was just as a caliber patient feels excruciating pain at the time of death because of retaining consciousness so also again with partial knowledge must feel extremely miserable leading the life of the world which he knows to be illusory so for m this this partial knowledge for him meant that god alone is real that there's nothing else striving for the word striving for that uh one should renounce everything for god and yet he has this family situation that he's not able to do it m people who are completely ignorant or like typhoid patients who remain unconscious at the time of death and so and so do not feel the pain master tell me what does one attain through money joy opal sen is such a wealthy man but he complains that his children don't obey him see takura he growing up in the village he didn't know about wealthy people except the laha family but uh it's not like you know they had lots of cars and boats and yachts and things like that what did the wealthy mean in those days and maybe a lot of jewelry for the for the women in the family or something like that and a little bit bigger house nothing like what the desire to win people's recognition now this is interesting because sometimes we think oh the the passions that uh they're obstacles they're obstacles in spiritual life if we don't really care too much about spiritual life then they're just part of life not so terrible what's being emphasized here is that we suffer because of them we don't realize how much we suffer because of pride and anger and lust and greed and all these different things so i am just saying is probably the only painful thing so these are glaciers also these are painful things these passions this is why i always feel that most of the things we find in github and everything are equally helpful for people with no spiritual idea no spiritual ideal but if we can learn to live without the result of action if we can learn to live with moderation if we can learn to live with contentment whatever comes we're content with forbearance with all of these traits that our spiritual life will be so much better off if we do it with the spiritual ideal then of course there's a real rationale behind it and a golden mind and everything but uh i i always mentioned this one verse from this in gita that says those who have this ability to control the mind that these are not simply people with good mental concentration and everything these are happy people these are happy people so i am is really talking about how painful it is to have this partial knowledge to have this longing to renounce when it's impossible uh to understand that uh lust and anger and greed and pride that these are all pain-bearing things these are glaciers and everything and yet we can't shake them off so easily that this is our situation we're we're in between we're trying to transcend these things and uh and the mind is is putting up a good battle with us so there's something painful about that and then tucker ads also the desire to win people's recognition because he sees that there's so so many of this oh he's just trying to to make a show of things getting more money and everything and the people are never happy people are always striving for more wealth more enjoyment more power for more recognition that they're never content impossible they're never happy people we sometimes think oh oh so much money and they can fly to the island vacation they can do whatever they want but where is that inner peace i doubt very much there may be some exceptions but i doubt very much and if there are exceptions it's not because of the money it's in spite of it that they have and with money comes the vultures and who knows wealthy people how do they know if anyone really likes them or not the flatterers and everything very difficult and then they know as soon as they die children are going to fight over their money it's a terrible thing m i'm sorry then talker says well what do you think my attitude is m it's a beautiful statement it is just uh it is like that of a man just awakened from sleep he becomes aware of himself you are always united with god so we're asleep we don't know anything or we're dreaming and we think we know something then we wake up and we find oh the whole time i was just here in bed that i thought i was doing all of these things none of it was real i've mentioned this several times that i used to sit with swami bhajanandaji every once in a while uh when i would go to on just my trips to india he was always happy to talk to people he was one of our swamis who uh was a very very deep thinker and very uh contemplative very in-drawn deep meditator everyone respected him very much he's still alive but he's retired now very rarely did he ever ask me anything he would explain things and he'd like to go through philosophical things but one time he asked me what do i think when i first wake up in the morning what do i do when i first wake up in the morning i didn't know what he was getting at so i said i repeat my answer he said well it's okay but ask yourself where was i when i was asleep and where am i now analyze a little bit who is who was this guy that was just a few minutes running around in a dream or was was gone in deep sleep and where did that eye come from analyze a little bit so it's very nice if we if we think that god realization will be a full awakening just as we have that kind of temporary awakening when we wake up from sleep so the very nice statement that em makes it is like that of a man just awakened from sleep he becomes aware of himself you were always united with god master do you ever dream of me em yes sir many times the whole mind is on him day and night naturally he'll dream after how did you dream of me as giving you instruction and remain silent so that means yes that means yes that was shy he didn't like to say too much and remain silent and then uh krishna says if you ever see me instructing you that means in dream then know that it is himself that does so that means don't think it's your imagination know that it's something real we have this this belief that krishna talked about also that there's something different about a spiritual dream and an ordinary dream now from a practical point of view or even scientific point of view what could be different i mean the content is different of course but is there anything physically different a dream is a dream it comes out of of our subconscious mind but the subconscious mind is part of this cosmic mind also there's some connection there so we can look at it from that point of view but just from from our own observation that sometimes we we have a dream that we dream of our chosen ideal or we dream of a holy person or something we wake up and it's like oh wow that this we really feel the how real it was and it leaves a deep impression that we made the whole day we may feel just uh out of this world we're living in a different place and it may last for you it may last forever it will be very very strong deep impression on the mind talker talks about sweptness in her at least for me most of the dreams are nonsense dreams but every once in a while if there is a dream like that then it really we feel very blessed that we've had that that type of experience i've had very few in my lifetime but really i remember so strongly that it was really as as if it really actually happened and related his dream experiences to srama krishna who listen to them attentively master to him that is very good don't reason anymore you are a follower of shakti now this is also interesting because uh m was never very clear when he first comes to streaming and he's asked he says he likes the impersonal impersonal absolute this is near going to brahmani ideal of the of the brahmos maybe maybe a little bit of personality but formless certainly certainly formless and then later he says no i like it but now i understand that god benefits in all different ways that we can he can also be personal and personal with form and everything and then sometimes he seems to like this servant master idea uh he never specifically tells sriami krishna that i like this mother child relationship does he you remember i don't remember that ever maybe something like that came in the dream now the other thing that is important i think is that em was extremely devoted to his mother who died the stepmother that he lived with he was very very much devoted to his mother and i think maybe at one time i asked can one meditate on one's mother yeah so maybe that's connectingly otherwise follower of shakti doesn't have to mean that oh mother kali or anything like that it can simply mean that he understands that this the brahmin is possessed of of qualities and is is also the creator or projector of the universe that this near going to brahman is also going to ram and everything that thakura was teaching this also falls within this this chakta tradition the personal impersonal and with form and without unable to take many forms and all of that so something in the dream indicated that this ramakrishna plus and now we can say by now he knows em's mind very well that he can confirm that yes you're a follower of shakti okay that's the end of that day this is still the same chapter instruction now it's wednesday october 10th 1883. i i never realized i never noticed it before we've seen it so many times and he's very recent recent devotee has the number one spot they say a hundred times talk we went to his house but the author is released many times other hand invited the master to come to his house on the occasion of the durga puja festival and in bengal and kolkata this of course is the main festival this is this is the equivalent to christmas in this country that it's the most important holy day and also festival day and the day when people visit other people and share food and and wear new saris and all sorts of things it's a very wonderful occasion and everybody gets the vacation time so school is closed businesses are closed so it was a very nice time my first trip to kolkata came during the time and it was aha he was in heaven everywhere it seemed like every street corner that they had set up you know there's a beautiful display with mother durga and shiva and all of the attendants and everything and there were jauters and music performances and everything and people visiting other people's homes and getting sweets and everything is really wonderful i remember beautiful chennai concert is that where the place are we staying just nearby so fatherhood invited the master to come to his house on the occasion of the durga puja festival it was the third day of the worship of the divine mother so it's a very important day was he yeah yeah he was a family man as far as i know yeah yeah and he was deputy magistrate but trying to get this other big position when trauma christian arrived at author's house he found his friend saruda balarama's father and others neighbors and relatives waiting for him the master went into the worship hall to see the evening worship when it was over he remained standing there in an abstracted mood and sang in praise of the divine mother now this is a very interesting song the divine mother but it's going to include radha and everything it's going to be half shocked f kind of so there are many songs like that the beautiful songs out of my deep affliction rescue me o redeemer terrified by the threats of the king of death am i left to myself i shall perish soon save me o save me now i pray mother of all the worlds thou the support of mankind thou the bewitcher of all the mother of speaking of in terms of of radha dearest playmate of bridges beloved blissful comrade of krishna child of himalaya so now we're back to this tradition uh it is going back and forth between them it's very very nice child of himalaya best of the gopis so this identification yeah who were the gopis is also manifestations of divine mother ron beloved of govinda sacred ganga giver of moksha or gowdy or khalid he had lots of different different ages he had different manifestations different forms of divine mother the ever blessed the all a little i don't fully understand it but when we see all the different names of say lakshmi or saraswati it's all the same lakshmi saraswati but there's some distinction between these different forms of divine mother that are different period she's reborn in different uh satiri or all different forms first for she first i may for shiva's concert thou art the spouse of shiva the ever blessed the all sometimes they'll take his form and sometimes are an absolute eternal beloved of mahadeva of shiva who can fathom thine infinite glories yeah so hard to say equal reverence for the vice tradition and the traditional tradition a beautiful song the master went to ottawa's drawing room on the second floor and took a seat surrounded by the guests still in the mood of divine fervor he said gentlemen i have eaten now the m is going to speculate that now he's identified himself with divine mother that you can all think that the deity has been served he would go into these moods other times he would get very annoyed so don't call me uh i am i am the servant of rama don't call me brother he would say does the uh the wave belongs to the to the ocean not the ocean to the to the waves like that but he would go in these other moods and he would feel that that oneness so gentlemen i've eaten now go and enjoy the feast was the master hinting not hinting exactly but but we can take it we can take the clue not that he was purposely trying to give that in i don't think but what's the matter hinting that the divine mother had partaken of others offering did he identify himself with the divine mother and therefore i have eaten seems so then addressing the divine mother continued shall i eat oh mother will you eat oh mother the very embodiment of the wine of divine bliss now this this is that type of confusion that takes place when taqwar is in this if he looks a little bit in one direction then he says the mother alone is there that she'll be the idea he looks a little bit the other direction he says the child is there and the mother is there who is feeding whom when he's taking food mothers is the doer so is he the one who's feeding him or his mother the one who's partaking of the food she sees also that divine fire that's that's burning within so he would sometimes get confused mother am i feeding you are you feeding me this uh in between position and we know at the end how he would say sometimes i see that they're two that i see the mother's there the child is there side by side sometimes they say the mother alone is there when they're said to be completely disappears completely otherwise shall i eat oh mother or will you eat oh mother the very embodiment of the wine of divine bliss did the master look on himself as one with the divine mother had the mother incarnated herself as the son this is a fascinating idea and this is something like uh the caitanya school where they believe that krishna incarnated himself in order to uh as rather both the chaitanya was a combination of radha and krishna so the krishna could experience the the joy of of the devotion that radha had the curious idea that the divine mother wanted to be born as as the son in order to experience that loving relationship with the sun for the mother it's fascinating the beautiful idea had the mother incarnated incarnated herself as the son to construct mankind in the ways of god but this way the master said i have eaten in that state of divine ecstasy srama krishna saw the six sinners in his body and the divine mother dwelling in them he sang a song to that effect again he sang my mind is overwhelmed with wonder pondering the mother's mystery her very name removes the fear of kala death himself it means time but time is death so it means both that everything comes in time everything disappears in time so time is the great destroyer also a name is shiva so because is also the one who withdraws everything at the end the fear of calling death himself beneath her feet lies mahakala so let me read this again my mind is overwhelmed with wonder wondering is mystery her very name removes the fear of calling death himself beneath her feet lies mahakala so we see that mahakali may share the image of mother kali she's standing on the chest of shiva the way we see it you can only see when you're looking straight on you see you see the head of shiva kind of matted locks that way you'd have to see from a different angle to see but but she's she's right on his chest one foot on the chest now why should her hue be collar black so that's that's the other thing that uh the color for kali and the color for krishna both black or sometimes they say like it's a shama called like a dark green cloud something like that so taco very often says that this is because uh this this represents formless and infinite formless reality we can't make any distinctions between things this idea of darkness and deep darkness whether they form this beauty sparkles the beautiful song why should her hue be color black many the forms of black but she appears astoundingly black when contemplated in the heart she lights the lotus that blossoms there in deep darkness thy formless beauty sparkles so it's not the blackness of the ignorance or anything it suggests this is an infinite absolute formless reality that illumines everything so why should her hue be color black many the forms of black but she appears as astoundingly black when contemplated in the heart she lights the lotus that blossoms there her form is black and she is named kali the black one yes sometimes taker says his name kali because the concert of qala of time of death of shiva blacker than black is she beholding her man is bewitched forevermore no other form can he enjoy and the wonderman asked the author of the song where dwells this woman so amazing at her mere name his mind becomes at once absorbed in her though they're they're highly realized souls there's always this little lamentation that uh is something beyond the power of the mind to understand so a little bit of that that idea that i i've been trying all my life and still who is this mother i don't know yet but the life is is one with mother at that point says that's the end of that song he says the fear of the devotees flies away if they but seek shelter at the feet of the divine mother oh no i'm sorry this is him speaking why the master saying the following song i have surrendered my soul at the fearless feat of the mother this is another ram prasad song am i afraid of death anymore unto the tuft of hair on my head is tithing almighty mantra mother collee's name my body i sold in the marketplace of the world three he's selling the body this means renouncing everything nothing belongs to me not even his body belongs to me everything belongs within my heart i planted the name of khalid the wish fulfilling tree of heaven king of death appears to him i shall open my heart and show it growing there i've cast out my six unflagging foes ready am i to sail i see crying to durga victory this means this expressions is stricken with grief on account of his son's death so other had taken him deduction is to visit the master we went through that before he remember when he came and talked were saying that song to arms death has come to the battlefield and beautiful song there was a devotee of sri caitanya srirami krishna looked at him and was inspired with the ideal of gauranga he sang now this is another song that kind of uh talk about mother kali and everything this will be another one of those confusion songs is it really krishna is it really caitanya beautiful why is my body turned so golden so this will be sri krishna he expects his body to be black but he finds he's been born as a gauranga with a golden complexion he's been born as caitanya david why is that happening why is my body turned so golden it is not time for this to be so yeah this must be i don't know is there some story about this or not before chaitanya dave was born i guess it is not time for this to be many the ages that must pass before as goranga i appear here in the age of dwapura my sport is not yet an end how strange this transformation is the peacock glistens all the gold and golden two the cuckoo claims everything around me here has turned to gold not else appears gold whichever way whichever way i look what can it mean this miracle that everything i see is gold now we have this other play with radha uh is also part of this display so he says ah i can guess it's meaning now has come to mathura so this is saying that sri krishna knows that he'll be born in the future as saitanya deva as a gauranga with the golden complexion but now as why is his body become gold may be thinking of rata whose body was a gold actually this says rather has come to mathura yeah they they uh they went there and turned back they went there and said who is this man with bhagavad-gita at least that's according to the story that they didn't want to look at him that no we want our govinda we want our cowherd boy so at least according to that tradition they went one time to see him rod has come to mathura and that is why my skin is gold okay for she is like the brahmara okay brahmana there's a footnote that we don't know exactly a cockroach something like that normally we say b yeah here it says the cockroach by intently meditating upon oh sorry the the brahmara some type of b or something becomes transformed into the ladder nobody knows exactly what any of this stuff is if if it's uh uh some real thing or what but it simply means that uh we become transformed that the object of meditation if we meditate so deeply become transformed we know some of these great catholic saints meditating on christ they would get stigmata to meditate so deeply on jesus on the cross that they would actually bleed from their hands so this is transformation can take place that way where takur when he his mind was so uh and one with the hanuman when he was worshiping rama that dark blue my body was but now uh but now yet in the twinkling of an eye it turned to gold by contemplating so now he's thinking has time passed and i don't realize it and i have this golden complexion because i'm chaitanya deva so this is the same idea that uh in this krishna leela the same actors there are reborn in this caitanya and take different roles so not yet is balarama born as nitai nor as nadada becomes srivas nor yashoda as mother shachi yet returned then why should i among them all alone assume a golden face not yet is father nanda born as jagannath that uh krishna any devotion that radha had the power that he had then that deep ecstasy she would go and get the key of krishna so much so that he wanted to experience it so he was born with his golden complexion that meant that he was combined incarnation you could say of ranta and krishna now so he's inspired by seeing the the vaishnava devotees there singing all of these songs srama krishna sang again still overpowered with the ideal of godanga yeah this is why he was so unusual we we don't see another instance where equal devotion to all different aspects and not just devotion but ecstatic devotion to shri krishna to godanga to mother kali to shiva all the different ways that god can be worshiped surely is lost in a state of blissful ecstasy in an exhibit he laughs and leaps and dances and sings he takes a wood for vrindavan the ganges for the blue yamana loudly he sobs and weeps yet though he is all gold without he is black within black with the blackness of krishna these are different uh stories in his life and also he he exhibited that phenomenon which we call the ut that the radha also had and christians these are the connecting link between not people krishna and sramakrishna but before this ability for something to trigger something in the mind we see with radha when she would see the the peacocks dancing and because sri krishna wore a peacock feather in this in his crown that she would immediately think of him and go into ecstasy when the dark rain cloud would come she would think of the three krsna's complexion and go into ecstasy all these different things happen in her life they happen in the life of childhood and of course israeli krishna this deep and it was happening all the time that anything could trigger it it would just it like getting too close this this very dry kindling would getting too close to the fire it'll just go up like that so when uh was in in puri there are many instances where uh garrett's he takes the woods for vrndavan the ganges for the blue yamana here it was really the ocean that he took for the yamana and there were times when the uh longing to be united with krishna there was one the tradition of the fisherman's net and was pulled in that way and then some people think he may have drowned to death but but this was this was that he takes a word for vrndavan so anytime he would see the words he would think of and he would think of krishna he would go into ecstasy this is that that divine association this power of association the ganges for the blue javana loudly he sobs and weeps yet though he is all gold without he is all black within so appearing to be to have that nature of incarnation of krishna himself black with the blackness of krishna the master continued to sing assuming the attitude of a woman devotee infatuated with love for gauranga why do my neighbors raise such a scandal so this is also uh that play of the gopis rather in the gopis who felt such a strong attraction for sri krishna to godango also because he was a striking figure with this shaved head and glowing body and everything that naturally people felt this tremendous attachment attraction why did my neighbors raise such a scandal what do they cast aspersions upon me simply because of godanga so the same thing that the gopis could have said how can they understand my feelings how can i ever explain can i ever explain it all alas to whom shall i explain it ah but they make me die of shame these are married people he's a sanyasin why should they feel some type of attraction for him so people criticized once this courtyard of suribas this is where a lot of these kirtan sessions took place so very well known for that goda was loudly singing the kirtan when on the ground on the ground of the courtyard falling he rolled into an ecstasy i who was standing near him seeing him where he lay entranced was suddenly lost to outward sense until the wife of shrivas revived me another day in the bhaktas procession goda this is godanga go to another name but sweetly singing the curtain harassing the outcasts to him this is another great tradition many of these uh great devotional saints we can say uh were also free from any idea of cast and they the outcasts and everything and bring them into the fold and they all took the name das so you don't know who was a brandman who was issued or anything like that i mean they they'll still know probably but but there's other people they're similar to the uh uh dharma where they'll they'll take the name sing so they'll just feel there's just one family no distinction to it and takara loved this idea he said there's no past distinction among among devotees this is the one way to get rid of cast make everyone a devotee of god another day in the back this procession god was sweetly singing the cure clasping the outcast to him he softened the unbelievers hearts through no dia's marketplace no dears it's just the uh kind of local name uh through know this place he chanted lord hadi's holy name i followed the throng and from close by caught a glimpse of this golden feet once by the ganges bank he stood his body bright as the sun and the moon charming all with his beauty yeah so these other songs about the german and ganga that'll be when from his period and when he was in podia was the ocean but here he was it was right on the gandhi once by the ganges bank he stood his body bright as the sun and moon charming all of his too had come to face some water and as i looked from one side my water jar slipped and fell to the ground my sister-in-law the gossip saw me and now she is spreading it everywhere balarama's father was a vaisnava hence the master also sang of the divine love of the gopis for their beloved krishna i have not found my krishna or friend how cheerless my home without him ah if krishna would only be the hair upon my head this how they came up with these these images they were really really beautiful if heroic and everything he would sing these songs and cry he loved these songs he put up a big front he was so soft inside so many times but he was saying to his eyes i'm not on my christian friend here's my home without him it could only be the hair upon my head carefully i should braid it then and deck it with buckle flowers carefully i should fashion the braids out of my krishna hair krishna is black and black as my hair black would be one with black ah if krishna could only be the ring i wear in my nose all the ways from my nose he would hang and my two lips can never be alas why should i dream why should i krishna care at all to be the ring in my nose ah krishna could only be the bracelets on my arms all the ways he would cling to my wrists and proudly i should walk shaking my braces to make the sound shaking my arms to show them down the king's highway i would walk wearing my bracelets okay we can stop here let's continue it will be a little conversation with uh balaram's father the very orthodox orthodox vaisnava who also a property person [Music] is who is stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace [Music]
