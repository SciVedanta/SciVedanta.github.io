your words are like nectar bringing life to squirt souls they are praised by poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone today of course is a very special day this is the actual titi in janmatiti the birth anniversary of srama krishna according to the lunar calendar and they had a nice celebration that any of you watch the bellarmort website and beautiful singing now we have so many talented singers brahmacaris and young monks and everything is really fantastic and uh one thing that not everyone knows is that the morning after surrounding christianity is the birthday celebration is when we have our sanyash ceremony so and now the whole batch of brahmacaris are now new sannyasis yeah as i thought i would just say a few words about that it's such a nice nice occasion that the future sannyasis of the order they'll fast the whole day and then they'll get up early in the morning if i remember correctly something like 2 30 or 3 something like that and then in the pitch dark take bath in the ganga and then go into the main temple and uh it's hard to imagine but right in the middle of the temple there will be two big fires that are set up this is the village home of fires and uh there'll be two different groups of of the brahmacharyas that will circle the fires and the charges will be there and then there's a whole ceremony that goes on and the president of the order is there and we get a garbage cloth that day and go to the shrine and then get our names afterwards so a very beautiful beautiful ceremony so i i always i i always connect the because they're all within four days of each other and if you remember that during the shivaratri when takur was just a boy 11 i think when he had his his samadhi and everything that they don't say anything about his birthday but they say he remained in that state for three days that means up until his birthday so that period between shivratri and taku's birthday is also kind of we can think of that period when taqwa was was lost in that state of shiva and and then in belarum there's no even even the brahmacaris are not allowed to go the whole temple is closed so they don't only uh it's those who have already taken the sannyasa vowels or allowed to go and witness that yeah and then afterwards they all everyone goes to the president of marathi's headquarters and they get their their new name so everyone is excited to find out what their name is then they'll finally get something to eat after a long time and then they'll prepare for going out for begging their food for the first time so around 10 in the morning they'll go out in pairs and walk barefoot far enough so that we're not within that range of all the devotees so we go to some place where people don't know what's going on and uh and bake food take it back and the food that it's gotten from begging the first thing we do is we we take some of that and it gets offered to taquer in the shrine in the temple because he used to say that any food from beginning is pure food doesn't matter who cooked it or anything like it's pure and then some goes to president and then the rest we go and we all share it and have the and everything is outside for for that whole period there's no sleeping you're or taking food in the dining hall or anything like that so it's a really beautiful occasion and they'll be singing and dancing and everything so it's very nice okay we're on the chapter instruction to vaisnavas and brahmos this is page 390 and it's tuesday october 16 1883. there's a interesting group of people with srama krishna here one is rakal and then balarama's father so balarama's father you'll remember from last time most of the conversation is directed toward him and this is for two reasons one is that uh there was some objection to balarama coming to suramar krishna so surrounding krishna wanted to assure balarama's father that he was coming to a good place he shouldn't worry he shouldn't have any objection to that and two uh takura had great regard for the division of a tradition but also i saw that there was a tendency to be one-sided and a little exclusive so the second thing we find is that tucker is trying to broaden the views of the balarama's father although balarama's father seems to be he seems to be rather liberal in his thinking but at the same time they would have been happier if if balarama devoted himself and kept company within that little vaisnavas circle rather than going to sri lanka so these these two things are kind of there together so rock ali balarama's father benny pal m mani malik ishan kishori and other devotees so summer or takwa is very intimate close to devotees like raqqa and then we have the vaisnava tradition balram's father and then we have the uh brahmos people they're also there so the last thing we saw is that tucker had requested ramlal to sing a song describing how caitanya embraced the monastic life now when we talk about evasion in this context it's not any vaisnava these are very strictly followers of caitanya do it not that they're followers of rama or or krishna from duarka or anything like that a very specific a very specific thing and so the tremendous devotion to caitanya deva and his sanyasa is a story that's told over and over and over again there's so many songs that were composed about that and with the great pathos these songs are sung and they're recited and and uh there's a whole thing called nimai sannyas that is very popular in in bengal and you'll find people weeping because here the young young man 24 and his first wife had died of snake bite and they'd arranged the second marriage but his old mind was the bishopria who who like holy mother became one of the spiritual leaders later and his mother tati devi had had to witness the death of all of her children except there's one son one other son who renounced the world and now this nimae is he's the only one left and for him to have to tell his mother he also wants to become a monk and leave renounce the world and asking for her permission and everything so tremendously uh tremendous pathos with all of this that she has to witness her only remaining son other than the one who pronounced the world also want to give up the world so there's so many beautiful songs so this says over the vision i held in kesha bharati's hut kesha bharati is there are all these different names gauranga goda all names of of caitanya goda and all this matchless grace shedding tears in the thousand streams like a mad elephant he dances in ecstasy and sings drunk with an overwhelming love rolling flat upon the ground and swimming in his tears he weeps and shouts lord huddy's name piercing the very heavens with his cries loud as a lion's roar then most humbly he begs men's love to feel himself the servant of god shorn of his locks he has put on the yogi's okra robe even the hardest heart must melt to see his pure and heavenly love smitten by man's deep woe he has abandoned everything and pours out unstintingly oh with that prim the wood that primed us were his slave and passing from door to door might sing godanga's endless praise the master asked mani malik to quote the words of tulsidas to the effect that one who has developed love of god could not observe caste distinctions one of the distinctive features of this caitanya lila was that they didn't bother with any of this cast and equally gave the name of god to the so-called outcasts and anyone else yeah when takur says there's no cast among devotees this is the way to get rid of cast everyone becomes the devotee of god this was some something that was part of the taitanya tradition earlier also and many of the other uh this during this renaissance period in india north india especially south india of course uh many of these great devotional teachers and and poet saints and everything they didn't care for these distinctions even hindu muslim distinctions said with khabib and others and guru nanak and it was the philosophers who were more interested in keeping the caste and the orthodox systems alive money the throat of the chatuch bird is pierced with thirst all around are the waters of the ganges the yamana the sarudu and of innumerable other rivers and lakes but the bird will not touch any of these it only looks up expectantly expectantly for the rain that falls when the star swathi is in the ascendant master that means that love for the lotus feet of god is alone real and all else is illusory we're used to this the ghanis saying the brahman alone is real and the world is illusory so we start to understand the meaning of illusory that uh here is very clear that it means that everything else is is uh secondary of no ultimate value so when the gyani says that this world is unreal there will be some ghanais who will really see everything like a dream and there are others who will simply say that compared to brahmin this is all fleeting and transitory soccer's view was always that anita was a better way of understanding this idea of mithya that falls mean that it's fleeting that nothing lasts there's nothing permitted to it and from a value point of view there's nothing inherently valuable about the things of the world that ultimately they can't satisfy us that we'll have to give them up one day and whatever we think is of value and then we find out is there's something hollow in that type of enjoyment so this is beautiful god alone is real and all else is illusory from the point of view of the devotee so love for the lotus feet of god alone is real all else is illusory money tulsi also said at the touch of the philosopher's stone the eight medals become gold likewise all castes even the butcher and the untouchable become pure by repeating hadi's name without hadi's name the people the forecasts are but butchers master the high that the scriptures forbid one to touch can be taken inside the temple after it has been tanned so that means that even the worst sinner after being converted by the love of god can be considered perfectly pure pure and hard man becomes pure by repeating the name of god therefore one should practice the chanting of god's name i said to jadu malik's mother in the hour of death you will think only of worldly things of family children executing the world and so forth they said jadhumalik was a very very wealthy person and he was he had a kind of friendship with sri ramakrishna he respected him and liked him but treated him more like a friend not with the same reference that others did and talk also liked him tucker liked all different sorts of people and he was within walking distance he could easily walk to his house just through the southern gate of dakshineshwar and his mother was very fond of shrumi krishna also so there there were many times when he had conversations with judo mother's mother also so he says in the hour of death you will think only of worldly things the family children executing the will and so forth the thought of god will not come to your mind the way to remember god in the hour of death is to practice now the repetition of his name and the chanting of his glories yeah if if we take this very seriously this idea that if we think of god at the final moment and take the name of god at the final moment that we don't have to worry about anything now we just have to do it at the final moment huh but it won't happen it won't happen the whatever the tenor of our life is whatever the thrust of our life is that that will come to the forefront at the end this is a theory at least and if we don't dedicate our minds and hearts to god that won't be the thought that comes at the end so really one one way of understanding spiritual life is that we try to prepare for the final moment prepare the mind train the mind to think of god repeat the holy name and everything so that that will come to the to the mind at the end in the very final moment so the way to remember god in the hour of death is to practice now the repetition of his name and the chanting of his glories if one keeps up this practice then in the hour of death one will repeat the name of god it will automatically happen we won't have to make any effort that thought will come into the mind when the cat pounces upon the bird the bird only squawks and does not say ramram because you can teach them you can teach these parrots these minor birds and other things to say all of this thing but it's just mechanical it doesn't mean anything for them it is good to prepare for death sometimes tako says one to constantly remember death now when when he says that it's not a morbid type of thing we shouldn't always be thinking about dying but we should always remember that [Music] none of the things that we have now will go with us that this this life will will end at some point that nothing is forever that the things we're so attached to we're going to have to give up no matter what to remind ourselves of those things it brings tremendous detachment to the mind if we remember that so it says it is good to prepare for death one should constantly think of god and chant his name in solitude during the last years of one's life if the elephant is put into this table after tibet it is not soiled again by dirt and dust now this is a very interesting theory that taqwa has that i whatever we've done up to this point is well and good but we have to continue this with total footy's idea that doesn't matter how many times you polish the brass pod if you stop polishing it it'll get tarnished so it has to be continued otherwise if if like the elephant after the bath we roll around in the dust then go to this table what good will it have done to take the bath in the first place so it means that daily we have to do these things and until it becomes second nature to us then we don't have to make any effort but uh in the beginning we have to form that habit so that it becomes natural and and we keep it up throughout one's life we we won't be able to do the same type of spiritual practice as we get older that we do when we're young we have to understand that those who are fortunate enough to begin spiritual life at a young age that that's the time to do very intense meditation to lead a very austere life to not worry about taking care of the body and the health or anything like that to dive deep this is why tucker kept telling this his young disciples the future monks of the order to dive deep in spiritual life that's the time to do it and as we get older we practice more of this constant recollection of god shorthand they call it that remembering god thinking of god and remembering god and thinking of god uh if we're if we're talking about that infinite absolute brahmin nothing to remember nothing to think of we're one with that that has no qualities attributes generally we take this to mean some personal form of god and the easiest way of course is the avatar so remembering god to think of the avatar taqwa says worshiping god and worship in the avatar one and the same so the easiest thing is to let the mind dwell on this leela this divine play there's not a lila of the lord in the form of any rama krishna sri rama krishna good to christ any of these avatars and yes just let the mind dwell and float and bob up and down on the ocean of that divine thought because we can't expect to be able to sit for long hours in meditation when we get uh aches and pains in the body and and uh we don't have the physical or mental stamina at that point we try of course we can still try but long hours of puja and japan meditation can be replaced yes by letting the mind dwell a lot of this can be through reading a lot of it nowadays can be through listening to all the talks that we have online and everything some of our devotees are fantastic all day long they'll be listening to these different talks or now so many beautiful budgets and things are available all day they'll be living in belmont with the different talks and with the different pooches that are going on and so many beautiful singers now there that that'll be the way they pass their time uh in great joy retired people otherwise what would they do they'd be bored not much to do it's a very wonderful way to pass the time balarama's father mani malik and benipal were all elderly men did the master gave this instruction especially for their benefit master why do i ask you to think of god and chant his name in solitude yeah this was one of the very special teachings of sri lanka holy company number one if we can't get a holy company solitude and even if we get holy company solitude from time to time in solitude we get to really examine ourselves outside of the gaze of anybody else we get to really see look deep inside of ourselves what's important to us what is our real goal in life we have the opportunity to really dive deep within to not think about anyone else or anything else it's a tremendous tremendous spiritual practice solitude and something that has to be cultivated some people are not cut out for it that they they feel lonely they get depressed they feel bored living alone and other people revel in it it's just such a wonderful feeling yes to just no one else is there just you and and taku or mother you and the lord whatever and uh there's a certain amount of joy because then we don't have to think about any of these coverings that we have we don't have to think about our appearance or we don't have to think about what other people will say about us or how they look upon us will they criticize we're free from all of that then we can be who we really are we can just be the self at that time we'd just be the devotee child of god anything so takur they put tremendous emphasis on solitude why do i ask you to think of god in china's name in solitude living in the world day and night one suffers from worries haven't you noticed a brother killing brother for a foot of land the sikh said to me the cause of all worry and confusion is these three land woman and money now then of course for men and why land because always worried about possessions things that we have woman because this mind is is always filled with lust and filled with desire for enjoyment and everything and then money greed so really this means the passions that these are the things and talk was he had not just a philosophy he had a psychology his psychology was remove yourself from uh from any contact with temptation in the beginning this was his theory it wasn't it wasn't that uh we just have to have that strength of mind that no i won't allow the mind to be attracted to things but i'll enjoy things this mental renunciation is is a frightening thing if we think that it means i can do anything that i want to do but i won't be attached to it no the mind will get attached so he says in the beginning we have to really with a draw from a worldly company a worldly company this is this i'm not talking about people who just you know family people and and have their jobs and everything but but people are really materialistic people with no interest in spiritual life and yes and as much enjoyment and and pleasure and and money and parties and all of that this is like poison for a devotee that we have to withdraw from that and really keep ourselves in a very spiritual holy environment if we if we have a place like our center that people can come and spend more time here then they feel the effects of all of these things so it wasn't simply strengthen the mind so you're not attracted these things but don't place yourself in it in a situation where you'll be tempted to enjoy these things this is what he means when he says that when the plant is very small we have to put a little fence around it to keep the the cows and and the goats and the other animals from coming in and eating it when the tree gets big we don't have to worry about it we take down the fence then we can do anything but it's got to be big and strong he said then you can even tie an elephant to it and nothing will happen you are leading a householder's life so uh this refers to all of them raccale is there rocal is uh he was married but not really leading a householder's life but for the others the elderly ones why should you be afraid of the world when rama said to that he was going to renounce the world it worried his father and the king sought counsel of said to rama rama why should you give up the world reason with me is this world outside god what is there to renounce and what is there to accept nothing whatever exists but god it is brahman alone that appears as ishwara maya living beings and the universe so what tucker is saying is not that you know why should you be afraid of the world not that you can do whatever you want in the world but no need to renounce the world as a householder there's mental renunciation is the main thing but it also involves monitoring our behavior and making sure that we do even living in the world from time to time going to solitude keep holy company all of these other things now he makes this a very great statement nothing would ever exist but god it is brahman alone that appears as ishwara maya living beings and the universe now we get some very deep philosophy that doesn't say that brahman alone that manifests as ishwara appears as ishwara maya living beings and the universe now how do we understand this this is a a point that many people get a little bit confused about what is this distinction between brahman and ishwara or brahman kali or brahman and shakti and ishwara is more or less the same is this is exactly what taqwa means by divine mother because it's uh it's brahman together with shakti together with the power or with the gunas saguna and so that's exactly what he means and the distinction that he makes between roman and ishwara is that ishwara is a brahmin looked at from the point of view of having power having this power to project the universe and and his power to uphold the universe and withdraw the universe now i i like uh one way i think it's helpful to understand all of this is to think of the relationship between sleeping dreaming and acting in a dream if we if we take it this way so brahman will be like someone who is sleeping there's not there's no guna there's no attribute there's nothing going on it's just pure consciousness just sleeping now when this sleeping individual has a dream then that sleeping individual becomes a dreamer right becomes a dreamer the the source of this of this dream world now does that sleeping individual and dreaming individual is he still not sleep the sleeper one in the same person now first we just say this is a sleeping person now we say it's a dreaming person but also a sleeping person both sleeping and dreaming so this the brahmin aspect is always there the sleeping aspect because it's not that you wake up and have the dream still sleeping but dreaming at the same time then what is this maya how is it that someone who is sleeping can who has no willpower who is not deciding now let me have a dream because there's no where there's nothing just just pure empty consciousness there what is responsible for the sleeping person to become a dreaming person maya another way of saying we don't know exactly but there's some some power that has to be there to take that sleeping individual to make that a dreaming individual so then maya and then uh living beings in the universe so that that same cosmic mind that is dreaming that itself is has become every all the objects in the dream they're not real objects in the dream there's also reducible back to to the cosmic mind or consciousness and everything so we say it's all all that one reality and if we say brahman is only near guna then we miss out on all of the other aspects of it that brahman is also saguna but the saguna aspect doesn't have to be there you can sleep without dreaming but you can't dream without sleeping so we can have brahmin without the ishwara aspect but we can't have ishwara without the brahmin aspect and they're not two different things it's all the same the same person we can say not a person of course but that same ultimate reality yeah now we don't have to take this this analogy so literally that it's really just a dream the uh but yes leela from this point of view is whatever that uh is projected out of this cosmic mind and becomes this world that's also that's god's play why because who is it who has become the actor in the dream the same sleeper and dreamer from itself enters into this this unit creates this universe enters into it like the spider creates the web and then lives in the web so that way it's a lila and there's so maya there because the brahmana forgets itself and identifies it just as we do we have a dream and we become 100 identified with the actor in the dream we have no idea that the real eye is lying in bed sleeping somewhere we may have some feeling at some point that no this has to be a dream and then we wake up from the dream but they're not the same even then we wake up we're a little surprised oh i'm lying in bed it's not a hundred percent that we really know that but still we may have some sense of it so this is that unity that we have the unity between brahman ishwara maya and jalad and this and this whole universe and these are all different sometimes they'll talk about brahman and ishwara and hiranyagarh and this virat they'll use different terms for all of these things all different aspects we can say of this one ultimate reality we'll punish yeah but we don't have to dismiss this universe as as just a mistake a mistaken view that uh there's really no snake at all there's just a rope there and it's just i'm misinterpreting everything uh taka's point is that this is all the glory of the divine mother we can accept this as a manifestation see mother dwelling within everything worship everything as the divine manifestation the difference really between the shaktas and the adwaitans is more one of the emphasis do we look upon this world is is maya in the sense that it's something to be avoided and something to be transcended or do we look upon this as this aishwarya as this the glory of the divine mother chuck the idea otherwise there's not a tremendous amount of difference between the two points of view but tucker liked the other one he liked the shakta point of view he said i don't like to call this world a dream he doesn't say that that's wrong he doesn't say that that's not a very helpful way of looking at it for some people that just that was his personality he didn't care for that he wanted to be able to enjoy sport in this world saying everything is divine everything is to play at mother that was he said i'm a child of mother i'd like to be happy i like to enjoy things balarama's father it is very difficult sir so yeah this whole idea that uh renouncing the world what does it really mean is it first of all the technical term in bengali would say to renounce the world it it means we've chosen a different path a monastic path doesn't mean that we're not living in the world everyone has their samsara or for months or some saudis is the order this is we also have our home we also have our duties and obligations just like everybody else does but there'll be some basic distinctions but it's not that we're living outside of the world it's just that our world is a little different it's not quite the same that we don't have the same types of duties we don't have the same type of family relationships that we've avoided that which allows us to avoid a lot of than that natural attachments and entanglements of the world that's all master the aspirin while practicing spiritual discipline looks upon the world is a framework of illusion again after the attainment of knowledge the vision of god this very world becomes to him a mansion of mirth now this is another very brilliant teaching that taqwa has he she he's explaining it in one way here other times he talks about this in terms of neither and it two different ways of looking at it that there's a type of spiritual practice where we first have to take care of misconceptions before we can have a fuller understanding of the final truth so if our problem is that we have this false identification with the body the mind and the senses and all of that then we have to start out with the process of native haiti we have to separate ourselves once we separate ourselves we can realize that i am pure spirit i'm one with the brahmin i'm just i'm the odd man i'm not this body mindset i'm something beyond all of that and then takwa says after that realization then we can see that everything that we said was was non-burman everything we said was assat now we see as a manifestation of the improvement so first we have to take this kind of negative point of view so the same thing here we've seen this before these are the two songs the ram prasad song and the uh what was his name saturday yeah who gave that answer song and tucker liked the other one better but really they don't contradict each other because one is is it at the time of sadhana there's a very very uh subtle point where says that when we say brahmas that this is at the time of sadhana we say that if we're real inviting then how can we say that this world is false everything is has to be real but he says no that this is uh in order to get rid of this false attachment to things and false identification with things we practiced this in 1880 this negation and later an affirmation so in the beginning we can take this point of view that everything is a possible attachment for me i have to be very cautious and i have to make sure that i build my my inner strength up and everything then after that i can enjoy it enjoy everything so this is taco gives so many examples this this tender mind he said it's like milk getting mixed up with water but what we have to do go into solitude and turn this milk into and to let it sit and turn into curd then turn it into butter then we can even let it float and water it won't mix with it so later we can do that but in the beginning we have to be a little careful we have to have a little bit of a of a frightful attitude a little bit that uh this world really can swallow us up if we're not careful we have to be a little bit uh have that attitude a little bit but then afterwards we want to be heroes and say that and now i nothing can attract me because i know that greater attraction is there and then we're on very strong firm ground we don't have to be so careful yeah i i like very much the statement that swamiji made he said when i was young i wouldn't walk on the same side of the street that the theater was on but now i can live in a house of prostitutes and it won't affect me at all because he'd become that huge tree at that time so in the beginning not fearful attitude but cautious and uh about who we mix with and what we do and everything like that and looking upon this world a little bit of of the trap tucker says that sometimes we have to look upon this world as a snake pit and we have to reject the way you'd walk and you have to care every step you have to be careful that venomous cobras are relatives as venomous cobras and the world is abrasion forest fire in the beginning and he has to to tell the mind that uh unless you're cautious you'll get swallowed up you'll get mixed up with the world that and you'll get attached and then tangled and everything so be very careful in the beginning so take that attitude in the beginning that this world is a framework of illusion that i don't want to if i think it's real i'll get attached to it let me say that you know this is all transitory it's all fleeting it can't satisfy me then afterwards i could really enjoy the whole world how much he enjoyed everything the the circus the theater the museum so many things it was yes just pure joy for him because nothing could attract him nothing could could be an attachment for him and of course we can't compare ourselves to him but just to get some idea of what it means so he he was uh he'd like this idea of the this world as uh mansion of mirth he really liked that song much better it is written in the books of the vaisnavas god can be attained through faith alone reasoning pushes him far away faith alone now there's also this word faith these these are very heavily skewed terms that have different meanings and different traditions and everything sometimes we think of faith as something that uh i may not really understand somebody tells me to believe in it so i believe in it i have faith in that this is not that this uh this term biswas vishwasa bishop it really means a deep abiding conviction of the truth of something so it's not that it's a blind faith i don't really understand it but i've been told that it's true so i'm accepting it that way no i've examined it i've observed things i may not have realized it yet but i've seen these great souls have practiced this they've had these experiences i see they're genuine i have tremendous faith in that conviction conviction or swami swansea always who said that word conviction he said conviction itself is a kind of realization so and that this is really the very end we developed this conviction this conviction sometimes takwor says is bakulata this longing is the final step before realization sometimes he says vishwas that this is a tremendous conviction that's followed by realization so you have takur this is why he he was always happy when narendra questioned everything otherwise he wouldn't develop that type of conviction if he simply accepted things without understanding them or without really believing in them it would have been hollow and empty and those are the things that fall away we can hold on to those things they're not very strong for us so we need to really develop this this burning conviction that yes nobody convinced can convince me that this isn't true it doesn't mean i've realized it but i'm convinced that i can have that realization if i follow these teachings that's something like that what faith krishna kishore had tucker always refers to him at written oven a low cast man drew water for him from a well yeah this was a there's a longer story about this that he was very thirsty he went too well and he saw a man there and he asked could he draw some water and that man hesitated and he said why are you hesitant he said i'm from a very low caste and then so then it goes on so krishna kishore said to him repeat the name of shiva after the man had repeated the name of shiva krishna kishore unhesitatedly drank the water now for those of us in in different cultures that don't know about these cast rules and distinctions it sounds a little strange why do we care who draws water for us but these these cast rules were so strong at that time that for uh and this chris nicki sure must have been a brahmin the orthodox environment for someone like that to allow an outcast untouchable to draw water from me would be unthinkable and for him to have so much faith in the name of god that shows a tremendous conviction that he would unhesitatingly drink water from him yeah this is one of those cultural things i remember the first time i read this i thought what's the big deal why should he even have a mask repeat the name of shiva he's just another guy let him draw water but we have to see it in its context the cultural context he used to say if a man chants the name of god does he need to spend money anymore for the atonement of his sins yeah there's so many different things that people do to atone for sins and everything and going on big pilgrimages and making big offerings and building arms houses and things like that the the krishna kishore as i did this repeat the name of god there's this story i never remember was it kabir's son somebody's son that he was left in charge his was it could be or maybe anyhow that uh he went away and he left his son in charge people used to go for spiritual advice and everything and somebody came to him and said i did this terrible thing this and that and he said you repeat the name of rama twice and then you'll be free from all sin so his father came back and he asked what happened and he told him everything and the father got very angry he said this is the amount of faith you have in the name of rama that you made him repeat it twice once would have been enough so we have these nice nice stories of how much faith people had in the name of god so krishna kishore used to say if a man chants the name of god does he need to spend money any more for the atonement of his sins how foolish he was amazed to see people worshiping god with the sacred tulsi leaf in order to get rid of their illnesses i think because he felt all they had to do was take the name of god at the bathing god here he said to us please bless me that i may pass my days repeating rama's holy name now i we were talking about different division of traditions those who worship rama very often will have equal regard for shiva this is one distinction of the invasion of the tradition of the rama worshipers as opposed to the krishna the vaishnavi tradition of in bengal they're really more exclusively worshipers of either either the baby gopal or go into that aspect of christian's life early life or caitanya they won't care too much for shiva but because rama was a worshiper of shiva actually krishna was too but they won't talk about that then they they have the equal regard we have our meshwaram temple and everything so this there's a very nice connection between ramen and shiva i know i don't really understand it but taco always says rama washington's guru and shiva was rama's guru i don't know exactly how wrongly she was guru but there must be some some story about that huh so the bathing god here he said to us please bless me that i may pass my days repeating rama's holy name whenever i went to his house he would dance with the joy at the sight of me rama said to lakshmana brother whenever you find people singing and dancing in the ecstasy of divine love know for certain that i am there caitanya is an example of such ecstatic love now when asrama krishna was growing up he didn't care for caitanya devil very much it's very interesting these are all very interesting cultural things because in his village uh there were worshipers of all different types and often different types of temples but it doesn't seem like he had too much contact or if he did too too much reverence for that tradition because he used to say that uh we thought this chaitanya davis was somebody set up by these these vaisnava people didn't have too much so if when they went to naboo he was curious to see if he would feel anything but later he he had his vision of caitanya deva and nityananda and really developed such tremendous devotion and fell to oneness with him also that because if if he thought himself to be one with ramen krishna and looked upon caitanya deva as an avatar and then he also felt oneness with him and they were so similar in so many ways with this this this uh association triggering some divine mood and this bakulata this tremendous longing for god they're very similar in their personality and loving to saying the name of god kirtan and all the spiritual moods and ecstasies and everything we find all of that in the life of caitanya also so he says caitanya is an example of such ecstatic love he laughed and wept and danced and sang a divine ecstasy he was an incarnation and this is something that takara didn't really i won't say he didn't accept it he didn't have much conviction about that until he had his own direct experience god incarnated himself through caitanya who became a very strong convicted with him later sure i'm a christian that now remember he's talking to balaram's father so these are things that they'll be very impressed they'll think oh this sriamakrishna he also has tremendous regard and love and and respect for caitanya deva he should be a good man sriram krishna sang a song describing the divine love of caitanya then balarama's father mani malik venipal and several other devotees took leave of the master in the evening the devotees from kang saritola calcutta arrived the master danced and sang with them in a state of divine fervor yeah the best time to go to srama krishna was at sunset when the as soon as sun the sun went down you automatically went into a spiritual mood not that he didn't during the day but especially at that time they would notice as soon as it would start to get dark sometimes a little samantha or bother and then but if there's any kirtan singing and dancing after dancing he went into a spiritual mood and said i shall go part of the way myself kishore came forward to massage his feet kishore is em's younger brother and who was also a member of the brahma there were several members of the brahma-samaj who really had the equal devotion for suramar krishna there were some who had some curious devotion for suramar christian and there were some who didn't care for him very much and there were some who were jealous and a little bit antagonistic all sorts of different types there but kishori was very devoted to srama krishna even though because they were staunch members of the brahma swamiji before they met him so and and everyone had regard for kesha of course they considered a scandal with a marriage you know as a daughter and everything but otherwise uh and there was some family connection through m's wife and everything and with keisha himself kishori came forward to massage his feet but the master did not allow anyone to touch him now this touching of sriracha krishna is a curious thing it depended entirely on the state of his mind and on the different period he went through different periods so at certain times there was a one period of time when in that state of samadhi no one could touch him except for baburah even swamiji even narendra and rakal and others he said that that state that this baburam later i was so pure that he needed to have him near because he was the one who could hold him in that state when tucker went into samadhi he could fall we know that he fell he cracked his tooth he broke his arm he needed somebody to be with him at that time but this wasn't always that other times we see even freedom could hold him up in that state of samadhi so he went through different periods and different stages and everything we remember when bryn day the uh the maidservant when she went and touched his feet how he screamed and yelled and had to get genji's water poured on it the same sriramakrishna went to the the star theater and afterwards the actresses many of whom were considered at least to be uh very low and and many of them were mistresses for wealthy men and things like that that many of them came and actually touched they all made pranam bow down to him some actually touched his feet and did he jump up and scream very nicely he said please just from a distance but not that he felt any terrible pain at that time so it depended on his state of mind so in this particular time otherwise he this ki shorty probably massaged his feet many many times so and these weren't his decisions on his part these were all natural things that in a particular state uh there were times when he couldn't touch any metal now with this all the time no he used to eat off metal plates then yes he went to a certain period when he said now i find that i have to have everything ready these stone things he asked damn can you buy some for me like that because he couldn't touch any metal at that time so he went to different periods and the divine mother made him go through all of these things each thing served a certain purpose we don't know exactly what it was so we can't judge him by the way he reacted at one particular time in one particular instance say with the with the maidservant rinde sometimes we think oh what kind of an avatar is he what kind of compassion making her feel so bad but just in that state the other thing is we talk about srama krishna that he could look into a person and know everything about that person and then we wonder when em came the first time why was he so surprised that he's married and it has children and so disappointed and then later we see srama krishna would say sometimes i got into that state of mind where i could look inside a person and see everything there so it's not like it was always in that state of mind so he [Music] he could do it on purpose if he wanted to or sometimes it would just automatically happen he said i just mother put me in that state of mind where i could see it that way so very hard to judge him and understand why he behaves the way that he does at different times then this statement i shall go part of the way myself who knows what he meant by that the very cryptic mystical types of statements ishan arrived now now we'll get with ishan again the poor man tucker told him so many times we've seen now we've seen it for months so many times that uh this this uh vedic type of gayatri mantra and everything uh will be much less effective for you than than doing this worship according to this uh saying the divine mother so many times he told him so nicely and everything and nissan jazz for some reason even though he loved sharomi krishna he was a good man very devoted and everything for some reason he just would not listen to him and he gets blasted for it we'll get to that whole chapter so ishaan arrived the master was seated still in a spiritual mood after a while he became engaged and talked with ishan it was ishaan's desire to practice the purus charana of the gayatri now taqwa had nothing against the gayatri mantra but he knew this ishan and he knew that he was a little proud of things and everything and somehow he knew that it would be better for him if he did it according to what taku says of the tantra which means something with looking upon god his mother something like that whatever it was this ishan was so stubborn about this why god himself comes before in front of you and tells you what to do or not listen but he's for some reason otherwise he was such a generous wonderful person master to ishaan follow your own intuition i hope there's no more doubt in your mind is there any the path of the vedas is not meant for the kali yuga he's so clear about it the path of tantra is efficacious ishan i've almost resolved to perform an atonement ceremony i'm pretty much saying that i've decided not to listen to you a nice way of putting it but pretty much that's what it means master do you mean to say that one cannot follow the path of tantra that which is brahman is also shakti kali then he sings the song knowing the secret the kali is one with the highest brahman i have discarded once for all both righteousness and sin okay we could stop here so there's a very special day today this is a day when the all of our spiritual practices our prayer and everything especially efficacious this is this is belief of course that many people have that on these very special holy days day that kako was born this is a very good day that we pray for him to pray to him for love and devotion and compassion discrimination and everything on a non-attachment and i pray also for all of us that we may all get a little bit of that okay let us close them i had a nice day i watched a lot of this builder program today really very very inspiring even though you don't see all of the people there that's the sad thing they were allowed to go at different hours but not you know throughout the whole day [Music] is we bow our heads before srama krishna who is stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace
