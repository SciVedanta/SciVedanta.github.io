[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (02/17/23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sSN0a_pos4M)

foreign [Music] your words are like nectar bring life to scored Souls they're praised by Poets and remove all sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving Souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of Sri ramakrishna God bless you we're on the chapter the master and this injured arm and the day it's Sunday March 2nd 1884 and it's page 395. middle of the page Master God Alone is the master and again he is the servant this attitude indicates perfect knowledge now this is a very interesting statement that I don't think he makes this statement in other places I don't remember it exactly but generally this this attitude of Master to the servant involves difference the the servant won't say that you and I are one and the same talk sometimes gives that the other examples that if the master himself says come sit next to me and he himself says you and I were in the same that's okay if the servant does it they'll think he's crazy they'll cut his head off so generally this is a one of the attitude of that involves a dualistic relationship where we think of ourselves as separate but related to God it's a relationship type of thing but not where we feel that we're one with God so with Krishna is saying that these attitudes are dualistic in appearance but the ultimate truth that they lead to will also be that God has become all this both the the master and the servant it's a very interesting statement God Alone is the master and again he is the servant that means that also we who have that attitude as the servant we have that uh that Oneness with with the master but we establish a relationship because we have some sense of I some sense of individuality and personality and that enables us to uh to bridge the gap between the two of us so the interesting statement right alone is the master and again he is the servant this attitude indicates perfect knowledge at first one discriminates not this not this native and feels the God Alone is real and all else is illusory afterwards the same person finds that it is God himself who has become all this the universe Maya and the living beings first negation and then affirmation so this idea that uh we have two categories that which is permanent in that which is changing that which is real that which is unreal that which is the Seer and the scene it's a also a dualistic type of of of thinking we can say in order to help us go beyond that but we start out with that for srama Krishna this idea that uh God Alone is real and everything else is is false is uh for the sake of of spiritual practice sadhana and he doesn't he doesn't say that this is a false idea but it's not a final position for him it's uh it's a stepping stone we can say so he for and for The Path of Knowledge we need to do that we have to distinguish ourselves from everything that is separate from us apparently right so that means if if the very beginning if I say God alone has become all this that God we can't have that attitude but if I say that God alone uh has become this this ego and this mind body and they're all one of the same I can't distinguish between them then I'll always remain falsely identified with this lower self so in order to to get rid of that we have to be able to distinguish these two things see when we when we talk about uh everything uh being one with with God and we talk about the individual cells being one with God the slight distinction there that everything that we see even if we say that it's all Divine we say it's all the manifestation of God it's still changing and it's still impermanent and it still causes bondage and and leads to desires and everything else we still have to be able to distinguish we can't simply say everything is God everyone is God Embrace everyone and enjoy everything that we still uh because the mind is not yet right the mind is still uh clinging to it or all the ways and enjoyments and everything so surami Krishna says that uh this this position is necessary uh as a preliminary position and preliminary means that this are all the way up until really we get to the to the highest position on The Path of Knowledge this is not for the devotee exactly on The Path of Knowledge that we're told we have to make these distinctions between that which is sin and that which is the Seer we have to distinguish between that which is uh constantly changing and that which is unchanging that which is made of parts that which is indivisible all of the distinction that we know But ultimately these will be they use the term sublated in Western philosophy these distinctions will will somehow disappear in the highest stage then we come back down again and then we see the distinction again so surrounding Christian says then we see everything is manifestation or the glory of the Aishwarya of of the Divine mother different ways of of explaining it but uh we shouldn't think that uh Krishna is is somehow negating this idea Abram he's he's accepting that but uh as as the position of the gyani and which leads us to the highest realization but when we come back down again then there's a different stage called vigyana where we see everything it's it's Through The Eyes of Oneness so he talks about this his first negation and then affirmation sometimes he'll use the terminology means you you go you know with the grain with long the way the hairs are and then you you can reverse the process you go up the steps then you come back down the steps when we go start on the on going up the steps we see duality when we come back we also see The Duality but with the different eyes and is it different for us we see everything as Divine this is this is what srama Krishna says is that state of Indiana the the ghani coming back down again they still every see everything is kind of dreamlike but uh we'll we'll not uh feel that same need to to be afraid of the world everything will be something that just can be an objective of of enjoyment somehow as an observer as an observer so this is very important uh important uh teaching that your army Krishna has that he tells us over and over again that uh is you utilizing the very uh important uh idea of a Dwight vedanta that there's a distinction to be made between the The Seer and the scene if we don't make that distinction then the mind will always be mixed up with the world but that distinction is overcome later when we see that what we called Asad unreal also has its own reality because it comes directly from Birmingham somehow and you know this is the way he explains it this is the view held by the puranas now this means that the devotees like this this position we we know he has his his code words when he says the puranas it means this dualistic position and devotional position when he says according to vedanta it means according to the Giannis and according to Edo he himself didn't have any one position that he would argue for the way the philosophers argue for one position this idea of other where we try to establish a philosophical position and we can do it also by defeating all of the opposing positions that wasn't in srama krishna's world view he accepted all these different philosophical positions as spiritual paths so when he says he doesn't simply mean as many faiths it means as many possible spiritual paths all of these schools of eduita they're also then he'll give this example so this is the view held by the Piranhas available fruit for instance includes flesh seeds and shell you get the flesh by discarding the shell and seeds but if you want to know the weight of the fruit you cannot find it if you discard the shell and seeds just so once you detain sachidananda in Brahman God by negating the universe and its living beings but after the attainment of sachidananda one finds that sachetananda itself has become the universe and the living beings it is a one substance that the Flesh and the shell and seeds are made just like butter and buttermilk now there are people this is this is uh it looks like the position of ramanuja this is disqualified non-dualism uh they'll use this type of of illustration that Brahman is qualified by two things one this jagat and the other Jiva so this the outside hard shell of the bill fruit will be like the the universe and the seeds will be like the jivas and the flesh itself will be Brahman so they're they're all one package but seeds are actually individual seeds real individual seeds and the outside is a real shell so this is the position of of ramanuja for srama Krishna uh we will see that uh his understanding of the Jiva again has to do with with the what the attitude that we're taking the the people who was talking to he'll give all different types of of interpretations that the philosopher will say no you have to choose one or the other yeah they'll say no it can be either there's only David's if if they're real and there are many you have to accept that uh if what we call the Jiva is just the sun being reflected in the pots if that's the the sun then there's no reality to the Jiva individual Jiva what happens at Liberation what happens when the water dries up in the pot does that reflected sun does they go and live with the real son it never had any existence of its own it was just a reflection so that'll be uh the right the way down to will accept that type of idea we take the waves on the ocean then uh individual wave is no reality the other than the ocean there's no real separation but a parent separation for a particular point of time they're all different positions most of the arguments uh among the philosophers have to do with what is the nature of the South external world of course is is also there but the real thing is what is the nature of the self and uh one of them that actual main points of difference is what happens in the state of liberation the devotee doesn't want to think in that state of Liberation there's no enjoyment of God now what happens if if we if we take that one drop of water and it goes back into the ocean does it have any separate individuality at that point what do I do without you we'll say no there's no and and if we become one with Brahman Brahman this is nothing to be experienced there it's some type of experience but there's no experiencer to experience the experience it made in that case we have a very hard time distinguishing between the Nirvana of the Buddhist where just the light goes out and this this Ramadan of the of the Dwight very hard to distinguish a very very similar Midway so the uh the devotional schools they don't like this idea of of merging into God at the end they have all different types of mukti all different things where we live in the presence of God we take the the same qualities of God that we enjoy the Bliss of God all of these different types of things are there uh but this uh this becomes one you got me one that's the last one they don't like that one so much they want these different distinctions so what does ramakrishna say about this ego and this individuality sometimes you'll say it's like a stick on water given the appearance of separation sometimes he'll talk about you know uh this distinction that this will like like the ice when it melts then it's gone There's no distinction at all if we if we say no this is his position says that just as the seeds are real and there are many of them there are many different jivas so there'll be people who argue that Rama Krishna was really a follower of ramanuja that he liked this uh I think if it misses the point that he thought that this is a very nice way for a devotee to look upon this relationship between the universe and God and and oneself very helpful and very nice forget about which is the ultimate truth for him there is no ultimate truth other than experience what is the truth of Brahman from it is what Brahman is whatever we say about it is a limitation and and uh short of we can never we can never explain it in words we have to experience it so uh this is why it's very nice when he says it this way that uh this is the view held by the Piranhas you're not saying that this is this is the final truth you have to accept this anything like that other times he'll say let me tell you what the gyani say and it'll give other types of illustrations so you look at the difference between uh weighing the Bell fruit and peeling The Onion huh it's not that we have a hundred onions we peel each one and each one has a little seed inside which is the juva there there's only pure space and there's only one space two different illustrations representing two different philosophical points of view but for ceramic creation the two different ways of of trying to get a handle on this relationship between ourselves and and God in the universe that's all foreign by negating the universe and its living beings that at first but after the attainment of sachidananda one finds that sachidananda itself has become the universe and the living beings it is the one substance that the Flesh and the shell and seeds are made just like butter and buttermilk now uh this whether it's a philosophical position or not this is the experience that shramakrishna had coming back down in in his particular type of state of vignana this is how he saw the universe that everything was one this is a Brahman manifesting Divine mother manifesting as the universe and dwelling with all within all beings as as the Divas he saw that type of of Oneness so this the Bella fruit there's also Oneness but internal distinction the writes and say no no internal distinction at alleness it may be asked how has such Ananda become so hard this Earth does indeed feel very hard to the touch the answer is that blood and semen or thin liquids and yet out of them comes such a big creature as man everything is possible for God first of all reach the indivisible and then coming down look at the universe you will then find that everything is its manifestation Now using the term ID because this is this impersonal from the other times that we can say is everything is a manifestation of divine mother philosophically no difference this is all uh in terms of our sentiment how we like to look at things if we prefer to look at this absolute reality in terms of divine mother then we'll say it's all her manifestation [Music] then sometimes ramification will say oh within everyone this is all women is he talked within Norman Rama that doesn't mean that there are two absolute manifesting in two different ways yes the different way of looking at it it is God alone who has become everything the World by no means exists apart from him now the schools of it the right to wait onto who will really try to give very little philosophical substance to the world uh will we say that the the snake uh and and the robe that the snake comes from the rope that the candidates with apart from the Rope no because there's no snake they won't even bother with within any of that so there's different ways of looking at it all elements finally merge in the Akasha now uh we're gonna get uh one of the few times that sharami Krishna really gives us some sankya philosophy it's very interesting again at the time of creation Akasha evolves into mahat now generally this this word Akasha will be we're talking about now prakriti within nature and everything Akasha here uh really means that primordial matter we can see so I'm just talking about Prana and Akasha matter and energy so it's more or less the same thing in this way the whole world says oh sorry at the time of creation Akasha evolves into mahat so not Akashi has the element because that comes later uh into mahat and mahat into a hankara in this way the whole world system is evolved so he went from really this qualified non-dualism to sankya to explain all of this it is the process of involution and evolution now what this means is that uh when this this universe goes into that state of dissolution into a potential form it everything that was in it gets involved in seed form this is the whole banyan tree is involved in the little seed of the banana tree so that can turn into a a big tree again yeah it is the process of involution and evolution a devotee of God accepts everything he accepts the universe and its created beings as well as the indivisible sachidananda so we can do this we can say yes everything is divine at the same time we have to know that this external universe is not going to satisfy us even then there's something that is a hollow about it foreign that it's something that's transitory it's something changing it's something that doesn't have any real substance to it as as a world of enjoyment if we see it in manifestation of God that's a different thing but uh we shouldn't we shouldn't think that okay now we have free license to do whatever we want Embrace everyone equally and every no we still have to use our discrimination God dwells within all beings we keep a distance from from some people we don't embrace the tiger doctor says huh foreign utilizing knowledge so the the other schools of vedanta they're devotional schools but they utilize this this type of reasoning now he says what the Yogi's path is different in in yoga is not as important to uh to focus on all of these different uh philosophical Concepts as it is to clear the mind to make the Mind perfectly still and quiet and and have that uh merging into that higher type of reality so he's going to make a distinction here but the yogis path is different he does not come back after reaching the paramatman the Supreme Soul he becomes United with it now this was the the one question when I first reading the gospel I went around asking everybody all the big swappies I always was very curious about this idea that if one detains nearby then one gives off the body in 21 days how exactly does that work that were about proud of the karma and uh is this for everybody can one realize god without nearby samati uh their lower Tides can one come back down this one is all these different types of questions huh and many people I think uh this is a an issue do we really want to strive for something that means that we'll go into the state of samadhi and we'll never come back down again and the body will fall off in 21 days but if if if we follow this then we know that those who will realize God through this path of of yoga Raja yoga will be very very tiny tiny percentage of those spiritual aspirants that most of us are following a devotional path and Tucker always talks about God realization so we have to have some faith that God realization doesn't mean we're going to give up the body in 21 days that now he's saying and he doesn't again he doesn't make this distinction all the time that is just for the yogi usually he'll just say one in that Stadium they recall the samadhi then one can bring the Mind back down again at other times he says that for ordinary person and there's another ordinary person a very highly evolved spiritual the Seeker that who attains that state of nearby they can't maintain it because they'll have a little Karma lift they'll have some little desire and that'll pull the Mind back down again so this really means that Yogi who was finished with all of his karma all the desires are gone I can attain that state where whether the body is there or not doesn't make any difference and then the body will fold it it means this is the way they leave this world through this this type of nearby and the rare souls are the ones who can really fully get merged in nearby samadhi and come back again that's what gerama Krishna says is is the uh restricted to the avataras is these very special souls and even then it's not that they have the power to do it because the eye is gone at that time that talk which point of view the will of the Divine mother that brings it back down or or maybe they also keep a little desire to serve the world to help others something like that so the mind could come back down again but there's no active will they can bring the Mind back down from nearby samati because there's no I at that point it's gone so this is for the yogis path is different then he says the partial knower limits God to one object only he thinks that God cannot exist in anything beyond that then there are three classes of devotees the lowest one says God is up there so this probably that's ramakrishna was familiar with Christian attitude that people praying and looking up and this idea of heaven and everything like that huh God is up there that is he points to heaven the mediocre devotee says that God dwells in the heart as the inner controller okay now we won't say mediocre there's also very high state but this is not quite reaching the level of the vignani which we'll get to after that but the highest devotee says God alone has become everything now we can we can have both we can we can say God alone has become everything and also God dwells within the heart as the as the Anthony we can we can maintain both views there's no uh problem with with that but uh this means that uh any hint of Duality is gone the only Oneness one sees the Divinity everywhere this can't be explained I don't I think this has to be experienced the house ramakrishna saw everything is chinmaya everything is the embodiment of pure Consciousness we're told over and over again Consciousness is the subject never the object so this chin Maya stayed or the the vision is is something unusual that uh really has to be seen when the Mind ascends to a very high mystical state it is not something that can easily be understood how this Consciousness manifests itself is well this something like this can we really say that yes I see this is China if we want to say that this is a whole thing is a dream that we have some understanding like that but takur also didn't restrict it to that idea to look upon everything as a dream but this was his experience so we we accept it we accept that as this is is it something that can be experienced in the highest state even Narendra uh didn't accept that for a long time he'll mention that uh all that we perceive as so many forms of God Narendra used to make fun of me and say yes God has become old then a part is God a cup is God laughter that he and hazra would sit outside and make fun of fisherama Krishna you know that whole story from one to try me to read that to him and had all of these ideas in it then talk with casually said oh what are you talking about and simply touched him and everything changed and for several days he was in a different state of mind completely he didn't know what's real what's not real he would bang his head against the railing he didn't know how much to eat not to eat nothing like that and then he said afterwards mine came down he said then I feel I had some glimpse of that state that the riches had attained when they made these statements a very nice experience stalker could give that experience not just that he had it he could he could give it to those who could handle it and not to anybody and everybody all doubts disappear when one sees God this is of course now we're trying to develop some conviction about these things through reasoning through logic through faith but these final doubts will go when we have that experience then all doubts are removed all the knots are untied Karma's all burned it is one thing to hear of God but quite a different thing to see him a man could not have one hundred percent conviction through a mere hearing but if he beholds God face to face then he is wholly convinced formal worship drops away after the vision of God actually uh even before division this ramakrishna says that uh all this all the formalities they start become less and less and less and less until we have that final experience but uh in in in his case uh he continued as priest of the the Kali Temple somehow and doing things in a very unorthodox type of way until he had that realization and after that vision of Kali then he couldn't perform the worship after that I think he got did he get ramlal to do it after that uh and he has something like that I work I used to worship the deity in the Kali Temple it was suddenly revealed to me that everything is pure Spirit the utensils of worship the altar this is the altar the door frame All Pure spirit men animals and other living things all pure Spirit than like a madman I began to shower flowers in all directions whatever I saw I worshiped so we know about that Ultimate Experience that shurama Krishna had when he was ready to cut his throat all of that but even before that he would have these these different types of visions and experiences there's so many different things how he saw the Divine mother and the cat who came to eat the the offerings and everything and so it wasn't just that on the way to that really all-encompassing experiences of divine mother he had so many other little types of experiences one day while worshiping Shiva I was about to offer a bell leaf on the head of the image when it was revealed to me that this read art this universe itself is Shiva after that my worship of Shiva through the image came to an end another day I had been plucking flowers when it was revealed to me that the flowering plants were so many bouquets now we shouldn't stop plucking flowers for offering this is ramakrishna we don't have to go that far but I thought because shivarachi is coming up huh I thought I would tell the very interesting experience that I had it's not it's not a spiritual experience it was just a little you know the light bulb that went off uh this was in 1979 and I I went on pilgrimage this kid or not and one of the places where you stop is and there's a series of like seven steps you go way down to get to the to the ganga and you're supposed to take a bath there a very auspicious thing and then the next day you continue your journey to to kid or not so I was traveling with uh I was not yet a monk I was drowning with two two of the monks of the order at that time and they were load shedding so it was very dark we could hardly make our way down you know the steps and everything we got down there and uh looking straight out straight out there was one very high peak and snow covered and the crescent moon was it just happened to be the time of the month of the Christian Moon and it was just at the crest of of the of the mountain exactly yes there and you see the white snow and you see the Ganges you see flowing down and everything and then it struck me that this is Shiva this is this this is where how that image of Shiva comes that this that the ashes on his body or the snow of the Himalayas that he is the mountain the somehow it was a really it wasn't a spiritual experience don't don't get me wrong I didn't go into somebody or anything like that but but I found it so interesting that ah this is what the rishis must have seen and how they identify Shiva with with the Himalayas itself and this Virat this idea so it was really a very wonderful thing yes yes that time of month when when the moon was just under Crescent and just touching just the right time of day also or night you could say it was like eight o'clock at night when it came it was a wonderful wonderful experience and we all bathe in the ganga and that night next morning we woke up with with practically pneumonia it was it was so freezing cold and at night we all we slept in one room there must have been 20 other people there and full of bed bugs so as we hardly slept the whole night and then the next day to the long walk we had heavy backpacks and everything but it was a fantastic experience yeah really after that looking at the skater not mountain when you when you uh you don't see it the whole time you're going and then you walk around one the one little passing everything you learn and you see it straight up like that that's really fantastic uh [Music] songwriter for the ramu samaji was there at that time ah how beautiful is God's creation Master oh no it is not dead it was revealed to me in the flesh I didn't calculate about it it was shown to me that each plant was a bouquet adorning the universal form of God this idea Virat that this whole universe is God is the body of God if we want to look at it that way God dwelling within this this in this universe this idea of this Buddha with the sun and the moon of his two eyes there's a very poetic type of idea but to see all of this if we see that then the flowers are already resting on the the Lord we can say no need to pick it and put it anywhere else that was the end of my plucking flowers I look on man in just the same way when I see a man I see that it is God himself who walks on Earth this is microcosm macrocosm the the whole universe is the body of God and each individual body is also the the vehicle in which God dwells when I see a man I see that it is God himself Who Walks On Earth as it were rocking to and fro like a pillow floating on the waves the pillow moves with the waves it Bobs up and down the body has indeed only a momentary existence God Alone is real now this is that other that other way of looking at it now we just saw everything is real but God Alone is real in a different way the permanent absolute reality that is our real nature everything else is trans transitory changing uh nothing that we can really get a hold of in distance but just object of experience we don't know it is anything more than an object of experience we don't know what it really is in itself anything like that this as it appears to us now the body exists and now it does not years ago when I'd been suffering terribly from indigestion Fredo I said to me do ask the mother to cure you I felt ashamed to speak to her about my illness I said to her mother I saw a skeleton in the Asiatic Society Museum it was pieced together with wires into a human form oh mother please keep my body together a little like that so that I may sing thy name and glories it's interesting that they took him to the Asiatic Society this is like we see with uh dinosaurs and things like that don't have the bones and they'll try to put it together with wire and everything thank you why this desire to live now this is another interesting question those who know God Alone is real that's their real nature when the body falls they'll be United with God then what's what's the point is remaining uh with all of the suffering of the body and all of the inconveniences of Life what's what's the why do we have such a strong desire so he says why this desire to live after a ravana's death Rama and lakshmana entered his capital and saw nicocha his old mother running away was surprised at this and saidurama all her children are dead but still life attracts her so much to his side and said don't be afraid why are you running away she replied Rama it was not fear that made me flee from you I've been able to see all these wondrous actions of yours simply because I am alive I shall see many more things like these if I continue to live hence I desire to live now for us the desire to live is attachment the attachment it's uh no conviction that there's anything better than this life we don't know anything else uh is because of Maya basically this is a different thing this is for the god realized Soul then they get to enjoy this Divine Play somehow we had one Swami he was the founder of the Chicago Center and I remember there was a a small biography that was written it was never published for uh regular consumption it was just some somehow among these close devotees I managed to get a copy so somebody gave it to me and I remember he made a great statement he said I don't know why Everyone is always saying let me get out of life let me get out of a man not be born again and everything he said uh to see everything is this place of God to be able to serve takur this lifetime there's a great joy why should we not wanted to do that Life After Life it's unusual this is not the standard way of looking at things but I appreciated it very much what and what a great state to be in where one really gets straightened joy out of being able to serve to live life as service and following a very high ideal thank you swamiji how much muhammadi suffered in life and how he could say may I be born again and again and suffer yeah so many miseries and he has to help a single person to worship God dwelling in all beings and he was also happy when his play was done yeah yeah because he had a sense of mission also swamiji is a little bit different from from the other people it's not just my players down but my work is what I've what I was born to do has been done I've accomplished that he wrote so many times I feel that I've set the machine in motion the the Machinery in motion he used that language when he had set up the ramakrishna order and the talk was work would continue that he wasn't necessary and he was dead he wanted to just give up everything really his play was done the very beautiful uh attitude that he had he didn't want to be ever be president of the order take any active part that way he really wanted to just really live on his own or live with his mother at the very end he had some desire like that also so yeah he was willing to be born again and again but then he was so happy to get that refined over spite because he failed he'll go back to srama Krishna they had that faith that Faith also like one of those or something like that yeah they switched they switched uh the division that you ramakrishna had but I don't take this so so literally also he says he's the sage not a even that I don't take so literally for me uh there's another means the embodiment of humanity there's God dwelling in the Transcendent form of God dwelling as man and that's why would you represented that it's the highest form of God dwelling as man I I that's my own way of looking at it otherwise NADA is not one of the seven rishis it's hard to square all of the different visions that surama Krishna had he also saw swamiji Yeshiva now these are all different uh yes different ways of showing the greatness of swamiji there'll be others who will take it very literally and there's nothing wrong with it but I think Swami was greater than any of the seven rishis I don't want to restrict him to that even but yes yeah we have this idea of course what is that he had come from from yeah see the seven rishis this is also a constellation this is the Big Dipper that some some idea then talk where had that idea that he traveled well far out into some outer realm and they were all there and everything so this is in that in that mood of God realization things get mixed up all these quranic ideas and other things they'll come into the Mind whatever spiritual attitude one has they'll come in the mind these high high realizations will be colored by cultural things and all sorts of things like that I I don't think that we have to get into big arguments is it literally true which of the seven uh which is Wuzzy some people will even go through that huh brigo okay but in six of seven uh and they're and they're that's also true that there's not just one list of seven of the subtarshi uh there are some that are in common and then there's some that are that are different yeah so anyhow we don't have to bother about these things too much we just know that he was a great Soul who came with a with a very great responsibility and burden and Mission that uh he had to come with Krishna in order to carry his message throughout the world that was his mission and once he had done it he knew that he had finished what he had to do and the whole vision of things changed also then mother revealed herself and my child that you do it you don't do anything ever I've been doing it all along everything changed after that he also had his different stages huh then after that every mother mother well my patriotism is gone a very beautiful statement that he made yeah now it's only mother before no more very nice but he had that experience thank you without desires the body cannot live that means we don't live that if we have no desires at all and what's keeping the mind in its in this ordinary form it'll go right up without desires the body cannot live smiling I had one or two desires I prayed to the mother oh mother gives me the company of those who have renounced lust and gold I said further I should like to enjoy this Society of the Giannis and bhaktas the eve sometimes we think that he these ghanis they grow dry and everything he didn't care for them that's to some extreme type otherwise he loved everybody son I should like to enjoy the Society of like Yanni's so give me a little strength and I may walk hither and thither and visit those people but she did not give me the strength to walk yeah he would have to go by palanquin often when he went to these pilgrimage places smiling of all the desire has been fulfilled Master Smiley no there are still a few left all left the body is really impermanent when my arm was broken I said to the mother mother it hurts me very much at once she revealed to me a carriage and its driver here and there a few screws were loose the carriage moved as the driver directed it had no power of its own yeah many of the these God realized souls and direct disciples they had it in a completely different relationship with the body because I remember Swami veer janandi he was what sixth seventh sixth president of the order anyhow he was swamiji's disciple holy mother's disciple holy mother gave this one to addiction so he used to say or takor why do you keep beating this broken drum his body it was breaking down his house was very bad but Tucker wanted to keep using it he was president of the order he had to keep giving initiation and everything huh so as if it's just his own some something separate from him this is like we have a little drum the instrument or something himself told Mother during this last illness how long will you keep beating this uh it may be a Bengali expression also something I don't know yeah if it wasn't just the direct disciples even those who came afterwards there were some really just powerhouses he was it was one of the Swami version why then do I take care of the body it is to enjoy God to sing his name and glories and to go about visiting his Giannis and bhaktas now he's eliminating he's not telling us one thing that is for the sake of mankind that he also had this incentive it was mission he didn't like to think of it that way he never liked to think of himself or a spiritual teacher or anything like that but he knew he knew that uh he came to Earth for it for a reason that it wasn't just for his own enjoyment huh that uh not just it didn't come just to eat Russell goldless Narendra was sitting on the floor in front of the master yeah so when he was teasing about Narendra making fun of me and everything Narendra was there he was doing it to tease it Master to triloki and the other devotees the joys and Sorrows of the body are inevitable look at Narendra his father is dead so this is just shortly after his father's passing away this is let's see 84. March 84. the father passed away sometime maybe within a few months earlier something like that his father is dead and his people have been put to extreme suffering he can't find any way out of it God places one sometimes in happiness and sometimes in misery no are we getting any explanation is it one's karma is it for some special hidden purpose or anything sometimes the talker doesn't give us any explanation okay revered sir God will be gracious to Narendra Master with the smile but when it is true that no one Stars at the Temple of Annapurna in benarus but some must wait for food till evening this is the example that tapu gave that everyone will get God realization some earlier some later depends what place in line we have in how anxious we are for it so yeah here he sees it annoyed with the Divine mother for allowing his Narendra to have to suffer so much once Fred I asked shambhu Malik for some money he was living at the temple he got a certain monthly fee and everything it wasn't like he was a beggar on the street and otherwise asking for money maybe you sent back home or something shambhu Malik was a wealthy man and he had one freedom of my life for some money shampoo held the view of English men on such matters that means western educated people from the British Taco knew that word Englishman he actually used it he said why should I give you money you can earn your livelihood by working even now you are earning something the case of a very poor person is different the purpose of Charity is fulfilled if one gives money to the blind or the lame I said sir please don't say that I don't need your money May God help me not to become blind or deaf or extremely poor I don't want you to give and I don't want to receive the master spoke as if peaked because God had not yet shown his kindness to Narendra now and then he cast in affectionate glance at his beloved disciple yeah he was really concerned that taqur he used to he used to tell the devotees when they would come he would say you say look at the condition that he's in and everything can you not do something to help them either help him find a job or find and do something for him and then narender will get very upset he was like how how can you talk about these things in front of anybody and everybody like that so one day he said to him don't you know for your sake I could vague from door to door huh how he looked narender I'm now studying the views of the atheists yeah it's it's interesting that uh charm is his mother was a great such a great devotee and swamiji had so much reverence for his mother practically because it worshiped his mother and it was because of his uh being raised by his mother that he had this the spiritual religious you know upbringing that he that he had and everything and uh after all this happened and one day she she heard him praying doing his prayers and everything and I don't know why for some reason she said all your life you've been praying to God who was there listening and doing anything for us this is just one time that she must have been so you know sad and everything and depressed and uh but anyhow so the word got out that traumaji was an atheist it simply means that he all of them actually later we see it kashipur many of them they were studying views of the Buddhists which were kind of non-theistic something like that and true advocacy said that's fine people go through different stages like that there's nothing wrong with it but all these rumors started spreading that he doesn't believe in anything anymore the talker said don't say these things in front of me I'll never believe them about my nut in so I said I'm now studying the views of the atheists Master there are two doctrines the existence and the non-existence of God why don't you accept the first very simple not just like a child would say Surendra God is just he must look after his devotees so this is what surabhi Krishna is saying yeah we can say that but look what what's happening doesn't appear that way all the time we don't know the karma behind it some hidden purpose but anyhow doesn't appear that way all the time master it is said in the scriptures that only those who have been charitable in their former births get money in this life now we're saying it to surrender surrender was one of those there were several of them like him that were very miserly and charitable that they didn't like to give money away very easily but they gave it away he gave a lot of money but uh with a little bit a little bit of him on about his money a little not proud exactly but uh he said the srama Krishna wants some people can give money easily some people are hard for them people don't understand they don't understand my attitude everything but he was so helpful for the Veronica Martin and other things they've been very generous person it is said in the scriptures that only those who have been charitable in their former births get money in this life but to tell you the truth this world is God's Maya and there are many confusing things in this realm of Maya one cannot comprehend them we have such a desire to explain everything either Karma or God into God's will with the hidden purpose that everything had some purpose behind it maybe maybe not this Maya we don't know so we make the best of it we try to make sense out of things but they're very interesting there are many confusing things in this realm of Maya one cannot comprehend them the ways of God are inscrutable indeed bhishma lay on his bed of arrows the pandava brothers visited him in krsna's company presently mahishma burst into tears the fond of it said to Krishna Krishna how amazing this is our grand sire mishma is one of the eight of us another man is wise as him is not to be found yet even he is bewildered by Maya and weeps at death but said Krishna bhishma isn't weeping on that account you may ask about it see bewildered by Maya doesn't mean it is glory of God it means some some attachment has come they're thinking that way being on that account you may ask him about it when he asked bhishma when he asked him said oh Krishna I am unable to understand anything of the ways of God God himself is the constant companion of the pandavas and still they have no end of trouble that is why I weep when I reflect on this I realize that one cannot understand anything of God's ways God has revealed to me that only the paramatman Whom The Vedas described as the pure soul is as immutable as Mount as mount sumeru unattached and Beyond pain and pleasure there is much confusion in this world of his Maya one can by no means say that this will come after that or this will produce that okay let's stop here we have a little more on this day but we can do this next time um [Music] we bow our heads before shramakrishna who is stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees and who is an embodiment of the Divine and the Supreme Lord and ever worthy of our worship peace peace peace Beyond we wish everyone a very happy shivratri that will have uh the short Puja normally it goes through the whole night four different worships we can press everything into one it'll start around 7 30 and everyone will have a chance to to pour milk on the Shiva lingam at the end and then have Prasad so everyone is welcome to come all right Kumar and I have unfortunately will have to be out of town but the others will be here Swami Brahma Swami password tomorrow night
