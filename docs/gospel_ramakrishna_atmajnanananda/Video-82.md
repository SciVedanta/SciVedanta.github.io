[The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna read by Swami Atmajnanananda (12/10/21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZLbzAhFGHI)

[Music] your words are like nectar bringing life to squirt souls they are praised by poets and removal sin they are auspicious to hear wonderful and exalted those who spread these words throughout the world are truly giving souls welcome everyone to our class on the gospel of swami krishna we are on the chapter the master and m this is page 281 and it is friday september 7th 1883. were talking in the master's room at half past seven in the evening that no one else was present master the other day i went to calcutta as i drove along the streets in the carriage i observed that everyone's attention was fixed on low things everyone was brooding over his stomach and running after nothing but food everyone's mind was turned to lust and greed of course tucker says woman in gold lust and greed i saw only one or two with their attention fixed on higher things with their minds turned to god takur's relationship with the people of kolkata is something very interesting that he's always saying oh you calcutta people because they epitomized to him materialism and and the modern world and and british influence and all sorts of things but he had some deep affection for the people of kolkata and this especially he said the holy mother when that after he passed away he wanted her to live in kamarpukur but at the same time he wanted her to look after the all of the devotees and to have compassion again on the people of kolkata don't you see them suffering you know living like like worms or something like that yeah can you do something to lift uplift them so we had great affection and he liked to tease them but he had great affection for the people of calcutta it was such a new experience for him he was just a village boy really just a young teenager still and uh when he went to calcutta for the first time with his elder brother and uh he had never seen these things before it was a whole different world for him when he got there but some somehow uh these all of these very close close disciples and devotees from the calcutta they just took to him and he and he he just he was so comfortable he liked to go into calcutta he had so many trips there that he went there and to stay in the devotees homes there and everything so his relationship with the people of kolkata is very interesting m the present age has aggravated the stomach worry trying to imitate the english people have turned their attention to more luxuries therefore their wants have also increased yeah this is the problem when the more things are available and people make more money they want to buy more things and they have to work harder and longer hours and this is this is what happens uh in every every generation i remember in the 50s when they talk about all these energy-saving devices that dishwashers and washing machines and everything and what will people do with so much spare time they're talking about not having five-day work for we'll only need four-day work weeks and then it turned out that people had to work more to afford all of these things so everything kind of backfired and now look at how you have to have two people in the same family working 60 hours a week sometimes just to make ends meet master what do the english sorry what did the english think about god cockroach was always curious about these things he uh he understood that the english meant those who were in india but he also knew about the country of england and that kesha had gone to england and met the queen and all of that m they believe in a formless god master that is also one of our beliefs for a time the master and disciple remained silent then srama krishna began to describe his experiences of brahman takara actually had some contact with the british we we know the cook huh that uh what was his first name no i remember anyhow uh with uh on this the steam ship that was one of the early steamship trick the trips that he took with the brahmos and everything and uh of course the photographer who came and took his picture and and a few other holy mother had much more contact with the western western people not as much british americans british cinema americans both so then ceramic christian began to describe his experience in brahmin master one day i had the vision of consciousness non-dual and indivisible now how does one have division of consciousness non-dual individual consciousness it's not possible so when taka says this he doesn't mean it in the way in any literal type of sense he means that some he had some type of vision which awakened this idea of the of the infinite absolute reality when we remember the vision that he had of swamiji that somehow the mind soared to a distant realm beyond uh name and form where everything was just the infinite absolute pure consciousness and he sees the seven sages sitting there in lost and meditation and swamiji is one of them so how is that possible this is the realm of the infinite absolute reality it means those whose minds are merged in the infinite so he can have these visions uh it'll be uh not of of gods and goddesses but that infinite absolute reality taking some type of visible form for him so it is not his mistake it's not a contradiction or anything this is what he means when he says that a vision of consciousness non-dual and indivisible because for him right this uh saguan and nerguda brahman are the same so this infinite absolute consciousness is that same reality that will appear in different forms also that was a different type of experience when swamiji had this his adwaitic experience at the touch of swami krishna then with eyes open he saw everything first everything disappeared then with eyes open this is this is really some type of in some ecstatic state some type of vision that but somehow for him he's understanding it in terms of near going to brahman that's all that it means so at first it had been revealed to me that there were innumerable men animals and other creatures among them there were aristocrats the english the muslim ones myself scavengers dogs and also a bearded muslim man with an earthenware tray of rice in his hand so these are all this will be that's hamati state and in that state he feels that everything is is consciousness even with eyes open he felt that everything he was seeing nothing but consciousness is this a massive congealed consciousness he saw the world that way he put a few grains of rice into everybody's mouth i too tasted a little so this is also a way of showing that he was beyond all possible cast distinctions and a lot of these these types of experiences i'll read the next one first they'll go back to wisconsin exact in the days another day i saw rice vegetables and other food stuff and filth and dirt as well lying around suddenly the soul came out of my body and like a flame touched everything it was like a protruding tongue of fire and tasted everything once even the excreta it was revealed to me that all these are one substance the non-dual and indivisible consciousness so when he says the vision of pure consciousness that means that he's seeing that everything is nothing but that manifestation some tangible manifestation of that pure consciousness now he's having this vision but when he did his tantrex under the the guidance of the brahmady vaidhavi brahmani he had to do some of these things that uh in order to get rid of this idea of of to two things attachment and aversion rag of the waste and everything he had to put touch his tongue to different even the jackal feces and things like all sorts of things he had to do yeah because what is it that's three gunas this is three gunas it's just in our mind this aversion and some some some sensation goes to the mind that's telling to the brain of mind it tells us that this is this is uh tastes bad it's a bad it's just it's all in the mind it's all our reaction this is this is the purpose of that and to learn to make no distinction that way just to say that the divine and the pure and impure alike so we had to practice all of these things so the fact that he practiced then probably resulted in different types of visions that his visions are a combination of imagination and memory this is this is what uh with all of us our dreams our daydreams everything the part of the imagination but based on past experiences another day it was revealed to me and there's a footnote this happened before any of the masters intimate disciples came to him that means the the future monastic disciples mostly another day it was revealed to me that i had devotees my intimate companions my very own therefore i would climb to the roof of the kuti as soon as the bells and the conch shells of the evening service sounded in the temples and cry out with a longing heart oh where are you all come here i am dying to see you and he very he he refers to this other times and he says after that one by one you all started coming so who were the first to come a lot to maraj maybe yeah no i don't think he was one of the first it was one of the early ones uh swamiji was uh swami brahmananda before swamiji swami ramana and then swamiji then this was in uh 1881 and 1882 many more came 83 84. well we we saw the other day the first one who actually saw him we saw in viggiano he was seven years old at the time he had come to the house of a neighbor or something and and there's a little boy he saw him there emma also thought that he saw him you know that story yeah that uh first of all tucker asked him one day do you remember the great storm of uh of auschwing of the month of auschwitz and m thought yes why did he ask me that that time i was so scared i was praying for some so there's one time he felt that he knew that then he said another time that he went somewhere he'd been separated from his mother and was was crying where is my mother and some man came a very sweet kind man and came and took him to his mother and later he was convinced that musrama krishna 2m well what do you think of these visions em god sports through you see these visions these are something that come along with the mystic mindset these are not necessarily that every god realized soul will have these types of visions he had he was a mystic he had some some line of communications and and and he had a tremendous uh imagination and uh just power to to progress subtle things so he had so many different types of visions we don't find holy mother having all of these types of visions she would have had some of course many were of sriramika and she wasn't the type to talk about them very much but also just part of our nature they were all different well holy mother taco all the direct disciples but he he was just prone to have these types of experiences mystical experiences that means that we can't explain them very well even how how divine mother would speak to him how to explain it he makes it sound like a simple thing that you can you can see god you can talk to god as if each and every one of us could do it and the vigne after coming down that then he speaks to god so this was uh this was something very special about the srirami krishna this this ability to have all these different types of visions and insights and experiences and god sports through through you this i've realized that you are the instrument and god is the master god has created other beings as if with a machine but yourself with his own hands master well hazrat says that after the vision of god one acquires the six divine powers now we've made a hazrat before we know that he was one of the characters in this play he he was to thicken the plot tucker used to say just someone who was there to just add to the to the color of the drama somehow to make the play a little more interesting we had ridoid who was a little bit more than interesting he was actually uh a little uh especially when it came to whole the holy mother a little bit cruel and we talk where with the hazra he was a little bit harmless but would go back and forth sometimes he would have great respect for takur sometimes he would belittle him and sometimes he would think that he's too attached all sorts of things and taco was very interesting that somehow uh he was so guileless that uh almost anything that people said to him uh would could raise him down on his mind so sometimes people would say things and then later he'd say why did you say that to me because of you i had this vision and that vision and i went to the divine mother she said no that what i said is true uh so it it was part of his childlike nature that what other people said uh he took a little seriously well hazrat says that after the vision of god one acquires the six divine powers m those who seek pure love don't want powers master perhaps hazrat was a poor man in his previous life and that is why he wants so much to see the manifestation of power now takur is the one who had such insight into what people were in their previous life what their some scholars were and everything so it's curious that he's just kind of guessing here surmising perhaps he wants to know what i talk about with the cook he says to me you don't have to talk to the cook i shall talk to the manager of the temple myself and see that you get everything you want and laughs aloud he talks to me that way and i say nothing yeah this was the other thing that takur could really be a little bit intimidated by people uridore we know terribly horribly intimidated by him so much so that when he insulted holy mother and and they they left takoya didn't say anything we wonder how is it possible and then we realized that uh how the taqwa says that kriday tormented him tortured him to the point where he was ready to to take his life to go into the ganga and take his life so uh he could be he he had these human qualities he always talked about the avatar having having human qualities and that was one of them that he took seriously what people said and could be intimidated by very strong people that's why he always said yeah these people come to salute them from a distance there was one sadhu who came he was he called me given to anger and he came and taku stood the whole time with folded hands and afterwards they said oh you show so much reverence to the satu and he left and he said yes we have to we have to do that to uh to a drunkard huh also if they come say yes how are you uncle please come have a smoke otherwise who knows they'll get angry or do something m many a time you have said that a devotee who loves god for the sake of love does not care to see god's powers a true devotee wants to see god as gopala the baby krishna bereft of all divine powers yeah taka used to say that that in the beginning one has the vision of the divine mother with ten arms then after that six arms and then the forearm kali and then two arms krishnan has regular form and then baby gopala each time it's more intimate each time there's a less of a show of that aishwarya and more of this madhuri the sweetness so this is kind of a progression the way he understands it or explains it in the beginning god becomes the magnet and the devotee of the needle but in the end the devotee himself becomes the magnet and god the needle that is to say god becomes small to his liberty so not small and significant small but accessible like a child and and that relationship becomes very sweet and intimate master yes it is just like the sun at dawn you can easily look at that sun it doesn't dazzle the eyes rather it satisfies them god becomes tender for the sake of his devotees he appears before them setting aside his powers so this is again he always explains things from the subjective side and the objective side so here this is from the objective side that the lord himself is setting aside his powers revealing himself that way other times he'll say uh this is this is the devotional power that the deputy has allowing him to see god in that form it's it's a play between the objective and subjective we and everyone will explain it differently those who are very very devotional and more dualistic and take things very in a very literal type of way will take the objective side that yes god actually is revealing himself god comes to me in that form like krishna said he said to krishna now take your rama form hanuman's coming he wants to see you in that form so he actually transforms himself the more the gani type they'll take the subjective side that yes that this blocks of ice are forming in that particular form because my desire to see god in that form that's why it's taking that form shakti that power cooling power that dwells within me which is true god knows there's some combination both remain silent for some time m why should your visions not be real now that was the question that tucker asked me about these visions if they are unreal then the world is still more unreal for there is only one mind that is the instrument of perception your pure mind sees those visions and our ordinary minds see worldly objects we can question the reality of visions but we can question the reality of objects that we see we only know them as they appear in the mind there's no guarantee that this isn't a dream we wake up from the dream and and realize no there were no chairs uh inside of my head it was it was just a dream there's no way of of proving the objective reality of anything so when we have the vision uh it is less of a chance unless it's a real hallucination or delusion or something like that but it's it's not based on any external object coming through the senses it'll be something coming from from within your pure mind sees those visions and our ordinary minds see worldly objects master i see that you have grasped the idea of unreality well tell me what you think of hazrat somehow he's interested in hazrat m oh i don't know he doesn't want to say too much he doesn't want to criticize him because uh that's not his place and he's not that type of person he doesn't want to say something nice about him if it's not true and he doesn't believe it so he doesn't he gives a kind of a vague type of answer master well do you find me to be like anybody else now very often taco will ask this question and this we may think that there's a slight bit of ego here why does he care what other people think about does he want praise from other people we may be tempted to think like that but this was his way of of gauging to what extent the devotee had deeper insight he didn't care what people praised him or people disregarded it it wasn't like that he wanted us to see uh how how far m had come in his ability to to appreciate that pure spirituality that taku had well do you find me to be like anybody else am no sir master like any other para mahamsa para mahamsa this is considered to be the highest type of of sanyasi and god really so the part of mohammed says sometimes it's taken to be a an actual sampradaya some sect that uh will will represent those who don't care for any outer show there will be a little bit like abu dhud that they may not wear a negara cloth or anything like that they don't care for any of these things they're beyond all of that but in general apartheid there's also a title that's given that uh to show reverence for those who have the highest type of god realization is it coming from that inspiration exploration that they say yeah there's something called this mantra yeah this is just a play on words it's a play in words that hamsa if you repeat it it says it's but if the next word is again it becomes hum so so hum so um it becomes soham so they call it like gita becomes taggy so the it just that's not why that this we have it can be a duck or a goose or a swan is a swan there's the one of the reasons is that the swan is supposed to be able to take milk and separate it into curds and whey into the solid portion and the watery portion and they just take the solid that means they have this power to separate the real from the unreal and only take the real this is one of the reasons that they do it but i'm saying yeah i had to stand for the soul somehow i read a very unusual thing today i'll mention it just for fun it is this uh suriti this these conversations with swami permission on the g and he came up with this with the most interesting explanation that how is this possible and he said that that there's a certain type of lotus within the stem the water is very milky and that this is what the home says is really drinking from that and it appears as if it separated the milk from the i don't know it's not supposed to be taken as some real thing the point is that uh can separate the real from the unreal the eternal from the transitory and can accept only the the real and leave everything else be behind takur once met at the sadhu you remember it uh iran's place congregacy and he became very very fond of him and he actually invited him ron brought him to dr chenishwar one time and he asked him do you belong to any particular son pradaya and he said people call me parmahamsa so it's also one i don't know how they trace it back or anything but it's it's one category you could say so when when tucker says like any other paramsah it means like any other sannyasi who has achieved a very high spiritual state they don't yeah they don't have to they can't or they don't or it doesn't make any difference for them so taco never worked guerrilla cloth he didn't care about any of these things holy mother never never wore anything like that and uh the fact that he would wear he wore slippers yeah saudis don't do that huh even sleeping on a bed even having a trimmed beard huh and getting haircuts things like that yeah so i just don't usually do those things in india m no sir you can't be compared to anybody else master smiling have you heard of a tree called the achina em no sir there is a tree called by that name but nobody knows what it is literally it means that which can't be recognized and swami putin talks about this a little bit that we know that it's a tree we know that much about it we see something we see it has it has bark it has a trunk it has branches it has leaves and everything but we can't recognize what particular tree it is it's something that we've never seen before so this is what takur is saying that this is like the the avatar that they're unique we we won't recognize them we'll recognize them in general that we'll hear someone looking like a human being but we try to say well where do they come from what exactly what is their status genus all of this we won't be able to it's something unrecognizable so we recognize that it's unrecognizable we say takur this is somebody that we we know this is a spiritual giant whether we say avatar or not doesn't matter but spiritual giant who's unique in in his spiritual experiences and his ability to transmit spirituality and everything else we recognize that he's come as a human being two arms two legs everything else looks like an ordinary human being but we don't recognize him as being similar to any other human being that we've seen it doesn't belong to any other genus or species or anything like that he's his own species so a china there is a tree called by that name but nobody knows what it is likewise it is not possible to recognize you the more a man understands you the more uplifted he will be aim was silent he said to himself the master referred to the sun at dawn and the tree unrecognizable by man did he mean an incarnation of god is this the play of god through man is the master himself an incarnation was this why he cried to the devotees from the roof of the couti where are you come to me now this is 1883 september am has been coming to takur for a year and a half roughly by this time he accepts all of this this this will be just rhetorical questions really not that he hasn't thought about these things before not that he hasn't formed some conviction about all of this but just an astonishment is it really possible that i'm sitting in front of an avatar these thoughts are going through his mind suramar krishna was sitting on the steps of the southeast veranda of the kali temple raqqa m and hazrat were with him he talked lightheartedly about his boyhood days when it was dusk he returned to his room so this is the same day uh and it's a friday night the raqqah had come so he's the the new one here when it was dusk he returned to his room and sat down on a small couch so when he went into samadhi this was a common occurrence at sunset that time he always went into some type of divine mood or samadhi or something soon he went into samadhi and in that state began to talk to the divine mother he said mother what is all this rao about shall i go there i shall go if you take me the master was to go to a devotee's house was it for this that he was asking the divine mother's permission again he spoke to her perhaps praying about an intimate disciple mother please make him stainless well mother why have you given him only a particle that means of shakti a little small amount of of power this will be one of the disciples that will be able to do some great work some people wonder if it's m also himself that he's talking about it's not very clear remaining silent at the moment he said oh i see that will be enough for your work it could be rakaal also see even a particle of the divine mother's power is enough to transform the world it's it doesn't take much in the same state he said addressing the devotees that which is a brahmana is verily shakti we've heard this sentence over and over and over again that one of the most important teachings of krishna i address that again as the mother so we have three things here we have in brahmin brahman we understand to mean near guna brahman when we just use the term brahman just as when taku uses the term vedanta we understand that when he says brahman we generally understand this near going to brahman now for taco or near gonna brahman and saguna brahman are not two separate things we we have these different terms we have in brahman we have ishwara and bhagavan we we could be confused sometimes and think that these are three different realities or deities it's like brahma vishnu shiva now generally three morty generally we take this to mainly three different devas but these are three different aspects or powers that belong to one in the same reality and the swamiji makes the point sometimes that when we talk about those who worship shiva they worship shiva as creator preserver destroyer those who were vishnu they were worshiping as all of them they and when we talk about brahmin creating this it's it's symbolic of that power of but all of these powers belong to one in the same reality and that that reality to which they belong has a reality that doesn't require any of these to be manifested so this shakti the main power when we talk about shakti in terms of brahmin is chitchakti this power of consciousness projecting power the power for consciousness to project this living universe and then to enter into it now does it project it as as thought so that there's no material uh reality to it at all does it project it in terms of of the lagunas that will combine into this so-called seemingly physical universe this is this is again up to an interpretation but the main part of this shakti is going from this near guna brahmin and this infinite absolute reality that alone exists turning that brahman into the creator into ishwara ishwara saguna brahman or shakti when taka talks about shakti he's not just talking about the power he's talking about god together with that power when he says that they're one and the same roman and shakti ramen and kali are one of the same and he refers to that as mother now that that aspect brings in a little more subjectivity because that personal aspect of god now can can be seen in in so many different ways that's ramadan is krishna any of these different ways so there can be others who will even talk to god as talking to the father so there's a subjective element to this for takur it's so real that he won't like to say that this is my own mind talking to me nothing like that but it's the divine mother somehow uh manifesting herself through his mind in that way we don't know it's very hard to to say what is if we have that experience we'll probably say no it is not subjective at all 100 objective so it's really hard for us to to say about these things so that which is brahman is verily shakti i address that so he's not saying that that is also divine mother i address that capital t so he's talking about this this infinite absolute reality i address that again as the mother i call it brahmin when it is inactive and shakti when it creates preserves and destroys so this is uh so you take any individual we also have this this where we we have a an elemental aspect of our being that doesn't require us to do anything or say anything i am who i am but yet i can do so many things i can i can appear in so many different roles and and uh do so many different types of different occupations different relationships with people so everyone is like that when that that activity is dormant or when we're not looking in that direction if we if we want to talk about from a cosmic point of view when this universe doesn't exist if if we say that god is the ground and this universe is resting upon it then what happens when the universe doesn't exist the remnant remains it doesn't disappear so subject and object i see an object so i'm the seer and that's the object what happens when the object isn't there seer is no longer a seer nothing to see but doesn't disappear remains it's consciousness as a potential seer as a potential seer so this is that that bruhman because this is the aspect that never disappears it's elemental and the other uh has some type of uh relative value the dwightons will say that it's through maya the connection with maya that it can do all of these things uh that gives a little bit of a negative spin to it but in in in any case uh the aspect of burma that's pure consciousness is always there whereas the aspect of it as creator and preserver and all of that it doesn't have to be there because it's secondary but belonging to it so they talk about antaranga shakti and uh this is the power that inherent power that belongs to brahman is for upa that will be pure consciousness and this bahiranga shakti that creates the universe and shakti that's creates the jiva that's the in between one there's this is it for some division of a theology from this jiva goswami school they have these three different types of shaktis that belong to bruhman so that which is a brahmin is verily shakti i address that again as the mother i call it brahman when it is inactive and shakti when it creates preserves and destroys it is like water sometimes still and sometimes covered with waves yes yeah this is this is a borderline because i'll give you you know that illustration that i like with the horizon yeah the horizon uh what exactly is the horizon this uh the line the parent line the parent line that marks the uh the meeting point of the sky and and the earth or the sky and water say we're looking out in the ocean apparently that line is there this is this is according to a deuter now if we go and find it we'll find there's no line we'll never find that horizon we keep going closer and closer and keeps receding from us we never can get there if we could get there we would find that it's it's an apparent line uh where one thing meets another right okay so say okay where this meets this it's an apparent line like that but then we understand that this is finite but the sky is actually infinite it's just hidden by that part then we realize that it's not even touching it's only just behind all of that so this this that which is the apparent meeting point between the heaven and earth between the the uh body-mind aggregate and that consciousness is a jiva the parent it doesn't have any reality other than that then according to a dwight hunter yeah yeah [Music] who am i i am i'm caught between heaven and earth that i know that i have the divine element i know i have that human element we're right in the middle we have the ability to realize ourselves as pure consciousness and to identify ourselves as human beings we're right in the middle we're sitting on the fence huh yeah when we realized that then we realized ourselves as atman the jiva part comes through this identification so tucker's giving me this illustration it's like water sometimes still and sometimes covered with waves the incarnation of god is a part of the leela of shakti now this lila here will just mean this whole universe is a play and the divine incarnation is part of that big play so within that big play there's a little play they give the the illustration sometimes of of the player i say giris kosh huh he he would write the play he was that he would compose it and and he was a great playwright and yet he would also play a role in it he was very often an actor within it so this is like the divine incredit they are active in within their own place sometimes they say you know alfred hitchcock the great director they say that that he has a little cameo role in every movie that he's ever made and most of the time you can't find it he'll just be just a little passing scene and he'll be in the background or something like that so akina unrecognizable sometimes yeah the other thing about this unrecognizable is takwa says that uh during his lifetime very few can recognize the overtime and one of the signs is that after the passing away then people realize who it was who came in that human form so he says if i if if you have a boat a small boat and it'll it'll go down the river it can go close to the to the to the bank of the river and there'll be a little wave the wake that will come and you'll see that uh even while while the the ship is still visible the boat is still visible you'll see the waves come and they'll hit the shore a big steamboat will have to go right in the middle they can't can't come too close it'll go right in the middle and by the by the time it's out of sight it takes that long for these waves to come they'll be huge they'll break the bank that way so he gives this is an illustration of the avatar together we don't know how it gets put together there has to be something going on yeah there's something that's going on that's for sure yeah but how it works how how this consciousness projects this universe and then gets confused enters into it forgets itself this is no no easy explanation for all of this that's lila means that this is something that just uh this is a play that uh we we don't know why it happens maya also means we don't know why and how it happens only we're we're bringing in an element of of disinformation an element of ignorance or delusion somehow taking place so the incarnation of god is a part of the leela of shakti what is the purpose of the incarnation of god [Music] this is the teaching of gita the teaching of the of the puranas and devotional schools is they come to teach devotion not so much this idea of dharma that's that's definitely the emphasis in gita and other texts like that so tucker says the purpose of the divine incarnation is to teach men ecstatic love for god otherwise how will we know how will we learn if we don't see that it's possible the incarnation is like the utter of the cow the only place milk is to be god god incarnates himself as man there's a great accumulation of divinity in an incarnation like the accumulation of fish and a deep hollow in a lake some of the devotees wondered so again this is m thinking to himself and now he's spreading it out he doesn't know what the others are thinking so in his own mind he's thinking some of the deputies wondered is trauma krishna an incarnation of god like krishna caitanya and christ okay that's the end of that day then this is sunday september 9th 1883. so we don't know what happened saturday there's no we skipped saturday uh perhaps him had to go back that day srirama krishna had finished his midday meal and was sitting on the small couch roccal m and were sitting on the floor baratan was the steward of jadu malik's garden house and was devoted to the master now we know about this he was a very wealthy person so i'm interested in the interest in spiritual life but was always busy with his business ventures and everything uh he was very fond of takur and taka also liked him but with teasim sometimes and do you keep these flatterers around and why are you always pretending that you want to buy this and that and everything they had a nice relationship and like many wealthy people he had a garden house so he had his own house in kolkata and then a second house this was just i don't know where exactly they say just south of the of the there's there's a northern gate in the southern gate to the dukcheniswar uh compound and this uh by the the south gate outside of that apparently was his house and uh this of course was the scene of uh uh takur going with narendra on the second visit i think and and when he touched him and he asked him all the questions about his past life and his mission and how long he would live and all of those things uh so tucker went there many many times and they all knew him they all liked him so he would go to these places with the wealthy people and make friends with the servants and people who worked there so they were also very became devoted to him very much like that now and then ram chatterjee passed in or out of the room it was about two o'clock rotten told the master that a jatra performance by nil kanta had been arranged in jodhu mullig's house in calcutta now this is the one that never got done huh and tucker you asked them several times you said you were going to do this why didn't you do it but unto the master you must go the date has been set master that's good i want to go near the contest sings with the great devotion yeah there were these different troops you know they call them sampradayas and different troops that would put on these is it jatras or these like country plays if simple types of plays with music and and exaggerated uh acting and dancing and all sorts of things that were village things but also very very common even in kolkata and uh very often during these uh some of these long pooches shivratri or something people what do they do all night long so they'll put on these godzillas and things and tucker loved these and these are the things that he memorized there's when he put on these plays and and he would teach all the parts to his his friends they would go to the mango grove and come up with and put on these plays that's why he was the one chosen to play shiva for shivratri when he was just 11 years older and the person who was supposed to play shiva got sick and they thought oh what will happen everything spoiled we can't have this display tonight and everyone said he can do it he knows all of these parts this and that and he did it but poor guy he went into the samanthi and the whole thing that he couldn't finish the play ram chatterjee and the other devotees asked about a theft in jada malik's house yes the golden sandals of the deity were stolen from the shrine room in jodo babu's house it has created an uproar they're going to try to discover the thief by means of a charmed plate everybody will sit in one room and the plate will move in the direction of the man who stole the sandals master with a smile how does the plate move by itself no a man presses it to the ground i don't know how that explains it a devotee it is a kind of sleight of hand it is a clever trick master the real cleverness is the cleverness by which one realizes god that trick is the best of all tricks what is it [Music] as the conversation went on several bengali gentlemen entered the room and after saluting the master sat down one of them was already known to sri amir krishna these gentlemen followed the code of tantra the master knew that one of them indulged in immoral acts in the name of religion the tantra rituals under certain conditions allowed the mixing of men and women devotees and taking of wine and mead and a lot of things that were looked down upon by it this uh society tantric these these tantric rituals they found their way into everything into not just worshipers of the divine mother but the vice of a tradition also with the rather krishna and things and uh how it happened we don't know exactly a lot of these things were practiced in in tibet and there's one theory that buddhism went through through bengal north into tibet under the paul dynasty and i don't know if it's fair but some people blame that for coming back and that influence coming i don't know these may just be this human mind the way that it works trying to to bring some type of carnal pleasure under the name of religion so they can do these things so the rituals under certain conditions allow the mixing of men and women devotees but srama krishna regarded all women even prostitutes as manifestations of the divine mother he addressed them all as mother master with a smile where's the we hear his name many times we'll get a description about him but uh he was the one who did all these tantric rituals and things and could also give medicines and maybe cure people and do astrology all sorts of different things whereas artillery on the my ideal is different from that of akshalananda and his disciples as for myself i look on all women as my mother he was a married man with the family also and left and took all this this name of achala took some type of sanjayas probably and then engaged in some of these tantric rituals and things and taught them the visiting gentleman sat silent master every woman is a mother to me a chalanenda used to stay here now and then he lived someplace near the temple garden even even at that time he would drink a great deal of consecrated wine hearing about my attitude toward women he stubbornly justified his own views he insisted again and again why should you not recognize the attitude of a hero toward women this is one of the attitudes pashu there are different things in the tantric tradition i said to him but my dear sir i don't know i don't like these ideas to me every woman is a mother yet taku sometimes that he didn't like to argue sometimes they would say well why do you you know this is in the scriptures why don't you accept this and he'll just say i don't know please forgive me that's the way i am he doesn't want to be too strong and say that this is this is completely immoral what you're doing and hypocritical and everything but he's just just saying this is this is just my thing don't don't take it too personally but my dear sir i don't know i don't like these ideas to me every woman is a mother but did not support his own children he said to me god will support them i said nothing sometimes he was like that yeah he didn't like to argue to us but this is the way i felt about it who will support your children i hope your renunciation of wife and children is not a way of earning money people will think you are a holy man because you have renounced everything so they will give you money in that way you will earn plenty of money spiritual practice with the view to winning a lawsuit and earning money or to helping others win in court and acquire property shows a very mean understanding now many people would go to sadhus for these things we know that i think one time mathur also went to suramar krishna and pray for this author even i have to pray to divine mother that i can get a job so there was some feeling that through the blessing of the sadhu even these worldly things could could come about money enables a man to get food and drink build a house and worship the deity serve devotees and holy men and help the poor when he happens to meet them these are the good uses of money money is not meant for luxuries or creature comforts or for buying a position in society see in the village there was none of this there weren't things to buy why would you have the house bigger than you needed there would be some people maybe la has probably had a big house but it just this was all new for him when he got to calcutta people practice very tantric disciplines now remember he's saying this to these people in front of them he's not directly criticizing them but he's staying in such a way to let them know that this isn't the highest type of spirituality people practice various tantric disciplines to acquire supernatural powers how mean such people are krishna said arjuna friend by acquiring one of the aids and d's you may add a little to your power but you will not be able to realize me one cannot get rid of maya as long as one exercises supernatural powers and maya begets egotism body and wealth are impermanent why go to so much trouble for their sakes just think of the plight of the hatiyogis their tension is fixed on one ideal only longevity they do not aim with the realization of god at all this is of course those who just practiced it for a health reasons and other things this isn't uh are people who do a little hatha yoga in order to keep their bodies strong they didn't know harmony taco is talking about because there are others who used to come they would do all sorts of things they would swallow this cloth and everything and take neem juice all sorts of funny things they do not aim at the realization of god at all they practice such exercises as washing out the intestines drinking milk through a tube and the like with that one aim in view okay let's stop here we're not stopping you're very high notebook we'll stop here yeah we have to know the context of things we might think why does tucker always give us a bad impression of the hata yoga because it was different in those days they uh those who really practiced raja yoga their goal was just to to be able to do enough of these exercises so that asanas so that they could sit for a long time without moving that was the main goal of it then it became a kind of a science unto itself uh with all sorts of cures and and bodily things and everything so this is what we know from kind of modern day things of pranayama it kind of lost this uh the initial reason for pranayama was to clear the mind and now it's become to cure all sorts of different diseases and things like that it's not a horrible thing but it lost that initial purpose to the head okay we'll stop here [Music] upon [Music] who was stainless of infinite nature whose heart melts in sympathy for his devotees who is an embodiment of the divine and the supreme lord and ever worthy of our worship peace and peace peace
