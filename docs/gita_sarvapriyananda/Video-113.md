[113. Bhagavad Gita | Chapter 9 Verses 22-25 | Swami Sarvapriyananda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oeixLgWTygs)

oh what's up [Music] krishnam one day we are studying the ninth chapter and in the ninth chapter we were on the 22nd verse that's right let me stand that again yes this is the 22nd verse of the ninth chapter of the bhagavad-gita and here Krishna is saying those persons who think of nothing else but worship me through meditation the accession to and maintenance of the welfare of such ever devout persons I look after all right we had already started discussing this last time we hear Krishna is saying the last part is remarkable yoga and mentioned it last time it says whatever the two words yoga and Shema are technical words yoga has so many meanings here yoga just means the literal meaning of bringing together yoga is bringing together bringing together means what what we do not yet have and what we would like to have in the world so getting what we do not have and Shema is protecting what we already have these are the two things people are doing all their lives we look outside in the city that's what people are doing keeping the you know whether it's money or health or property or reputation or relationships trying to keep what we value we are trying to keep that and what we don't yet have in these Dimensions we try to acquire uh from the world that's what people are busy in all their lives and Krishna here is saying devotees who focus on me entirely the question might be if I focus entirely on God then what about the rest of my life I have to hold a job and I'm not a monk I have to I have a family to take care of you know maybe property house Investments my own health and all Insurance what not so what about that Krishna is saying I'll take care of it for you really no you will keep doing whatever you're doing but you don't have to worry about that lay the burden of your worries your anxieties upon God God will take care of it provide it there's a condition so that it's not that I become lazy you know all right so God's going to take care of it I'm going to relax do what nothing this is a new term called the soft life people want this new chemical soft like people want a soft life soft life is you know taking it easy everything is taken care of but then it's not exactly the Krishna is not recommending the soft life is all your time and energy focus it in sadhana as much as possible make God your goal God realization the goal of Life the purpose of life if you have a job you'll still be holding a job if you come to an ashram and run away from the job and it will come to an ashram they'll put you to work trust me I know they'll put you to work they'll keep you busy so there is and it's good to work Masha Allah here she used to say that in Bengali kajal work is Lakshmi the goddess of prosperity uh so work is Lakshmi keep your it keeps your mind and body um you know fit keeps your mind balanced and body fit engage in work but all the anxieties you put upon krsna says give it to me I'll take care of it don't worry about it and he said I will I will carry it for you whatever you need and that cute story I told you last time about the great Pandit who was comment writing a Sanskrit commentary on the Gita actually he was writing it on the whole Mahabharata so when he came to the Gita and this verse in the Gita God says I will bear for my devotees for those who love me I shall bear for them I shall carry for them what they need um he said God is going to carry this that's against the glory of God you know God will grant God is glorious so God gives us what we need not carry so he cut it out in the in the book instead of means to carry means to Grant in Sanskrit he cut it out and then we know the story of how that pandit's wife she saw this uh little boy who came with carrying food for their table they had no food and but he had a red like somebody had caned him and Lead stripe across his back and he said your your husband has done this and then the boy disappeared of course it was God and uh the wife asks the husband why did you beat that little boy how Krill he said I didn't do it then he realized that pen that I scratched out in those days they had quills so I had scratched out that word so that is my offense now God does bear uh for those who love God God loves you even more and God takes care of us however there is something to be understood here I mentioned it last time what we need God will give us and what we have God will protect so is God going to make us foolproof against the movements of the market you know someone short sells you and then yeah your Shares are protected against it will God do that if you worship Krishna a lot will he protect you against ups and downs of Wall Street no will Krishna give you what we need what you what we need what what you need will Krishna does he look through your Christmas list like Santa Claus and bring you what you wanted again no then what does he mean he'll give us what we need and protect what we have whatever is good for my God realizes for my spiritual realization whatever is good for my spiritual life will give you need food clothing shelter you need protection and a modicum of Health and Wellness till you attain God realization or your Advanced far enough in spiritual life God will take care of it unit protection from the elements protection from you know that which will trouble you in spiritual life God will take care of it but he will not give you things if we want so many things in this life he will protect you from yourself do not desire anything why he says do not desire anything hyphen then he adds because you will get it we think we will not get it and that's why we shouldn't desire no you will get it and that's trouble often you get something we give you seen this and we realize years and years ago we might have wanted this now we don't want it at all it's bothered now we get it um I gain trouble problems in life who knows what is good for us in spiritual life a little bit of maybe a Troublesome person in our lives or or a little bit of maybe even physical illness is it bad no not really not really it might be actually helpful in spiritual life depends on the person where they are so in that sense God will take care of us so God will help us to attain God Krishna will help us to attain Krishna but what's the condition he says those who are constantly engaged who who are constantly engaged in God with God through meditation prayer study service worship music kit and whatever it is they're constantly engaged these persons they see everything in this world has got God God Alone appears as all of the living and non-living things in this world nothing here is apart from my beloved Lord I could whichever for Krishna here but whichever way you understand God nothing in this universe God is imminent in this universe in and through all beings living and non-living God is there I am in the presence of God When vedanta teacher put it very beautifully God in vedanta you know he says if God is out there it's incomplete God a partial God if God is only within me God is within me people say it in school to say it God is within within all of us God is within me incomplete God partial God God is not here in heaven only in complete God a partial God is only in deep meditation not with my eyes open incomplete God partial God is only when I become enlightened then God is God is only after death when I go to heaven then God is incomplete God partial God God something that is limited in time in space or by object in sanskrites limited by time space and object but limited by time we understand that then not now that's limitation in time limited by space we understand they are not here limited by object objects means entities so that one is God but not all this God is unlimited all the time everywhere and in everything in and through everything and when nothing is there then also God is in fact then only God is so that is the complete card not a not a partial it is a complete God Purna he says in everything you must this devotee Sees God and in all the activities which are going on in this world the work that we do when other people are doing the the play and entertainment and enjoyment that we uh you know what we do for others the job that you are holding the and of course the rituals that you do in your Shrine and in the temple all of this work is the Leela of God the play of God all entities are God and all activities are the play of God so this person is immersed in God [Music] and a very ancient verse I was referring to it some some class yesterday of yesterday where it says the person in samsara is so unfortunate the ignorant one the one who's not realized enlightened so unfortunate they are like they are they are people they are beings immersed in the ocean of nectar and they don't know it and they are looking to like they are like looking to the Waters of a mirage for to quench their thirst I'll repeat that immersed in the ocean of nectar what does that mean we are immersed in God we are immersed in existence Consciousness place all the time inside outside everywhere all the time it is one Divinity alone always continuously radiant and Shining forth we don't see it we don't see it at all and what do we do we are looking at the Waters of a mirage to quench our thirst what is this Mirage samsara what is the Waters of samsara the chasing pleasure avoiding pain you know um accumulation of wealth such a satisfaction of sensuous desires this is the water of this Mirage which we expect if I pursue it it will fulfill me somehow it will quench my thirst it never does it never does so such devotees they recognize that they are forever immersed in God and they're connected with God how there are three things those literally people so there are many such devotees what do they do first of all ananya three things ananya means not anything else that means turning away from the world [Music] means other than God other ananya not other turning away from the world from people from activities from Pursuits not literally turning your face away that's rude what are you doing I'm turning away from you towards God no turning away from the world means not seeing the world as World seeing the Divinity in all beings in all activities so turning away from the worldliness after all when I say God is everywhere and everything that means this world here itself so if you turn away from this where will you turn away means not look not upon this world as samsara see God the same the same Divinity with whom you worship the Beloved in all beings that is ananya so turning away from the world from the other from The Mirage turn away from that then literally means thinking of thinking of so the second thing is once you have turned away from the world what have you turned towards you have turned towards God so your deity repeating the Mantra of your deity prayer to the to your ishta devatha outpouring of love singing the names of God reading about God and and um you know the Saints and the spiritual people chanting mantras there's so many ways devotional music service to all beings so service will come later means dwelling on God talking about God don't be a boar um so talking about God reading about God meditating upon God in whichever form we our practices and then the third one is so here service comes in our activities should be the service of the Lord so to Worship the Lord through our actions so these three things turn away from worldliness dwell on God in your mind heart and in your activities Worship the Lord through save Seva now this worship the Seva can Seva means service it can be ritualistic and it can be actual service to humanity it is seeing Divinity in them it could be worship also you know ritualistic Worship in your Shrine in the temple that's also for you and you actually you go out there and do something for people or you know any sentient being it could be animals also plants also we do something for them it could be you going to a soup kitchen and feeding the hungry and the homeless or it could be just yourself you're cooking and setting out the table for people in your family and um and feeding them for you it's the same Divinity everywhere and that your that's your offering um or yourself they're feeding yourself that's also an offering there's God present as the fire of hunger in the tummy and I'm pouring like the you know the imageries of a Vedic fire sacrifice the fire is lit and the priests for oblations so empowering ablations in there some kind of visualization which connects my activities to God all the activities that we do as long as they are not outright immoral unethical everything can be done or connected with God so that's per your password these three are the explanation of the word means constantly connected with God how in three ways one ananya turning away from God nothing other than God that's one two dwelling on God think pray japa repeat the Mantra meditate study whatever it is the mind and the heart are on God that's second third action my service to God into the Sanskrit word bhakti we always say bhakti means love of God devotion loving God but the etymological meaning of bhakti the root grammatically it comes from bhaji sevayam to serve so it's not just a nice feeling about God you know we have a warm feeling about God no actually to do something to be translated into action and I I remember this because this is I heard 16 17 years ago in the Himalayas studying under a monk there in gangotri and he was teaching us a quite a non-bhakti text that is the most radical non-dual text so this sadhu um uh he has passed away now lakshman Dashi it was a traditional sadhu Punjabi so he had come from what is now Pakistan after the partition of the country he came straight from there and crossed all over North India which went straight to the Himalayas and he stayed the rest of his life now he said when I um I was um under a guru and I was a young monk night was my Habit to go around and looking for the old monks and see what I could do for them who wanted a a comforter in Hindi they say Rajai that's a sick like a blanket or who wanted a cup of milk who wanted medicine so whatever I could give or help them so I'd go around to the huts and the caves and and my gurus scolded me once and I said do some spiritual practice you're just you know being a busybody in Hindi he said lakshmandas do some Bhajan sometimes but just Bhajan means devotional practices you're just going around and then he thought he told he told us he said that saddened me I thought am I wasting my time and then when it's in the Sanskrit class we learned the word bhakti Bhajan it comes from to serve to serve and my heart was glad and that I'm doing the right thing this is Bhajan also this is spiritual practice so yes to serve God in all these ways for such people Krishna says I take care of them I take care of them if you you my Lord are in all the gods which are worshiped in The Vedic sacrifices so you remember the ancient Vedic religion fire sacrifices and they were deities and all of them so Arjuna is thinking that if you are in all of them indeed then why is it that those who are worshiping them through Vedic fire sacrifices so why don't they attain Moksha enlightenment you're saying that those who attain to those who worship you will attain freedom Moksha enlightenment why don't they you said that they uh if they worship like that they will go to heaven you remember the last time we studied they will go to heaven and stay in heaven for a long time and again will be reborn and they will keep coming and going into samsara but why because you said you are them them also you are everywhere so those gods are you are also those gods and their people are worshiping those Gods those religious rituals people are doing with faith with real devotion sincerely and they're good people so why don't they attain Enlightenment why doesn't everybody everybody who is religious in some way attain Enlightenment why only people who are focused on God with the capital G with you on you so answer 23rd verse you can repeat after me if you like yes [Music] [Music] even those devotees of other gods who worshiped them endowed with faith worship me alone o son of kunti though in an unauthorized way now what's this is an answer to the possible question that so all religious people basically if we make a general question if you leave The Vedic thing out of the equation generally a lot of people go to temples churches mosques a lot of people are religious in some way so why doesn't everybody become enlightened and that krsna's answer is there's something to be understood religious is not equal to spiritual religious is not equal to spiritual what is it that we want there is one way of being religious the mass religion the conventional religion where my belief in God is to make my life better easier I want certain things to turn out the way I want them to I want to win the lottery I want people to treat me nicely I want my diseases to be cured or to be safe in this world and God will do all that for me a lot of people believe that and they have faith and there's nothing wrong in that but Krishna is here making the distinction yes all those prayers they will come to me also but notice what they are praying for they will get what they're praying for in the Bible again and again Jesus Christ says they have their reward those who pray for example he says in an ostentatious way showing you pray in secret and your father who is in heaven and who sees in secret will reward you and they who pray in the street corners with much words you know they have their reward which is what means you get what you want when you go to go to God you have they have not come to God for enlightenment God realization Moksha Nirvana salvation no no no they have come to God for money for um you know worldly happiness for curing diseases success in business whatever it or politics big big one politics two kinds of people turn up in regularly in temples in India one is students before examinations and politicians before elections so yes and they want it they want they want want um [Music] success in the world and krsna says they will get success in the world I'm not saying it doesn't work it's Superstition no no they will get is it guaranteed not guaranteed there are many factors involved there is a you know once past karma is involved there and so if everything is according to Karma why should I pray to God at all now that praying to God also does change my karma so even a person who's worldly who wants things in the world to turn out the way they want it to be it there is a point to praying it's not just oh it's all coming from a past Karma so I won't do anything God will give me what I what what's coming to me anyway no if I want something more and I pray for it it does make a difference but it's still worldly it'll keep me trapped in this world where do I get all this so the commentators make it clear this commentator sridhar Swami he he explains not in an authorized way so here the technical term is vidhi with he means um the injunctions of The Vedas in karma karanda there are do's and don'ts within do this do these rituals if you want to go to heaven or all these things do not do these immoral activities so this is given these are the vidhi initiate the vidhi do's nished don'ts injunctions and prohibitions now the people who follow the Vedic religion they might criticize the devotees of Krishna that look we are the guys who are following the injunctions of The Vedas The Vedas tell us to do these sacrifices and we are doing it you are the one who is not doing it you are you know chanting the name of Krishna and dancing around so you are not following the with the the injunctions of the way this Krishna is saying no there's something to be understood here those who follow those injunctions they are not looking for Moksha they are not looking for Liberation they are not looking for God they're looking for what the world this commentator explains means without the the desire to attain Moksha without the desire for god without the desire for Liberation without that desire they are worshiping they have other desires which makes them worship God so they get that that's why by worshiping all these other rituals and pujas even though I the Lord one ishwara bhagavan the one God is everywhere but they will get what they want not me um when sadhu put it very nicely he said in every human being there are these Three Rivers these three streams running all the time means the stream of knowledge what we know what we have learned what we know what we understand you know science and art and spirituality and religion and philosophy you know that's what we know that's what I understand and then Karma dhara what I do in life what's my job um you know my daily life how am I spending my time what am I doing in like Karma dhara the stream of action but third bhavadhara this is how do I translate how is an inner disposition inner attitude what I truly want deep inside based on my past samskaras what is it that motivates me what do I want deeply that is most important and sadhu he said to our devotee who had come very beautifully he said I'll tell you in Hindi and Translate um what you do like you watch your job and what you do what do you know what have you learned what books have you read I have no interest in knowing these things but what do you want from inside what is it that you really want tell me that how do I know what I really want it's interesting it requires a study of the Mind what really pleases me and makes me happy honestly inside again asada put it nicely for whom does the dog wag its tail for whom does so whom does the dog like it's still whom it likes you know so the dog wags its tail far he says does it wag the tail for does the dog walk back the tail for for in Hindi he said colloquial Hindi said for whom does it wag the tail is it wagging the tail when it sees a rich man a powerful person a scholarly person a talented person or a spiritual person but where does so what what attracts our mind what honestly makes me happy often what happens in spiritual life is we think this is good for me I'm convinced so I'm doing it it's good for you but is it nice for you might ask but suppose it isn't nice for me I don't feel particularly happy but I'm still doing it because I know it's good for me what will happen you'll still get the result of it wouldn't take a longer it'll be mechanical and hard going for a while until you begin to like it once you like it you have no more fear once one likes it there's no more fear SRI ramakrishna put it this way he used to live near the river the ganga the river would be flowing in a current and you would see this fishermen would go out on their little boats so when they set out from the river bank to the river inside the river they would have to row mightily with their bamboo poles work really hard but when they hit the current he says the fisherman just sits he gave a nice example he sits holding the rudder of the boat in one hand and smoking the tobacco Hubble bubble in the other and the boat sails along merrily in spiritual life he says you have to work hard at the beginning but afterwards you catch the current it becomes much easier then it's a habit more or less then you try to stop it also you will not feel like stopping because then you don't you've you can't imagine your life without that I remember we were novices once in our main Monastery being trained under training newcomers so it is very senior among very devout saintly person he was telling us trying to inspire us you know he's telling us imagine suppose you are told today that you cannot think about SRI ramakrishna today it's not allowed how terrible it would be how upsetting it would be how impossible it would be we were thinking Hmm for him we are trying to get into the current we are trying to maintain it with effort for him it's effortless it's deal to stop it will take effort for him so he says twenties yes huh so it is only those who want God realization to at least a little bit or at least they're sold on the idea like we are all are as I say that even if we don't intensely want it we want to want it and that's good enough so we are in the group which he those those who are on the path of moksh we are we are seeking Liberation Enlightenment guard realization whatever it is and then the 24th verse SRI ramakrishna says I am the enjoyer and the Lord also of all sacrifices but they do not know me in truth therefore they fall down [Music] so I am actually all worship ultimately comes to me God Alone is the power behind all deities even if you are worshiping a particular you know performing a particular ritual for a fulfillment I know I want money or I want to win an election or whatever it is even that worship also comes to me Krishna says to God again you know I'm using the word God in vedanta it means so it comes to me however such people do not know me in reality and do not want to know me in reality also they want the world if they want the world they will get the world so that's why he says though they do not know me in reality that I am Brahman I am God I am the inner self and by attaining me they attained to fulfillment these things they don't know they don't believe they are not interested in they are interested in the world they want particular things in the world they want their life to be this way and not that way and that's why they come to God that's the only difference between the theist and the atheist The Atheist also is worldly wants the world to be this way and not that way and only things that there's only worldly ways of doing it there's no such thing as a God so pursue is a worldly goal through worldly means and the theist the one who believes in God but in a worldly sense that person also wants the world to be this way not that way but also believes in addition to worldly ways there is a power behind everything there is an intelligence a great force the one which controls everything and by the blessings of that power I will attain my worldly goals but all of them they do not know me in truth what is what is it to know me in truth that I am the one Creator preserver destroyer of the world I am the goal of all and attaining me one goes beyond suffering and also in an advantic sense I and you are we are one reality so this ultimate secret they don't know this or they are not interested so they fall from the truth they fall from the truth means they continue in this cycle of birth and death they continue in samsar [Music] um but they but if someone knows this truth the commentator here sridhar Swami says I'll read the Sanskrit and translate but suppose someone is doing rituals but knows behind all these rituals behind all these worldliness there is one God and everything my ultimate goal is God and not this world the Sanskrit here is whatever mode of your worship if you know behind that say deity behind and all behind all these different rituals whatever your religion wherever you're worshiping if you know that behind it is this one Divinity who's behind this entire universe who is the foundation of this universe and my innermost Soul the inner controller then even through these rituals the same rituals you will attain to God and you will not come back into this samsara again you will attain Moksha so he's not actually against uh ritualistic worship or even against Vedic rituals but one must know what purpose it is for we get what you want in fact is very interesting that Houston Smith who wrote that wonderful book religions of the world he was inspired by his disciple of Swami sat prakashananda ji the founder of the vedanta Society of of Saint Louis where Swami chaitanya um so he wrote this wonderful book the religions of the world and the first chapter is Hinduism and in that he was saying that he writes I was trying to find you know okay one key which will unlock the whole of Hinduism very difficult because Hinduism is so diverse so wide I always say whatever question you ask in Hinduism the answer will be yes and no do the Hindus believe in God yes and no there are Hindus like the Sanchez who don't believe in God in the even The Vedic rituals the karmakandra in The Vedas itself the karma Kanda the ritualistic portion of The Vedas they believed in the power of The Vedic mantras the individual deities were not as important as The Vedic Mantra and the ritual they believed if the mantras were chanted properly and the rituals were performed properly the the devatas the deities would give the results the point was not God are the gods it was The Vedic ritual itself or the mantras themselves so they were there are and there were Hindus who were not particularly god-oriented or theistic is God male in Hinduism yes and no God is very much female and Beyond gender and both male and female I was surprised to see the classic image it's a Shiva and Parvati together in in one image and I found it you know where in the most surprising of places in the Harvard Business School on the lawn this is a big sculpture of in Boston the Harvard Business School on the law uh some it was some exhibitions um so all these are there so such tremendous diversities are there within Hinduism how do you have one common theme in Hinduism how do you explain Hinduism through one common but he did it Houston Smith does it he says one way of understanding Hinduism is that Hinduism tells us you can have what you want I mean I can see so many Smiles that's a nice thing you can have what you want but then he says immediately the question arises the great question arises what is it that we want and getting what you want you will get what you want but then you have to be ready for the consequences also what is it that you want and then he saw how nicely he progresses he says Hinduism then next says what we want that also will help you with what you want are four things you want pleasure fun happiness in this life that's Karma fulfillment from the grossest sensuous desires to the most subtle you know artistic desires fulfillment of all the refined from the grossest desires to the most refined kind of sensors Pleasures pleasures all of it can be fulfilled that is calm or that's the range of Desire Earth not pleasure not having a party how many people New York is so busy you know the city that that doesn't sleep so are they all partying all the time no most people are working all the time so what are they pursuing not fun they're pursuing um that is prosperity money wealth success in this world so that's the second thing notice it says Hinduism says this is then third Dharma Dharma is morality ethics an ethical and religious view of life we want this do you really want this or are we told to want it no what happens is prosperity and pleasure in life we instinctively want it no we don't have to be taught by religion to want it nobody has to be taught you don't have to go to class to say to learn that you know it's nice to have a party no it's instinctive pleasure seeking is instinctive then what what does religion do what can religion contribute here religion can show us if you this is what you want what's the ethical sustainable way to do it do it without religion without Dharma it's no longer ethical it's no longer sustainable even for one person I've often quoted this Somerset mom his if you chase pleasure if you want if you chase pleasure one pointedly then very soon you find nothing is pleasing anymore if you all you do is chasing pleasure very soon you find nothing pleasing anymore and time is going away very soon we find even the things which gave pleasure our capacity for enjoyment is limited our tastes keep changing first satiety follows very fast so all of this pleasure has very serious consequences pleasure seeking so has money seeking wealth chasing dollar chasing it has serious consequences for our moral health for society family for the economy for the world all of it has serious consequences and who knows it better than New York can you go through these booms and busts um so what religion can do Houston Smith says it puts a restriction around it morality based on ethics we come to realize that we it's good to pursue what you want in life but as a decent person as a moral person as an ethical person and luckily most people are like that there are people who want just pleasure and you know success in the world and they don't care as long as they're not caught by the IRS or the police they just can do anything and there are lots of such people but not in majority thankfully otherwise society would collapse notice even people who are like that they would want others to be not like them they would want others to be law abiding even the greatest of Thieves wants others to be honest doesn't want to be stolen from himself so Essex is introduced so when Hinduism talks about Karma the pursuit of pleasure at the pursuit of wealth it's all within Dharma that's why we always say Dharma takama and we never say karma Dharma Dharma first and then the pursuit of your worldly goals so religion has a role there are rituals God is there to help you to get what you want there are all the temples and but that's all lower because that will never lead to Freedom that will never lead to peace happiness satisfaction it will trap us in samsara and we keep going round and round in samsara till we learn the lesson that by pursuit of worldly goals nobody has ever found happiness in this world so the real goal of Hinduism Houston Smith says is Moksha that's what Hinduism actually wants to tell you that you there is a way we don't instinctively want Moksha we don't want it we instinctively reach out towards the world then religion teaches us what what is the moral way ethical way sustainable way of reaching out towards the world and then shows us that there's a limitation to that it will never be deeply satisfying reach for Moksha and how to reach for Moksha then he goes into Ghana Yoga Yoga bhakti Yoga Karma Yoga so it's a very beautifully developed chapter simple elegant and yet pretty authentic so that was used in Spain religions of the world then a further point he makes 25th verse no so um the worshipers of the Gods go to the gods the worshipers of the mains go to the mains the worshipers of the spirits go to the spirits and my worshipers to come to me basically this is the idea that there are those who do ritualistic action and day after death they will go to the worlds where their forefathers are Petri locates carpetri look you'll lead a moral life religious life you go to the world of the forefathers stay there until your karma credit is exhausted and you come back into this world those who lead a higher religious life devotion worship but the goal is still the world when you go to a higher plane Deva Loca and there to if there is guard realization is not the goal they will again come back to this world but he says Those Who worship me God and the capital G ishwara bhagavan Krishna they will attain to me which means what's the difference all the others they will still be in samsara a better kind of samsara if you are a ritualistic in a Vedic ritualist if you are a Vedic upasaka meditator are you know basically you're a moral person then your samsara will be little better than others still some sorrow and still bound to be exhausted and come back to this world whereas those who worship God in devotion they will attain Moksha in this life or the next definitely Moksha is guaranteed for you that's what Krishna is teaching here next there are three actually several verses after this which are very beautiful shows you how to worship God through things objects you know by giving everything to God how to worship God through actions by doing everything for God and then after giving everything and after doing everything you offer the results of that because as you know Hindus are very big on Karma and results of karma I do this and what is the result of that well you offered all the results to God also I don't want anything from you know like personal gain anything I don't want anything except God so the mother she was in the Bank of the ganga somebody was there either a sadhu or a beggar was sitting there and she had some shoots in her hand she gave it and she to that man it's so my child take these fruits and the fruits of this giving also I gave unto you don't want anything back from it Vivekananda says give and do not look back whoever whosoever looks back their ocean dwindles to a drop [Music] so um that is giving up the results of my giving whether it's objects or action that will be talked about and um then the extreme power the speed with which spirituality Devotion to God transforms a person that will be talked about it is even the worst of Sinners should be considered a sadhu the moment that person develops devotion for God because why why would that be so because this would be transformed very fast into a saintly person so the great transformative power of spirituality also will be spoken about so when a series of very beautiful verses is coming all right I'll have to wrap up Toronto awaits um [Music]
