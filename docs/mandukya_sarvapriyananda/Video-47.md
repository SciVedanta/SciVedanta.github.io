[48. Mandukya Upanishad | Chapter 3 Karika 37-39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGcKEekOFoU)

let us start with the shanty mantra om bhadram Carini Vishnu Yama diva petrm posh a moksha period Etra steerer here on guys - two volumes Aston OBE Mishima deva Heaton yada yo swass tina in grow british rava suez Pina foucha schwa Vida sauce Tina Stark show air Astana me swass Tino brie hospital daughter to home shanti shanti shanti so we are studying the monocoque erika and in the third chapter of the monocoque erika and third chapter is called adwaita procore another chapter on non-duality you remember the first chapter included the Upanishad itself and the teaching that we are the pure consciousness beyond the waker dreamer and deep sleeper this was given in the first chapter with open Ishod and gorup others own verses in the second chapter which at the dog bite a chip recurrent the falsity of the world which we experienced that that it is not essentially real that was explained with the help of reasoning second chapter the third chapter the non duality of the self the ultimate reality is non dual Abdo item this is being taught with the help of reasoning and right now what's happening is from 31st verse onwards till now it's going on now the topic is no mind after all the teaching is given guru father says ultimately non duality boils down to what is it at the level of the mind because our problems are really at the level of the mind so non duality at the level of the mind is called no mind what has he been telling us no mind does not mean for going off to sleep no mind does not mean being in Samadhi no mind means by Atmos actia navasana by the realization of the the truth about the self that I am Brahman I am the Turia by the realization realization of that spiritualizing the mind so overcoming the troublesome mind the problematic mind the worldly mind by the mind which is which is which is enlightened so that is goda padas version of no mind so no mind does not mean destroying the mind does not mean not thinking you may think as much as you want or you may not think at all but you are not the mind or deeper meaning of this would be that everything is realized to be brown them including the mind itself so the world is Brahman actually the world is not the world but it is Brahman the body is also not the body but it is Brahman the mind is also not the mind but it is actually Brahman this is the realization of the enlightened person and hence it's not a problem anymore if all this brown man and I am that Brahman where is the problem with whom is the problem so this is what is going on now and we saw verse number 36 last time I think that is a very powerful and beautiful verse you remember in the open assured the Mundaka Upanishad is the smallest of all the Upanishads with only 12 mantras and in the 12 month is the seventh one is the most powerful one I mean I regard it as the most powerful mantra in the entire vedantic corpus so the seventh mantra what it says that is sort of summarized in this verse this is the 36th verse of the third chapter we saw it last time a young money drama Swapnil unarmed akamaru become sakura tree bottoms Arabic gum no Baraka Sanjana what does it mean what do you realize when you when you become enlightened the realization is I am this agem are the unborn an interim beyond or beyond deep sleep I swapped numb beyond the dream state 1 the these 3 together they mean a germ literally means what is born the physical body is born so if I'm not the born then the fifth and not the physical body I am NOT the waking self I swept them the Beyond dream or no dream that means where is dreams dreams are in the mind so I am NOT the dream self either digested the dreamer I'm not that either on each drum the deep sleep self the deep sleep self do you remember the name Braga I am not that either now very interesting that our entire range of experience is waking dreaming deep sleep and if there any other states of the mind you can conceive of coma or ecstatic states or a high on drugs or whatever they're all included in these in this entire range and in each of these experiences whatever we consider ourselves to be the self I am NOT that as he says saying that's what we realized I am NOT that atom on each drum I swapped numb so I am none of them then what am I not the Waker not the dreamer not the deep sleeper then I am the fourth Turia the fourth and this is anomic um a rupa calm that to liam the fourth is beyond name and form so name and form is shorthand for Maya the entirety of this transactional world is called name and form so all of this is story a plus name add form Turia itself our real nature is beyond name and form or beyond Maya if you look at it a little deeper the terms they used Adam a swept them on it drum Adam the unborn refers to I when it says and the unborn that means I cannot be the way or the wakers world this world so this is the physical level the gross level I am NOT the gross aspect of this up the Atman I'm not this tool Atma then when it says a Swapna it means subtle the dreams are at the at the subtle level at the mind so I am NOT the subtle level of the self also the deal with the world of the mind and it's projections I am NOT that either on it drum where the mind finally finally is resolved in deep sleep the blankness of deep sleep that's another experience we have I am not even that so that is the causal level so the datoria the real self is not the gross level stool Atma is not the subtle level sukshma Atma is not the causal level also the karan Atma beyond the stool a sukshma karana is the to do the real self and notice on Appa anam akamaru become beyond name and form all see the entire waking universe and you the vicar together are represented by do you remember ohm ah the first letter of ohm the entire subtle universe your universe of dreams the mental the subtle level whatever is going on in the mind now mind intellect memory that is represented by the letter O and deep sleep where everything is withdrawn the causal level is represented by the letter ma so if you put them together ah uma ohm the hole the ohm represents the gross subtle and causal the entirety of what we experience as the universe the whole thing is ohm ohm just the ohm represents the whole thing and we're saying I am not that I am what is beyond the ohm the silence beyond the ohm the silence beyond the ohm represents Turia will come to you so unarmed acum ohm itself in all the sounds are encapsulated in ohm and up with those sounds all words are made so all language in a way is encapsulated in ohm ohm represents all language and ohm represents the entire universe gross circle causal don't look at me as if it's something new we did it online a long time ago it's understandable if you have forgotten but that is the meaning of ohm the real meaning of omae's after ohm the silence after rome which represents to dr the pure consciousness so on are mahkum beyond names and all the forms gross subtle causal or rupa come beyond all these forms is datoria the pure consciousness yes not they say Upanishads open assured says Gayatri mantra demanded clopin assured who comes first in what sense both are vedic [Music] mantras not something is left out after all this story is not left out after ohm ohm includes the silence after the Oh which which represents to you absolutely it's the same thing it's exactly the same thing when Gayatri says boo movers who are the three worlds and ohm speaks about the gross this subtle and the causal all three are within Maya and all of it is ohm and what is ohm beyond the Maya the silence which represents pure consciousness Brandon that is also Oh so Brahman is all of this in what way a snake is mistake a rope is mistaken as a snake all right now the rope is not a snake and yet the snake is none other than the rope can you follow this practical it is so the rope in itself is not a snake but that snake which you saw is nothing other than the rope itself similarly Brahman is not the world but this world which we experience is nothing other than Brahman so first of all Turia has to be understood the fourth has to be understood as apart from waker dreamer deep sleeper pure consciousness having understood that then you realize it is this pure consciousness alone which appears as the Waker in the wakers world ah dreamer and the dreamworld ooh and deep sleeper in the deep sleep merged darkness hmm so it is from that silence alone all my merges so the whole thing is home but if you at the beginning if you say everything is ohm you don't think oh so that brownstone is home and this man is home that woman is ohm that way all of this is Brahman not in this way not in this way if you say the snake is rope you say oh that snake that means the Rope must be like a snake and like a rope is like a rattlesnake or something no no the snake is not the Rope is after understanding that then only are you entitled to say the Rope alone appears as the snake world is not Brahman is after that you are entitled to say Brahman alone is the entire world first Natan eighty waker dreamer and deep sleeper you are not you are the two dear when you realize your datoria when you realize you are the Turia then only you are entitled to say you that Turia alone is the waker dreamer deep sleeper so it's not that there are four people there's a Waker and a dreamer and a deep sleeper and the Turia and you need for ID cards from now on no there's only one there's you there's the real you and the apparent you the apparent you comes in three flavors the Baker dreamer in deep sleepers but it's always the real you you are you are that all the time Victoria yes - yeah and please confine yourself hippies can find your stems of Top Trumps used here yes is super mind ever used here but it's not a bad bad word in fact when I think about it no mind could easily be understood as super mind awesome yeah yes mystics hear it all the time we have a Swami who would hear it all the time the real ohm it's called the unstruck sound Anahata Dhvani all sounds are struck struck but unstruck sound is it's a vibration which goes on without vibration so it's called but it mystics hear it we had once one is Swamy Chantal and the G who could hear it and he actually asked the Holy Mother whether it was mistake he was making or is it real and the Holy Mother verified she said yes my son what you're hearing is right and I have not met him but the Swami's who have met him he but he was very childlike and he was a given more than enlightened person so there I heard some stories about it for example he would sometimes say too close but the monks who are close to him he would say do you hear it do you hear it there no so one meditation is done the meditation on the Bell so that's like ohm so when you sound the bell and sound fades away now if you put your mind to it mind - it means literally merge your mind in the sound and let the mind fade away with the sound trail away at one time you will find the sound is no longer an external sound it's resounding in your mind and with that and that also diminishes and dies away and the mind falls silent it'll come back again because we are not trained but it's a good way to do it so when the bowls for example in tibetan book or buddhist meditation when they strike the bowl there's a there is a vibration which dies away yeah that's a good way of meditating but you can you can simulate the same effect by chanting ohm [Music] you can follow it back and merge the mind in in its merged state and when you win the mind merges absolutely still and quiet dare merge into a dive into it with the last enquiry who or what is watching the quietness of the mind there the watcher becomes very clear clear to whom clear to itself but that's a yogic way gara pada would not approve royal palaces be philosophically find it out here no mind while thinking I'm not thinking while talking I'm not talking while seeing I'm not seeing and while eating I'm not eating it predates know what go to pod is describing is found in the mondo cube furnish the highest description or explanation of ohm is found in the man to cure position what you are talking about connecting it with the bread - bread same four bits hold so and come back and those are I mean I would say barely kindergarten they came much much much later and the although there are exercises see if this is difficult the teachers would say meditate if that is difficult then bhakti practices are given if that is difficult go to the yoga studio do the stretching and to the for to in for hold release let it be stay at this level yeah I did I did no you don't press them emphasis of them but I did now for the purposes of meditation yeah Krishna booty Jiddu Krishnamurti would say from the sublime to the ridiculous I don't agree with his he was used to be sarcastic that's not necessary because pranayama is a whole big science in itself but pranayama is at the physical level this is the top of the Everest there's nothing beyond beyond so he's only silence beyond this is only enlightenment is the last thing that can be said so don't drag it down all right then this one beyond name and form what is it like secrete vivid we saw last time security bottom meats which flashes eternally as as pure consciousness which is shining eternally as pure consciousness server gamma server game normally means all-knowing but here it does not mean all-knowing here it means service check gesture gear means consciousness it is consciousness and service it is also everything in the form of existence of pure being pure being no datoria itself is the waked dreamer deep sleeper in the first step we say I am NOT the Waker not the dreamer not the deep sleeper and the background consciousness Turiya after that we say the torria itself is baker dreamer deep sleeper what is the example I have given it off in the gold and the ornaments there is a bangle there is a necklace and there is a maybe a tiara or something and then somebody tells you the reality is gold now gold is not a bangle gold in itself is not a necklace gold in itself is not a tiara when you understand what gold is after understanding that then you realize that the bangle and the tiara and the necklace are nothing but gold similar realizing your nature as pure consciousness as a Toria then you look back it is that Toria which if it the waking mind and making body in this world is is called the way Karishma it is that when you fall asleep the mind falls asleep that to D alone becomes the dreamer digestion that to D alone becomes the deep sleeper probiem and then again wakes up so yeah so this is it that is secrete v become pure consciousness or rag Geum consciousness and all that is presented to consciousness all of that is also Toria all of this no pajara cotton jhana and there are no transactions here at the level of Toria no giving and taking no walking and talking no eating and drinking from consciousness is consciousness alone and yet all of it goes on at the level we have a Harika level at the transactional level your life goes on as it is right you can wear the necklace sent you on your neck and the bangle on your wrist and the tiara on your head and yet you can say from the point of view of gold nothing is happening gold is just gold right so this is this is no mind this is no mind when you're mind is suffused with this realization ah-hum Tori osmium ROM has me I am this problem then then mind becomes no mind this is what is this discussing now then next 37 sort of a palapa we got a son of abdullah we gotta Tsarevich in Tassimo Teta salvage in Tassimo theta supra Shanta sacred duty so prashanta sacred duty samadhi Rachel oh boy AHA samadhi Rachel OH so developer we got the beyond all language saruba cinta sama theta B or beyond all thought so prashanta forever serene sacred Jyoti eternally eternal consciousness or pure consciousness some odd here Samadhi means the no mind itself a chala unchanging never leave leaves its state up higher beyond all fear so this is a very beautiful description of no mind what is no mind serve observable Ave we gotta service cinta so much data when it says beyond all speech by the organ of speech walk all sense organs and motor organs are represented so by you it is often a technique in Sanskrit they will mention one Raksha huh the Sanskrit but protection means direct perception but literally it means that which is presented to the eyes but it's not just a eyes aksha the word Akshay means eyes but it also means ears by extension by extension yours no skin taste touch all of the stung and skinned all of them all the five senses are meant by the knowledge by the five senses is referred to by the word protection though literally it means presented to the eyes similarly here by the word beyond speech beyond the activities of all organs so beyond the eyes beyond the nose ears skin tongue beyond hands feet so it's not something that it means it's not something that you see or hear or smell or taste or touch it's not something you can walk to what pilgrimage can undertake to find this great Toria devatha you cannot walk to it it's not something that you grasp so it's not something you can express my words so none of the indriyas the ten - indriya the ten india is the ten organs of sense and action johnandrich our main three sends an action none of them can objectify all right I can think about it understand it Tsarevich in Tassimo theta her transcending all thought it sounds cool but what is it it's you transcending does not mean out there it's you in there you are the one who deploys thought you are the one who employs the ten organs but you are not under an object for them neither for thoughts not for the ten organs this is too real what is the nature of this Toria soup Prashant forever because it's beyond the sense organs beyond motor organs beyond mind it is therefore eternally at peace there is no problem there problems are at the physical level in this world well fall asleep dreams also have problems they are bad dreams and nightmares and deep sleep no apparent problems in deep sleep but the seed of all problems is there it will come out come out again the moment you come out of it so but this this Turia beyond all three beyond the causal beyond the subtle beyond the gross beyond deep sleep beyond dreams beyond the waking this is beyond all suffering so prashanta in the seventh mantra in one dokapon assured shantung Shivam does anthem anthem means beyond all sorrow secrete Jyoti its nature is of pure consciousness I keep translating as pure consciousness but you know the best way of understanding it is this it's not even pure consciousness the closest description we can give is pure consciousness there are many ways of in tweeting this Advaita Vedanta is very philosophical but there is a system called Kashmir Shaivism so there they have many ways they have developed many ways of giving you a taste of it or a foretaste of this of this pure consciousness there's a text called began a bed of aware there are a hundred and twelve techniques of meditation for example one they say imagine you're lying down and looking up at the vast blue sky you can in Central Park you can actually do it you lie down and look up at the vast today the sky was an extraordinary color - the beautiful light very translucent kind of magical light today this morning so you're looking up at that the vast blue sky now you're looking up at that a vast blue sky and now with nothing else except the sky just throw your mind into it is nothing else except the vast blueness hole there and then in a moment dismiss that just let it go what will remain is an unexpressed awareness that which was aware of the vast blue sky and then drop that we can successfully do it the mind will plunge into Samadhi if nothing else you'll get a taste of varied extraordinarily deep peace so that's one technique there are many such techniques that they have developed but all of them that gives you an idea of what is meant by pure consciousness it's not immediate that what is misleading about it is we think it's the awareness which we have right now it's not that it's close to that but it's not that the difference is like when you see your face in the mirror yes it's the face you're seeing in the mirror is your face but it's a reflection of your face it's not the real face what you are seeing in the mirror is a reflection of the real face it's not your real face and the real face cannot be seen what is seen is always a reflection directly you cannot see a real face so the awareness that you feel in the mind right now is like the reflected awareness so when you means pure consciousness it's not not that one but from there you can go back to it pure consciousness secrete Jyoti Samadhi this pure consciousness this Toria forever beyond suffering is also called Samadhi here Samadhi does not mean yogic Sumati here Samadhi means that no mind state where you have the realization I am Turia I am Brahman that is Samadhi Salah unchanging to distinguish it from our usual state of mind our usual state of mind always changing new thoughts and ideas come and go and then the whole thing's disappears into sleep and we have a whole new set of thoughts called the dream world which seems to be the way you don't call it the dream world you don't say that ah now I have entered the dream world let me look where as my passport and no it seems to be a waking world only later upon reflection you call it a dream world and then that also disappears into deep sleep so these are the major states of the mind Chalam jolla means changing but this no mind never changes it is the same in waking same in dreaming same in deep sleep because it is the tour iam up higher what is the result of all of this you go beyond fear you go beyond suffering you go beyond fear there is no fear anymore what will you be afraid of there is nothing else other than you there's only one non dual reality that is immortal you cannot die that cannot be hurt the body can be hurt the mind can be heard you cannot be hurt that is beyond change and yet you are right here in this world that is the beauty of it you don't have to melt the to get the gold in the necklace or the ring or the bracelet do you have to melt the ornament down into a lump of gold let it be a bracelet let it be a ring but you know what the gold is now you know in that sense so this is again no mind these are very grand verses then one more there are two more verses dealing with the no mind 39 thirty-eight yeah thirty-eight graha not etre note circa Gras ho not eternal circa Jintao yet trinova deity Jintao yatra Navi dirty Atmos mhmm tada yharnam Atma some some tada Yanam a dirty saw matam Gotham a dirty summer Tom Gotham she's building up to a climax which will come into 39th verse where he will conclude and call all of this what he has taught he'll call it he'll give it a name especially over he will call it so graha not a true note circa ha there is no acceptance or taking there and no giving or releasing they're not cinta no thought yet run a bit dirty there is no thought where there is no thought yet remains where doctorate try using the trim is there yet remains where there where what interior interior and in your real nature graha with saga graha means accepting with circa means giving up all rejecting this accepting and rejecting giving and taking this is the basic nature of varaha or a transaction samsara here everything is this is nice I will pursue it this is bad I must avoid it thought this is called probably cleaner if depravity means moving towards never flee means moving away from and it depends upon what we our likes and dislikes rargh of Asia so ragged racial likes and dislikes and our likes and dislikes are depending on our conditioning and on our body mind situation likes and dislikes giving rise to thoughts of I move towards something something some place some food some person away from another place a job a person an activity a state away from that I like to be all the young never old this shop forever 21 or something so always like that I will be graha good circa I don't want to be older but you know it's strange I'm happy to be old we build we'll say just you wait Swami it don't be too happy sir graha wood circa ah there's an attractive state I want to be like that there is a unattractive thing but that depends on product in everything what I'm moving towards what I'm moving away from and the probability and ability are in the mind moving towards moving away from and that is expressed in the world as graha catching grasping would serve a letting go or rejecting the whole thing is samsara and it is based on a delusion the delusion is I am this body mind and here is a world apart from me the way we look at it and therefore depending on my body mind situation there are certain things in the world what getting there certain things in the world you one must avoid and this is what life is this is samsara none of it is there in the real self you are not it makes no difference to you if all is Brahman then what is therefore grow out circle what is there to accept what is there to reject or if all is like a dream and you are the reality beyond this dream in your dreams what is really what purse we accept waking up think about it really speaking in the dream what is worth pursuing waking up to the reality that is the dream after that also you may continue dreaming but it'll be a lucid dream the only urgent thing in a dream is to wake up to the fact that it's a dream but all the pleasurable tempting things present in the dream are they really worth pursuing no all the terrifying anxiety causing stress causing horrible things in the dream are they really worth being worried about no no only from the waking perspective of course yes so in from Turia perspective all the give-and-take of the waking world all the give-and-take of the dream world and all the potential give-and-take in the seed farm in the deep sleep all of that is as if nothing so this is obvious re-emits at an explanation of one word which was used in the seventh mantra beyond transactions beyond give and take when do you get this it sounds nice when do you get this Dada then when yharnam when you get this knowledge what knowledge a humdrum has me I am Brahman I am tutorial this knowledge will establish you in the real self artemus mhmm Atma Samsom means established in the self I am already established in the self where else can I be I am me I am I wherever what else can I be so I'm always established in the self yes but you don't know it you are under you are deluded you think that you are not you're not tutorial you think you are the Waker which is has so many problems or the dreamer and so on so up Muslims thumb established in the Atman datoria then what happens then whatever you experience a very beautiful phrase is used a GRT summit on Gotham everything is a GRT that means whatever you experience is the unborn what do you mean unborn unborn is equal to uncaused uncaused means this universe has not come from the tour IAM your the tour IAM it's not that the universe has come from the tour IAM it is the tour IAM you yourself are this everything that you see exactly as you yourself are everything that you experience in a dream everything everybody every good and bad experience every tempting experience every frightening experience that you have in a dream is you yourself you remember the story of the princess of kashi by now you are like don't don't tell us anymore we know it back to front now we know it yeah maybe there is true Swami Brahman and they used to say it today to the young Ramachari seems to say Swami Ramananda my children give your body to the world it will destroy you give your body and mind to God even in body and mind you will be healthier you'd be better off little and you'll become enlightened of course but that doesn't mean that the body won't get old it will get old I have seen monks were very very old I have the oldest monk I saw was 105 years old he's still living and and he says my dad lived 208 and my mother lived 210 so I bet I'm young yet he's a tremendous scholar I studied under him many many years ago the disciple of swami began Ananda one of the disciple of sri ramakrishna made last living disciple of swami big young Atmos system Talal yharnam a GRT through the world is the universe is a yachty not born which means non-dual you remember non-causal non causality is equal to non duality non-duality means basically it is you real you which is appearing as your world summer tom got'em and therefore it is one and the same in joy and in misery in success and in failure in the high and in the low it is one and the same what is one and the same you are one and the same the real you from that point of view everything is alright everything is just what American hunky-dory from that point of view the world a lot of things which are wrong and will continue to be wrong you'd need to place their strong awakened to say this place is a gymnasium you build up your spiritual muscles here you do good here but remember ultimate in ultimate sense it is all right and it is that Brahman sama Tom Gotham it's difficult to convey the beauty of the Sanskrit phrase a GRT summit on rhythm the unborn even everywhere evenly everywhere summit on rhythm therefore the grand conclusion 39th verse especially Gavin AMA Esparza yogev a nama dude our survey yogi B dude our survey yogi be yogi no B Beauty has smart yogi no B Beauty has smart Abhay by Adele Sheena variety Sheena Swami Ranganathan she was fond of this verse he would repeat the first line especially especially oke yoga y nama this knowledge here Yoga means the knowledge of Brahman I am Brahman which makes mind into no mind so especially oka literally means the knowledge of esparza here refers to Toria no contact no relation no contact untouched so a special special means contact eyes are seeing something contact your hands are holding the book contact all samsara is born of contact when the self contact contacts the non self not nonsense non-self Atma an Atma samsara is born there if you do not know the Atma if you know the art more then there is no an Atma if you know the Optima if you know the self you know that everything is the self itself so in that case the so called contact also will not give rise to some sorrow that is the Jeevan Mukta state the free while living just just like us walking talking eating but at the same time they know it is all brahman so in samsara like us maybe but there are some sorry so here Esparza Brahman is not touched the Rope is not touched by the poison of the snake which snake the false snake attributed to the rope Shankar Acharya says in the Mirage the water of the Mirage all the water in the Mirage cannot wet a grain of the sand of the desert why why it's false there are two distinct levels of presentation one is the is the desert itself in webinar thick terms it's called via waha Rica and the water which appears there in vedantic terms it's called prety Waseca an illusory appearance a presentation two levels of reality never come in contact they are not there together one is mistaken for the other here they are in contact this book is in contact with my hand look it's in contact with my hand the book is imposed on my hand but the snake is superimposed on the Rope superimposition means what not that there are two things putting one on the other rather one is taken for another one is mistaken for another the Rope is mistaken as a snake in that case if it's the case of superimposition in that case what the superimposed object will not affect its foundation its ground there's a philosophical way of saying that the snake has no effect on the rope The Mirage water cannot wet the desert and samsara does not touch Brahman good for drama I am in trouble you are ramen in your nature as Brahman if you would realize your nature as Brahman right here right now in the midst of samsara you are not touched by some self be like living in the middle of a virtual reality accept that virtual reality is presented to you separately here the virtual reality is nothing other than you you alone appear as your own virtual reality but again remember I am talking about it from the point of view of Turia consciousness I'm not saying that you the person are imagining this world that is not a bad on taste and not saying that that is called subjective idealism Berkeley and idealism the Buddhists began about the mind only school says that but Advaita Vedanta doesn't say that Advaita Vedanta you can take it in a very common-sense way here I am here is a world separate from me but the whole thing is experienced in consciousness I am actually that consciousness esparza samsara does not affect you disease yes disease will affect the body but like a dream disease affecting the body in the dream once the dream dizzy disease affects the body in the dream it can no longer be a dream body I don't know how many of you got that so the body becomes we can sick and ugly and decaying and dying and yet it's all in the dream from the waking point of view it's nothing to you so just like that this body from the point of view of consciousness pure consciousness it's something that's experienced in consciousness it has no existence apart from consciousness it's health and it's disease both are experienced in consciousness consciousness itself healthy very healthy hundred percent health and mind the sorrows of the mind the failures and frustrations of the mind the the curiosity the excitement the boredom all of that comes and goes like clouds in this vast blue sky look sky is unaffected consciousness is not affected by the movements of the mind by the ups and downs of the mind and when the mind shuts down the waking world is not experienced the dream world is not experienced the darkness of deep sleep that also appears in the same consciousness you are the witness of the presence of the mind and you're witness of the absence of mind also both are experienced by you and you are not touched you're not attached another name for a space a Sangha res antic monks repeated and that a Sango humma Sango Sango hum I am unattached as body you cannot be on attack you are definitely dependent on the environment even if you're living in the Himalayas in a little cottage still you are dependent to cold air going to freeze to hungry the body is going to start so body is dependent on the environment though much less than what we think we pamper the body no end and so I was host so much effort is spent in taking care of the body and serving the body and doing errands for the body it survives it's ultimately it's an animal body it's meant to survive so it doesn't require too much the mind also so we run around even more than the body we run around trying to serve the mind its little whims and fancies and a lifetime by one lifetime many lifetimes go by before we awaken to the fact or the one I was serving has nothing to do with me all this time I thought I was that and therefore I was running around trying to fulfill all its whims first it will tell you that oh I want this good food and friends and partying after some time that leads to unhappiness in dissatisfaction mine is very clever mind says oh right right it is not not giving you satisfaction good good no let's clean up your life no more partying and eating and drinking now they'll be only yoga and they'll be healthy food and meditation in the morning meditation in the evening and so your life becomes better definitely so then that carries on maybe a couple of lifetime's this but is this all there is to it then the mind says no no no there's something more there's something called Vedanta okay I'll give you a veil on terka attend the classes I will talk to you about waking dreaming deep sleep I will explain it all to you and then you see how you are beyond or everything so that also might find even that even that you don't need actually don't go away from the class if you know yourself as the Atman you don't even need this this is the final show put up by the mind spirituality and enlightenment because once you attain it you realize you did not need any of it at any time neither the things of the world worldliness is overcome by unworldliness spirituality is necessary to overcome materialism materiality and then you realize beyond spirituality you are the spirit how can you make the spirit more spiritual so that's what happens ah Sangha what are you attached to I think I told the story of the monk he was a great monk in a founder of a big ashram in India I read his life he was a householder then he renounced the world a traditional way and became a wandering monk one day depressed he was sitting in in a forest in the mountains just outside a village and his old woman who was collecting wood said Baba why are you so sad and this monk replied oh I'm unhappy because of you no attachment worldly attachment and she says what are you attached to are you attached to your wife no she died are you attached to your children no they grew up and went away are you attached to your house and property no I sold it off and gave away the money look what are you attached to they've all come and gone and one day this body also very soon it will go away what are you attached to none of them your wife children property body none of them ever said I belong to you really so you can you utter one who's trying to hold on and saying mind but it's not yours it'll go away one day and I'll disappear so unattached everyday this lesson is taught to us everyday this whole life which we clutch my property my people my family and even more than that my problems we think we hate our problems oh no we don't we love them more than all the good things in life you define yourself by your problems unfortunately you define yourself by your friends and even more so by our enemies so there's a story about Picasso as reading he said for some very nasty things about a critic what criticized him but not much but he said some very nasty things about that art critic and he's understood you somebody told Picasso that why did you say such things about this person he has not done any harm to you he's really has not criticized you know and Picasso said ah but you don't know to do great work you need great enemies he's creating an enemy so anyway don't do that don't do that it's easy to lose friends very difficult to lose enemies you make an enemy he'll make many for a very long time so do not so easy so don't make enemies now I'll come to you hold on so we define ourselves by friends and animation and this whole world which you call my life with its grand big be problems and small P prospects hopes and fears hopes and fears and why are you hanging on because the prospect why would I should tell you the story of the prospect its swami ghana and the g who was a vice president of Arad a president over order finally but he told the story to us when we were novices he was a vice president one of the know Most Serene this word sue prashanta absolutely serene I have seen him he why it's important is he was the he was the head of some of our most problematic centers a hospital in Calcutta at the height of communist you know troublemaking trade unionism and all of that lot of problems and we were targeted because we are religious organization and the Communists who later on became very good friends with us but to begin with they thought a religious order are the first target let's so this swami was in charge and get out you know you feel from india you know what psychotic hero is the workers will will surround you if you are in management position and not let you out of your office until the demands are fulfilled so and so many problems yelled at and abused I think somebody threw hot water on him once and what not he was the head of the institution and all throughout he retained this tremendous serenity and calmness don't be good too eager about the question there's a story coming but don't forget your question so I'm taking the scenic route but because actually I have time I don't want I don't want to go on to the next topic this is a different topic altogether anyway but this Swami is so silly in all throughout and it was long before I ever saw him it was before my I became a monk many stories about him and later he became the president of the order later he became an assistant secretary of the order and the general secretary of this big international order so you can imagine how many issues and problems he had to deal with but everybody all throughout nobody ever nobody ever does an any amazing thing monks were known him for 50 60 70 years nobody ever has a story of him losing his temper ever and I've seen it myself a few times I was close to him always centered somewhere deep inside people people job they recognized it did he has found something he's deeply inward somewhere I still remember the first time I saw him I was a little kid and he had come to the ashram the monastery in the city where I grew up I just knew a big Swami had come that's all at that time he I think he was the general secretary of the order or something like that and I was a kid you're not supposed to go up to the room of the Swami there didn't in the ministry so everybody was waiting downstairs all the grown-ups there was a kid I was running up and down here and there so I at once I ran up the stairs and straight barge into his room but there's nobody and everybody was downstairs waiting for him to come down and give a talk I didn't know what it what was going I still remember this was I don't know how many years ago 40 years ago I barged into his room and I still remember his he's just getting ready putting on his each other and getting ready to come downstairs to give the talk absolutely certainly a little kid cry rushes into her room and he just I just said this hmm and then gently he took me down with him downstairs we walked down together so he would tell this story one of the student had made these little stories he would he wouldn't speak much a few things people thought that he was well he had not particularly a great speaker he was not particularly he wouldn't say very philosophical things just a few words all the times little stories a few words for example I remember that when I became a monk and now this he had come to our visit our Russian by that time he was the vice president of the order so at night the whole day was spent in initiating devotees at night he called the youngsters who had come to become monks he called us around him and that also I remember of course he wouldn't remember me as a little kid who barged into his room but I was sitting at his feet and the other monks were there so Swami Gahanna and the G he asked us each one of us why did you come why did you become a monk why did you become a monk a Jew so we all said what we could somebody said I want peace somebody said I want to dedicate my tie I want to lead a noble and good life I want to realize God these are the things which we all said and his only answer was everybody warrants wants to get something nobody wants to give nobody wants to give and that's all he said now that didn't appeal to me because I thought yes we are new in new comers we are youngsters so we have come here to learn you need to be trained and we need to learn so much to learn and become when you grow in spiritual life what can we give but later on I realized the entire philosophy especially of karma yoga is in that little seed it's an attitude it's not a question of I'll be ready one day to blend become a saintly person then I can give no no no whatever you wanted his basic answer and understood what I understood was whatever you wanted peace of mind a noble life god-realization all of that comes from this little seed making the change in your attitude from I want this or I want that you see from vedantic perspective also if I get that meditation I'll be alright who is saying that pure consciousness Brahman isn't a delusion if I get that mystic experience then I will be alright if I get a vision of God then I'll be alright who is saying that God so there is a delusion there it's perfectly understandable what we said but very deep answer that's how he would talk so all this is background for the prospect story which is a very silly little story but very typical of stories he would tell he said the day was once a circus and there was a donkey and ass which worked in the circus and he is not one of the glamorous animals lot like the tigers and bears and lions you know who elephants who would perform in the ring it's just a donkey and ass a very humble creature and his master would make him work hard wood under feed him and once in a while would would whip him and he suffered terribly but he hung on he didn't run away from the from the circus one day one of the other animals maybe it was a horse or somebody one of them you know more prestigious animals said hey you leave such a miserable life why do you hang around just run away get away from this place did they treat you so badly here and the donkey said ah but you don't know I know things are very bad now but I have a prospect a prospect what prospect when didn't you notice a few weeks ago when whenever the ring owner did the circus masters daughter she works on the trapeze and she trains her father is there and he's very harsh and stern taskmaster so she trains and every time she makes a mistake her father curses her and says that you fool you next time you make a mistake laughter that donkey there so the donkey says look there is some hope you know things might get better and the Swami said after telling us he looked at us same expression serene expression with a slight smile if you see the pictures you will see there's always a slight smile playing on his lips slightest of smiles she looked at us and here I still remember he said such is samsara I have some prospect all of this it disappears this whole thing including its prospect also it disappears every day when you fall asleep and the dream world comes an entire world what you call your life totally disappears you can't catch hold of it it will not remain it will go away and the world of your dreams appears and that too goes away with its problems and prospects and then deep sleep blank nothingness darkness and again that goes away and again this world comes back with its problems and prospects what is attached to you what is attached to you what can you call your own own one Swami put it very beautiful he said have you seen those rays of light he said the rays of light which come into your huts in the morning Oh monks like a beam of light and little motes of dust float about there the universe floats in the light of your awareness like the motes of dust in the morning beam of sunshine this is the universe which floats there what are you seeking in it what will what will stay with you what will it give you it cannot it's your joy its millions and they say velocity the velocity say will ask a play of your consciousness alone it's its Leela it's bliss when you realize that but when you identify yourself with one mode of dust wanting another mode of dust then the problem star some sort of stance nothing is attached to you think about it you see our attachment I want attachment oh it's alright you're a monk but I am a person in samsara I have many problems and prospects yeah so take the case of the most serious samsaric I still remember that you have a question yes and I'm glad you remember to take the case of the most see I'll end with this take the case of the most serious intense samsaric attachment a young mother with her baby most intense attachment and yet and this examples I'm not giving me I heard it from a monk in Zurich and in Himalayas yet when she falls asleep finally every night she happily goes into deep sleep letting go mentally from her mind of the most valuable thing to her in the whole samsara and how happily happily what will happen to the baby when I'm asleep till the last moment might think that but that does not prevent her from going into sleep happily and letting go of the entire samsara including that most precious precious baby - so we are you are already a Sangha just note the fact nothing sticks to you you are a Sangha this is called a special realising that is called especially oka oh yes monks if you did not struggle then all would be enlightened then now you'll ask aren't aren't they all enlightened no I wish they were here yeah it's a long process so in fact in some ways we take the plunge and then the struggle really begins you're beginning to walk on the path not just theoretically yes no yes but but remember what is it depressed about not not depressed about money or not because I'm not getting this are getting that why have I not transcended that yet which is a great thing to be depressed about so Ramakrishna if you say every day he is crying because I have not seen God but he shows triggered severe depression prozac you'll forget God know that kind of depression is the holiest kind of thing in the world that's one step away from enlightenment our mentor when we became monks our mentor told us swami under whom we joined three types of people come here when the initial days of her monastic life he's talking about monks he said three types of people come here to be monks one is those who come with enthusiasm I will attain enlightenment God realization and find a conducive environment all the pressures of samsara are removed and the more you do spiritual practice so everybody is happier this is meant for that their way raga dispassion for the world and their desire for God realization moment ricktum desire for freedom that blazes even higher and they strive these are the ones who become the few Saints we know of there are few in number they have come with all desire for God realization for for this the great aspiration calling for for God and when they come to the ministry that redoubles the enthusiasm grows because they have found a perfect place for that so that's one group that's that you know the bell curve that's at one end of the bell curve far end on this end closer to the origin is just the opposite they have come here with a good intention but the moment they enter into this ministry they find intentions are here but it's not intentions which will drag you out of bed at 3:40 a.m. in the morning it's not intentions which we keep you meditating even in the worst heat or cold and so on and working and obedient and giving up every possible personal ambition not just intentions alone the mind has to be ready for it the body has to be ready first specially the mind has to be ready for it and these people at this end of the bell curve defined resistance so there are a few who will find life difficult in the monastery it shouldn't surprise you in every field you will find people they find it difficult so these are the ones who will who will call were the troublemakers who are the misfits who find everything difficult getting him getting up early in the morning oh it's so difficult then meditating I fall asleep classes are so boring and this our work no I don't want this work I want to do that work and so all of that is unspiritual but the feeling is there inside what can they do interesting think that they have come here for the for the for with the highest goal the same goal as the other group with the same intention but the result is there's a huge difference so these people they either drop out and the other ones who caused it disciplinary problems in the monestery they drop out or just hang on this struggle and it's good that they hang on everybody must struggle I took I think I told you the story or something I told of a monk who struggled like that and in his old age he would often mumble that I made a mistake I shouldn't have become a monk and then somebody told him well then go back go back and you don't have to be a monk he said what I made a mistake by becoming a monk and you are asking me to make a greater mistake by going back no I stay here is struggle and that's right that's the spirit so that's also a small group at this end of the bell curve the point of telling the story to us was this one monk told us most of us he said all of us gathered here we are in the middle square in the middle of the bell curve so we we have the we're purity of mind noble intentions the discipline so that we don't struggle here it's okay but we don't have that kind of purity of mind that kind of one-pointed aspiration that we become like those people who are who excel in spiritual life we are somewhere square in the middle life is good nice he would joke a little meditation a little cup of tea and a little work and a little and before you know it sixty years are gone spiritual progress nothing then he said what we should do and he told us because of our good karma he told us so because of your good karma you are you all youngsters you have come here your good karma by the blessings of God by the blessings of your guru you have got this chance but that is a limited thing it will run out very fast you must work hard now you must make an effort now even if the effort doesn't come to you so easily you must make an effort now so that you build up that storehouse of good karma which will which will power you through for the rest of your life anyhow that was I think that's true of everybody in spiritual life not just monks so this is alright now let me complete the rest of this verse this I just I was just explaining especially oka this word especially oka so what is the special yo gazpacho means Turia Yoga means the knowledge of Turia I am that Turia I am Brahman a special yoga is just a new coinage or a very old coinage of gold apart for same up Dwight evident Advaita Vedanta non-dual we're on the gold padas name for it is especially ochre then he says something interesting do - serve a yogi he very difficult to attain by most other Yogi's what what other Yogi's are they referring to Shankar Acharya explains he says serve a yogi he where on to be heater began or ajita he serve a ugv those who are devoid of this knowledge of Vedanta they are trying in their own days they are trying some kind of meditation some kind of prayer some kind of technique they've got here and there there is endless the supermarket of spirituality if you go on YouTube you will find a to see everything is available but those who do not have this way non-dual teaching for them he says it's very difficult to attain what happens to them yogi no Beauty has smart boy by other Sheena ha these did we change this verse yes those Yogi's they are terrified of this teaching the the teaching which is supposed to take you beyond fear the Yogi's are afraid of this teaching that which will make you fearless they be they're terrified of this teaching why why because if you look at it this way no relation no contact as parsha beyond body beyond mind we think our real life is this here it is even dreams we don't weaken don't consider that real beyond that deep sleep we consider is that nothing if you're talking about something beyond that is it's like reduced beings did reduce to zero you're being reduced to nothing from their point of view from the physical body point of view Shankar Acharya here says at Menasha roopam imam yoga manumana by uncle wenti they think i will be destroyed if I practice this I'll be reduced to nothingness not nothingness its infinitude if the ornament realizes you are not a bangle you are not a necklace you are not a tiara you are gold now if person the ornament does not understand what gold is and things I am happy as a tiara I just want to be a better tiara and if you're told you're gold Anora tiara then I'm lost I'm gone I'm nothing there no you are the reality which appeared is the tiara you wanted to ask something here right the orientation is not proper you will immediately feel yes we think of what is our general idea of happiness that that's why Advaita Vedanta is simpler than the simplest and yet it can be terrifying and most difficult it might be easy as a philosophy but people don't want to touch it why relationship our all whole thing is I am this body mind therefore my security my happiness depends on this world on relationships father mother husband wife children employer employee owner owned not just human beings from relationship from God to dog all those they're all based on relationships and hence my happiness is based on this and what I would prefer is you know not what you are telling me that something beyond all relationships especially is beyond all relationships with what will the infinite have relations with what will the infinite have relations with what will the non-dual have relations with literally the non-dual not - how can you have relations in the not-too you look at at least - for a relationship so when it's beyond all relationships it is carry why our idea of happiness is I want a better version of this one I want a better version of this one same husband wife father mother children except they're mean to me here there in heaven God will make sure that they are nice to me and so it will be nice it is just this one in another name and form Hindus in Hinduism and Buddhism you have various grades of heaven Swarga none of them are very spiritual they just if you have a lot of good karma you go to a better place it's still a place you're still an individual and there are better things you move to a better neighborhood that's all better school district that's all and most people somewhere within they feel that is good that's what we want this is far beyond that if you want that the waiters say go back to karma kanda we're by various rituals and religious life and ritualistic life you are assured of good karma after death you will go to a heaven where things are much better for a while and then you come back again but if you want reality if you want truth if you want moksha transcending all of this so I'm you've awakened to put it very clear clearly body lessness must be the idea having a body is being being limited and limited the infinite is limited within a body right so body lessness must be the ideal body cannot be the ideal what we do is better body better body I just mean I don't mean just physical body better circumstances all circumstances are samsara beyond all the circumstances underlying all of them is the reality and the reality is manifested to the circumstances you can still know the reality and be in this world being a body also but then you'll be called liberated while living Jeevan Muktha so that is what that's why it's terrifying so there are different categories the most gross kind of category who might turn up they are not at all touched by Vedanta they say what are you talking about I need peace in the family I need health in the family I need my monetary problems are there and there are social and community problems and here you're talking about wake a dreamer deep sleeper I want basically better prospects in society you know the prospect story so that that kind of mentality is completely untouched by Vedanta for that there are other things on offer for that kind of mentality there are other things on offer whether on the teacher will say go to that party line sit on the trees you know that fellow is sitting under that tree means we go there that person goes and this person person sitting under the tree comes come come tell me a problem all right so such-and-such problem this stone you put on on your ring and this mantra you repeat and you have to pacify Shani Saturn in it so that kind of treatment isn't necessary for this person in that personable thing are something practical that useless fellow talking about waked dreamer deep sleeper to readjust bored me no end so that kind mind is not at all touched by Vedanta the next level of mind hold on to your question next level of mind which understands what we Dante say which has a spiritual inclination but finds Vedanta dry or even scary genuinely spiritual but finds way down to scary or dry because they want a spirituality based on relationship contact sparsa nothing wrong in that their bhakti works very well devotion works very well I am Brahmin very difficult for you to say alright take Brahmin as your Krishna or your Christ or your Nara and as God in heaven and now establish a relationship with God it will work your problem is because of your relationship with the world you replace this relationship with the world with relationship with God it will save you yes ultimately it will God a power would sniff at it but will leave God a father to himself now it will it will liberate us definitely definitely won't work to liberate you of course it will and in the Gita Krishna says if this is the knowledge is what you want I will give you knowledge those who are have one-pointed devotion unto me you see what you want to get rid of crooks a big trouble by crooks one way is instead of trying to fight with them yourself make friends with the police hang around with the police the crooks feels to step away from you the world is giving you problems world you so the relationship is given remember all of the cells at the mental level not physically worldly world is giving you problems establish a relationship with God internally internal solution is also internal so my whole orientation becomes I love God in this form this is my lord I worship God I have faith in God I hold on to God I refer all problems to God samsara is secondary for me God is primary almost all the problems of samsara will disappear there by a relationship a divine relationship replaces a son sorry relationship but that's outside the scope of this here he says a Sangha sparsh a yoga give up all relationships because the truth is beyond relationships yes I'll come to onion Mirage yes that comes later after this yes Sri Ramakrishna would say the bikini comes after non-duality after you realize don't that I am 30 up then you realize all of this is also to him that is the good job actually yes it's good that you've got it [Music] correct and that's my view now you only have to convince I on Mirage that's my view too actually you know the way Advaita Vedanta is presented brahma satyam jagat mithya Jeeva brahma here an upper that's just the first step of Advaita Vedanta this jacket is also the world is also nothing other than Brahman so from there to Vidya evident is one step and I've seen many teachers about the weight of it especially the mature ones who teach advaitha Vedanta what they are saying and what began of a lantern was talking about it there's not much difference there are some other differences but they're not much difference there ultimately there's some differences like goda powder Shankar Acharya would have a very hierarchical approach to it karma yoga gives you a purity of mind worship of God and meditation gives you concentration of my after that come to mondo Kia it will give you knowledge which will liberate you know by karmayoga I can get knowledge liberation no no they will have a very hierarchical approach to it whereas Sri Ramakrishna's approach was very universal yes it's not that you have to do bhakti and karma and then finally come to Vedanta class and then you get liberation no no look at the lives of the Saints of different group periods of history in different world parts of the world how many of them turned up for the Manduca class so you can he simply said with his sincerity and intensity whichever path you take up you will so this is some speciality of began evident which a classical non duelist would would turn his nose up at but so these are other other other aspects also but ultimately it is the same thing I agree with you I agree with you yes yes prerequisites are for Vivica by Rajesh Ahmad Ahmad Rashad sympathy moon should come with a occurred the the discernment of the eternal and non-eternal you should finally move from replacement replacing discrimination by discernment all the old Swami's translated we wake as discrimination between the eternal discrimination is a bad word now so somebody suggested discernment I think it's a very in a fine word and actually that's what vivica means discernment between the eternal and non eternal one record a quiz it second is what you said dispassion intense dispassion don't get me wrong on that right no I'm not telling you I'm telling everybody don't get me wrong on that that that will become the real stumbling block when one begins to get a clear understanding we'll see next what will come the next topic also deep dispassion further if think about it if you are convinced if this seems logical to you if you are convinced that this is an appearance the it's like a dream there is nothing worth pursuing here separately only thing worth pursuing is awakening after that why would you keep pursuing it why would you keep chasing things you might for the sake of the world the life you are leading but they would not be it would not be with the idea that this will fulfilled me you know it won't so if you have a job Arjuna had a job you have to do the job you have a station in life you have to fulfill your duties fine but the whole orientation will be how do I wake up then that that should be the orientation that is that is dispassion not really not really two things one is dispassion and depression are different dispassion and yeah but this yes this passion is not that I have no everything is boring and awful that's not this passion that's depression I have a body see I have a body and a life and a mind let it do its thing if I don't do this thing what thing will I do something else in this thing also enlightenment is possible that's what god of others teaching is and our Krishna's teaching to Arjuna is in the Gita in every sphere of life unless it's absolutely immoral otherwise its enlightenment is possible you don't everybody doesn't have to become a monk you have to become monk like inside that is true does everybody have to become a monk yes and no yes on the inside no on the outside on the outside you may be what whatever you are that is your karma I like that story about the lady who came to Ramana Maharshi and asked do you have to become a monk to become enlightened he said no mother you don't have to then she said sharply then why are you sitting in a cave wearing a loincloth and he said he said that is my karma mother your karma isn't to be a housewife in the kitchen but both of us can become enlightened when you're a monk internally definitely easier true but here also you see that's why people are afraid of becoming a monk let me say talk about this why because of this very philosophy especially ogen no relationship literally a monk is no father mother husband wife children no relationship means how can you live in the world without any relationship for a monk every with everybody the monk has the same relationship all are embodiments of Brahman to me all of us that's the one relationship you have it everybody yes for practical purposes you may have a relationship with your guru your spiritual master but then they're all embodiments of Brahman no special relationship not only with people no money no possessions no house this is Swami you own a whole brownstone I don't own one break up this place so no positions and people get scared then how does one become happy then because happiness comes from people money possessions relationship status in society no status in society that's what a monkey's one I remember the story of a monk who met his friend twenty years after he became a buck his friend had gone on in the world and become a rich and powerful person and so they they met and his friend said look this is what I've done the monk said oh you've earned so much money and house and wife and children so this is what you have and friend said yes so this is my success what have you done and the monk said I have none of that that's my success but that that's what scares people it should not that's what God a pod is is pointing out Hawaii buyers are China those who see fear in the fearless there is actually fear in samsara you are afraid for yourself and then you multiply it when you get married have children you get like that Swami he came that day very nice he said buy one get one free that is the very nature of samsara buy one get one free buy what try to get one happiness you will get once one suffering free but more than one usually a lot of free stuff in the world that's why people are afraid of sannyasa of a monastic life and people make a mistake even those who admire sannyasa even the monks I don't want to be a monk myself but I admire monks they admire it for the wrong reason why they run I'll tell you why many people think like that they come and say Oh Swami what a great sacrifice or whatever ideal life what a great sacrifice you are wrong if you actually inquire any genuine monk will never feel that I made a great sacrifice anybody who thinks that I'm making great sacrifices will have great struggles I wouldn't do those things if you paid me to do it No so it's it's not that it's a great struggle for a person to become a monk by losing all those things and then staying Swami Brahman and there was there and the president of the order in balloon mutt so a devotee comes and vows down to Swami you are worthy of our reverence he said why I bow down to you you have given up the world for God and the Swami even Italy bowed even lower to the man I bow down to you you have given up God for the world your sacrifice is far greater whose sacrifice is greater one who throws away a few pieces of glass to get diamonds or one who throws away the diamonds to get a few pieces of glass so Bahia de shiran people are afraid of monastic life afraid of sannyasa who else what had questions yes but you don't think me admitting this in the name of good and no they don't want and you know what they do after that they destroy it yeah I say a group of Tibetan monks had come to Los Angels and in the in a Cathedral there so they made the mandala so over a period of seven or eight days several hours per day and and we used to go and see and pictures were taken at every stage and then finally they it's all made of coloured sand and finally they wipe it all out and that is the nature of this world I often think when I'm walking in Central Park I see those people blowing bubbles iridescent bubbles in the air and children laugh at it and run after it they're exactly like that just this world is our bubble nice and shiny we run after it and then it pops yes I won't defend its earth yeah I won't defend you go your own way Baba you have prospect I don't have prospects yes yes yes absolutely the vivica Baracus Ahmad Ahmadi shot sympathy so the six four six treasures so Shama control of the mind dama control of the ten organs then diksha spiritual fortitude then some all hana this concentration operati withdrawal actual operative comes first withdrawal from you know too much engagement in sensual pursuits so we drawn from sensual purchase pursuits and then what has been withdrawn that should be concentrated focused settle down settle down on your vedanta so some are hana and then shut down guru Shastra waki what is taught by the guru what is taught in the mandu cure a working faith in it it's the difference between a working faith and faith on which you whole religious life is based on belief that's a different thing and this Shraddha is a working faith believe in it that there's something what understanding here proceed and you will get it I've told you the funny story of in Vrindavan which is the place which is not the place for Manduca but anyway is a place for Krishna and Radha and the love of Krishna and so this West Java babaji Vaishnava monk and very austere if you go to a place like Ramon ray trace of there are shrooms their huts in which monks tape ten twelve fifteen years tiny Hut the whole Hut will be around this much and there among stays for 10 12 15 20 years in meditation so one Babaji baba ji is a vaishnava monk a vaishnava monk so there on the path of devotion he came to a Vedanta teacher was teaching Manduca and he said I that's a faith-based thing we know belief an emotion you know the you have got the right path it's all logic and reason please teach me I want to change change tracks he started first you need the fourfold qualification we Jacob Iran you're very good very good summer Damas then titik shall open at ISA Madonna shut da faith he said what faith here - and that so and and then he said in Hindi Tamera geezer Gopal Kadosh Katy my my beloved Krishna what what fault as my beloved Krishna then I'm going he slammed the book shut and he stomped off in a huff he said if it's weightier you need and I was on the path of it anyway so no that's different that's faith a twosie here it's faith - big enough like you go to Columbia University and sign up for a class you must have some faith the professor is not lying to you the textbooks are have something but maybe I don't get it now but if I hold on I'll get something out of it what will happen now till now from verse number 31 to 39 no mind was taught what is no mind the Enlightenment when you persist in this enlightened mind how do you get this shravana mañana needed the asana by hearing the truth by thinking about it reasoning about it and staying with it which is nice it dancin and staying with it is this no mind so this is a kind of meditation which is possible with open eyes as you must have gotten by now no mind is not stopping thinking but here is a big but what happens now is it will not work for everybody in fact it will it won't work for most people it's not so easy and so now what God a path is going to start on is for most seekers a course of actual sitting closed by meditation Samadhi is necessary so needed the asana same they done Tecna Tadasana now he's going to prescribe the yogic Samadhi the sitting eyes closed meditation eyes open it it hasn't of no mind over but to attain the same state if it's not working for you if it still feels theoretical if it still feels that it is not giving the the advertised results am I sorrow is overcome I shall I'm attaining bliss no I understand if you're stuck at that that I understand and I'm convinced this is very clever this is very interesting this is very direct and it has many benefits I have heard so many people from different angles you know just a couple of days ago one young person was telling me that he one thing he finds now is just by listening to a brighter Vedanta a kind of clarity and standards have been set up so when he says opens up YouTube and the whole panorama of spiritual practices are presented before him he clearly knows he can separate the wheat from the chef he knows what's what what is serious what is worthwhile and what is just it should be discarded or ignored so when you have reached the top of the mountain you know where is what that's one benefit but still you don't feel that you are an enlightened person you don't feel that it is even Mokpo you really honestly cannot claim I am Brahman I understand I am Brahman and I know all the reasons for that I know all the verses and teachings but it doesn't feel very honest to say I am Brahman I still feel and Swami serve a free Ananda and I still react to life as if I'm Swami servo Priyanka still my problems are not resolved what do I do so the knowledge which you have got the knowledge for which clarity has come conviction has come that must become a living reality and that living reality is not happening with the no mind kind of teaching so now vedantic meditation will take the form of closed eye meditation the classic meditation which we are familiar with totapuri it tells Sri Ramakrishna sit down and meditate but that's like throughout the day 24 hours a day so intensive course of meditation until it becomes an undeniable truth what we'll teach now is Samadhi as we understand Samadhi so we culpa someone he need we culpa Samadhi all those things he will talk about all right home shantih shantih shantih hurry he own that sat sri ramakrishna Aparna Musto
