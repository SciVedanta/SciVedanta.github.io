chanting shiva madhu item Chatterton mignon tea sad MA savage a 2/7 mantra which we were doing is this is the real nature of the self this is the actual thing that demand okay open assured wants to teach adi shankaracharya in his commentary you know the text is structured in this way the Upanishad then go to power the scary cos and then Shankaracharya scum entry so in the beginning of his commentary adi shankaracharya on this monday open ishutin carica the first thing he says is this thing which we are going to start now survive a Dantas or a shangri-la butum these these four chapters which are going to study now are the collection of the essence of the entirety of Vedanta so all Vedanta is summarized in these four chapters and all of this is summarized or this is the essences of that essence is in the seventh mantra when we started studying this we were told that all our problems will be solved if you if we know ourselves as we truly are meaning there why we do not know ourselves as we truly are so we need to know the reality of ourselves how do you do that by an enquiry into ourselves what is the process for that enquiry the special process mentioned here in demand opieop initial is the method of the three states waking dreaming and deep sleep it said that you have four aspects one aspect of yourself is you the Waker and your waking world the second aspect is when you dream and your dream world and the third aspect is when you are in deep sleep and your the merged world of the deep sleep the potential world of the deep sleep those are the three aspects and now we come and there is a fourth aspect which is what you really are and now we have come to the fourth aspect we had seen that this mantra you can analyze it into three parts the first and the second parts and negation Nathan 8e not this not this and the third part which we shall enter today the third part is an affirmation it points out what we are the first two parts are what we are not the third part is what we are in the first two parts what was denied Natan it is not this not this what was denied is remember in the first three aspects of the self which we talked about the book talked about in each aspect waking dreaming and deep sleep there is the knower and the known pramatta premier pairs in each one there is a pair what is the pair you the knower and the world that you know now right now for example here you are you are the knower and here is the world that you know so you are the knower pramatta and there is the romania knower and known pair the baker and the wakers world appear in the dream also exactly the same thing you are there and you know a dream world so there's a pair and in the deep sleep also there is a pair we actually do not experience it that way but just for symmetry let's put it this way that you are there as the nor except that you do not have any instrument of knowing so it's not an experience that I know deep sleep it's all merged in sort of lumped into a oneness and the subject and object are not clearly divided in deep sleep but still you can conceive of a pair what is the pair the knower in deep sleep and what does there know or know emerged universe there is no distinct knowledge and in deep sleep so these three pairs no are known pair they are being denied here the first part of an end in the first part second part the knower and known pairs are being denied how are they denied first in nowhere is denied the knower in waking state it says you are not the Waker the knower in dream state you are not the dreamer then so-called nor within quotes in deep sleep state you are not the deep sleeper but how does it start up do you see not the consciousness which is turned inwards who is that the dreamer Nanta protium did you see the first words not the program though not the country you are not the consciousness which is turned inwards not the dreamer now by his program you are not the consciousness which is turned outwards you are not the Waker Narayana Ghanim you are not the consciousness which is a mass of enough indistinct awareness deep sleeper you're not the deep sleeper and then it also goes on to add other possibilities you are not the you are not something in between often questions that come here what a why only waked dreamer and sleeper why not something in between like somebody has a coma or some somebody some state between waking and dreaming or some mystical state where you experience you know God in some form what about all of those states those are also denied no better program not something in between either what about the the omniscient mind of God which you know everything is it a do you mean that no not that they're not talking about God so it denies that no purim it denies that but servic your all-knowing consciousness of God awareness of God that also is not what we are talking about here nah a plug so so no awareness like a rock or a stone nothing no we're not talking about that either so all of them are denied the you know which is familiar to us the first half of the pair of the knower and known that is denied then in the second part other Ashtami Baba harem it is not perceptible to any of the senses it is not available for any kind of transaction or use a gray um it's not perceptive it's not graspable by the organs of action motor organs so all of that is denied what is what are they deny they are denying the knowable it's not anything that is knowable the two pairs know what unknown so here the what you see here these are all knowable you can either you can they're available to your sight or smell or taste or touch arts or hearing or you can go and touch them you can grasp them you can walk to them you can talk about it this is your knowable universe this is also denied it's not it's nothing here none of these so the no unknown pairs are denied and then we come to the third one third part of the mantra starting from a cart Marathi asaram this is what we shall see today here it takes a turn towards the positive it's not trying to indicate what the tour iam is the fourth the so called forth what it is really is what your real nature is remember here it comes the real teaching of the open ocean the Waker and the dreaming and sleeping is not the real teaching of definition it is just labeling our our common experiences it is using those experience to point to something hidden behind the experiences if I use the jewelry in a in a in a jewellers shop to point to the material gold I am not really interested in the ring or the other necklace or the the bracelet I'm interested the material gold but unless some I can use those jewels I can't point out the gold either similarly the tree NORs and the three Nobles are being used to point out the reality hidden by them which is behind them so to say that is being pointed out why I'm using the language pointed out you see it cannot be said if it could be said it would have been said directly but it can't be said in fact Shankaracharya wind starts commenting on this one on this mantra the commentary of Shankar Acharya on this mantra starts with an objection the objection is very interesting the objection is you said wait a minute you said that the way of self enquiry is that the self has four aspects let us examine each aspect one by one and when you wanted to speak about the Waker you said waker dreamer sleeper and Torey um the fourth right so when you wanted to talk about the Waker you remember the third mantra what did you do you went straight ahead and talked about the Waker by sheesh protium the the the one whose awareness is externalized and who experiences the external world you straightaway talked about the Waker when you wanted to talk about the dreamer you straightaway talked about the dreamer the your consciousness internalized turned away from the external world and you dream something in your mind that's the dreamer so directly you talked about it now when you're going to talk about the fourth - Liam talk about it why are you doing this strange thing you start off by saying it's not the Waker it's not the dreamer it's not the sleeper what's going on you want to talk about the fourth talk about the fourth why are you doing this there's a reason for that the reason is there is no other way there's no other way if I want to point out the gory to you I have to bring out the necklace see it's like I said to you here you have three ornaments a necklace a bracelet and a ring but the reality is gold reality is a fourth one if I say fourth and then I bring out the ring or the bracelet and show it to now look here carefully you can object just a minute you said the reality is the fourth just remove these and talk about the fourth when you talk about the necklace you show me the necklace when you talk about the bracelet you show me the bracelet when you talk about the ring you display the ring when you talk about gold show me gold why are you bringing up the necklace and then rendering again because there's no other if the gold is right there isn't it you have to use that thing so you have to use this waking dreaming deep sleep use it how by denying them by bringing them forward and saying it's not this okay yes so there is something that you have to deny here and something that you have to affirm what has to be denied has already been denied it's not done no er it's not Danone way it's not the Waker not the waking universe and that's all we are familiar with that's all we are comfortable with in the world and that's being denied and yet something will be left over in each case that's we are going to try to point that out why I'm saying this is because language cannot be used directly so a technique has Peter this is the technique to point this out there is an an ancient saying you look tia prabhu robert a mood aha tucked away in a private jet a the train about dirty para a Praia ha the the foolish the less competent student has to be convinced with philosophy and reason and logic the more competent mature student it's enough if you point out the truth to him you cannot tell the truth if you tell the truth that's simple enough but you can't because it did language can't express the truth now what can you do one is you can point it out with philosophy with logic which is what most of Advaita Vedanta is all this sophisticated reasoning you come across all the teachings that I do here most of it is reasoning and philosophy why I am NOT the body seven reasons to show why I am NOT the body and so and so forth we might think this is fascinating and it is said to be the dr. Radhakrishnan said it's the fairest flower of Indian philosophy Advaita Vedanta but the wait on teens themselves are this saying it is for the foolish it is for the lesser Nima they got lower Adhikari the lower the less competent student then what is the what is the method for the competent student the method for the competent student is pointing it out like Chinese have a saying a finger pointing to the moon the fool if you point the finger to the moon the fool will think that the finger is the moon and keep staring they're not this what it is pointing to similarly what this seventh mantra is a pointer around the teeny ayah so if the seventh mantra is a pointer it points to something which we must grasp yes yes correct right but it's incredible how how some pretty smart people really smart people it leads me to wonder are they zombies they said that the brain is everything there's nothing other than the brain but a very simple thing when you taste a cup of coffee now the what is happening is neurons are firing in your brain is no doubt about it when you are having a conscious experience of tasting the cup of coffee but if you ask me I am NOT experiencing neurons firing I am experiencing coffee I experiencing taste warmth smell fragrance and the brain there is some neuro chemical activity going on in the brain that is true how the two are related you can't deny completely my experience if you deny my experience you're denying the conscious experience of everybody you're denying life itself you denying the whole of human experience of all kinds of experience in fact the universe goes dark if you say that and there are people who actually deny that this hard problem of consciousness yes yes because you can hear smell think talk and you have no other way of explaining how yes and there is no other way of explaining how you can hear smell talk think the way of explaining this by by saying that the brain does everything is no explanation yes right right one of the reasons why this is called mondo key open assured Manduca means a frog so there's one interesting story it's it's that story which is an interesting example a frog when it leaps it draws back a little and then jumps forward right so in order to take the spiritual leap you draw back a little from the world step back a little from the world this continuous now you have to take two steps back earlier people had to step back from the material world you have to step back from the virtual world into the material world and from material world into yes yes yes we'll do that we will see that no word and the consciousness itself so just a direct answer to your question would be what she asked that if you cannot smell it touch it taste it you cannot think about it you cannot talk about it then how do you know at all that that thing is there and the answer is that which enables you to smell touch talk think about anything that one light shining through all of these activities that that in this way you can know about you can't know about it as an object in the cane opening of the eye of the eye the ear of the ear all right now so this is I wanted to say that this is a pointing a pointing out this is this is beyond logic and reasoning if you're not convinced we will give you logic and reasoning we will give you a greater philosophy people think that's the finer but that's actually they say this is just for people who who are I mean philosophy is for people who are dumb that's what is saying for the people who are intelligent just a pointing out should be enough if I still don't get it after all that philosophy I'm just bewildered but what I don't get it what are you saying then I will be then Vedanta recommends meditation here I'll give you a mantra repeated if that makes me fall asleep then we're on to recommends then you have you have Pujols and elaborate rituals and and do go ahead and do an selfish work and all of that and engage yourself in here's a deity to whom you can I will give you a form to look at and you can wash a Peyton so there are graded levels in it reminds me of Kashmir Shaivism where they have which it's a it's a different philosophy it's not at the weight of Atlanta but one interesting feature of Kashmir Shaivism is they have four graded levels four four ways so to speak about so in Kashmir Shaivism they speak about the highest way is a new pie a new pie means no way way no way it doesn't mean that there's no way it means that in it's no particular way you just become enlightened straight away that's the highest obviously but you can't sit around waiting for it so a way is necessary the second one is they call de chambre ah by the way of sham who are Shiva the way of Shiva which is equivalent to our Advaita Vedanta it's a way of knowledge the third way is shocked oh by the way of Shakti of power of divine mother which is which where you take the help of mantra and meditation so that's only the third way and the last way is called envelope iron WA means the UH no means that the Jiva the individual the atom or the individual the the infinitesimally small individual us so based upon us so what is that way that way is full of rituals full of activities and rituals and chants and Pujols and things like that many many many many techniques are there the last one is the most complicated and most time taking the third one is less time taking it powerful the second one is even more powerful and and very short we just have to know you are it that's it it's done and the first one of course is instantaneous but the first the first one is you can't there is no condition to it might be the grace of God may be the grace of Guru the people spontaneously awaken yeah sometimes yes yes yes yes that's the third the shock to pile Choctaw by that I remember in all of these who piles they all lead to the same realization it's not that if I have to take a simpler path or a more physical path like say doing a puja that will lead me to a slower grade of realization you know Brahman - a subpar kind of a sale Brahman you know they which is you're being given given at a discount no it will lead to that exactly the same realization and Sri Ramakrishna's life it shows he started off by being a simple pujari actually had an image of Kali and he did actually puja with chants and flowers and water offerings and food offerings and he would sing songs so every level of worship he shows right up to the highest all right now let's go on to the third part of the seventh mantra which we were doing it goes like this the first part was not the program it is not the dream an Amish program not the Waker no by the program nothing in between naproxen aghanim not the deep sleeper nopprage am NOT the omniscience of God nah iam not an inert in sentient thing either algorithm it is not available to any sense organ via Behar iam not available for any use or transaction or I am not available for any motor organ Alex Onam it cannot be inferred achene tiem you cannot even conceive of it AB the opposition it cannot be spoken about done nor unknown denied what is it now it starts a carpet a harem so a khatma practice RM is the next next word which comes so let's see what it means I don't feel like rubbing this this is so nice all right I won't rub it I just speak about it a got my birthday asaram how do they translate that which who's valid proof consists in the single belief in the self again not happy but let's put it this way Aker Atma Proctor Salim split up the wording in three parts Sahra means tracing a clue an indicator again a pointer there's only one clue one pointer one trace which you have to get hold off what is that Atma prepare the self cognition in the form of eye this eye cognition which we have the eye experience which we have when all the time you have it in the waking right now you feel I I am sitting here I am listening to evade anta class I'm a man or a woman I am feeling I was feeling cold outside I came by the subway I am happy I'm unhappy I'm excited I am bored so I discontinuous all throughout I'm worldly I'm spiritual I'm interested I'm uninterested all of that I is common to it this Eyck ignition I experience which we have all the time in the waking we have it in the dream also I am seeing all of this later do you wake up and say it was all false or as a dream but you felt I very and in deep sleep - in deep sleep and during deep sleep nobody feels I am sleeping but when you wake up and you look back what did you say what do you say I slept so there was no actual thinking at that time because the mind was shut down but after waking up you claim that sleep for whom for the eye vertical high not a ye this one so I cognition is common to all it is one and unchanging so this one and unchanging I cognition this is the trace the clue the pointer towards the fourth to Liam how is it a pointer what is the process how do you get hold of it and find out the fourth the clue is a cup look at the word ayka Atma practi asaram a khatma practice arm that's not long long words in Sanskrit the oneness of the eye cognition the way he has put it is the single belief in the self not single belief in the cell it's the oneness of the eye cognition throughout our lives hold on to that and notice something about it what happens let whatever happens all our lives it's basically you are adding attributes lot of things attributes which come and go childhood till now I was a baby I was a child I was a teenager I was a young man I'm a middle-aged man I'm I'm an old man baby teenager a young middle-aged old they have come and gone the eye continues or I'm American I am Indian I am in the Northern Hemisphere's your physical location changes the eye continues right mental states I am happy I am unhappy I am depressed I understand I do not understand I remember I do not I forget remembering forgetting understanding confusion liking disliking happy unhappy they have all come and gone they all revolve around around a central high cognition these attributes come and go notice second note that there is something common which lasts all throughout what is that thing which is common which lasts all throughout that I I is common but what is that in I which lasts which is common which lasts throughout everything throughout babyhood teenage youth middle age old it in health and in disease in happiness and in misery in understanding and confusion in remembering and forgetting and desiring and in peace in meditation and in excitement in your virtual world involvement and distraction and in that withdrawn deep peacefulness of meditation in everything what is the one thing that unwaveringly continues the experiencer but what is that yeah what is put these two together she said experience and she said awareness true she's experienced at the ie that means the I it continues but what is the nature of the I awareness continues consciousness continues the attributes of consciousness come and go that consciousness note that that consciousness is not attached to any of the attributes properties qualities which come and go put it this way we always experience the I as I am X I am X and in the place of X you can put anything I am X in the place of X you put anything happy tall short rich-poor remembering forgetting desiring peaceful whatever you want to put now bracket this aside and for the time being focused on the I am you will see if you drop the X if you bracket it aside mentally you can't physically stop it mentally you will see what you are left with is consciousness is awareness is a pure bright light of awareness without any kind of coloration the coloration comes and goes now noticing this this continuous unchanging consciousness this is the clue this is the clue - all attributes - attributes means you're not supposed to erase all attributes the attributes the qualities the experiences they come and go the awareness in which they come and go is one and constant I remember in Canada when I was giving a retreat just outside my room there was this beautiful lake and early in the morning I would see the bright Sun Sun Inn in the lake you would see a blue sky and he would see a bright Sun and then if it got cloudy it would be dark and clouds in this in the lake itself and at night maybe you would see her the dark sky maybe with a shining moon in the lake in the lake itself so what is there in the lake I see blue skies and Sun I see cloudy skies I see darkness with the moon and it revolves and yet the truth is there is no blue sky or Sun in the lake they never were there any clouds in the lake there never was any dark sky or moon in the lake in the lake what was there all throughout unchanging water water that's what is what we are saying now it's not waking it's not dreaming it's not even deep sleep it's just consciousness waking dreaming and deep sleep are because of the activity of the mind activity of the mind generates waking and dreaming in activity of the mind gives you the experience of deep sleep and yet in all of them unchanging is awareness so this is the meaning of a Gartner practice Arum the whole approach of Mundaka Upanishad waking dreaming deep sleep is basically to enable you to see that the awareness is associated with waking dreaming deep sleep experiences then mentally with an act of understanding drop mentally waking dreaming and deep sleep and be aware of awareness there's no other way of putting it sri ramakrishna used this term what exactly happens at enlightenment because you can't know it with the mind he says both hey both hi the consciousness realizes itself both Amin's consciousness consciousness conscious conscious of itself then there's no other way of explaining it it's not consciousness conscious knowing itself with the mind it's not consciousness seeing itself with the eyes or touching itself in the hand it's consciousness without hands or eyes or mind aware of itself through awareness that is enlightenment it is just the water whether early morning or whether cloudy skies or whether night and the moon none of them are actually there in the water it's just the water all the time though you see all the time this is happening ok so keeping this aside mentally intellectually for the time being focus your attention on this our attention goes so much to the experienced world that we forget the consciousness in which are all this is experienced our attention goes so much to the bright blue sky and the Sun we forget that it's in a lake our experience goes so much to the beautiful moon in the dark sky we forget that the water itself is there the water is so still we forget that the water is there first which must be pointed out it is water first we'll see oh ok blue sky and Sun in the water that is first step second step is denied the blue sky and Sun Also even while seeing it there is no blue sky and work Sun there in the water ok so that is called a karma practice arum now we will go into because it is so the next word is prop enjoy purshotham will see prop enjoy fashion what is prop enjoy Pasha mom prop enjoy means universe Oh Pasha mom it's a beautiful word the silence of the universe you are the fourth that awareness in which the universe falls silent it means the cessation of the universe it is translated as where all phenomena cease that's how it's translated so dry philosophical way of putting it but it literally means the word itself propels your upper Shama means cessation quietude questions silence ceasing ceasing of the universe so preppin chopper shaman what universe three universes not one the physical universe of waking then the dream universe the subtle universe and the deep sleep the merged universe of deep sleep in sanskrit stola sukshma car and a puncher stool a prop ensure the gross universe physical baking universe sukshma Provenza is the dream universe subtle universe car and a prop ensure the causal universe of deep sleep so all three are actually not there we're in the fourth in the awareness which you are just like remember the lake remember the lake example the Sun and the blue sky is not there in the lake it is just water and come to the cloudy skies the clouds are not there in the lake just water and the moon and the dark sky not there in the lake just water so just like that the entire waking phenomena the entire dream phenomena and the merged causal state of deep sleep are not there in the awareness where they appear yes no no it isn't when we would say I want to go back to the dream to have feed sights something like pizza it's something different from me it's really there and I am this guy who loves pizza so I need to have that pizza that's ignorant whereas an enlightened person who might say want to come back is that I myself in all these forms and suffering from ignorance that might be the attitude the suffering is real no that's why I'm distinguishing I'm distinguishing the two when I say I want the pizza I clearly say I am this person and the pizza is different from me and I need to put it in my mouth to enjoy the taste that's why I need the pizza I am a subject that's an object and it is a separate reality that's why I need to add it to me I will be complete I will be full if I eat the pizza but but the enlightened person doesn't see that way enlightened person sees if I am the awareness in me alone all of this is appearing so dad guy all those people in the world they are none other than me their suffering is my suffering so that might be an attitude of an enlightened person so I'll go back to help them to that realization which I have got already there isn't it comes from oneness it does not come from difference true it might there are enlightened people who might say that it depends on the attitude remember these are models what we are talking about to point you to an enlightenment what will happen after you get enlightened will you look back upon the world and say I need to help everybody and bring everybody to this beautiful place I am in this realization you might then you become a volta or will you say it's all a dream this oneness is all that exists let me merge into it and be there forever then you disappear beyond the range of human experience forever yes so they speak about enlightened people of three kinds it's not go into different bundles let's just stick with what we are going here right so even the jar and the air in not the air inside the space inside in space outside that's the model so that model you can can apply it here the other thing is you have to leave it be because there is no compulsion after enlightenment an enlightened person has to help everybody no not necessarily true but but but in the absolute also see there might feel I've given the example of the wave and the ocean there are reasons why an enlightened being might want to help others and that's why they become the avataras and the Buddha's what I'm trying to say is that the enlightened avatara's and the Buddha's and all are enlightened beings it's not that they don't know this and they have not realized it they have and from that point of view they want to help us they are not like I'm responding to your pizza example they are not like that speeds are there and I'm going to go back and try to have it it's not like that three types of enlightened beings Swami Amira Angie speaks about it in his essay on gourmet Poli not evident I think so he says after enlightenment up they liberated while living Jeevan Mukta might have three kinds of attitudes three different approaches to what to the world one is might completely ignore it might might want to remain in Samadhi like Vivekananda when he got near weak alpha Samadhi and Sri Ramakrishna asked him what do you want he said I want to remain in this state forever once in him I will come down have a snack but otherwise I'll remain I'll remain in this state for a but I found it I'm I want to I want to be one with God that's it and Sri Ramakrishna condemned him for that he said a Phi upon you I thought you'll be this great tree under whose shade thousands will find rest and succor here you are only thinking about your own liberation but that's not to say that's a low state that's possibly the highest state that humanity can ever and ever for so that's incredible me being one with the divinity so that's possible - that's one one state and many enlightened persons would would be satisfied with that there's a second state where you don't ignore the world altogether the world appearance is seen like magic like you see the sky in the lake its water but how wonderful look in the water there is a Sun and the sky and clouds and birds and trees everything so clear in the water it would feel like magic and this person is delighted by it these are usually the crazy men of God they look like madmen to us there was this person in Dakshina schwer in the Kali temple a yogi who would stay all day long meditating in his hut but once in a while would come out of his Hut and look at the temple and the river and the sky and and say wah wah wonderful wonderful Bravo and go back into his home and meditation and there were a number of such crazy people who visited enlightened people who visited duction in short there was a person would would rest in rags and long beard and unkempt looking and he had I think a plant in his hand a mango tree in his hand a little seedling a mango tree in his hand why would nobody knows and he walked into the collet and people thought he was mad it was mentally ill or something but when he walked into the Kali temple he chanted a hymn to Cali and in three nomination his words the whole temple vibrated it's like the mother you know came alive and looked at him so and I'm Krishna said he's a fully enlightened being but acting like a crazy person he said the whole temple shook with that with the chanting of that person so that's the second attitude towards the world a magic show the third attitude is the enlightened person's heart melts with compassion here are all these beings and he recognizes they are none other than me here in fully feeling of oneness but I must lead them out of illusion into reality so that person becomes an avatar or not that person doesn't become an avatar that person becomes a teacher world teacher the Buddha said to ideal for example anyway now we are we are we are now going to dismiss the world so preppin Joe pochamma proppant Joe pochamma means the quietude or cessation of the three universes gross universe subtle universe and the causal universe stole a sukshma car and a popinjay tram initial initiator means negation now note one thing here I'm going to make two statements one is reality cannot be negated that which is cannot be negated and that which is not unreal need not be negated negated means what what do I mean by negated understood to be an appearance by knowledge falsified by knowledge take the example of this snake and the rope if it's a real snake no matter how much you keep saying it's a rope it's a robe it's not a snake it's nothing that is going to come and bite you it's you cannot you cannot realize it to be false by an act of knowledge if it's really a snake okay and second if there is no snake that you see there no no false neck there is no need to negate anything no need to see the falsity of anything it's not there what needs to be negated the error called the snake are you with me there is really a rope I mistake it to be a snake and then I get scared then I need to be shown that it's not really a snake it's just a piece of rope it's harmless piece of rope that's necessary let me put it in another way mm-hmm what needs to be corrected if somebody tells the truth there are three three things I will tell you three statements somebody tells the truth somebody keeps silent somebody tells a lie which one needs to be corrected the third one the first one cannot be corrected because he has told the truth the second one need not be because there he has not said anything silent third one needs to be corrected are you with me a lie needs to be corrected by the truth so in the same way the real cannot be challenged the real cannot be negated cannot be challenged cannot be corrected the unreal need not be corrected it's like being silent if something is not there at all then you no need to talk about it no need to do philosophy or Advait about it but what needs to be corrected is something that is neither real nor unreal in sanskrit now such nah acid that means that which is assert means that which is not is there anything in between which is neither is nor is not yes what is that for example the snake rope it is not there's no such thing as that that that snake is not there but we cannot say that it's not there either because we saw it we may so it's an is a mistake needs to be corrected a mirage water Mirage water the water is not there it's not real but it's not unreal either because we saw it we saw something there we thought it sell water and it needs to be corrected because we are in error a dream nothing in the dream whatsoever happened when you wake up you say nothing happened it's just a dream good dream bad dream a nightmare it didn't happen but you cannot deny that you saw it that you cannot deny so it needs to be corrected that it's just a dream it did not happen so errors dreams illusions they need to be corrected the truth cannot be corrected it's true that which never is experienced need not be corrected but that which is experienced wrongly incorrectly in illusion in delusion that needs to be corrected and that can be corrected by knowledge now there the contention of Advaita Vedanta is the entire universe physical universe subtle universe causal universe is exactly like this it's not real like like Brahman pure existence consciousness bliss it's not totally unreal also it's neither real nor unreal it can be experienced we are experiencing it right now example the blue sky and the Sun which I saw in the lake it's not real there's no real blue sky or Sun in the lake it's just whatever but I saw it I saw it so that has to be corrected there's no blue sky or lake there even after connection what happens what do I see blue sky and bright Sun in the lake but I know it's just water every bit of it is water in the same way it has to be corrected that in that fourth that pure consciousness in which all the attributes are coming and going and that we saw a gardener practice Arum in that pure consciousness which you are the three universes are not their physical universe subtle universe causal universe are not there but they appear this is not existing and yet experienced there is a word in Sanskrit for this media false technically the false is that which is not true and yet experienced it's like a lie telling a lie it's not true and yet you did say something I did say something it's wrong I did say it I did not keep silent so this universe is not silent it's there continuously expressing itself to us yet it's not real even when you take it to the example of gold and the bangle and the necklace and the ring what is real in all of them is the gold the bangle and the necklace and the ring are you see are they lies in one sense yes are there two things gold and necklace no there is only the gold necklace is a name and a farm and a function that is can you show me the necklace apart from the gold you cannot there are not two things there are two words gold necklace but show me two things I can show you ten and cap two words I can show you separately here is a pen and here is a cap but if I say necklace and gold I can't show you two things separately pointing there by that necklace they say in chandogya upanishad watch RM madam vicara the necklace has only words for its support it exists in word in language it does not exist in reality so what is go reality gold and gold is only reality compared to the necklace but gold is not reality compared to the earth element which is composed of the earth element is not reality compared to Maya from which all the five elements come altom utley it goes back to pure consciousness so other than pure consciousness no second reality the three universes are false you wanted to ask something you talked about truth silence and life yes they're not silence they are not truth they are not silence they are the lie all three universes are the line I'm not matching the three universes to truth silence and lie none of the three universes are the truth what is the truth you the pure consciousness look at it this way the lake which I saw outside my door or outside my window and in the lake I saw three things I saw a bright morning sky with the Sun one that's one universe I saw the cloudy sky - that's one universe I saw the dark night with with them with the moon that's a third universe now all three are lies because after all what's there in the lake only water whatever you see it's only water right they are appearances now what about the three three universes I saw in the lake they appear and yet they are not real they are in the lake in the same way the three universes which appear to you and you cannot deny the appear to you they appear every day here you are in one of them look then you will be running another one in dreams and then they all will merge into a third one which is causal universe darkness all three appear to us every day and yet you're none other than like the water of the lake none other than the awareness in which they come and go in that awareness there is no universe so that awareness is prop enjoy pochamma the Silence of the three universes there's a song which we sing in Bell hermit it was one of Swami Brahma Hahn and his favorite songs yeah Shankar Acharya moon magna hey Rory oh my mind remain merged indeed at the feet of the Divine Mother Shankar is divine mother remain merge in the mind of the divine mother ching-chong sharma t me che bro me about Audrey that these three universes are false they in vain do you roam about in them which three universes the waking universe the dream universe and the deep sleep universe how do I roam about them in baking and in dreaming and in deep sleep in vain do you roam about them roam about in these three universes roam about means I'm trying to make a living in these three universes and trying to make a living in these three universes but never if it was possible if you ever succeeded Godspeed to you but we have not succeeded we have just increased our suffering because we are dwelling in falsity that's why we are suffering so much you root yourself in the the background consciousness the forth then all three will be joy to you entertainment like mr. conductor says to agony everything is entertainment to the enlightened person everything is entertainment the all three universe you look at the lake and admire the beauty of the morning sky and the Sun in the lake and admire the melancholy of the clouds in the lake and enjoy the beauty of the darkness and the moon shining in the lake doing all the time none of them are true they all come and go what persists is the lake right and those three universes they are false they come and go and they are none other than the lake itself you're asking the lake is in and through all of them every bit of those three universes are the lake and the lake is something different from me but here you are the reality so everything in this universe is false and also everything is in this universe is you don't do of equivalence then I am false no false means they seem to be separate realities they are not separate realities I am all of this in what sense I am the consciousness in which they appear in which they have no separate identity I am alone appear in all these forms yeah imagine if you were the lake itself this is what it say you are the lake prop enjoy purshotham silence of the three universes all right now not something that which you see in a dream cannot be counted in the waking true hmm I had a cookie which I liked very much then I went to sleep and I gobbled up three more cookies in dream I'm gonna wake up I say oh I have exceeded my sugar intake I have taken four cookies no you have not I've taken only one cookie the three cookies of the dream cannot be counted they don't exist if you win a lot of money in the lottery in a dream that cannot be counted either unfortunately but at the same time if you get a ticket in a dream that also is not to be County you don't have to turn up in court to pay the time no you don't have to so none of them not needed the good not desirable not the undesirable things in a dream are to be counted in other words there's something I'm driving at the one-two-three waking dreaming and deep sleep universes are not to be counted why in the 4th they have no existence they appear but they have no existence so the 4th has no second you the pure consciousness which is the fourth with respect to waking dreaming and deep sleep actually waking dreaming and deep sleep are not separate from you it's not one two three and one two three and you are fourth no you are the one without any second what happened to those three they have no independent existence apart from you therefore you are one without a second or do item once you see the next there will be a word or two items anthem Shivam or do item I'm jumping ahead and not forgotten the two words chant ohm and Shiva I am jumping ahead to Advaita non-dual that consciousness which is a khatma practice arum which is traced by the one unchanging eye cognition in that consciousness the three universes disappeared they cannot become so that one consciousness is non-dual without a second reality you are non-dual your Abdo item without a second reality there is clear these two words are very important prop enjoy pajama a do item the cessation of the three universes or the Silence of the universes in you and the non duality of consciousness which you are these two words are very important and go depowered arch area he will write two chapters on them each word he will write a chapter the second chapter is entirely on profanity or pajama the silence of the universe is a falsity of the universe the whole chapters about the falsity of the universe he deploys a lot of logic of reasoning to convince us that the universe Dovie experience it it's only experience like a dream it's not real that's the second chapter if you want to understand why I bright the keeps on harping on the unreality of the universe unreality of the world then the second chapter is for you will will study that it eventually the third chapter ad wait up recurrent which means a chapter on non duality the whole chapter is written on this word addto-item how are you non dual how can we understand it through reasoning and experience not just because the Upanishad says so but reasoning and experience that's the third chapter so two whole chapters I think the second chapter there are 36 or 30 30 s for 38 verses and the fourth chapter has 48 verses so total of 86 verses he will write about these two words the cessation of the universe and the non duality of the self because you are non dual and because the universe is just an appearance on you then we go back to the word then what is the result of this enlightenment you see what has to be done is okay so this I will come back to those two words shantung Shivam later on let's go ahead the next word will be sir Atma octoman ent next word is chatter Tom Magnanti people think it is the fourth which what is the fourth you the real self waker dreamer deep sleeper and the fourth tattoo thumb money and the people think it is the fourth the real self is the fourth who thinks it is the fourth Shankaracharya comments the ignorant people think it's the fourth what do the knowledgeable people enlightened people think it is the one it is the one - the ignorant the fourth I have learned man Tokyo it says there are four aspects of the self one waker dreamer deep sleeper and the real aspect a fourth one that is me ignorance Manduca keeps on saying it is the fourth it calls it the fourth also and say those who call it the fourth are ignorant when you realize the secret of the Mundaka Upanishad you will see it is the one then what about the tree they are not real it is the gold of which necklace bangle and the ring are manifestations they are not there is no third no one necklace bangle ring other than decode there is no maker dreamer sleeper other than detour iam the consciousness done changing consciousness which you are so people think it is the fourth ignorant and in enlightenment people know it is the one without a second so-called fort is one without a second it's like this oh good they're doing well for time so when we first started we were told so I am NOT much a touchpad we went inquire into the cell to the end cut the self has four aspects waker dreamer sleeper and to Liam now he's saying this is wrong it's not like this what's it like it's like this the fourth one is this - Liam and it alone appears as the Waker and the dreamer and it's the sleeper just like gold alone appears as bracelet on necklace and ring okay with me so far all right what else saw Atma all this we are talking about right now the torii um this one which appears as the Waker in the wakers universe which appears as the dreamer in the dream universe which appears as the sleeper and the merged potentiality of deep sleep all of this it is that one reality tour iam saw Atma it is the self it's you it's the real you serve again yeah but you have to do now serve again that has to be realized realized means right now what we think of ourselves is the Waker experiencing awaking universe but the open assured suggest we do is this I which refers to the Waker there's reference has to be changed to to diem you should start thinking of yourself as the fourth when Oh after realization when I get Samadhi or at least when we complete the Manduca course know from today right now onwards it won't matter it won't be any problem at all it will be all all do all for the good sooner you start the better it's just acknowledging the truth about yourself try to take that standpoint and the one awareness in which this body and mind has come and am experiencing a waking world soon this will disappear from my aware from this awareness which I am and a dreamer body mind will come and experience a dream world soon that will disappear and experience a blackness again the waking will come back I am the one untouched consciousness and the Waker and the waking world and none other than me I experience myself as the Waker in the waking world I experience myself as the dreamer in the dream world that's easy to understand that I experience myself as the dreamer in the dream world just like that from the pure consciousness point of view I alone am the Waker and the waking world whole waking state is nothing like like I mean nothing more than like the sunlight and the sky reflected in the in the lake so I am that consciousness so begin your how you have to realize this start thinking about it start start thinking that you are it ah hum Brahma has me I am Brahman right now you will find it's not difficult it's not difficult to be interesting life will become very interesting very soon that's one then what will be the result now let me go back to the words I'd left earlier shantung Shiva Shanta means peace not peaceful the mind can be peaceful my world can be peaceful it can be quite peaceful outside snowy and quiet or not that's peaceful but you are peace itself your name is peace the mind may may be peaceful may not be peaceful but you are peace itself shantung this peace what does it mean the end the cessation of all misery the end of all suffering the moment you shift right now if you do that shifting you are beyond all misery because all misery is in the waking universe and it affects the Waker all misery is in the dream you verse it affects the dreamer and deep sleeper has no misery as such but the seed of all misery is there in the deep sleep it will come out the moment you wake up and all you dream so deep sleeper potential misery potential for mischief dreamer plenty of mischief there Waker lot of mr. manesis like miserable world Buddha said do come do comes are one to come all is dukkha here but from the turian point of view you can look at the Buddha and say you are a Buddha I'm joking hoodoo means fool but the means the wise one so now the Buddha is not the full of course but Buddha actually stands here and says to us who are here that all your life is misery from this point of view no misery shantung what problem does this have nothing no problem at all ok by the way I'm good we are going to do a different meditation today just now I'm almost done we will do that meditation where we'll actually try to stabilize ourselves in in the tour iam you might think that's a really ambitious thing to do it's not it's considering how you are it why should it be ambitious at all you always be in it and it's always available to you Sean dumb and one more word remains Shiva Shiva means anand bliss so your real nature is this one is bliss itself Shawn Tom Shivam remember the whole promise of Vedanta was what will happen at the end of all this exercise do connect exactly remember the promise the selling point the carnivorous TR in the property what we want in life this is what connects bed aunt which seemed might seem like Airy speculation philosophy with our day-to-day requirement of life we want wellness we want happiness we want peace we want to overcome suffering that is what is promised here and that's what the word stand for Shanta transcendence of suffering very important word transcendence remember when the waking universe comes up in europe in the lake of your awareness it will bring with it all its suffering if the body has cancer he bring with its cancer if Ramakrishna's hand was broken when he fell down his samadhi and enlightenment don't change the fact that the hand is broken in the waking appearance so all of that will come but here the lake it transcends because it's real and that is not real it transcends it's not affected by any of that so remaining in this awareness you can experience this within yourself without any problem transcending the suffering xantham and Shivam being bliss so attainment of bliss and and transcending suffering was the promise and that is what is attained if you stabilize yourself here it's neither experienced nor is it part of everything it's just the opposite it's the it's the core of the experiencer it is the light behind the experience that together with the body mind become the experiencer pramatta it's not part of everything everything is part of it and everything is not part of it also you are the turian acting is the Waker it's like the lake saying think of yourself as the lake but I am the Sun and the sky how can I be the lake that's what you're asking the wave doesn't have to think of itself as notion the wave has to think of itself as the water is the way water or not no no tell me is the wave water or not so it is is there any harm in the wave thinks of itself as water know there's only benefit and is it true if the wave thinks of itself as water it is you it's like the Sun and the sky reflected in the lake and the lake says how can i who am the Sun and the sky think of myself as the lake oh you are the lake what has happened is your entire attention is on the Sun and the sky and you think they are real they're not real they are appearing and they will go away when they go away if you think you are the Sun in the sky you will be I am dying I am dying I'm gone I'm finished the cloudy skies come on you think that's gone and something new no you are the lake you where the lake you are the lake and you will be the lake come day or night come rain or sunshine or snow snow snow fall entire consciousness and part of it think about it does anybody have an answer to that there is no entire in part think about it when you are just think about but Wendy you have now woken up pouring from your dream it's like the dream are saying how can I think of myself as the entire world how can I think of myself as the entire world but when you wake up from the you don't have to go to Toria to wake up from dreamer to maker are you not the entire world of the dreamer from the in from the consciousness point of view again the language is important you are not entire consciousness or part of consciousness entirety and part are all appearances in consciousness consciousness itself has no entirety or parts when you think of yourself as entire and part that is vashisht ugh do it it is the difference between vashisht advaitha advaitha part and whole relationship we she stabbed waiter oneness a radical oneness advaita non duality okay there is no other there's no whole and part also there's no big and small see when I say ocean wave and water it's still the feeling you know what the feeling will be the ocean has lots of water and the wave has a little bit of water so I am the water and ocean is also water but not quite exactly the same water because ocean has lots of water and I am only a little bit of water no that don't extend the example that's why the examples are double-edged swords they will put an idea into you they can clarify something but they'll put an idea into your mind which will take a lot of hard work to clarify yeah which one which pad yes yeah right right it's useful the Tibetan Buddhist have something called dream yoga in fact they did it at the Rubin Museum last year they had a program you have to sign out sign up for it then you go to the museum in your pajamas and then you get to sleep you can choose the Buddha you want to sleep under so the Buddha's statue is there or the picture icon and you sleep there with your bedding and you dream you say what if I don't dream don't worry about it they'll take care of it you use go to sleep and somewhere in the night you'll be woken up by these people in I guess in white lab coats or whatever and they're going to immediately they wake you up when you are in REM sleep and ask you about your dreams and so night after night they will take that and then it is analyzed not in a Freudian sense but in a in the for this purpose to see that there is no difference between vague and dreaming like the Chinese philosopher who dreamt he was a butterfly butterfly and he woke up and he thought am I have Lhasa for dreaming that I am a butterfly or I'm a butterfly dreaming that I am a philosopher so that's the danger of the lucid dreaming path I had a friend a monk I have a long time ago when he was a student he practiced this and he said he stopped he who has actually could know the two experiences melted into each other and he stopped we got a bad shock when the two words became interpenetrated there were elements and people and events from the dream world coming into his waking world and so he could not tell the difference and that alarmed him so much he stopped doing that but it's a very interesting experience yes there isn't why is there no form why is there sometimes form and sometimes no firm that's what you're saying why do we here for example why do we cycle through waker dreamer sleep or waking dreaming deep sleep why not pure consciousness as pure consciousness that's all right that's the thing which we discussed earlier do you remember before we went into the seventh mantra go to pod asks this question why and there were different answers why does the one appear as the many the same question so one answer was Maya one answer was it's you know the devotional answer is the play of God do many many answers possible what was God about this final answer it's it's very nature you look at the the carica number nine I think Karrie Kagoda podgorica number one it's not a question that is raised in the opening shot but go to podraces he knows that we will ask this question so he raises this in carica number nine yes number nine Bogart um Srishti returnee Creed automata chopper a Davis J Schwab ha Boehm opteka mashiac Osprey ha so different theories are given some say it is because that consciousness wants to enjoy itself actually a pretty deep answer you remember Alan Watts story God wanted to play hide and seek read Artem because of play it's Leela the divine play of God so devotees might want to think about it that way but GABA doesn't buy any of it including the Maya theory ad waiters answer is Maya because of Maya it appears in these forms but God epatha doesn't buy any of that he says Davis CA Schwab harem this is how the forth shines if you say why did the Sun become the light it could have remained as the Sun but being the Sun means radiating light isn't it the Sun being what it is means it pours out light and heat in the same way the tertium is what it is it pours out the universe it shines as the universe a gross way of looking at it would be universe is real dent aureum becomes God for us the creator of the you never ET istic religion sees God is the creator of the universe but you look at it this way then it's not a real universe it's not a separate universe it's not a separate universe then you must be to reom yourself and then you yourself are this universe yes actually no if you're trying to experience consciousness without the Maya there is no way of experiencing in it the only way is is through this at the most way you'll you will try to do what Yogi's try to do nearly culpa Samadhi shut it all down and remain as this for a while you know what Godfather would say to that why go through all that trouble you get it every night in deep sleep you get it in ignorance the yogi gets it in knowledge in in awareness there's a you there isn't used to that because through that nearly culpa Samadhi when you come out of it you become enlightened you know the truth and deep sleep you come out of it you're just refreshed that's all so but the only way we see is this what else can it be other than this means you want to shut this down shutting it down is going into a potential state and into a blankness either you will see a blank miss or the subtle universe or the gross universe and there's no harm to it because none there they are now entertainment they are movies they are Hollywood now it's the separation and the reality and your limitation that makes for misery and horror if it's oneness there is no misery it's all joy all right now let me I'll just share one or two points which I had noted from Shankar Acharya commentary very interesting points then we'll go into the meditation did you have a question somebody have a question all right here is Shankar Acharya he has a question I am mentioned this already I'll read it out it's from Shankar's commentary so he starts with the question when the Atman has been declared to have four aspects and three aspects have been described it seems obvious that the fourth is different from these three that's why you say it's fourth so you should tell us about it why are you starting by saying it's not the Waker it's not the dreamer it's not the sleeper it's the question which really is earlier this is a very this is how Shankar theory starts is coming to the answer it is only by denying the imagined snake that one gets access to the rope which is the substratum of the illusion if I say if you are seeing a snake I tell you the reality is the rope what will you do you will start running around for looking for a rope but if I tell you it's not a snake look closely it's a rope then only you will find the rope denying the snake is part of realizing it to be a rope correct similarly you have to start by denying all this to see the underlying reality you have to start by saying it's not a sky and a Sun and a moon and a clouds it's a lake all right the realizing the fourth an intuitive grasp of the fourth requires us to realize the falsity of the three the fourth is the substratum of three appearances then next question is to dear the fourth one quite apart from waker dreamer and deep sleeper your question you know is too dear a separate entity no Turia if it were a totally separate from the three if it were totally separate from the three then what will happen for want of a door to end into the terrarium it would always remain unknown to us if it were something entirely separate from the tree all that we know are these three if it's a fourth reality all I'm giving you our tree ornaments a necklace a bangle and a ring now if I tell you there is a separate reality called gold if gold is something separate from that those three you'll never get the gold you have only those three we have only these three in our experience so it is not something separate from them then then a related question the three states differ from each other right wake a dreamer and sleep are they differ from each other making dreaming a deep sleep because the events of the making if you eat and go to sleep there's no guarantee that you won't be hungry in your dream might be it doesn't affect the three states and they're different answer differences are all false all imagined are superimposed on the reality Brahman which is called Turia in reality the Waker is none other than Turia the sleeper and dreamer are none other than Turia even without them yes these three are experienced because of tertium that's what - Liam does for these three and what do these three do for - do they manifest to him but the difference the difference is this these three depend on Torian for their existence - Liam does not depend on them for directories existence yes yes true no Maya is not a nature of - Liam it your question is why are these three appearing that was the question to answer that question go ahead a path aside is the very nature of thorium to appear as these three but supposed to Liam does not appear as this straight is possible yes it's possible but your explanation your question was why are these three coming at all and the answer was because of play because of enjoyment of because of our Karma some said because of you know God can create the universe so God creates the universe some said Maya and God a father said it's the very nature of that to shine forth in this way yes no it's not that state that's what I'm saying Samadhi is somewhat like consciously going into deep sleep where you can shut down these experiences and remain as pure consciousness the yogi can cultivate that it's a difficult process Yoga can cultivate that it's like saying what you are asking is can I experience gold in itself without any ornament you're saying that maybe it's a lump of gold still something it's still a form yeah so if you want to experience it then it must have some name and form right and not only that if you're Advaita says the whole question is twisted why you are desperately trying to have Toria min itself without these things it's like can I get gold it's somehow I feel this is a necklace no matter if you see a necklace is false false the real gold I want it's the real gold don't try to change your experience you may try to change and get unique experiences that's the yogi mentality the Advaita mentality is whether you see tur iam has in deep nirvikalpa samadhi or you are having a cup of coffee into your breakfast and waiter says it's exactly the same it's a very radical statement but but I won't say it's damaging to religion and so so I won't say it again it's a damaging statement because you'd simply you read yoga Sutra what is the whole purpose of yoga yoga chitta vritti nirodh aha' Yoga is the suppression of the modifications of the mind if you if use the modifications of the mind cease then for you for the yogi your waking universe dream universe will disappear and yet it will not be deep sleep also we have not fallen asleep we have consciously shut down the mind then you realize after all of this is gone I still am whatever I was when your mind starts functioning again when you come out of Samadhi you will realize I am NOT the Waker I am that which I experienced in Samadhi that's enlightenment it's like watching them I'll come to you watching a movie watching a movie and telling you that see the movie is not real the screen behind the movie is real one good way of understanding that is to switch off the movie and show you the screen then put on the movie again then you will understand the movie what the movie is and what the screen is this is the movie this is the screen [Music] this is a very subtle point when many people do not understand see we are very nicely going along sailing along you might think you're beginners but you're asking questions which after years of study in yoga and Vedanta people come to this epiphany Oh enlightenment is not possible in nirvikalpa samadhi when is enlightenment possible enlightenment is knowledge knowledge is possible when the mind works so you may go a very prepared mind the moment the flash of knowledge comes that person may be thrown into Samadhi so Samadhi may come just after enlightenment or after need we culpa Samadhi when you wake up you're enlightened but the flash of knowledge I am thorium not the Waker I am Brahman that cannot happen in Samadhi because the mind is shut down there yes the knowledge comes in the mind and it removes the ignorant in the mind in Samadhi what remains toreano alone remains the story am have ignorant no does it need knowledge no but what needs knowledge is the Waker so when you come up but that's yoga what way Dantas is why go to all that trouble vedanta says all you have to do is come to class yes bit the if you regard that some people say that in an intuitive grasp intuitive flash that comes in Samadhi afterwards you realize it so there is teacher in Chennai Swami who very humorously said that the vedantic approach the yogic approaches the true Samadhi you get an intuitive grasp I mean the advaithic approaches that in advaitha we believe we don't believe in intuition we believe in tuition - it's intuition what we are having here is tuition right so that's what we believe in come to class in don't spare yourself the trouble of 30 years of yogic meditation so of course this is also troublesome we have to wade through snow and all to come to class okay now you had questions very quickly yeah correct Advaita also says that Advaita also says that Advaita says that here's the teaching did you get it no okay what you do now is karma yoga bhakti yoga and jnana yoga meditate here is a deity here is a mantra worship the deity love God doing selfish activities cleans cleanse the instrument and when when do I come back to class 20 years later no keep coming to class keep coming to class you never know when it might awaken and you see one thing is just by repeated listening to this how much of it becomes clear it's not I can see it you die I don't know how whether you appreciate it or not I have been teaching for more than 25 years now so I can see quite clearly how far along people are many people are beginning to get it it's beginning to clear up at least intellectually it's beginning to clear up what is this about what are they talking about that the thrilling thing is they're talking about you right here right now so all spiritual type practices are welcome but remember this is the highest spiritual practice that we are doing we always have this in our mind I will read about it study about it take notes and then when I get time practice it and can get something that's the yogic attitude this is reading about it listening about it thinking about it which we are doing right now is Shravana monana the first two steps of Advaitic practice okay one more point and I'm done there is this Swami who passed up a long time ago a candle in the Saraswathi in Mathura he in R in Darwin he was a great non dualist very great Scot very great scholarly Swami unfortunately all his works are in Hindi style attempts to translate it into English but the English is poor but he wrote two classics one is bhagavatam wrote means he gave talks and they are made into books so two were big volumes from bhagavata mean Hindi that's the devotional and then Manduca carica this one it's really a classic four volumes four chapters four big volumes on each chapter or in one volume on each chapter and in that he has a chapter on the seventh mantra this one I was stubborn I studied it first I was so thrilled he makes several points about observations about the seventh month I counted how many distinct observations or points he has mentioned about the seventh month the one which we did 125 if you do even ten per day it's going to take you a dozen classes to go through all of those points so anyway now I can turn the Saraswathi if you understand Hindi itself it's a very good book to read four volumes in one book you punished excellent very thrilling how he can make dry philosophy dance one more point and here many points and many of these points have taken from him this is taken from a non-degree who wrote a commentary on Shankar Acharya commentary on God about this commentary on the Monde okay so semantic Upanishad go to power the Shankar Acharya then and again Allen the Giri makes a comment if Toria be totally distinct from Baker dreamer deep sleeper then there can be no upaya Lupe a connection which means method an object to be attained upaya means method and Lupe o means the end to be attained the oh let's put it this way there can be no means and end connection the philosophical analysis of waked dreamer and deep sleeper will therefore be unable to reveal Turia so if the Turia will absolutely separate from all of this then the you see this is only a method methodology what's so great about talking about Waker and making universe we know all that you can't you should save you can't fool me with fancy words like wish were and veera art and things like that I know all this this is by the day-to-day life get down to the real stuff and open it sure there's only one real stuff to say Toria so this is the end which to be realized this is the means Shankaracharya uses a very beautiful
