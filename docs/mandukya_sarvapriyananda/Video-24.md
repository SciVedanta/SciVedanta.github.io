[25. Mandukya Upanishad | Chapter 2 Karika 19-23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tom50sKG730)

Durga Puja though the mother is hidden by the board all right so today in the morning we had a ritualistic worship of the Divine Mother and now the worship will be non ritualistic through through knowledge but remember especially in light of what we are going to study here it is the same reality which is approached through knowledge through devotion through ritual through meditation that's the idea we have got here because what we are going to do right now is going to dismiss all of this the monocoque Erica so we must not hold onto the the either/or paradigm this is right and everything else is wrong okay that's what he's going to say this is right and everything else is wrong all right let's start with the peace chant and then go on Oh bhadram Carini Vishnu Yama Deva bhadram Pasha moksha Beatrice Tara Ronge Tosh toboggans hasta Novi vyasadeva Heaton yada Yahoo swass Tina Indra reader shava swass Tina foucha Vishwa Vida Faustina star show our astronomy Faustino Bri hospital Dada - boom Shanti Shanti Shawn [Music] we are doing the Manduca carica the second chapter where Goethe pada is trying to justify the non-dualistic claim that Brahman alone existence consciousness bliss alone is the reality and the entire universe is an appearance he's trying to justify it on the basis of logic on the basis of reasoning what do you mean that that the entire universe which we experience that this is an appearance appearance of what and how is it not real so the verses which we did was 17 and 18 we did 17 and 18 last time 17 we didn't do 18 oh was 18 17 18 should be done together I think I mentioned 18 attend yes 17 and 18 on each Tita I saw a Jew and a career because Vita Serpa da da da da da da maha kalp it aha as in the 17 we did buy it says that ignorance of the rope that it is a rope in the classic rope and snake example in Vedanta that I am not aware of it being a rope ignorant of its rope nature I think there is something there in this in the semi-darkness and immediately I make an error error is born of ignorance we culpa imagined variously because but the Sanskrit word means imagined variously mistaken variously what are the various mistakes possible snake somebody says there's a snake there Hara somebody says there's a trickle of water in the darkness there somebody says there's a twig or there is a mala that means a garland discount discarded from the temple these are classic examples today we might think there is a computer cable thrown out there by mistake or something like that you know so variously errors they are all errors none of them is right none of these are right what is right it rope ignorant of the reality leads to error error is multiple the truth is one so the truth is that it's a rope and it's neither a snake nor a trickle of water in the darkness nor discarded garland none of them are true and then next verse eighteen twists nice cheetah arm guitar Adam nice cheetah young guitar Adam Bickle paavana Berta T vikulova niversity Roger IVA teacher do item Roger IVA teacher datum that bird at Marvin is chaha that word art Marvin is chai AHA as illusion on the Rope ceases and the Rope alone remains when the Rope is a certainty to be nothing but the Rope so also it's a certain meant about the self how is this illusion removed how is error corrected error is corrected by knowledge what happens knowledge comes removes ignorance and the errors are automatically dispelled notice the source of error the source of error is ignorant about the reality ignorant can only be removed by knowledge what knowledge will remove ignorance knowledge about the reality whatever we are ignorant of knowledge must come about that not about something else so if I am ignorant that it's a rope then I must know it as a rope then only all the errors multiple errors some thought it was a snake some thought it was a trickle of water all the errors will be dispelled at once automatically you don't have to do anything more about it see ya what this is a rope and snake so how does it apply to our situation remember our situation is what you won conscious yes the one existence consciousness bliss the self that is experienced as the Waker and the wakers universe as the dreamer and the dreamers dream world as the deep sleeper and the darkness of deep sleep it is in one awareness alone all this is experienced yes is please here so all these are experienced in one consciousness that consciousness alone is the reality so the three what are the three Waker and wakers universe dreamer and the dream universe deep sleeper and the deep sleep universe or the blankness the merged universe of deep sleep these are three errors like like the snake like the twig on the ground like the trickle of water they are actually errors they are not the reality their reality the background reality of them is the fourth one that existence consciousness bliss which you are the toriel toriel reality waker dreamer deep sleeper and their respective words are superimposed illusionary appearance the illusion will be corrected once you know the self as it is that I am that to reom I'm not the Waker not the dreamer not the deep sleeper but I am the thorium will it remove the appearance of the universe no the appearance will continue but the appearance will be recognized as an appearance after realizing yourself as the tore iam you will still see the world you will still see the body you would still have a mind but that body mind mind body and world will be recognized as appearances in the consciousness which you are that will be the that look that is freedom samsara error samsara is born of error error is born of ignorance from ignorance to error and error leads to samsara I am ignorant of the rope and hence I see a snake ignorant of the Rope first stage seeing the snake error second stage then samsara I'm terrified of the snake I'm running away from the snake all unnecessary because the snake is not there really another example fall asleep every day in the night so that's ignorant maybe our sleep is equivalent to ignorance we fall asleep and therefore we are ignorant of the fact that in the waking world we are lying on the bed and sleeping and we have a nightmare the nightmares in the category of error in the nightmare I suffer and do so many things that is thus that is samsara dream samsara how will that be removed how will the snake samsara be removed when you awaken to the reality it's not a snake it's a rope immediately removed how will the dream samsara be removed when you awaken to the waking world the error of each state in the dream in the error it is valid as long as you see that only and you do not see the background reality everything there is valid in the dream in the dream if in the dream if a dog is chasing you you better run away because you don't know it's a dream if it bites you it's going to is going to hurt so the viajar a transactions at a particular level of reality are correct as long as they are not corrected by no knowledge of the deeper level when you wake up from the dream into the waking world the dream is false a falsified and it's gone and when you wake when you see this rope as the Rope then the snake is falsified and it's gone but remember always the illusion may not go away it may still persist you may actually experience it as long as you have a body projected by Maya you will see the world projected by Maya but there what's the distance between us and the enlightened person enlightened person is literally the person who's got knowledge the person who's got knowledge still sees the same world still sees the same body and the same mind but uh knows that all of them are nothing but Turia seize the one Toria in all appearances in waking dreaming deep sleep the one who knows gold knows what we call necklace and bracelet and ring they are all gold and gold is the reality and the gold is the thing that is valuable in them so the enlightened person knows that now a person who knows that gold is the reality Gold is what is valuable still continues to see the necklace we see it's a necklace the person who knows that it is gold understands what you mean says yeah I know I know what you mean it's a necklace that's correct that's correct but the deeper reality is that it's gold yes if I show you a golden necklace do you see it as gold or do see it as a necklace yeah you see the necklace name-and-form and you know that it is you're wearing it are you waiting and you're not wearing a necklace right answer so if you see if you see I am seeing a necklace you see that's correct if I say I'm seeing gold you'll see your that's correct so if I ask you are you seeing a necklace or imc or are you seeing gold yes it depends what you what do you want to know I if you are asking about the ornament yes it's a necklace if you're asking what material is it yes it's gold so if you ask is the enlightened person does the enlightened person see men and women and you know cars and streets and Manhattan yes does that person see brahman the thorium the existence consciousness bliss yes then what's the difference between that person and us we see only Manhattan we don't see it as Brahman because we don't read and recognize Brahman here just as a person who does not recognize what gold is if you show that person a necklace that person will see a necklace if you showed that person a bracelet golden bracelet what person will see the bracelet but will not recognize the gold in the bracelet will not recognize the gold in the necklace do you follow the example of course it's easier because we know both why is it easier that's why it's an example where we see both we understand both that's why it's easier that's why the example is given if it could be seen here you would be enlightened immediately you wouldn't need to come to the class yes here we are seeing the name and the form but we are not seeing the reality and what what the what is the reality Gold is an objective reality out there it's a material but what is the reality of this universe what is the reality of the universe not an objective reality why not remember God our Father give the two causes of falsity first cause if it is an object it must be false what are what are a radical thing drishya to add because it's an object why is it false because it's an object to what it's an object to up object of knowledge it depends upon your knowing it's an object to this subject it is an object to you the experiencer if it's an object it must be false this was did you remember you must hold on to that because what's going to happen now is going to swamp you grow the pod is going to give a entire range of different philosophies points of view religious skeptical materialistic all kinds of views are going to come what have people during God about this time or before that how have they understood reality and God our Father is going to give you a whole selection of these points of view I counted what's going to come now 35 different philosophies 35 you just throw them out before you and say all of them they're mistaken why not mistaken as far as their themselves can but from the point of view of the ultimate reality of turian they are all objects that they put forward some object on the other as reality it cannot be the ultimate reality because it's an object so all of these things that we see they are all objects therefore false if it's an object it must be false yet there is a reality put these things together if it is an object it is false false means it's an appearance and yet there is a reality then what is that reality mm-hmm put put it together whatever I just you give you give you the terms whatever is an object must be an appearance false so anything objective is what is objective is false it's it's an appearance not reality and it is not that there is no reality there is a reality after all if you say appearance you'll see appearance of what so anything objective is an appearance it is false yet there is a reality now tell me which is the reality yes correct the subject what other thing is there apart from the object what what other thing is there apart from the objects yes subjects subjects did somebody say subjects subject why not subjects if there are multiple subjects then you are a subject immediately using using the terms which I just said there are multiple subjects you are a subject there is some another subject apart from you it will become an object to you an object being an object it's first subject singular subject alone is the reality that subject is called the fourth here to reham 7th mantra sir Atma yeah - Tom to diem the fourth and what is that fourth art massey subject you the real you it's going to come right now just as the rope is imagined in all sorts of false ways as a snake as a trickle of water as a crack in the ground similarly the reality the subject is imagined in all sorts of false ways including the personal guard where each to the eternal which is a little say if you think it's an object it's not true though ultimately from a Vedantic perspective it's not an object it is yes yes yes that break3 is the pointing this pointing out continuously it is possible it's only reason it is possible is because you are that reality if it was a separate reality which you cannot access you cannot see it hear it smell it taste it touch it you cannot think about it you cannot conceive it you cannot grasp it through science or mathematics you cannot grasp it through religion completely unknown there's no way of reaching that reality in that case it's the thing in itself of Kant which is completely unreachable by us but here it is reachable reachable only within codes because it is you yourself not only you yourself it's a continuously revealed you swap prakasha always shining forth it is always self expressed hence if you if the pointing is successful you will notice it immediately it's there where is it in every experience of yourself just as I said the gold is there in every ornament right it is not the name and form of the ornament but it is the reality of the ornament similarly I can point out in this way it is the reality of every experience that you have what is common to every experience you have had in the world what is not common what is not common to the hundreds of experience here is an experience you are having right here is an experience you are having this will sound an experience you are having three experiences one thing you saw another thing you saw another thing you heard what is the only commonality between all of them Devon but what is that experience sir when you go back immediately which itself there's a word but what is what does sale self normally mean to us you'll go back to the first chapter of Mon Tokyo Punisher what does self normally mean to us you say this one in this one what is non-objective is the body non objective is the breath non objective is the mind non objective why is the mind non object and not an observer and not as not the subject because because it no because it's an experience right it's an object of experience is the intellect which you are using to understand all of them is the intellect non objective no it's an object if you push beyond the intellect you go to a blank nothing is that blank non objective still an object because you're aware of it what is aware of everything from the blank down to the intellect down to the mind to the breath to the physical body and to the external world what is the one thing I'm not asking for an answer I'm pointing it's a mind which can point inwards towards it but that one is you yes it's not something apart from you which you are trying to reach it is your the own real nature which you are trying to grasp all of this is ultimately understood not as philosophy certainly not as just religion certainly not as just philosophy all of it is properly understood as a direct pointing to the reality within you even within you is the wrong use of terms the reality which is you the golden thread that runs through all your experiences throughout your life all right now it says nice cheetah amutha origami as the Rope is a certain to be a rope immediately all errors about the rope are dispelled as the self is a certainty to be that forth that pure consciousness see these once you make that breakthrough these words become immediately meaningful pure consciousness being itself witness comes consciousness so experience itself very interesting one of the advance defines the ultimate reality you as Anubhava Mottram param brahma the ultimate reality is experience only experience only means experience - the changing names and forms Anubhava Mottram Anubhava is experience what is experience in all this hearing smelling tasting touching thinking feeling desiring loving hating all of them are experiences - the changing components what's the background of all of it that is anubhava Mottram experience only experience by itself or pure experience that is one and that is the that is what you are that's the fourth it's not waking it's not dreaming it's not deep sleep it is the one underlying waking dreaming deep sleep which appears as the waker dreamer deep sleeper then it no they can't dream a deep sleeper all right once that is ascertained then all errors are dispelled when errors are dispelled samsara goes when it's we realize that it's not a snake fear of snake fear of snake increases vanishes fear of snake is directly related to the error that it's a snake and just that it's a snake is directly related to the ignorance of the rope fear and suffering in samsara is directly related to the ignorance related to the error that I am the Waker I am this person in samsara and this error is due related to the ignorant of myself as truly at the fourth coming from the ignorance is not coming from anything once you recognize that it's a rope even semi-darkness cannot do anything to you ignorance is uncaused ignorance is the cause yes ignorance you say where is it coming from it's coming from lack of knowledge of the self yes yes yes perceiving both means both what mind exists you say there's a difference between mind and existence it's like saying the ornament exists does it I will say gold exists and ornament appears what we normally experience is gold plus ornament I say this is a necklace no it is gold plus necklace name-and-form name for men use nama necklace farm like this use put it on your neck name form and use belong to the ornament but the reality belongs to gold so if you really want to say what exists it is gold which exists not really the ornament by itself the ornament exists depending on the gold because if you melt down the necklace the go and make a bracelet out of it what happened to the necklace what happened to the necklace gone what happened to the thing with gold itself still the same existence belongs to the goal not to the necklace knowledge of non-duality is an experience if you may if you all experience involves the Atman right so experience continues in all experience you recognize the Atman you are saying when does it stop being an ornament and become gold with it when does it stop being an ornament and become gold Mike my answer will be when is it not gold [Music] yes the moment knowledge comes see you are already that which is knowledge will point towards the knowledge will come in the mind and reveal to you that you are that Brahman that knowledge which came in the mind still remains an objective knowledge that itself becomes falsified not that you are not Brahman you remain as Brahman you the moment in the knowledge arises you realize a hum Brahma has me and that is you see I always was am and continue to be this particular knowledge in the mind revealed it to me pointed it out to me disappears means all knowledge mind including all the contents of the mind they reveal does appear in system is that the knowledge remain as a separate reality no of course not the knowledge points to you the example they give is use wood for kindling a fire they rub the pit two pieces of wood to Kindle a fire as the fire starts burning you throw the wood into the fire the wood which created the fire is also consumed by the fire yeah you're pretty close consciousness gives awareness these are from Vedanta perspective these words are interchangeable consciousness awareness sentient s-- intelligence belongs to body intelligence is the function of the Buddha the intellect thinking is a Faculty of the mind exactly that's what we have been trying to say far more than hundred twenty-five years here and the main answer society here consciousness alone shines forth it reveals shines forth and the various forms which appear and disappear in it including mind intelligence prana body world their names and forms the reality belongs to Turia the awareness belongs to Toria remember one one just one further thing here the light is there it reveals so many things but these things have an existence apart from the light if you switch off the light these things will still continue to exist but in the case of Turia it not only reveals it gives existence to those things also it gives existence to the universe a good way of understanding this is your mind in dreams not only or does your mind reveal the entire dream world your mind gives existence to the dream world are you with me no yes you have your right but but but you please stay with the point I am making I am making a more important point here this light does not give existence to what it reveals does this life light generate you does this light generate the chairs and tables it only reveals yes consciousness is like that constant light revealing everything but also further consciousness does one more thing in in Vedanta it gives existence to the very things it reveals citta smooth the existence and revelation not just alive isness the very existence let me give you the example I'm giving I'm giving a pardon no no no no let me just I'm giving you the example please follow they in your dreams when you dream your mind the Dreaming mind it reveals all the things in the dream men and women dogs and cat stars and planets whatever you dream of it's being revealed right so the the mind illumines all entities in the dream and gives existence to them do you see the mind gives existence to all entities in your dream because without the dreamers mind if you do not dream then the things that you saw in your dream won't they disappear right now your dreamers mind does it give existence only to living beings in the dream and it gives existence to everything similarly awareness the turiya they are talking about gives existence and reveals everything in your waking experience in your dream experience in your deep sleep blankness that's what you see once you verify the nature of that that consciousness that existence consciousness that's why it's called sucked and chit once you verify the nature of that all the errors of thinking that I am a laker experiencing a waking universe apart from me this space here come come come come that all errors will be corrected once you realize that I am the Turia but it will still continue to appear it will appear exactly like this that's what I'm trying to say eyes will still see forms years will still hear sound skin will still touch mind will still think memory will still work all of those functions will continue you will realize it all to be none other than me the todya not me the body because you're very well question no to your question at this stage if you if you'll notice if you get what what other weight is trying to say all these questions have their own answers look at the language you used why our individual experience is different what is individual that consciousness from the particular point of a single body mind immediately you have a different perspective probably not if our eyes are functioning very well but differently definitely but what but yeah if you're color better but if you are saying I'm saying something here and there are many people here many people are hearing different things this sound may be the same but the understanding is different the retention will be different yeah so this is individual difference why is this difference there because minds are different the filters through with the organs through which you are perceiving it is different go back to the very question of individuation where does the consciousness become individuated because at the very level at the causal level Maya has parts ignorances parts from there from causal level onwards differentiation starts beyond that one consciousness only yes the enlightened person no they don't lodge themselves in the Turia state they understand they are the Turia all the time they always have been yes correct correct correct you realize that none of it it affects the world objects there it affects the body it affects the mind also but it doesn't expect me the thorium yes right you will see it as gold and also the necklace but you will not be stuck onto the necklace name-and-form you realize it's not real because if somebody comes and tells you it's a necklace you understand what that person wants to say you are not you can it's not that you're ignorant of the difference between a necklace and a bracelet but you see a deeper reality that is gold detachment will come you realize that yes you will not only float between all three all three will float in you yes you are that and so you rest in a kind of serenity comes over you and all kind of it's not alienation kind of oneness comes over you because everything is in you everything that you experience is in you the consciousness in you the object sub subject the pure subject yes I'm glad people are beginning to use language like this when I use the mind good this is the first step in advaitha to take a step back from body mind yes when you use the mind yes so far so far I'm one with you but I'll just make a little correction that revelation and existence are not acts they have no beginning in time they have no end in time and they are no effort involved in them yes so they are not acts they are the reality in which acts appear in disappear good that you're not able to put it in words means you're coming close to the reality because otherwise whatever the mind puts in words is false it is an incorrigible liar from the from the Advaitic point of view not it's fault because it functions in time space and causation right to you I'll say one thing experience in fact it's - for everybody notice the language he uses act of experiencing experiencing there are two types one is an act one is what is called a changing seer the one which sees here right to see something you need to act you have to focus your eyes you have to connect your mind to pay attention to what you are seeing and then cognize bring your memory into play the ego into play then I say I am seeing a book it's an it's very much an act right so this is the changing fear the subject us that's what we are used to what Advaita is speaking about is an unchanging seer even the word seeing is used in an implied sense like the sun shining all those sun shining itself practically speaking it's tremendous activities going on there so they're not speaking about that it's like an unchanging light not an action that's going on that's what Advaita is pointing towards that unchanging light the it's the ultimate seer it's called see only with respect to the objects which appear and disappear in it but in itself is not even a seer its very nature is of the nature of illumination the mind comes before it and is revealed by it the senses come in contact with the mind and through the mind and senses that ultimate seer becomes a changing seer the one which you're talking about that pure consciousness now becomes seer hear or smell or taste or touch a thinker the person who remembers a lover hater desire a person who desires all of these are activities and these activities are because of the changes in the mind and the senses but behind all of them is one unchanging consciousness so they talked about two kinds of sphere the changing seer which their person and the unchanging seer the Atman I don't have any attachment I am the conscious how can you experience it you can experience it let me ask you how can you see your eyes even the mirror you are seeing with your eyes and what you see in the mirror is a reflection of your eyes not the eyes themselves even to see the mirror and the reflection you need eyes right in one sense is it not seeing anything is within quotes seeing the eyes an experience of eyes is what seeing anything the proof of the existence of the eyes the eyes reveal everything that can be seen right now you are using your eyes do you need to see a mirror to see if your eyes are still there no the very fact that you can see all these things is a proof that you are you've got eyes and you are the eyes at that you are using them similarly the very fact of any kind of conscious experience points to the fact that you are that unchanging consciousness you cannot objectify it that's what we are saying thank God because God apart is already proved whatever his objective is false if you could objectified the Toria now I've got the Turia false go back to now I will subcontract out my job to your seventh mantra of the open Ishod obviou / - iam beyond name it cannot be named yes did I name it I used the word remember the word should referent refer to something and I say book I used a word word is the act of naming the book successful yes why is it successful when I show you the book you say here it is what you named when I say Toria pointed out what did I name when I say Othman Brahman point it out it didn't succeed we are using terms you're using language but it's not it's not in the sense of any other other use of language yes for an enlightened person it points to a reality for us we are just discussing concept we exactly don't know what it refers to if you knew what it refers to you would be a Brahma Gani right now I use the word book you immediately know it refers to this you are a book journey you're enlightened about a book if I say Korea and you know what it refers to you're enlightened Jeevan Mukta right now so the act of naming has failed in this case but it is a strategy used by the scriptures remember we have to refer back to my talk Advaita Vedanta and the paradox of language it's all it's on youtube why you cannot name it why you cannot name that absolute reality I will not launch into that now why you cannot name that absolute reality and how do the Scriptures Vedanta not only we learnt them that this teacher who was here the Tibetan Buddhist tradition magda maker Buddhism they come from exactly the same perspective Nagarjuna says we ultimate the Shunyata is ineffable beyond language and yet the only thing we have at our disposal is language all these books are language then how do they refer to that so they have developed strategies about five different strategies are found in Vedanta you know them actually for example Natan eighty I cannot speak about the ultimate reality but that doesn't prevent me from speaks from saying what it is not the whole tenth man strategy do you remember the story the tenth man we kept on discounting you are not this not this not this we kept on pointing to things which we can pointing to and denying it in the hope that finally you will catch the tenth man has to catch I am the tenth alright what happens now and they come to the 19th verse not knowing the reality about the self it is imagined error in multiple ways so there are many many theories about the ultimate reality 36 of which 35 of which will be detailed down or at least mentioned now they will make make a mistake take something objective to be the self or something objective to be the ultimate reality various theories about the world philosophical theory is materialistic skeptical religious theories all of them will come now and God apothem will take them up and dismiss all of them one by one I counted 35 it starts with 19 prana deed prana D be an entire prana DB Ronon taster bhava typical pita ha ha very Mahadev HD was sure my artists URI was your yo-yo some mojitos I am no hitter so I am NOT knowing the true self the true self itself is now imagined experienced in multiple ways as different objects like brown rd as the personal God prana here means here Anna Nagar per the first projection the cosmic mind before that Ishwara is their consciousness plus maya do you remember what is your entire but do you remember the three stuff I'll never forget that the structure of the Atma has four aspects waker dreamer deep sleeper and the real Atma the fourth the Waker the cosmic Waker is called Virat the individual Baker is called visual the cosmic dreamer is called Hiranya garbha the individual dreamer is called digester the cosmic deep sleeper is called Ishwara or deep sleeper means causal power Maya consciousness limited by the causal power Maya and us the deep sleeper consciousness Braga in reality these three are nothing but Turia the fourth which you are now what is the first manifestation in ignorance what is the first error or you know you don't say Ishwara or project because that's not manifested it's a blank in deep sleep that's the causal level that's where everything comes from but that's not an object which you are experiencing other than blankness there's nothing happening there as such the first happening comes in your dream state as you emerge from the darkness see always invade on to try to experience it subjectively from your point of view how do you experience life ask yourself I experience life as the nothingness of deep sleep emerging into the dream world emerging into the waking world and again going back into sleep that's how I experience it so for me blankness of deep sleep is replaced by the dreams of my dreaming mind is replaced by the experiences through the senses of the external world again covered over by sleep I the consciousness keep on experiencing these things that's how you experience it so what's the first thing that happens something is happening dreams from the darkness of deep sleep yes oh that we have discussed in number of times here yes so some dreams remember the dream world is not is not completely dissociated in the physical world it's not just a private affair that you are having in your mind as the physical world is also though our bodies are separate still they are part of an ocean of matter is it not so in some way we are connected you not you might find it icky but it's the same air which we are breathing it's the same environment which we are sharing similarly it's the same mind there's an ocean of mind it's not that our minds are completely divorced from each other in private there's an there's an underlying ocean of mind a cosmic mind of which our minds are our appearances in that cosmic ocean of mind so sometimes though our dreams are usually connected are created out of our own impressions of the waking state but sometimes there is a seepage from the cosmic mind and there are things which come into our mind which are actually related to the external reality also from the cosmic mind something comes into the mind which you as a dream and which actually you experience in your waking state when you make a make up that thing happens you dream about somebody who are not met for 20 years you wake up and that person is ringing the bell it at your door that very day so the dream you will see it forth it foretold it actually predicted something which happened in the waking state it doesn't answer your question yes yeah yeah something something very vivid and very true right that's what you mean yes that can happen that can happen because yeah yeah it can happen it can happen because all of these things are visualized in the mind of God the cosmic mind here- which is which you are talking about so sometimes it may seep into our minds and most of the dreams do not mean anything much about the external world but some of those dreams may actually predict something very real something that is actually happening in the external world it's possible purpose what's the purpose of anything yeah that that points out that tells you something about your waking life but remember let me find out something here we are talking about something much higher let alone a dream telling you something which is going to happen in your waking life actually going to happen in your life the entirety of waking life is also regarded as a dream here yeah why because whatever applet meet you predict a child to be born and you know the gender it all turns out to be real you see it happening Goro pada will only say did you see it yes it's false false not in the sense of one thing is true in the waking life another thing is false in the waking life yeah it is true that what you're seeing here is Manhattan it is false that what you are seeing here is Mumbai it's not Mumbai it's Manhattan so this is Manhattan is true this is Mumbai is false this is true and false in the waking state but both the fact that it is Manhattan and the dream that you had it is Mumbai both are appearances and from Gorda Palace point of view equally in consequential you we must imagine we must understand what level we are speaking of here - guru father religion science the most fundamental discoveries of life and the most important things of life are equally inconsequential what is consequential then you the experiencer ultimately whether it's a true dream or a false dream or the greatest thing in the world outside isn't it all in relation to you you must experience even if God appears to you tomorrow look at the language appears to you alright let's go ahead now let me make an entry into the I thought I would finish the 36 will twenty-five philosophies today we are not we have not yet started with even one in multiple ways is this self not knowing itself in multiple ways is it projected outwards in multiple ways and taken to be the reality what are the multiple ways he starts with the most tremendous one of them the Hiranya garbha the deity in which we worship God so the first projected here on Nagappa prana prana here means hidden Agharta adi etc etc by etc he means the entire subtle universe entire physical universe subtle universe mind thought emotion intelligence life prana physical universe matter energy space time all of it these are all according to him errors mistakes appearing errors in what sense errors because you take them to be an external separate reality that is an error not knowing what you are if you knew what you were that pure consciousness and then all of these are experienced in that that would be a true true statement of the truth cosmic mind consciousness plus cosmic mind is here in niigata literally speaking in our in our scheme of things do you remember that Turia with the entire shuttle name and form of the universe so what is the subtle universe what is the subtle body nineteen parts are there mana bodhichitta ankara mind intellect memory and ego the five Puranas pancha prana the five subtle organs of perception the five organs of action nineteen all together this is the subtle body of one person of all beings so the entire universe of sort and and understanding sentient and that is intelligence and memory desire all of that which constitutes our inner universe yours and his and hers altogether that is cosmic mind consciousness with that cosmic mind is called here on the garba who yes does your mind exist you seem to be doubtful yes of course it does if your mind exists the cosmic mind also exists yes it does you you know what you're asking does the universe exist the universe exists in your in our practical sense the universe exists can you take a look you see who's there in that sense the cosmic mind also exists in that sense miles exist but ultimately their existence is derived from turia only one thing is real okay of course just as your mind is different from you the consciousness you the consciousness you are the ultimate Brahman and you have an individual mind all these individual Minds put together up is the cosmic mind but it has no existence apart from come on a Brahman itself just as you say one necklace is it different from the goal yes it is different from the gold because the necklace has no reality along with the gold all the necklaces in the Tiffany's showroom are they different from the underlying gold of course gold is the reality which is appearing as those necklaces similarly mind is one kind of ornament body is another kind of ornament but the reality of all of them is existence consciousness please all right still haven't started all right as cosmic mind and everything else all of these entities are projected by Maya Maya Asha Tasya Davis yahoos Maya whose power power of that they were that bright being bright peak they were literally means Giotto not they were in sanskrit the bright being bright being literally means consciousness that which shines by its own maya is projected what the cosmic mind the physical universe here in Nia garber viraat and individual bodies and minds and this entire non living universe everything is projected yaaaaa some more hit'em by which is you did swayam that one alone that Bremen alone is deluded by its own my own own Maya we normally say Maya deludes all of us that's the language we use in Vedanta we are deluded by Maya into thinking this is real but here he says that ultimate reality Brahman itself in a poetic manner of speaking is itself deluded where is Brahman deluded what is he talking about he's talking about what you are right now what are you you are Brahman deluded what is that yes Brahman not deluded that's all that's the difference enlightened person and us we are that same reality as is Ramakrishna charlatan Vivekananda as is Durga hidden there by Maya it is the same Brahman but they know or they that one knows it there and here it does not know that's why it is the difference yes so what are the different different ideologies philosophies belief systems about what about reality about ultimate reality so he's going to give a list from twentieth verse onwards to twenty-eight and accounted thirty-five philosophies or thirty-five theories of belief systems about what constitutes reality many of them a little archaic something that prevailed 1400 years ago in India in God up at this time but many of them are extraordinarily modern sums very much so you'll recognize it in the thought world here he's talking about philosophies theories you recognize it in thought world around us here in Manhattan today and of course remember we established in that idea I am the consciousness to which whatever is an object is an appearance appearance where in you the consciousness appearance of what of you the consciousness all of these are appearances interior in consciousness and therefore they are false appearance the word appearance itself means false he appears to be a good person not a good person appears to be real not real then what is appearing something must be appearing it is the Tori of the fourth that pure consciousness which alone is it it is the subject which is appearing as the object everything in principle as an object must be an appearance then appearance of what of something which is not an object then what's the only thing which is not an object the subject what is that subject the fourth pure consciousness let's quickly have a survey of the thought world then cyclopædia philosophy in go to Palestine 1400 years ago one by one twenty at worse prana 80 prana vida prana ET pruna Vida Kootenai teacher taught vida ha butanna teacher taught vida ha guna ET guna vida ha guna ET guna vida taught Juanita chatted with AHA that Tony teacher taught Vida those who are experts who are from the philosophy of prana be front of it means the knowers of Hiranya garbha they considered the cosmic mind to be the ultimate reality it's a deity which is worshipped that is the ultimate reality but we know it's not so because is it an object to consciousness in that case it must be not real ultimately butanna teacher taught Vdara the second one is the materialist there was there are many schools of materialists in ancient India and one of them considered the materials out of which the universe is made space the ancient cosmology space and air and fire and water and earth most ancient cultures had this cosmology and these materialists they didn't even think space is real why because you can't see space directly so you can experience only the four evolute air water fire earth so these material is considered only these four to be real and they say that these are these are the only realities in the universe ultimately everything can be reduced to these elements four elements or five elements whatever but we know the hammer-blow are the objects are you aware of them yes are the objects to your awareness yes then they must be false next guna e Teague Nevada huh the note he's talking about Sankhya philosophy Sankhya philosophy says the entirety of this universe is called if the source is prakruti prakruti literally means it's the word for nature in Sanskrit in many Indian languages also so nature is the source of this entire universe and what is nature itself is made of three gunas sattva rajas tamas i will not go into this you have heard about it again and again shut to a rajas tamas god APPA there's only one question are the objects yes then they must be false they cannot be the ultimate reality taught wanna teach at a Veda ha there is a school the it's a the Shiva school one of the Shiva schools it says there are three principles ultimately Pashu Pashupati and parsha so now pursue pursue is the sanskrit word is for animal beasts but here basu means Jeeva all of us so we are classified as animals as as insane as sentient beings under the control of Pashupati the lord of pushes so one of the names of Shiva is pashupati and we are all bound by parsha parsha means rope so what is what are these ropes all sorts of things mind and ego and pride and jealousy we are contracted by impurity so these are the the bondages by which that pure consciousness becomes bound that consciousness free of bondage is called pashupati the Lord of passion and within bondage under the influence of the parsha the rope is called Pashu Sri Ramakrishna in the gospel once he refers to this philosophy he says the word he uses is parchment Oh cheap posh posh muck to ship posh posh but dodgy be free of the ropes of bondages is Shiva under the influence of the bondage is tired with the with these ropes is jiva so we are in bondage Jeeva the same reality the same reality freed of bondage is Shiva that's what she was called Pashupati pursue and Pasha Pasha means rope Pasha means us and Pashupati means the free of the ropes that means the wheel developed of this power 3.2 us are the objects yeah that's not how normally people understand them of course if you go deeper into shaver philosophy not so say Kashmir Shaivism for example but anyway in general are the objects of objective reality yes then they are not real at all so they are to be rejected not to own it it ought to be the treated to us 21 so you're already dealt with four big systems of philosophy one is the worshipers of hidden dagger birth the second one is the materialists third one is the SANCCOB the fourth one is the Shiva they will come back again in different forms 21st et Parvati pas de vida be sure yeah it had been her vision eat eat at vida loca et loca vida loca loca vida de bourree teacher taught vida a teacher that Vida the first one is which consists us before father's to be real what does this mean according to these people what you said in the mandoke Upanishad you talk talking about mundo company should yes that's real that's what we considered to be what is real the Waker and the wakers universe first aspect the dreamer in the dreamers universe second aspect the deep sleeper in the deep sleepers merged universe third aspect and the pure consciousness story of which you are talking about the fourth aspect these four aspects are the ultimate reality isn't this what you said so we accept it is this what we said right it sounds it sounds like he's talking about the Mundaka Upanishad no he's not he's making a big big mistake open you should say is that the self you have four aspects waker dreamer deep sleeper and the fourth one and then goes on to say the first three are appearances of the fourth it's like saying there is what is the ultimate there is necklace bracelet ring and gold and if you ask the question what's the reality here and somebody says oh there are four realities there is a necklace as a ring there is a bracelet and there is something called gold wrong there is only gold which appears in these four three forms similarly there is only such Eden on the you the thorium appearing in these three aspects but here what is he saying the four aspects which you have thought in the Manduca that is the reality no rejected wish IIT tattvatah huh this this is another form of charvaka which says the these are the senseless enjoyment what we experience to the senses touch taste smell sound ultimately this is the reality of our lives so this is this is what is to be pursued so they had a master what she Ayane he is well known as the composer of the Kama Sutra so these people say that experiences through the senses are the ultimate purpose and reality of life and we say no why not is it an object to you the consciousness yeah of course experience has to be an object good dismissed local IT loca vida the next one says the Vedic worlds are the higher heavens and the highest heaven so in all the davidic you know the ritualists they will chant the mantras the Gayatri guru who was sought at savitur varenyam who means this world of men the human world bruja is higher heavens so is the highest heaven DZ these are their realities are the objective can you experience them objectively yes dismissed no they write it at Veda ha there are others very dedicated in those days vedic practitioners and go to Palestine who were worshippers of the Vedic gods so Indra Varuna and all of this Agni and so that is the point that is the highest reality of the universe same question are the objects yes they are objects that each object of worship for example then they are not to be considered as the highest reality now remember one thing as we cruise through all of these and nonchalantly dismiss them which are revered systems of belief or some of them are very well thought out very comprehensive systems of belief with their own literature's he's not being contemptuous what he's saying is these things may have an internal validity they may actually be experienced so somebody may actually experienced higher heavens somebody may worship Indra and have a vision of Indra somebody may worship the davidic guards and get boons fulfilled it may work in your day-to-day life it may actually give you results somebody may be a way pursuing a sensual enjoyment through arts or through refined enjoyment of you know sense pleasures and will get the pleasure accordingly but that does not mean that these are the ultimate reality if you put them forward as the theory of ultimate reality this is what is real in life this is what is really valuable in life no no they have their use and they have their benefit this is not denying was going to talk about many things which are apparently quite real and effective and yet he dismisses them he is not saying that they are not valid in their own sphere they are they can give you certain results in their own sphere definitely but they are not the ultimate reality not only that you take them to be the ultimate reality you are trapped in samsara any one of these you take into the ultimate reality you're trapped in sub-sahara what is the ultimate reality you are the ultimate reality then next we're making good progress now 22nd Veda it evade evade aha without it evade evade aha yoga teacher taught Veda ha Yaya a teacher taught by de vocht ret bhakti teach a book trivia ha bhakti teacher book trivia ha but Jimmy teacher taught vida ha well Jimmy teacher taught Veda ha the Vedic scholars even now you'll find spend their whole effort in memorizing and chanting the Vedas so there are families in India we even know that that who have been give interested with one branch of the Vedas do a way the to wait two branches three way the three well shut evade afford four branches of the Veda and they were they don't do it nowadays but the whole point was to memorize and preserve the Vedas and that became the sole purpose of their lives generation to generation across thirty centuries forty centuries three to four millennia they preserved these traditions it became the ultimate reality for them so this entire Vedic tradition of which even this opening shot is apart by the way this is also part Iturbide Veda mundo key open issue is that the reality God our Father fearlessly says no because it's an object magnificent object magnificent object no doubt but still an object so many of them they will memorize and memorize and memorize we have a branch in balloon mutt kids who do this memorize it but you will see anything this entire vast Vedic load is there they have got it all here so they must be really really wise no they don't know what they have memorized if you ask for the meaning they don't know the meaning in fact there are Vedic there is a whole school of Vedic thought which says the meaning is not important the sound of the Vedic chanting is enough to produce the results the dosas school of belief in ancient India there's a whole philosophy associated with it that the vibration produces the results so the Vedic chanting the perfect intonation is most important chanted properly it will give you the result chant it improperly it will give adverse result there are many many stories about this there is the story of beer editing emerges ricotta comics as a kid bricked restaura the great demon with Britta the king of the gods indra he offended a great sage there's a story behind that also but we will not go into that and so and so the sage decided to destroy indra and he performed this great vedic sacrifice and he was going to say from this infallible vedic sacrifice let the demon be produced who will destroy indra and that it has to happen to protect indra however Saraswati the goddess of learning went on the tongue of the Rishi and made him mispronounce it the mantra so the mantra is Indra shut rune what the swirl let the destroyer of Indra be be be generated from this Vedic fire now in sanskrit indra shot through it means pronounce it one way it means the one who destroys indra pronounce it another way it means the one who is destroyed by indra so what really happened was with Trishula was created and there's a whole whole story about it ultimately however the demon was destroyed by indra it all is traced back to mispronouncing the vedic words so huh that's neatly yes no stilt but the point is these are all objects of consciousness in awareness yeah get it up with another branch of the Vedas where the Vedic rituals vast in you know the Vedic sacrifices which were done and that became the main form of religion in ancient India in fact during Gautama this time it was undergoing a revival after the Buddhist sort of disappeared they were beginning to disappear from India and the Vedic ritual ISM was making a big comeback kumarila bhatta was a contemporary at that time so they believed in yaga yaga means the fire ritual even now in big Hindu worship so for example Durga Puja if I did it in full the full puja I just did a shortened version for one day's puja it's done in five days I did one day's puja this morning in a very shortened version I mean just one and a half hours really if you do it it goes to seven or eight hours every day then you would have to do a fire ritual also that's still part of the bigger Hindu rituals in ancient times that was the ritual of the Hindus the fire rituals but anyway our point here is are they objective or not yes dismissed both they teach a book three Veda her again I will not go into details here bhakta means experiencer the Sankhya philosophy has two aspects one is what is experienced what is experienced nature prakruti we have already dismissed that guna as the three gunas but who is the experiencer according to samkhya consciousness is the experience but according to samkhya experiencer is the nature of consciousness what do we say connected to what i just said to him you become the experiencer with the help of mind and body and experiencer is an agent which experiences but consciousness in itself is not an experience it's an alumina alumina if you have the instruments experiencing then you will experience without the instruments of experiencing you still remain as pure consciousness whereas according to them the consciousness is bhakta always the experiencer so that idea that is also dismissed that's also an objective element in that both Giamatti chatted varaha this confused me see the problem with this entire range of verses is Shankar Acharya has not written any commentaries in this this phase where gora father picks up picks up all these philosophies and dismisses them quickly one after another these carry cos 2228 Shankar Acharya has not written is very helpful commentary nothing blank he skips this entirely because the principle is clear but the problem is for us at a distance of 15 centuries which philosophical school is he referring to here it must have been clear to go a path and Shankara it's not at all clear to us luckily a sub commentator a non-degree an under Giri he has given short notes on each of these schools so that's where I'm getting all the material from original Mundaka Upanishad the worst commentary called carica written by God a father on that Shankar Acharya commentary called Shankara Vasya on that the sub commentary written by our and the Giri called it Undergear Atika so on that in that you find these but here I I was stumped because this this philosophy called the podium the footnote here says the cooks philosophy of the cooks and I looked it up and again he also says the same thing the philosophy of food now I understand if there's a philosophy of food it is food objective yes so it must be dismissed so fine but what is the philosophy would have never heard of this finally even Shankara could not help me on the Giri could not help me I asked finally who else Google that's why I was little late it's a big area today the philosophy of food first thing which came up University of California publication the philosophy of food 16 eminent philosophers write about the philosophy of food so ok so it's a big area I didn't know now I know of course it does that's true but the film philosophy of food food in itself yeah both geometries you that better those who are knowers of what is to be eaten and what is proper food and all of that if you say nutrition of course philosophy of food Park Shastra of cooking it literally says the cooks philosophy of the cooks anyhow objective so dismissed but so it is there even New York as famous philosophy of cooking itself I don't know what the philosophy was gastronomy yes gastronomy the entire science of cooking so for them it's a very important yes Anton abuddin who committed suicide few months ago yes then more more philosophies are coming up 23 sukshma 80 sukshma Vida sukshma 80 sukshma Vida ha stool 80 chatted with aha stool I teach at Vida ha muta et muta be da ha Mota 80 muta be Daha boot et chatted with aha Mota a teacher taught Vida ha formal philosophies there are those who say the soul is an object you're an object but a circle object not body not mind Sushma means a new para model I can like a particle a particle of awareness still an object who say that Ananda Gary says digambara ha that means the Giants so it is a giant philosophy that the soul is it's like a particle of consciousness it gets covered by impurities and it has to be purified it's just no it can't be an object it is the object to what that pure consciousness must be the soul then others says tula no no there is no such thing as a subtle soul there is no such thing a settled soul it is the body alone there's another variety of they're called char Walker's or loci Atticus very much today's philosophy also it's the body alone what's the ultimate reality the physical body no no what about mind intellect they are born of the activities of the brain which is part of the physical body mind has no reality of its own it's just a by-product of neuro chemical activity in your brain yes so consciousness pure consciousness nothing of that sort it's the brain chemistry that's what's generating it so ultimately the reality is the physical body nothing beyond that and right now we are having this debate he right here in Manhattan the hard problem of consciousness David Chalmers you know so today the materialist outlook is is is triumphant because mainly because of science that the the the the success of science and technology so it's an age of science and the sign the scientific worldview right now is basically a reductionist material materialist worldview ultimately according to science what is real matter what is matter particles what are particles I mean atoms and molecules we go even deeper subatomic particles neutrons protons electrons go deeper moons bosons recently the goddess boson was discovered and so many leptons and the different kinds of quarks now they're talking about super string string theory sometimes it comes into fashion goes out of fashion but basically they are subtler and subtler forms of matter that's the one thing we need to know and that is alone real matter energy time and space that's what's real gotta bother dismisses that is it an object to awareness yes it cannot be real it cannot be the independent really it cannot be the foundational reality then comes another one moo dat moo de vida so modern scientific point of view is not represented here because ghurabaa that did not know modern science fifteen hundred years ago but in principle these thoughts were there not in the level of sophistication we have now Mirta eighty muta vida they say the ultimate reality is personal God what is the ultimate reality it is say Krishna or Vishnu for arms and they are very very particular view of what Vishnu is for arms blue in color lying on his eternal couch these cells a serpent station Agha floating in the milk ocean and that exactly is the reality that's symbolically to represent something no no no not symbolic exactly like that so for example in the early days of this con I was reading a book early history of ISKCON prabhu father was here right here and he started this car so somebody asked him rather incredulously RV to believe that God is a little blue boy as a simple uncompromising answer was yes God is a little blue boy not only that so it's a entirely objective idea of God not only that anything else can God be for example the Devi Durga can God be Shiva or Jesus Christ or a formless Abrahamic Christian or Islamic God no no absolutely not it has to be that little blue boy why because Krishna said so I am God but Shankar Acharya says when Krishna said I am God he means I the pure consciousness I am Brahman I am the pure consciousness as with my my I am sir Munna Brahman I am an avatar of that cerebrum that's what he means sir no sir is wrong plane what do you say to that so muta a personal God with a particular form is the ultimate reality we do not we are not getting into theological wrangles here we are just saying is it an objective experience reality yes for dismissed remember again nowhere is he saying that it cannot happen can suppose a mirror saw Krishna in that farm if see if you say are you saying it's false no we're saying of course she saw Krishna ended from entirely believable Sri Ramakrishna saw Carly again and again every day he saw Kali but what we are saying is that particular name and form that objective thing which he experiences that cannot be the ultimate reality it's a name and form covering the ultimate reality the ultimate reality is not an object of experience it is it is the very reality of Meera it is the very reality of Ramakrishna it is your own reality it's the same reality existence consciousness bliss so it is not a particular form an objective form again all of them have their relevance because devotees will be shocked are you dismissing all of that then he said those will be useful for devotees you may actually experience then and it'll be very good progress in spiritual life but you cannot stop there it's until you realize yourself to be the ultimate reality there is no freedom for you then a mood to eat eat at the Daha just the opposite there are some who say no God then farm less everything is wired there's nothing nearly stick at attitude he says no that also cannot be who is the witness have you experienced this void yes then it cannot be real you you the experiencer of the void must be the real ok let us stop here next comes Carlita call of either 24 onwards so we'll stop here yes actually here is one school shoonya wada but this is not really the School of shown Nevada so never that does not mean this what you what it is an earless school he will take up the Gianna Basel later on it will come up so this is what it is next time remind me next time I will tell you he next comes astrology which is very popular in India here too also I think so Karl Aveda those who consider time to be everything time auspicious time the astrologist time to be everything then we'll come space those who consider space to be the ultimate reality no vastu and so on so many other theories will keep coming but the principle is same if it's an object of your awareness it's dependent on that awareness it's not a not the ultimate reality let's stop here Oh Shante Shante Shante hurry he owned that sat sri ramakrishna Aparna must
