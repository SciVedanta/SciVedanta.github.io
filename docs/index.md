The Science of Vedanta (SciVedanta) is a collection of YouTube videos on Vedanta philosophy by several eminent monks.
The YouTube videos are also converted into text for reference. 
Note, that the video to text conversion is not 100 % accurate, especially when Hindi/Sanskrit/Bengali etc., words
are pronounced. We plan to proof-read the texts soon. If you are willing to contribute in this work in progress project by editing/proof-reading or have any questions/suggestions, 
please feel free to let us know by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/SciVedanta/SciVedanta.github.io/issues/new). If you want to learn about GitHub, checkout this [link](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).
