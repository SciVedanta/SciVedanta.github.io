[60. Shanti Gita - Class 60 - chapter 6 - verse 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f41wrUcFJGs)

[Music] [Music] [Music] lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face on peace peace peace be unto us all so we are reading chapter 6 verse number 4 will start today we read the other day verse 1 2 and 3. so this is the shanti gita may be not familiar for many of you and santigita is a teaching of bhagavan krishna to arjuna again first it was given in the work before the war when arjuna was totally overwhelmed seeing his own relatives and friends blood relations and they have to be killed so that was a terrible thing for him to understand and for us also life struggle is such if we look at our life terrible situation comes with our little emotions some friend does something family does something and that qual goes to that extent to go to court case killing these that what not so it's that time bhagavan krishna gave the advice which is called the bhagavad-gita popularly known and the war started and what was going on on the thirteenth day of the war the vivanu the son of arjuna mother uttara subhadra who [Music] see these are all money mistakes anyhow the theory then he when the sun was killed in the war and not in ethical manner unethical manner not following the rules and great rules of the war principles so he was totally lost and he was again very much depressed and he thought that he's not going to fight anymore that time he was full of believement and and the suffering because of that bereavement that time bhagavan krishna again advised the same principles of the bhagavad-gita which is called shanti gita so here in the sixth chapter sri bhagavan says i'll not uh now tell you what is the essential truth that's renewed that listen to me oh shakha oh my friend arjuna and what i'm going to tell you it is very secret extremely secret but it is mahatma it brings great auspiciousness human being person can get out of all bondage and suffering conquer death that i am going to tell you what is that ultimate truth is what brahman it's a purnam caitanya there is only poor know that that absolutely filled with the reality that is the consciousness ekam only that consciousness only that sat that eternal existence eternal consciousness that is the only there in reality no kin channel there is nothing else and there you talk about maya no maya no maya you called god has created the universe no ish there is no creator no jivo who is created individual they show call us to the time space character the moveable and immovable thing which you see there is nothing as such if you talk the ultimate truth is this and that i am telling you what a gurjam it is very secret because even if it is why it is secret because it is everywhere and i don't see anywhere what is the secret secret you hide me something from me that's his secret someone is hiding one thing but it is not it's open that's why sami we began to had a wonderful lecture open secret the secret it is open but we don't see the truth it is open for all of us to see that's why it is most secretive water gujaram but if you no one's mahatma nam the greatest auspiciousness can be derived by knowing this and in that truth there is only consciousness there is only that absolute existence and there is nothing else other than this there is no maya there is no ishara the creator god no created jiva no jivo there is no space in this species is created no at this particular time it is created there is no such time space and position it has beyond all this not tuang you see you are arjuna you are not there that secret that secret when it is revealed you are not there arjuna has arjuna you are not you are as brahman you are there not as arjuna now i am krishna i am telling you giving you advice i am the lord there is no such me neither i am there neither you are there is earth this one universe is not there nami and we see that there are different planes of existence no burr bhuvaswa mahajana tapas going down this way going up this way all the different planes those are all concocted thoughts there is nothing no such thing as as it were kinchi knows therapy there is nothing nothing not only nothing not a trace of anything is there nasty nasty it is you know no there is nothing there is nothing make it sure that we read these three verses see what is the truth in one word the whole vedata has been given here that is the truth and what we are seeing this is only our ignorance is showing us and that is why you are suffering if one can stay in this truth then where is suffering where is pain who can give you pain where is that another entity to give you pain and who will be getting the pain and that's why the killer and the killed the slayer and the slain if they're one where is that it is the same experience when the realization comes that holy man was asked who has lost consciousness because somebody beat him some other person and when he came back to senses he has asked who is feeding you milk what was the response spontaneous response that is the secret he has reached the secret open the secret it is open cigarette for him that's what i said he who has beaten me he is feeding me the milk there's non-dual existence so who will give pain to whom but bodily when they come to the body body will have to spend but they don't suffer that's ramakrishna when he was in extreme crucial pain in your throat cancer and someone said oh what a pain ramakrishna is saying oh it's very very painful and turian on the said no sir you don't suffer there is no suffering for you then ramakrishna said that oh the rascal has got me here no you caught me here. that means in that state there is no body the body is not there mind is not there those concepts are not there even laser lesser means even the trace of those thoughts are not there so what is there only saccida nasty nasty now the fourth verse we read today what it says [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] what does it mean very simple kevalam only only when you say keval there is nothing else but that what is that cable brahma mataram only brahman alone that is the thing kevalang brahmatram sat and that is the eternal existence and no or not ostiiti there is no other thing there is nothing else think now there is nothing but brahman what i am seeing is my delusion what i am seeing is my misconception misapprehension misapprehension you know you put a 3d glass and just see what you are seeing and the 3d experience is a real experience no and you really feel that you are in the middle of it and it's hitting you it is attacking you so this experience is real is it real i take out that and then you see nothing but you saw it can you deny you saw it yes i saw it that because you see it is not true it is also misconception of ours so kevalang brahmatram only alone brahman alone is sat his means is no no this deity there is nothing other than that at all not a trace of anything then etibhaya think day and night the harimara studio used to say think day and night i am that i am that i am that no day and night thing as as as we think so we become we have become bodies why i am the body i am the body i am the body those people really in the in in in the world we see those who dare not think of their body they become body bound so much and every day the body will have something but those who don't think they live differently used to come here and one day he was talking with sami and the doctors are saying this and that he was a very upright person he said why do you listen to doctors they will say something but you see your health condition and you just adjust yourself don't have to think about all the problems doctors say of course not to be unscientific but the point of what he's emphasizing if you pay attention to body body body body will be you think that you are not the body body's pain and ex will be less though it will be there in the body but you will not feel it that's why it is said joke is there no so you go to the doctor because doctor will have to survive then he will give the prescription go to the medical yeah pharmacist because they will have to survive and then take the medicine bring the medicine and throw away because you have to survive the question is that it is a survival question so it is mostly because we think of i am the body i am the body i am the body no so one lady came that's the story with sami turiyananda today another always lived in that consciousness not i am not the body that state of consciousness but whenever you know devotees come what they will ask one old senior lady used to come and prostrating and said baba up kai say hi and my father how are you said thursday i'm okay is going on then second day she came again again with the love and affections she said baba apk the third day when she came and said the same thing she said maiji what i want to forget you come and every day remind me again and again how are you how are you then how is your body how is your body i want to forget that and you make me remind me so this is the point say thinking of day and night you know really when we think that my pain is so severe no and no one suffers like me then our pain becomes really heavy when i think my pain is pain but there is other person look this way not that way who has a good health don't look at that then if you compare theirs then you will be miserable why am i suffering that person has no health issues and i have so much health issues i don't eat this i don't do this bad thing i don't do this but still i am suffering and all the time money brooding over that and suffering increases and if you can do this way look that way your suffering reduces i am not special a body is there a machine it will happen but let it go let us take care and forget think of god only mother said no those who take the name of god the suffering which they there to suffer it is reduced when a plow could have plow pain could have been through the body tremendous suffering from them you will feel the pinprick meaning you are not saying body body body body you are saying i am a child of god or i am that whatever your philosophy you talk about that that means that but mind is gone out of the body that much is the really fear but when i have no other resource and i go only to the body and body and body then my suffering increases so that's why we have to find is a thing day and night that i am cave along brahma matram only brahman alone is there and that is only the existence whatever i see it is only brahman now what i'm seeing are not real well it's yes it is real how long it is real so long you see it just i go to sleep where goes my observer of observable universe it's seriousness when we sleep where goes our anxieties worries tension all goes what does it do does it vanish yes man is from my mind when it vanishes from my mind it has no value for me so personally then what you see you see like your dream that's a great example we see the dream no we enjoy the dream or we cry in the dream we our heart gets pumping so hard that we wake up sometime a tiger is attacking me or somebody is chasing me and i am running here the fire has started this way i cannot find a way out and is it happening is it true huh no it is in your mind these are experiences there's one swami in our early days he has some fear because he saw in calcutta right or something so his how home was in calcutta so he saw some very pitiable situation people are running out to save their life and brutally kill that way and he used to feel always some ghost around so one day i was it was about maybe 11 30 or 12 o'clock in the night we used to live side by side small rooms for our brahmacharis and sadhus to stay so and suddenly at midnight it is so calm everywhere and i am hearing some morning sound i said oh my god what is this going on and then he came out of my door and went and where the sound is coming i saw that one room next to me that room see that sound is coming that that swami lives there of our age he recently passed away so and he then i knocked at him and i called his name and said open open open the door what has happened what has happened and put the light on and ultimately he was sat on the bed and then put the light on and yes oh my god he was in the bed and he was perspiring like that and then i said what has happened oh the two long hands coming from the window squats scratching my neck and that's why i i i i saw that he's so really it is so real that his heart is pumping and he's really could not believe that i am talking to him and the light is on and see so that but it is because all in the mind because mind from his past experience mixed with some other ideas and thoughts mind is projecting in the dream and my mind is practically my dream your mind is projecting your dream because you see the dream is it true there is another theory when dreams are true or not to true how to analyze the dream these are all other issues i am not going into that but the point is that in realistic sense you saw some dream means is it true as soon as you wake up it is gone what is the definition of truth truth means it is there it was there it will be there in three period of time past present and future if it retains the sameness then it is called truth what was yesterday is not today and not will be tomorrow how can you say it is truth that's why it is false it is mithya then mithya means did i not see that yes you saw that but that is shankaracharya brings a big philosophy out of it second line bibar tang caitanya [Music] he brings the philosophy of bibar to bada what is vivarta there are philosophies different philosophies of understanding the world viva tabatha means bibarta means without changing the substratum you project something which is just not there like the conventional example there is a rope and you felt it to be snake and you cried out you went to hospital you got injection and come back to watch that it is your room rope never became a snake and the rope has strangled your feet and you thought snake has tangled your feet all your thinking without changing anything in the substratum it is rope remaining all the time before you hit it after you ran snakes neck snake and got all these troubles to take injection and other things but only wisdom came let me go and check it where this snake can come where is that and you say the same rope is sitting over there lying over there so this is called vivarta means you see something without changing what is which is the reality it does not change but you in your mind in your conception you see the change and it becomes so real that you cannot deny it we look at this stars in the night time if there is little darkness you see so many stars in daytime you don't see so what is that it is experience or not if i say it is starry sky in the daytime people will smile smile because i don't see that but story story sky is study all the time study is there i do not see does not give the validity that i am seeing the right thing so similarly vedanta says brahman alone is there whatever you are seeing it is only superimposing and that superimposition is just a non-existent it is just like you created your dream world entire dream world all its anger all his passion all its fire and all his shivering all his joy all created by you you have your mind have created the people and you also there your eyes your nose everything is created by your mind you created a 10 friends all the 10 friends as created by your mind has created 10 friends you have created food drink that food drink everything is created by your mind the road you are walking you are traveling you are driving the car has been kid body of the car has been created by your mind the headlight back light this is that whatever you call about everything is so real as you have seen it is your mental imagination mind created without so but you are lying in the bed when you wake up what is that dream world so that in this is a this is also according to vedanta this is a daydream and this this dream should break when this dream will break then it's called the knowledge that we are established in our knowledge so long we are in this dream this reality is true when you are dreaming everything is true someone is using sweet word to you that is true you feel joy there feel bad someone says something wrong about you hear also the same thing happening but this world is not real because when you go to sleep this world goes away you dream that time this is not here in dream time it is not here in your deep sleep time you are not here when you go to hospital someone goes to hospital and doctors are having some procedure to put anesthesia where goes your hospital where was your doctor where was your disease where goes your own body all vanities managed in wire in the space all vanish but is it real or unreal it is real for the time when we see it when knowledge comes we wake up then you see oh it was some imagination of my mind no reality so if we analyze every day this this thing very seriously you need not have to believe that's why vedanti is very great it is not a religion of faith normally people say what is your faith this is not faith it is your experience you cannot deny tell me who can deny this experience of dream in the world and who can say that dream is dream sometimes you may say oh i saw that dream and that became a reality that is a different issue reality you are talking this as reality again you are making a mistake this is not real this is in a particular state of mind see those were now we find that there are many people who have some psychological problem no they see some subtle bodies ghosts angels this that sometimes people say it is your mental imagination or it is a reality some will be began on this to challenge ramakrishna no these are all your mental hallucination what is the difference between hallucination and reality hallucination is created by mind and your vision and experience is also in the mind but impure mind confused mind creates hallucination pure mind in a purer state and pure state shows the glimpse of the light which is behind and that is steady that will make you strong that will make you fearless and this will create into more confusion into confusion so that's why vedanta does not give much emphasis oh you have seen this you have seen that in the dream you saw that that's good idea if it inspires you but these are all mental creation no value of it that's why even the avatar ramakrishna said no he who has rama he who is krishna he is rama krishna not according to your vedanta why in vedanta name and form is within maya a big dream day dream you break this day dream then you become what you are that's why indoor punisher judy said para dusapniyagum shiva that supreme dushav they say this is swap law but upanishad says dosha it's a bad dream because so much suffering so much pain so much anxiety so much worries all fear fear fear fear we are living in fear all the time no what will happen we do not know if the water the southern california water restriction is coming and if we don't get drink someone sending in rajasthan what will happen there will be no water anymore already gone and water level is going down here what will happen what will are you before death we are all die and this this anxieties are always going to be there give to do something when it breaks so then they become fearless the sword cannot cut me the fire cannot burn me all these ideas become a reality then so this is called bibarto this bibata philosophy is to be understood you put the milk and make it a yogurt yogurt cannot be turned back to milk that's the purity now the world god has become this so this is a another form of god but it cannot go back to its origin vivarta says nothing change has come in your accepting misconception you remove the misconception you see that bright light sachitan on the brahmana is there and that is the experience of all these saints and sages when they go beyond mind and body it's not the pain it is the analysis you are analyzing your experience and your emotions i go to interfaith too i live in the world i eat why do i eat why do i breathe you are accepting this relative existence there you are breathing you are in the dream in the dream you bring so this is a daydream you are breathing so long you are breathing so long you are eating so long your mind is working you go for good bring harmony disharmony is there harmony is there so how to bring harmony that's a better job that's why we do all these things and we have to do nothing to do god realization does not depend on to do something but that will be understood much later when your karma will be done and your mind will be purified you need not have to do anything i am that what to do one of my friends i refer it to you now and then he is probably born when he has joined the order as you promote them he said evening time if we ask him let us go to meditate and who meditates what to meditate upon whom myself meditated who what is the instrument to meditate who is there accepting that my god this is so much advanced in spirituality and vedanta studies no because his father was to be a monk wanted to be a monk but he could not so he's taught his son from the very childhood so he used to in the college classroom used to lead all great master rama krishna gospel or no vedanta books vedanta text used to read not the text books because that was so much ingrained into him some people may say only but don't follow but he was really he believed that and he used to stand in them what to that i am atman say that what work will you do you cannot attain it by and having family and children or having wealth and prosperity and not north honey no no and not by vast land and property nothing it is only by pure intellect you can understand this so say say again and again i am that i am that then i said okay if i pinch you you cry oh that you did my body body is body so long body in the body level body body will react that's a physical thing in physical reaction but i am not that so you see that strength of the mind to think in this way so kevalang brahma matrang only there is brahman alone brahman alone is the only existence and not sought no austin even a trace of anything else is there that is not true contemplate upon this everything you see is truly like a dream an illusory appearance which is bibarto vivarto we just discussed it is called the bibarto it is the illusory appearance appearance is there but it is not real appearance but it is it is illusory appearance and when illusion will go away this appearance will also vanish therefore what we see in the world it is like a dream and be worth them we are seeing the bibarto without transforming it looks different it looks something changeful but it has not as i give the example milk has become yogurt that is called the purina it has become converted but vivotto [Music] it is nothing it is water and milk is milk it has no it cannot be get converted or it it is that all the time bhaktri [Music] sense objects and they show color this means the space and time color is the time etc etc whatever we see [Music] bhaktri ghatri kriya aadhikam bhakti i am enjoying it gathri i am understanding this intellectually bhoktri gayatri kriya i am acting this way i am working this working upon that etc etc etc these are not true robots are working but robot has no ego this is also a reward robot but it has an ego and that ego is the cause of suffering ego is identifying here you can identify with the cosmic reality so mithya thought all these visuals the same subjects the time space etc and the enjoyer bhaktri gathering the noaa et cetera et cetera and the activities done by the senses mithya these are all unreal mitha means it is not hallucination like maya it appears but it is not there it has its relative existence that's something about bharanam maharana means it appears no kinchit there is nothing as such na pikincano nothing is there no object ever be possible like that so the sense objects space time etc the enjoyer knower the actions all are false all of them are false appearances like dream nothing else exists in the list so it is a that's why it is open secret no i am reading it but still as soon as i look at this solid table it's real i look at you it's real i'm looking at me it is real no because it has gone into the very core of our thinking process we have to rewind the clock rewinding the clock ram holy mother said there are karma they look like a kite example kite flying kite and they to measure how high they make one color say 100 feet another color 100 feet they tie together so as it has gone out you have let the mind go and roam around in the world now you want to withdraw then you turn it close close it and bring it back the same way as you have let it go the same way it should come back the way we went out of our own self we have to come back to ourselves with the same effort so that if what is to be done i am i actually we are all that only little clouds of ignorance is creating this difficulty sun is all the time in the sun sky only little cloud only little cloud makes the day clouded and we cry today there is no sun in our life there is no sun i am alone i am to suffer who is there for me even there are some people but when i suffer i suffer alone so this is the feeling but the sun is not gone anywhere only the cloud be removed instant some sun sun will be appearing our sun comes out in its own glory the sun of knowledge son of wisdom the eternal light within is all the time there only because we have never trained the mind to think that way it has taken that stand i am not the body but i am the body i am not the mind always i am the mind otherwise why we get so much upset if someone says some few words are words in the combination and permutation of the alphabets is it not if you look at that construction wise a sentence construction or anything it is on the words play of the words and that makes me happy unhappy and i am so subject to that and i cry and weep in that life why because you're so ignorant and we don't hear the message we hear as i say we hear here it goes there but here is here that is called sravana listening that is not hearing that is manana to reflect to reflect to reflect again and again again and again again and yes why why why not why am i doing this self analysis no so how much time is spent whole day look at our lives lifestyle how much work is there but we can if we wish we can use much more time on this subject but very valuable subject is comes in the newspaper and in the what you call the media social media very serious very serious very and these are all coming one after another bombarding on me bombarding on me and i think okay okay okay okay okay and never think of these things so that's why spiritual life is to be awake and aware of this truth and this is our own truth it is not that we are talking about somebody else it is our own experiences of every day is making us feel like that but we think it is satnavat vanam it is only like dream is an appearance only it is a bibarto nothing has changed brahman remains the brahmana the rope remains the room only the snake appears and disappears so i cannot change the rope how much i cry and weep rope will remain wrong brahman will remain brahmana how much i say swami bibi canada say let go thy whole sannas in bold say om let god i hold we hold on because i and me when i am this little i'll have to hold on to something but when i think i am infinite who have to hold on everything is holding on me but we very difficult to think about that it is a frightening thought i will be lost if i think this way so vedantic thinking actually makes one bold though it appears very pessimistic at the beginning but it's the most words of optimism not to depend on anything but to depend on the self which is already there you know the consciousness has never left us the day we came into the work in this world and behind my all awareness all knowing these that if we say knowing is through the senses then the consciousness which allows it that is constantly there that's why it is a beautiful experience we are going through but we never think pancho does he refers this point again and again that in ostamati is that consciousness sumbit the consciousness asia this consciousness never goes never comes it's 24 hours mass abdo 365 days month goes away year goes away no 222 started now it is already june and today is already so many time gone tomorrow is again coming wednesday jugo is going on time is mass is going on ma of the kalpa kolpa means thousands and thousands of years how many eons make a juga huh big measurement of time called this gauta gamma issue this time is in the spiral going on and on and on okay in various ways the time passes but the consciousness which is behind us this consciousness never rises like a sun rises or not the sun sets consciousness never sets look at that from the child till today i say i i i i as if that eye has no age but when you talk about oh i am now this 80 years old then you are talking to the body this happened in this year you are referring to a particular time but who has observed the time somebody should observe then memory will possible unless you observe the incident you cannot say you cannot recall any memory so the memory because of the memory you have to accept that there is some consciousness in me who is observing all the activities of today daytime when i go the sleep whatever you dream that observer will observe it then say oh i had a good dream last night oh i have a bad dream last night oh i was crying so much and then he means i have a good sleep also somebody they have to watch your sleep also who is that guy if you say oh no no no what is that no no no you you say you had a good sleep i have a good sleep so i is somebody he have an experience of good sleep some say i dreamed last night so dream is a subject somebody has observed it and all the days activity good bad with your anger or love or affection or fright and whatever qual everything has been recorded by someone else and that guy never sleeps that is called god that is called vedantic word brahman or atman or consciousness that's the consciousness all the time and it does not sleep that's why we say we give we put the lord to bed when god goes to bed if you look at the whole world where is his sleep he is sleeping one place another place someone is right hey get up morning time oh lord get up and this person goes to another within few seconds time changing you know zone zone zone zone so god has no sleep that's a god is named as pomitra pure stainless oh on earth you never have a winging of the eyes blinking of the eyes you have never because you are on idro no nidra god is named as anidro that consciousness is on it that's why as you go not this we have this full moon night it's called jagannath yatra and jagannath round eyes why it is round there is no eyelid blinking no blinking animation all the time observing whatever you are doing that's why we say whatever you want to do you can lock yourself in the do door get in a room and you do something good or bad god records everything everything is recorded there that means they mean that the consciousness never sleeps so think of that in me is that all the time but i never pay attention to that only looking outside uma so okay i am the enjoyer i am the noah kriya the actions we perform all are false all are unreal all of the mithya all of them are false appearances not something about like dream bharanam it appears it appears like that no kinchit nothing else exists at all without that so that is to be thought again and again and again vedanta is yeah reading vedanta is easy i can finish the book today but it is not the purpose purpose is to think more thinking if it takes on a some little deep impression in our mind and make us thoughtful then we do the manana reflection and then deep reflection brings the reality needed and needed darshan takes us to the experience that vedanta students have three things to do listen as you are listening or you read that's also listening concentratedly and analyze analyze hammer hammer and hammer till the mind becomes clear yes yes i understand now and then dive deep into that understanding go deeper and deeper and the world you live in the world but this world will appear like a dream world sometimes we have some uh half dream hap awake no you are still awake at the same time you are dreaming it happens our awakening will be like that the ghanis they live in the world they live like that like us they eat they talk like us all the brahmagan is brahmananda shivananda rama baby ramakrishnan and all these people all the saints of the world they lead like us eat like they talk like as a butt they have the awakening there they see what is behind and they act accordingly so we will read next day from verse number six only we did two verses okay that's okay you have any questions online you have any question please get ready [Music] so thank you who are online and we'll have some question now and any question comes we'll spend some time few minutes one question has come if the world is just an appearance and the events of the world are just a motion picture playing on the screen then how brahmagan is like swamiji could identify himself so much with the pain of the common people or do brahma-ganis conduct themselves in the world knowing all well that they are just playing a part in a play it's a good question if you say that is all false all unreal appearance only then why these people christ comes buddha comes christ comes why they come and why they behave like that why they act like that do we come i can see your face sit somewhere ah little adjustment okay this is the adjustment of mind [Music] so adjustment of mind is this when they are vivekananda like people they come down from this experience of consciousness they see that same consciousness everywhere but they do not know we do not know they look at us and say i am a brahmon i am brahman i am the bliss absolute but what a pity i do not know that people don't know and they're crying and weeping because of that ignorance so they feel infinite compassion and to remove the coverings of our mind they come and act and do all these things they weep and cry for our good so that is their sign of their spirituality when you become spiritual your heart will be very soft you will feel differently than you are feeling now it will feel every suffering is your suffering every joy is your joy wherever you find any suffering you know it is not my anyone suffering individual is he feeling his suffering because he is identifying in the brahman consciousness the substratum is it not look at that it is a scientific truth you give suppose calm surface of the ocean now it hit in one place with a 100 000 pound missile or something like that that vibration may be big there but is it not felt in a fine vibration goes to the distance because it's one so there is no location because this vibration they have the sensitive instrument their mind is so sensitive our this look at the world people are brutally killing someone and they're happy by killing how they can torture and kill there are people like that but there are sensitive people even cannot bear the suffering of others the tear comes in their house and they want to do something they sell their home they do all these types of activities which really very difficult that others even people think that they're fools they are doing so much because their sensitivity has grown how the sensitivity will come oneness vedanta gives that oneness no then your suffering is not your suffering it is my suffering my finger gets caught i saw my finger what is there in it i don't feel the pain of the finger and i have a head injury do i not feel the injury of the head am i in something strikes in your toes don't you feel the pain you feel the pain because that whole world is me big me capital me so they live in that consciousness that's why they out of their bounty of their heart they cannot butt stop as a nasty person cannot but torture others steal others money cheat other people so these people also by their own constitution they cannot but do the thing [Music] his ego was not our ego so long you live in the world you should have some ego ramakrishna said pakami kachami a ripe indigo and unripe indigo our ego is unripened that means it centers around my my pleasure my happiness my peace my joy my food my house my building my friend my my my me and my my my mum is called vedantic understanding about the truth not me me my my then it becomes that becomes spiritual me to thou me to you so that transformation when it comes then you are unfolding your divinity and that is taking us closer to god can you talk about suicide my best friend committed suicide and so if the world is not real did i write her suicide in my story since we are of the same one mind either suicide is a case this is a first of all you take the world to be real so if you take that point of reality then yes suicide is bad suicide comes out of depression but depression is where depression happens in your mind people become happy or unhappy in mind so my person may be very excited in the mind and also will be very depressed in the mind when that that's a disease of the mind so in that case it is really suffering and no religion supports the suicidal situation because karma is not ended you'll have to have the same karma going on so but the body is not there but the tendencies are working there so it's a difficult situation so it is not supported by the scriptures for every religion but the point is that whatever happens the soul is like he is living in a dream world we are suppose i am sleeping and dreaming and sometimes someone comes and chops my head okay i'll be in my mental level and then i want to come back to the body and there is nobody what will happen then you'll have to be limbo and we'll have to find when i can get opportunity to have another body but this body which has been chopped out it could have lived another 10 years so in that period the suicidal soul he has to move in darkness to find out this body was to eat he has to go to see something all the desires which have been fulfilled by this body there is no body there is no car and your desire is there what will you do it is a painful thing no you want to go somewhere and you are designed to go there but your car is no more there and you are in a position where you are alone no so that's why it's called very painful state but we can pray for them always we can really uh pray to god that to give them peace and then soulless so those things we can do because it is soul individual soul entered into this body individual goes out of the body so we can pray for that and by god's grace things can happen okay so anything oh okay first of all uh to continue from the first question for the god-realized person i could see how when identifying with oneness of being they would want to see harmony amongst all people to identify and feel the suffering of other people but in identifying even further back the brahmin pure awareness pure consciousness unchanging awareness that doesn't do anything that is in somebody like they wouldn't want to do anything no in that state they remain in samadhi there is no question of doing anything that person also does the best in the world because their vibration their their lofty state generates some energy it silently works in the mind of others but they cannot do anything ramakrishna when he needs to go to samadhi no action he cannot talk he cannot sit he cannot dance he cannot express any idea but he's in a very high state or altered state of uh situation where his joy and bliss and radiating that and that vibration impacts people all over the world that is the same thing after this gita he got back his strength and then i will do this gita always says karishay bachanam say gita ends where either started with so many questions of this oh lord what do you say i will follow that will that happen after when they started the world next morning put in the day yeah that's a duty there's a duty and you know these are you can't say that but after this type of knowledge which is given by bhagavan krishna to arjuna he's not an ordinary guy or generally a high grade student high class student because god has spoken to him twice no this bhagavad-gita and living with lord lord god is itself you can think how rare is the opportunity again another question salvation that the devotee get by succeeding in their sadhana of their chosen deity how is that different from kohiball namaksha nirvikalpa samadhi you know salvation that devotees get by succeeding in their sadhana when you say sadhana and they succeed in their sadhana of meditating on his chosen ideal say rama say krishna say rama krishna this ramakrishna does not remain ramakrishna as i give the example when the ambition comes i give that example form dissolves it merges into the infinite form the formless form so therefore different is no different from kohiballah it is a terminology ah when one transcends all this level and remain in that consciousness that state is the ebola state that is called we need to be composted but don't get mixed up with technical um language because technical language his own deeper intellectual meaning but we are not going to that let us go to the experience when you reach that experience there is no more expression of the duality so you remain in that consciousness stay in that consciousness and that may be moksha what do you mean by moksha eternal liberation or you have to come back again there may be little lower level you can come back again for the good of the world for your own enjoyment bhakti says i want to enjoy the sugar i don't want to be sugar so all these states are there but depending on where we cannot just terminologically we cannot understand that every terminology has its own connotation but main thing that let us understand when we go from the duality to that level of non-dual extreme point where body identity mind etcetera all gone banished that is called the state of nirvana if you call nirvana that is called the nirvikalpa but again if you go intellectually to the scholars there will be much difference between these terminology so we are not thinking from that perspective okay thank you tomorrow gospel class and then i will be here to give you the gospel class and most importantly day after tomorrow one will be our honored guest who
