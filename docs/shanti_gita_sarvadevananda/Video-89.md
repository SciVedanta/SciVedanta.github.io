with folder see you Krishna the what is the essence of your real nature oh Krishna did me I am an ordinary original what shall I know Krishna what shall I tell you o Krishna namami I salute you only [Music] I salute you Lord Krishna who is established in the heart of all beings concept and not only that what is second verse we read you are the Eternal absolute real existence the cause of the creation of the whole universe [Music] this world renowned world is established on your Divine self IE your form is infinite Barada is all blessing and compassion kripalu full of compassion [Music] o Krishna I salute you who reside in the heart of all and is the foundation of all existence how shall I describe your the truth with much details I do not know even what is the Deep significance of your of your reality Tommy your sister comes down and Saturn there is no spiritual practice they cannot understand but you are standing before us but you have deluded us we think that you are like one of the Kings you have greater skill to fight or guide you have something special but how do I understand looking at you the ordinary people because you have deluded their eyes so ramakrishna Hindi is to come to ramakrishna they thakur is speaking about their spiritual discussion or discussing the spiritual issues and the Calcutta babus have come it does not he does not like it they're poking and pushing their friend hey let's go ah what is this God God what will God let us go they said he's saying such wonderful teachings now unless then after another two minutes he sat and he could not stay there he had to leave that place and so okay I am going to have fresh air at the boat fresh air in the boat and ganga air will be whole life but you will not get ramakrishna again in life but who can understand who can understand Even in our life we have seen I visited but I was not much impressed his old man lying down and we want some fiery person and giving something bold statement like that rather I was attracted to those type of sadhus and some of the Southern influenced me don't go go Premiership is Excellence holy mother Disciple This that that and I went and I saw that old man lying in the bed so we have seen our grandma grandpa like that what is the special of that which is very difficult to recognize even a whole event what the question of Avatar they hide themselves by by their deluding power so he's here is an open statement that how can I describe in the past means I have seen your Bishop in the cosmic form and Tommy I have seen you you are the ishara the lord of the universe creator of the universe sustainer of the universe and what you have done you are standing before us as Krishna by deluding the whole planet as it serve all not this all the planes of personalities human gods angels they get all deluded [Music] what does it mean s Everyone everybody who looks at you krsna they know you what is your description you are born in the clan of brisney dynasty and pandavanang sakha you're different the pandavas cript Arjuna you are a friend of them yeah and your hurry you are just is a friend the God has hurry what shall I describe you about your that the Eternal truth which you carry even the gods means all the gods even the gods do not know your glory what I shall know it is like the humble statement of Girish goes no girisco said whom biasa and balmiki could not describe I am an ordinary Girish what shall I talk about you whom biaso and balmiki could not describe that that is a that ignited the fire in ramakrishna no it reminded him he is who was Rama who is Krishna he is ramakrishna that that Consciousness so how to understand that even the gods cannot describe you Gods cannot understand you then how can I describe you no how can I I understand you you are the lord of the universe so really Swami Vivekananda even such a person is talking about ramakrishna he declined he said shall I make a monkey out of creating a Shiva upon that means he is frightened no to describe ramakrishna to understand who can understand more than Ram Swami Vivekananda but that's why it is it is we do not actually is so simple so humble and it is not at much attraction nordinary people don't feel much attraction because they see the outside Glory if someone goes with The Godly with the matted hair and then basma here and here here was more and all over this and ten Gardens and ten then you see a like in a single I am the lord of the universe no come and there will be one a beautiful Lotus of gold or silver and your feet will be put over there you understand he's somebody in ramakrishna one cloth a half naked person could not get it even and then the honorable people of that time like who they win he invited ramakrishna and then he withdrew his invitation because he's a very highly educated person mixing this sophisticated people in the British people no and he is naked person he will go and dance and sing and do the drop his clothes then what will happen say he invited no no you don't come again so invitation was done but invitation was withdrawn so who will understand this this guy who has been very much praised at a pagla is a crazy guy a crazy high abduction so who will understand is God himself but he was twinkling of an eye the stars and galaxies they are created going to Boyd no said so powerfully do you know who is ramakrishna is not that we are the child of ramakrishna do you know who we are we have the power to crush the Stars on hinge the planets into the void no I'll throw the word heart into the void oh my god do you know who am I I am ramakrishna's child see who who is that ramakrishna and what we see here is like this sitting as he don't know anything of the word no most humble and always saluting saluting you know the life humble and the duster the dust of your feet you know this is ramakrishna so who will understand [Music] who can Know You O Lord unless you make his mind clear and you make it possible your grace then whole world knows you that you are a business you are born in the clan of the business Dynasty and pandavanang shahori you are the harida Shaka the friend of the pandavasam how can I describe what shall I describe what shall I say about you about your real nature there even the Devas the gods who are very pure and who are enlightened much enlightened that we humans they even cannot describe it what are we that is the verse number 45 so 40 forces the previously seen Cosmic form was very you the Supreme Lord himself deluding the inhabitants of all the planes of existence you are now manifesting in this form of Krishna before me everyone knows you as brishni the one born in brisney Clem as a friend of pandavas as hurry what shall I say about your essential nature which even the gods do not know now hearing all these praises then the bhagavan God lord Shri Krishna then responded to these praises okay [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] here here the original praise to the highest no you I saw your the cosmic form and that is you no as if Cosmic form is the great experience but no that is not highest that seeing is there seeing Seer seeing all these Duality is there he's heading hinting to that it is my Maya only what you see in the cosmic form that also you see in my Maya I created the delusion he knew to think that I am their world is there foreign truth you know the reality when you will be touched will be no one of Truth he will be open till you are chattering you are praising will all stop you are talking so much about my praise I am this that that all will stop just when you need a lot of Truth foreign is there any speech is anyone to say anything anyone to hear anything so that's a state therefore now be silent oh my friend is my magic only it is my only just a mesmerizing factor to show my glory in the world of Duality today [Music] [Music] you got deluded seeing my Cosmic form you thought I am the lord of the universe this is that but who am I you till you have to understand that it is beyond all understanding no it is beyond all understanding so you want to understand that then be silent don't talk when you talk then you are in duality and you have not understood anything so it is and it is who am I it is a subject of experience allliness Darkness who will say thatness who will say Holiness that is also cannot be said that is only the Sami Vivekananda Express that word only one who have experienced he understands otherwise all these scriptures are talking about that it is only to explain that ultimate truth how what it is and how it is but no one have finished it only when they go to samadhis thus name is silence when they go into the silence their silence is the name of the ultimate truth that story [Music] teacher and student so the student went to the teacher with humility and frustration and then he said sir please don't teach me about Brahman and he said teaching you Brahman what shall I teach no as he didn't say anything yeah I am saying that he he didn't say anything just become silent and how long you can wait you come with serious question and when you come you see your teacher is not responding you to your question you become impatient so after being silent for some time he became impatient and he's asking the teacher sir please tell me I really want to know what is Brahman like please describe please explain a teacher didn't say anything and continued continued and lastly she said sir please tell me I wish to know what is Brahman like I was to understand what is an then the teacher said my child I was teaching you what Brahman is by silence but you didn't understand that you want it through words no so that is not what I says this is not what is the reality anything you see anything you feel anything you do that is not that truth what you are seeing feeling experiencing it is beyond all so here also bhagavan is telling don't get overwhelmed here is a great indication of our our personal life we think seeing something some vision I saw some Divine form mother Kali or Durga or Christ or something we think that say oh my God he said Vision it's an experience what achievement in vedantic terminology it is only just a glimpse of that but nothing don't get stuck there you are making a mistake what is that that cannot be described that cannot be expressed so long you are in expression seeing each other it is Duality it is meaning yatra one sees another I See You In This Plane but in a Mystic plane you see something this was a mind so one sees the other you say I dream I saw some voice srinoti you saw this plane and that plane the tree terrorism you are smelling you are in taking you're seeing something feeling something these are all Martin it is all it ends experience does not stay long when you come down what happens that vision is gone you saw a beautiful dream last night where is that it is in a memory now in a memory stick USB it always moves there whatever we see everything goes there so it's mortam it has to die it will end martham that's very limited it is there it is subject to death and it is limited therefore it is not this is not that what I am talking about that is the message here bhagwan is saying though it is a great thing to see River the cosmic form of God but it is also not that what I am that's his thing therefore you are deluded by that you are overwhelmed with that vibration that is think contemplate meditate reflect Beach deeply profoundly go into that analysis and find out what is your real nature you are seeing here Krishna these God don't see find out you yourself Who You Are your whole spiritual nature because of being deluded by the Maya the fools and [Music] I made a mistake who get deluded by this they are mudha they are fools they are not the Noir of truth but they are not beyond the Maha delusion or you can be meaning you be a doctor you be a Noah of Truth you get out of the delusion of this confusion get out of that foreign 47 says o son of kunti you are confused by the Maya reflect upon your own essential nature the ignorant that we will led by The Cosmic ignorance but the north of Truth are free from delusion so you try to understand who are you unless you know yourself you cannot know me that's also another thing ah that's why we cannot see God everywhere unless we see here that's why meditation is so important in our personal practice everyday practice to concentrate here and that's why this withdrawing the Mind from the external is the first step and when that touches gained here then you open your eyes then it is here it is there it is everywhere so author the God those who are not that law of Truth they get deluded like this girl you know yourself that then don't think even my Cosmic form it is also my Maya it is also my delusion see it is a very deep statement a very profound statement that bhagavan Krishna is saying that Vision what you saw and you are overwhelmed and we we all think what a great chapter is 11th chapter Krishna himself is nullifying that it is not the highest it is also within the realm of Maya but understand we should not discard it that is bad but it is a lower type of ignorance in which I see all the hid this world of Duality and my uh my anguish my love my hatred my feeling of anger these that in this level this is higher level but both happen because their mind it is not mind Beyond mind state and whatever is happening in the mind mind is Maya some people cannot Define what is Maya in his lectures he said mind is Maya this mind is creates bondage this mind given gives Freedom it's you look at that even in our day-to-day life a person is very sick but mentally very strong he's suffering from physically but mentally very cheerful when mind is the factor which determines everything and controls us mind there is nothing has happened psychologically for a little affected no say depressed nothing has happened he's full of power but as if he has become helpless powerless nothing he cannot stand up but physically medically doctor says nothing medically he's perfectly okay so this whole world is spiritual world or non-spiritual world it is all the level of mind so go beyond mind this world vanishes we all the experience that state every day when you go to Deep Sleep what happens where is your our world of Anguish Our World of Fun our world of reality I have lost my job I will get my job what will happen to me anxiety worries where does it go I am excited I got it something I will I am a powerful person where does all Venice when we go mind becomes into deep sleep that is not a realization though in deep Sleep mind goes to ignorance state but when mind becomes aware and moves in the spiritual journey that's meditation what is happen going to sleep and going to make it man many samadhi these are the difference we every day go to our own home Eternal Abode of peace and perfection but there is a deep dark Veil here is the one that you can feel almost it percolates through it but we do not know what is that it's because the veil of ignorance is there it is a sleeping condition dark state of mind now one is sit for meditation and consciously is moving not the body not the mind and going deeper deeper deeper it's all conscious movement and you hit that point your conscious mind is conscious then it penetrates the Veil or even going there they get overwhelmed and then they get attracted more and the drops the veil drops huh the fall of the burning Berlin Wall and then the illumination comes yeah so this is the major thing to consciously move that's why day and night we need to read Santi Gita or the Gita whatever to aware since his his bhagavan is giving the last message what you see not Vision but know yourself just now he said contemplate on yourself who are you all round about the ultimate teaching for a higher student but this is a very high student like Arjuna but I am an immature person and I start thinking I am Atman I'll be egotistic sometime I am that okay I am that means I am what I am this body mind I wait to get out of this body mind I that's why vedanta is good somebody is dangerous because this is to be understood the preparation is necessary it is truth is truth this Arjuna is getting at the end of Cosmic vision and all these messages he got and con absorbed and understand and then the SRI bhagavan is giving him the idea who are you try to think about that what is eye Consciousness what is that me what is the real life yeah now 48 verse [Music] this is the praise of this text that is a style of the scriptures when you that the glory of the book he says that now what you do foreign what I have told you it is shantida in him it will bring peace it will confirm peace to all whoever listens you know we are all in trouble in our life and when the trouble takes our position we become overwhelmed with that position we forget that this is nothing in life it comes and goes I am not that I am something higher than that I am beyond that so that concept he reinstills so that's why it is a Shanti Gita this shantigita Imam partho this you know I have been I told you that is shantida in him it will bring peace it is it gives Shanti not only should give Shanti just who will listen to this both the reader and the person who has listening they will be freed from this bondage the seconds of Mondays of this world and worldliness so it is an assertion that means you should listen oh these three things are coming listening and then reflecting and Diving deep into that truth if it happens then mukta said he'll be free from Babu the bondage of this worldly bondage it will be freed om 49 cheats foreign that person after that knowledge foreign or talking about this or contemplating on that gradually gradually one will be free and when one becomes free he will never be deluded again he will never again be in the turmoil of this bondage of birth and death again it will that means whatever material thing we gain know it may be position of the person for say some days or maybe his whole lifetime but it will have to you have to give up but this you achieve never to be given up you are you will be no more delusion no more cloud can cover that person's wisdom I am always trying to play with no this world is a play God is playing foreign God is playing in this world you know so that is a different perspective there is no man there is no woman there is no anger there is no frustration there is a farm it's a good joy to see Divine playing with the Divine there's nothing but the divine so this type of delusion that I am again a person who is a person and all this will not happen that is a state normally we this question suppose anything in the material world we gain we have to leave it behind you get a PhD but PhD you cannot carry when this body is gone you are a millionaire a billionaire money you know Bank in your mortgage or wherever you are it will stay over there you cannot touch and take it even the body you like so much the body even wants grain one hair one strain of here you cannot take it but if you have this knowledge it is you nothing to leave nothing to go it is you everywhere and that will not be again deluded that is the jivan mukti the big question comes then how do people Vivekananda getting angry what is this ah that is a play ah if there's just in a split second they go back to their connection because they for the good of the world they take a body and ramakrina said when he goes into samadhi is in that state and he says that I will drink a glass of water or something he says I come down 10 cubit in the spiritual plane if that is the room a 10 Cubit down then he can water a word and then come down come down this is only for the good of humanity those who are liberated in this life they to finish their prayer of the karma The Remnant work which is to fractify in this life for that only they come down to body and they act like human being they sometimes become angry they sometimes like or behave like ordinary person sometimes goon ramakrishna said the ganis behave it cannot restrict in any way because according to their background of their prayer of the karma they last after wisdom not attaining the knowledge they come down and live in the world but they are never forgetful about their Divine Glory once you touch that ground never ever to forget that so this is the no Karachi therefore no kadashid never ever that person mojito Momo Maya will never be deluded by by Maya atmogano foreign is emphasizing ultimately all is here it starts from there our spiritual life starts from there look at our life when we started our spiritual life we go to Temple we go to a deity we go to a holy man it starts there to end in here because everything is that and that one and that is in and out that is both the all are the same so because of the dawn of the knowledge of the Atman shoko Shanti Ashoka the bereavement you are your son has been killed in the war and you are thinking how can you get out of the bereavement because no one is dead that wisdom will come one million waves are playing and dancing in the ocean of the Pacific ocean surface surface of the Pacific Ocean no when you are we are looking at from the website or your Ripple side each wave is fighting with other someone is in love someone is in hatred someone is consuming someone is fitting if you take that play in equilibrium level it is a really it's a many difficult to survive there contesting World fighting World jealousy this is that now you want to understand that is all the play up there water ocean water then it's a joy who is playing with whom God is playing with God as our Krishna said the grasshopper was held by a boy and the boy took the grasshopper and putting a stick within his body and ramakrishna in that spiritual moods clapping his hand said oh Rama you are doing your own trouble in the stick so that's a state of total freedom total joy and no one can take that Joy so that's why you just said know who you are Shanti your peace will Dawn because our bereavement will go away and Gita by the grace of this bhagavat this Gita Shanti Gita he will gain that type of Peace forever foreign [Music] [Music] six verses are there so and then still to go through it again quick synopsis of the seven chapters so that will start continue after this so now I can end here today a few minutes 10 minutes are there that can be kept for any question any question has come no question no very inspirational but here also we get much in insights are very deep that how we think in spiritual life that says that nirpi samadhi your Spiritual Journey Begins no actually then spiritual life we are non-spiritual people we are only talking about that thinking about that in our bed and in application we are failing every day but even if someone succeeds once one time or two time that we are not established in that truth therefore our spiritual life has not started spiritual life life of joy spiritual life a life of full Bliss and total contentment how one can feel it unless one is absorbed in that Consciousness ramakrishna deep in that Consciousness actually ramakrishna's spiritual life he knows what is spiritual life we had a mixture of non-spiritual 905 percent one percent two percent five percent ten percent twenty percent maybe uh depending on the who is the intended they can feel this Glory of it but it is so more emphasis that's why to uh practice and to keep the mind in this lofty thought uh we we talk about these are all words uh all all are all are it is not that difficult unless it is difficult because we don't keep the mind in a lofty level if someone practices to keep the Mind always in their lofty level the world will change transform their actions will be totally different that's the meaning of purpose of this ramakrishna tradition also that's why it is called ramakrishna machine is an admission as a mission you enter into it and angularities are there either this way to make it polish grinding it goes cut this side chop this side and that is the way ultimately to bring out a beautiful ornament at the feet of the Lord so it is a sincere responsibility is there how to emphasize in our spiritual practices and don't get happy too much happy seeing one dream how many people get seriously affected by this dream business I have seen a dream what is that habit has it transformed your life ramakrishna tradition teaches you if it transforms your life then it is Meaningful if the character is not transformed your vision is no vision so that's why it is a play it's a good of course good the mind in a higher state is good always but it is don't get it must have elated that you have achieved something in spiritual life that's why we are reading the other day sarudananda Swami saying that it is the life and character character of the person how much it is improved that is the sign how much you get detached to the happenings of life things happen in light we have no control over that but how much we react how much we come back to our balance uh how much we have some anger and frustration with somebody how quickly we reconcile that not that he will not be angry even Brahma can you will be angry ramakrishna is to getting Vivekananda who would stand before him he will fire everyone of this war snow so when something goes wrong he will be so angry and so Disturbed but see in a second and that is also for a purpose for the good of us and good of the world he is scolded equally he's called into all the Indian people and he scolded all day American people his Universal father wherever there is trouble and difficulty smashed it so this is the state which comes in a person's life so spirituality is to be understood I am not saying that your good dreams are bad or you have some experience is bad but these are Miles Milestone mild post no a sign that is yes I'm in the right track but nothing more than that and when it will culminate as we did today they saw you know your own self you know who you are and they're being established in that knowledge then the culmination will come it will not go tomorrow is my gospel oh I try yeah tomorrow we'll have a gospel class at five seven thirty like this so we end here today [Music] okay open it wrong boss so today no question so we finished it early yeah these are conclusions where the question conclusive thing when when you go to some intellectual level to talk
