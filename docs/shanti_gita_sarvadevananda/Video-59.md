[56. Shanti Gita - Class 56 - Verse 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFMGirN9pXg)

[Music] m oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face on peace peace peace be unto us all so we are talking about in the 5 verse number 33 0. we have read that last time though but still it is a synopsis of many verses that's why i want to recapitulate that the 30th verse says how the gang is the north of truth wander around and live in the world and why so much of differences of in their pattern of behavior that because the scripture says we are all born with our past samaskaras impressions we call swamaskaras so a person even realized but his past impressions forces him till the body for drops of in this particular life so this particular life is run by prarabdha karma three types of karma one is creoman what you are doing now all the deeds you are doing good bad its impact immediate impact and also later impact immediate impact good bad happiness misery pleasure pain sometimes you get sometimes you don't get how many people in the world doing all nasty things and having very fine time but where their work effect of them will go it is accumulated in his bank account debit credit and and he does not know but the impact of all these is our character so when one in this life we are moving that is the clioman means acting now what i am working you can come here to listen to this class you can go to a dancing party you can come here you can talk to some people uh politics that much freedom is there that's the crew man what you are doing and is creating your future or you are meditating or you are in reading a wonderful spiritual text uplifting your mind or even engaged in some vulgar useless thing this freedom is there for every person so that is the crew man what you are doing now its impact will be there immediately some impact but afterwards it is accumulated in my skull so similarly this is kriyaman and one is the prayer of though the momentum which gives this life to move on like you take a bullet and gun and fix the point i will hit this side or that side you can choose where you will like but you when it is decided i'll shoot and trigger it when the bullet goes out that means you take a birth and the bullet is moving on to the destination then you say oh ho ho you should not go that it should go to this no it's direction it is momentum is his forces are all there and it will move in that direction till it drops you can change the direction beforehand but not now that's why in this life whatever you are to experience pleasure or pain happiness and misery it is determined beforehand because you have triggered your momentum your desire one desire has pushed you to this direction my dear my life is my way your life is your way but then what is use of brahmagana brahmacanu means you know this is the functioning of the body i am not connected with that when you cut that the knowledge of with the sword of knowledge then what happens then you know the truth but still the body goes in its own momentum do you know this is matter this is only appearance this is only a show but so long the body is functioning and the momentum is still at the back of you it will force you to go in that direction that's why we find that the behavior of the holy people are so different brahmagani is lotu manas i'm talking about the lives we know why so much different why maharaja is like that and babur maharaja is like that why mahaprabhu's marriage is like that if we underst try to understand that because they have their karma of course they are realized so they are born pure i am not going to that discussion to understand the philosophy of karma i am giving this citing these examples now another karma is there which is stored up in my box infinite number of stocks are there how many things we did from this childhood till today all the karma karma is done you mean instant effect you get a good food your tongue says good that's gone but the impression of that sweetness goes down into your subconscious mind layers after layers after layers so infinite number of layers of samskara that's called the sanchito accumulated past and it can give birth to infinite number of lives and deaths because any of the impulses come from there puts a momentum starts a new life goes something this way accumulates something more again come back that's require coming and going becomes a cycle so these are the three types of karma when you realize god what happens immediately your accumulated bundle that has no effect in your life because you have severed it knowing the truth is all our minds play so it is gone and at that point of knowledge you see two things together the name and form at the same time background is such you down you see the gold as also the ornament together most of the people see the ornament and its design the world and this beauty and this ugliness but only this enlightened people they see it is permeated by god the eternal love and joy and bliss so these are the and but this life also continues till it falls till it drops up the bullet drops up at a certain point so that is why their behavior pattern is all different so that parts has been mentioned in the 30th verse so we have discussed a little bit but i am going to the same reading again chanting again you join with me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it means ganny then what's up truth [Applause] gyani means they are some of the men of wisdom are indifferent they are not entitled ganyikoshi some of them birak taha means withdrawing from the science objects tactical they give their attachment to enjoyment of the world nirasha they are be left of any expectation they don't expect anything from the world that type of people will be fined that that these people abandoned all types of worldly enjoyments nirajam without have no expectation for anything but some you find kashida vogi they are engaged in eating good food sleeping in a royal dress wearing costumes and things like that beautiful dress garland so it appears what type of sadhu is he but it is don't think like that it is his inner spirituality is awakened but the body is going on due to product probably he has a born in a lord's family in a jovinda landlord family or a very rich millionaire family if he becomes a monk so wherever he will go even when he is in the forest good food will run and run after him so many noble people will say salute them it is very natural where he goes matters little people will feel that is their prayer of the karma is pulling them and he appears to be surrounded by such people no sometimes they will be say some that's why some sadhus are requested that use hadoos you should not in india and then youth convention one boy was asking you swamis you are talking about loving human being but you go by plane you travel by plane but india america plane is nothing but india plane is very that means you're a rich person why not give that money to the poor people and you are flying on plane so you see that the sadhu is flying in a plane going in a first class rail accommodation a air conditioner and in india these are all very rich people's affair you are a monk and you are traveling what type of monk that swami he was the president he became the president afterwards he said yes i go i always try to travel by plane and travel by first-class train and a possible first-class car air-conditioned car because i have to do so much work i am going to delhi this moment to mean to finance minister to talk today to get one a million rupees or something for the poor people to work on that on that in the tribal area or somewhere some so i am too i'm an old guy my body will not permit if i go by ordinary training next moment i cannot have to keep the appointment and after that appointment i will go too many people so i behave that way but left to me i am a monk but anyhow why that one swami is going by this way there are other sadhus also so everyone's karma follows them good karma and the result of good karma or their their past samaskar either it is nothing higher or lower but if the impulses of the past moves people to their own journey it is they which you see apparently their outside behavior so the ghani's behave sometimes totally detached no expectation from anything left to himself absorbed in that another another again can be found with luxurious outside and enjoying good food good bad good days so nirasha be ripped off expectation they are a bhogi enjoying proceed to their renowned maturity they wander around vishai in the objects of the world no bhugo raga prashakto and they are seen as if they are attached to the enjoyment of the good food sensations experience good food good scene they want to visit a new nice place a good scenario artist enjoying the art and they so they're like like any uh worldly person is this look like that bhugura they're being attached to the objects of the experiences of the outside the result of the past life's action is the their heito what is the cause cause of their past life they were to get this hardship or this type of luxurious life because of their karma has brought the previous life's karma but when knowledge knowledge part is same for anyone but the external expression of the life after knowledge is so different the cause this scripture says causes the cause is the prarabdha because of that it creates diverse types of desires as it were karma yoga prayer but because of his proud which has brought his fun and joy and enjoyment he is engaged that way sahaja tati viva and he is found to be enjoying in more luxurious and pomp and power and this and that huh and bhuguhino birakta someone bhuga hino he finds he does not get a good meal he's so austere dry paratha dry roti and begin in the himalayas but some in the himalayas itself they also monk but they get so many things so these don't judge by any other thing but you have to understand that is their past lives good karma or bad karma which has created brings all these things associated with him in our order also you can find so many great swamis you know something location wherever he goes no he'll be there people are flocking around him no when he goes everyone feels that somebody is going no and all the honor respect and he's very humble as a monk we have seen him he is the most loving swami heart flows for the bloom when he bleeds for the suffering for humanity and does so much for anyone how many people he has helped in the life but outside you see it's a luxurious big body with a fine dress no fine cloth a monk should be using all those monks will be in tattered cloth and they say that's also another example but don't judge by that it is the it is that there each one has brings his own prayer and because of that product life goes in a trajectory and then but knowledge when it comes to both every wisdom wise the same but external association external behavior appears different but uh it is only associated with that eating and research like that or also like that may like to talk that also can be if it is karma is there but if they don't get affected because of the knowledge that will bring whatever their karma that will bring let's say people you see that there are many um great swamis and who are many so many devotees come around that swami no and as other other swamis are there there normally they don't like and and also probably by nature that's recalled by the nature and that is the it it differs so you don't gain it we are talking about for us our regulation is different their regulation is different even because that's why they that's why they're gaining ghani means that they have attained the supreme knowledge and they're established in that knowledge established in the knowledge does not go away our knowledge means we have the knowledge intellectual knowledge we someone discuss and we forget we do and we don't do but they are not like that their knowledge their protista gyan of pratishta they are established in their form knowledge and that said that when brahma gano comes once you get it you cannot forget that it will be your own eternal property those the people of nawaz of two thought their physical behavior and pattern of movement of the body etc it becomes possible there should not be any doubt about that whether because of their past life's karma whatever condition they may be whatever place they may be everyone because they have established themselves in bras brahmasmi i am that there there is no distinction between their freedom of the soul soul-wise they are perfectly free but internally they are free but externally people behave judged so don't judge any holy people that's the point when you judge from your perspective but their internal knowledge has wisdom has come so they are not bound by those limitations so this translation english translation of this verse 30 will be having abandoned the objects of enjoyments and free from expectations some men of wisdom are found to be indifferent and not only indifferent withdrawn from the sense objects on the other way some are well renowned as pleasure seekers oh there they are like good food they like good luxurious bad like always good luxurious life some sadhus maybe or some and not sadhu they are not talking about sadhu realized soul whereas whether you are a householder or monk is not defined whose wisdom is generated being deeply attached to sense objects enjoyments they move around sense objects they are found as if they are attached to that and they are moving around that association their actions of past lives are the root cause of that which creates various tendencies due to the actions performed previously the one who is destined to have enjoyments due to the results of the past actions makes an effort to nurture and live in luxury being internally dispassionate and be left of enjoyment internally they are free but their externally their behavior becomes like that so that means it is very difficult to judge a knower of truth from their external behavior okay now the verse number 31 proud [Music] [Music] because of the past impression which is there they instigate in our mind say look we are instigated inspired to do one thing or the other thing who is inspiring who is working behind your mind it is because your own past action is the source and it's pushing your mind to move in that direction so prabhupada because of the prague or bashana the desire actions are inclinations which inclination a person's inclination will be going this way inclination will be going on that way every child born [Music] out of the same family may be same mom same parents everyone is different each one's proud of though is creating an inclination and desire in the mind and they move in that way their whole life pattern moves in that direction inclination towards action and liberty abstention from the action that means those who go to be more in the worldly path and those who go to stop that path and internally move inside praviti on everything with drawing the tendency from outside to inside but this this past actions impact control of power tests in all respect entirely we find that so in case of a human being there arises longing that is called bhasana which each propensity pravity from the inclination of the past life section that is proud that means last life's prayer of though whatever you desired whatever is the cause of this present life you know it is called the resultant effect of our all karmas like a football play the ball is pushed kicked in one direction another direction another direction ultimately when it goes out it goes not in diverse directions but it goes as a resultant of all the pushes and pulls and heads and kicks no and it goes in one direction so this life is the resultant of all the activities of the other lives and that generates in us what two things vasana in general is bhasana masala means the longing and icha is which you wish to do that and you longing is a deeper sense which is a superficial thing you wish this but you can change it longing is a deeper wish so all the longing and your wish and the propensity your tendency all are generated by past life that's why most of the time we call oh my fate oh this stars and planets are doing huh why stars and planets are doing because your karma your thing is going to such a phase all these are coming in that time i give the example in a trap you are in the freeway suddenly one person was in the middle of the what you call the trouble the car is hit by another car and this and that and big collision now why it happened just your car one split second half a second just to cross that and the other car [Music] may be behind but no he crossed and what you call chasing other cars and this and that covering this and enter into that time and that is the time it the accident happened changing lens right and left and going this way that way and ultimately he fell into that particular time so what to who to blame here why not it would happen another two minutes afterwards why not in one uh one minute later or earlier no that then then that car would have been free i give the example that even people are going uh if people are going to the plane someone is frantically trying to get a plane ticket to go to india or bangladesh or same some country you know and it then it is so much pool the plane is full and he will have to go he will have to go and ultimately one person said no he dropped and another person thought oh gods grace i got it entered into the plane purchased the ticket with high price and entered and that plan crashed who is determining this one person who was not to go his ticket was not there plane was full he has no chance to go into the plane and die but he was pulled into that and the other person suddenly dropped one seat how this thing who is the guide here we called accident we call accident but this vedanta gives a explanation of that that was the karma which each desire and longing creates a propensity pravitti from the inclination of the past life's action so very important factor if we understand that then we will be very careful what we are doing now very important karma theory it does not allow us to it's a more if [Music] most rational most rational thought makes sense so what are you doing now is very important out of this experience what we are getting that how you are spending your whole day what you are doing what you are thinking you are creating your again another life or not and what life will be that that responsibility is upon us that's why i said good thought good thinking good association holy association and that gives one type of mental a purification and mental inclination and mental what three things yesterday mental inclination uh [Music] inclination wish and longing longing no the propensity of the heart is all we can create recreate here that's why swami vivekananda so much on karma karma can mold our character we can change our character to prabhupada you cannot change the result of prada everyone will have to suffer but by god's guess what happens if you take god's name the intensity will be less where there is a plow to enter in your body that means severe pain it will make a pinprick how is that that's also the science because when you are taking the name of the lord your mind is absorbed in god certain amount the body what pain is going on through the body if the part of the mind is in god that much less pain remember the mathematics say 100 unit of my mind if i have no idea of god or anything pain is pain and my whole mind is in the pain i am suffering hundred percent now if someone is so fortunate have prayed to god and their mind is set in disorder and they can think so that fifty percent of the mind goes into god pain will be first in less year similarly if it goes more it will be less so that is the beauty of god realization that is the beauty of receiving grace of god or thinking of god so this is a prarabdha is very vitally important and we are creating product for the next life but this life is the result of the past lives product so prabhupada whether he is engaged in the prabhupti prophet means and engaged in the worldly actions or in the abstention of the actions no i don't want i will be i'll not engage in worldly pursuit i will be in the spiritual pursuit whether you take this path or pravitya nibriti [Music] from all corners the prophet to the mastery who is master controller we are proud this life how much we try that's why it's so difficult no our tendencies to change our tendency that's why we by god's grace we say oh by the blessings of this guru i got it this holy person changed my life no so it is really really to have special fortune for that but otherwise prabhupi and inclination will prarabdha will force us to that direction of yes is luck is something people call luck and karma luck means why luck comes to you and not to me because you have some certain karma who's who is giving the result that time i mean i'm talking about two guys doing the same work one guy is trying more and more but he cannot get the success and another guy is doing the little bit effort but he is getting the success a lot that's the point that says that karma their past life's karma yeah that does not make us totally lost rather we should have to swamiji's idea to courageously move forward and find how can i stand there how can i make my ideal our goal just [Music] his question is that in the work field maybe two people are working why one with less effort and not success can please the boss and get something but less work but getting good name and you are working hard and your assessment is bad you don't get any raise you don't get any support it happens why that is the point we do not know but it is we can say that people can cheat easily but outside cheating on inside cheating is different one is cheating inside another cheating outside so these are karma we cannot explain any other thing only we can say our karma in hinduism we think that is my karma that's why doctors take this when the suffering comes or some problem comes they think what can i do it's my karma they say simply it is my karma it's my fate but swamiji said don't be fatalist that is no use this this as a theory you know and utilize the theory in your practical life if that is my karma i did something i can alter also that karma if i have done some wrong i worked in the wrong direction now i can do it in another direction it is in my control so that is the power of karma theory karma theory and people take its fatalist or negatively lost as it were but real karma theory is for encouragement if this has happened because of my my fault or not giving proper attention or not working hard so i will do such karma that it will be nullified karma will nullify the karma huh so positive energy should be brought to theory vedanta that is the vedantic meaning otherwise most of the people take it as my prayer too i have no other way i'll have to go through this trouble again and again yes maybe but vedantic student will not be falling into such state of depression that they will think yes i have done that i can do this so in case of human being there arises longing mashona wish icha and propensity pravitti from the inclination of the past life's actions in case of human beings there arises tendency or propensity from this inclination of the last life's action whether he is engaged in prabhupti or prabhupti means the worldly pursuit or he's in in is disengaged that is from nibrity withdrawing no i don't that means one path of becoming a renunciate another path of being in action either of the path all these affairs are in its proud of this control so why one becomes a monk why one becomes do tried whole life and cannot do that well these are your own prayers because the past lives action what can you do now you can now do something for future but you cannot do undo that what is already started the bullet is running starting point is already out of your grip and bullet is on the air and it will go in its own trajectory you cannot say i will be following that path or i will be following this path no but you can realize god that is the beauty now 30 2 [Music] gametes [Music] this karma which has started already in our life which it started in the starting and we are somewhere in 20 years of my life someone 40 years 250 years oh whatever so we are in this proud of the started that karma so means enjoyment and ganum means knowledge where does enjoyment or suffering happen in the body and also in the mind by some actions some one action or multiple actions that has started to fractify action was done then result is coming now people get ulcer how this stomach also starts you ate something days after days and did something knowing and unknowingly and the itching starts after long time no when it starts you say oh ho ho what is happening it has started much earlier similarly joking when the in someone's life we find some luxurious pleasant life and myself ganum someone is in the path of knowledge is getting knowledge booth it happens in the body cannot arab the karma by some actions that have started to give you the result practified arab the karma arab dominance which has been big beginning which has begun to give fruit that karma which has started to give the fruit result action of the past life that is the prayer of the it gives enjoyment or enjoyment means experience suffering or pain it gives both leukemia in this plane when you are in embodied here this your past life's karma brings you enjoyment or suffering experience of both and and what happens giving that suffering or pain who the experience of joy and suffering they binashati prayer of the gets destroyed but understand the point you triggered a bullet one time prior of data starting point intention is our flying bird oh no no i want to learn the target here whatever you decided your decision make the target and you triggered it but this triggering force the momentum will go how far when it hits the target it drops there you're proud of that priority is gone but many prior twos are here bundled up from the songs are old that may come up in next life again and also this life what you did those will be on the surface top of the surface they will bring the next life so both enjoyment and knowledge they are experienced in the body in this body and also body means the mind subtle body gross body and subtle body by some actions that has started to give results give fruits in this plane of existence here now the result of the actions from past lives is the giver of experience of pleasure or pain and after giving this result or on conferring the experience of joy and suffering the prarabdha perishes prarabdha is exhausted because his purpose is done it was the impact of all the thoughts because that's why i say that's why it is said at the point of death what you think you will become next life like that why because of this all the combination of good and bad thoughts or karma's effect impact last when the life is going out then you think oh i shall be a rich man next time i shall be very highly educated person or i shall be a king or i shall be whatever soft one desire and that immediately gives the boosting of the birth next by and then that starts action already started when you plan that way that is the starting point you know building comes much later but you plan here will be one building of this size this size this it is going on your mind very subtle level it will help you because that will be the association your desire will lead you your trajectory your trajectory you're asking for you want to go to i you say i want to go to new york so you try your train bus plane it will move towards new york you will catch those things that will be your desire you will not go you have to go to new york then you will not catch alaska they won't take that so that's why the last desire to be that's a noble desire if one does they are born and in their life they meet people trajectory moves them takes them and in that trajectory as i give the example traveling in a train how many people come and sit by your side chit chat some friendly someone friendly and have some discussion and afterwards each one comes their destination they go away no in our life that's why you look at that in your life how many people come how many people go away it is who is collecting them who is separating them so the concept of only thinking will not do because you do not experience it i am thinking now how many times i am atman how many times i say does it make you a brahmagani this is only your saying but it is only intellectually or just a verbal statement verbal statement should be deepened into an understanding and understanding should be so deep what is brahman what is the i what is the pure eye what is belief of the panchakushas i am that i am not body mind etcetera etcetera and then go back to the consciousness and that the whole universe of name and form behind this that consciousness this consciousness this consciousness are the same ah must be so it is not intellectual knowledge but it is it starts with intellect and confusion will come doubt will come and one doing continuously doing doing doing day and night thinking like that one time fortunate moment will come when you will be able to experience the truth and that is experience that is the point i am brahman will only talking will not do because there is a new intellectual world of course next birth when will he he'll be born in a very high intellectual understanding up to that far that's why it's called where you live there you start again my example goes suppose you are going to disneyland or you are going to san diego hey papa when you are going to say in san diego so you know on the roi you go spectrum arvind spectrum is beautiful and you so you you are driving and you see oh wow wow okay then you find let me see you you for you're you're digressing your wish your desire in fact and you get the exit and you spend the whole night they stay in a hotel and enjoy whatever to see eat and this and that then you're morning oh i'll have to go to san diego then what will you do you come out of your the same exit you take the same exit and continue so spiritual life is like that if one moves up to certain point they don't go back but they start from there itself okay so this means this is the 32nd verse both enjoyment and knowledge are experienced in the body by some actions that have started to practify or give results in this plane of existence the result of the actions from the past life is the giver of the experience of pleasure and pain on conferring the experience of joy and suffering this prarab to them ultimately perishes qibla okay so that's a okay how many questions are yours so we we end here now then only we read two verses 30 and 31. thirty-two [Music] now i am going to the question answer few question answers so let me see it seems that the one capital is playing a game of hide and seek and apparent that is the karma is a part of the game but the game of karma is in substantive in the light of the knowledge of the self is it not yes we are talking all these things to a person who is not a man of knowledge yet but who is seeking for knowledge that means he is or she is under the spell of ignorance but this study is for them those who have experienced that truth what study is necessary so here the one the one true there is only one absolute oneness like the ocean infinite ocean and that ocean of joy is as if with the ripples and waves are playing games how many ripples come and waves come and they're playing hide and seek as it were with karma they say karma is all bringing together dispersing together as true but it is all play of god in that highest sense karma when you bring karma it is you are talking in a level down all level i see i did this karma i found this suffering how this is joy i don't want to do this i want to be peaceful this is in our level but in the spiritual sense it is the play of one absolute one book it says that in no infinite ocean of consciousness all the ripples infinite number of ripples and bubbles and others they are all fun and playing but it is only water it is only ocean there is only one display there is no two from that perspective it is a big gyano coming from ghana to entering into that and coming down then you see the whole world changes another question will you kindly tell us a little more about swami oma any one anecdote that are not in the public domain that will give us a glimpse of his towering personality yes those who have seen him is a towering personality but he was very humble if you talk to him and you see that he was a person full of love and affection so when he came here he came once here he spoke here in this hall so one girl [Music] was not here is he a very young girl maybe 10 12 or something and swami location is such a personality talking to top intellectual in the same manner and when swamiji was leaving going back to india we all went to see him off in the airport and that small girl came her father was a devotee of here and within few minutes some location when they became a friend to that girl friendly he sat side by side and talking like a friend and they took their address phone number and then as swami location went back to india she kept communicating with some location on such a person of international reputation he could find time for that girl to give her some support or some strength and remain friendly for a long time and swamiji passed away of course afterwards but the point is that a great personality is like that whether you are a rich person with a very powerful person in the society top intellectual and they may they talk with the same humility with them at the same time a school girl and within split second became friendly and they could feel that love and tie and the girl probably once went to india also to see the swami so siri that is the towering personality that means it comes out of knowledge when you become a person of wisdom or knowledge or you love god so much that your wisdom develops then you see something not human and their attraction become tremendous attraction people flock around them but some people cannot take that much because their spirituality is less but those spirituality is high they can do that and keep themselves totally detached that is the knowledge oh now nishant is asking another question to get brahma ghana a person must have practiced a lot of austerities so would not their tendencies be naturally spiritual anyway why should they have worldly icha if they have been have done much sadhana that is true what you say is correct that's why we in hinduism we emphasize for regular spiritual practice why regular everyday spiritual practice knowledge can come any moment that's why those who get somewhere some little experience of light and things their character does not change and they do all types of nonsense things in one side they say they have vision they have experience even they become brutal that's why swamiji said about someone you stumbled into realization that means suddenly you get illumination because your good karma may be there but because it is not practiced very seriously the old tendencies cannot overcome so when the trajectory is fixed that means your life is destined to move in that direction that cap becomes natural but inner personality will change if the practice spiritual just in ramakrishna tradition very much emphasis is given for your regular spiritual practice and developing your character so and even in the cases of spontaneous awakening without sadhana they must have cultivated spiritual tendencies in previous lives and so must they have spiritual inclination carried over no that spiritual inclination is their good karma good karma has produced some result in certain point of time but if it is not practiced very well it does not become a part of our life very important point is that we should have to spirituality should be a part of our life and that it is not that um you know many people don't you see they don't they never went to any church any temple any places this i saw in my dream i saw a light and that light was so strong i feel it is even now no they see us many people have vision in hindu my families you will find ah and someone is seeing mother saraswati mother durga kali mother came and mother told this and that and that they are seeing certainly it indicates there is some super savaskara but it is the overwhelming saskara then he will continuously live in that consciousness but it is only spar of the moment in somewhere by god's case something comes at once once one time and then it's covered again by the cloud so that's why their life goes on in the past pattern but it does not matter for a brahmagani brahmagani is free only so long his body goes he is seen from outside that is behaving like a worldly person like an ordinary person but internally they are all transformed oh one one question can you please explain what is bhagavat anubhati anu bhabha only bhavam is experience god bhagavat means bhagavan god god experience god experience means what now you think what is god if you think god and depending on that your god experience will come what is the god god may be god the absolute god someone may think rama is my god someone will be thinking makkali is my god someone will think jesus is my god so god realizes me you see jesus that's how you got realization but actually realization means where you lose yourself totally into that consciousness so ultimately vedantic way of god realization means you become a brahmagani you merge into the infinite absolute truth which is unchanging truth that's called brahman but i think explaining no one can explain what is god but god realization means that you lose your eye into that that's the major point intellectually you are asking question intellectually we are giving the response the other is there is no other way to explain that and even those who have experience they cannot say upanishad says obama managed to go beyond speech beyond mind beyond description beyond time so how will you describe them individual that's why when the i will go totally his purified eye this ramakrishna's idea this unripened life which we are having now this i i with the body i with my emotions i with my knowledge i am a rich i am a poor this this i will be transcending and it will be ripe and eye and absolute eye and there there this i will you're gonna find this i anymore when that eye merges into the ocean of consciousness you will not find the personified experience of that which is bound in maya that person will no more be they are available takur's example salted all and trying to measure the infinite ocean and they enter into the ocean will you find the salt doll anymore the doll salt is all merged into the ocean and it become what no trace of any is like a camper when you burn the camper we do the arathi not here but special day the camper you burn the camper burns and it ultimately see when it is totally burnt camper is gone no more no trace of anything so similarly the ego will go away that way another question what is it that carries karma from life to life it can be the body or mind that end with each life or brahman to which karma does not attach no no no karma what is that carries karma from life to life that is the question what is that which carries karma from life to life what is that karma carries karma is where karma's the impact is where in the mind solar the mind is there this physical body is gone but your mind does not die like when nighttime you go to dream this body is dead for me i have no concept about this body but i live in another body that's a dream body and that is the mind body so that carries the karma that carries all the impression gross thing goes to the subtle and settles there then the mindset so karma sangaskaras our impressions are all carried in our mind that's why raja jogo deals with chitta britti nirodha and other issues talking about purification of the mind i see desire arise in me regularly i have not been able to stop that instead i work on detachment with the outcome of desire how to reduce desire in me ramakrishna gave the example i see desire arise in me regularly everyone not you alone we are all driven by our desire desire arise but what desire and desire for name desire for money desire for achievement plays in in position and life sustenance desire is life is desire without that there is no life but we can ramakrishna said you can desire give that desire a turn what is that term give the desire a turn and that turn is god turn towards god i desire this worldly thing this thing that thing but now i desire to love god to see god to feel who is behind this universe so this desire one desire can be replaced by another desire that is the point you cannot go beyond desire without counteracting the other desire one desire takes us this way another desire takes the opposite way one so desire is the motive for bondage and desire also takes us to god that desire we don't say desire we call love for god only language changes but it is desire desiring god one gives up home and heart and home and desiring world one gives up god and everything no the most of the world gives up god infinite joy infinite peace giving up for what for having a love relationship or having a sweet something eating or for some mundane something huh we can give up god that's giving up is there that means attachment is there desire is there and desire can be turned that way so many questions another takur advised to live like a kitten which remains happy as its mother keeps it if we accept happily what we cannot control will it benefit us spiritually of course who said is the best thing it says that live like a kitten that is the devotee's attitude that's the devotee's attitude devotee thinks that i am nothing god is my whole god is my soul god is my everything so i depend on god holding on to god and cry oh lord please take care please take care please see one more question oh another is there so so be like a kitten is like surrendering to god that's a devotional approach surrendering to god everything is happening in the universe by god's will so so i surrender to god oh lord please take care that is that is also will a path gany path book to path that's okay that will benefits of course benefit spiritually and there is another question here this is how to destroy vasana permanently can a degraded mind can be become divine of course mind is we are not the mind so degraded mind means cluttered mind and pure mind so yes yes we can that's why whole spiritual life is for that so don't think that is it is my mind is only deranged and that that mind can be corrected and by god's grace that's right permanently how to destroy the vasana it is only by god realization permanently this bastard will go away but till then we will have to have personal desire so what to do ramakrishna as i said ramakrishna said desire for god turn your all desires that's why give me love give me devotion that's also desire pray o lord i am your honor the child you gave everything to everyone i am could you not give me a little devotion little more so that i forget the world and forget the worldly desire forget the worldly things so that type of prayer that type of surrender was a just now to like a kitten any attitude will do also vedantic attitude also good i am not the mind why i am caring about my mind if i am not the mind then why am i caring about mind thought bad thought or good thought what does it mean so whatever attitude of the mind we can utilize them for this path so not to be discerned yes our mind is cluttered that's true that's why we are here our mind is full of bad old impressions it is saturated with those so but i want i can overcome by god's grace by prayer my meditation my vedantic analysis by selfless karma so these are the four path rama krishna vivekananda tradition gives us so i hope by god's grace this are all possible and god can help us always om shanti shanti shanti peace peace peace yes tomorrow will be gospel class at 7 30. thank you you
