[61. Shanti Gita - Class 61 - chapter 6 - verse 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJBEgV4iMTA)

[Music] [Music] lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all so we are in the santi gita the song of peace sixth chapter and see bhagavan krishna was giving the wisdom highest wisdom to arjuna who has believed because of the death of his son and was grieved so much so here sri bhagavan started with saying in the sixth chapter that today i will tell you the essential truth listen extremely it is extremely secret and supremely auspicious and listening to that what will happen by listening to which one will be able to free himself from all bondage and suffering what is that truth second verse we read we'll start today on the verse number six sixth chapter six verse but i am just touching what we have done just in quick passing so it says so there is nothing only one reality there is nothing other than what chaitanya may come that consciousness that existence sought and chetan existence and consciousness there is nothing nahi kincana no maya even there is no maya there is no god there is no individual soul there is no time there is no space there is not nothing in the world movable and immovable giving the highest knowledge and not only that not that this universe or this maya is not there the jiva is not there not the space time position but it is not that you are there you are not there i am not there. so there is neither you neither me neither this earth neither these plains of existences there is no trace of any truth in the apparent universe but you see around national nasty nasty nasty nation know it for certain there is nothing there is nothing there is nothing a buddhistic philosophy no there's nothing there is nothing but there is nothing neither you neither god neither demon neither maya neither anything nothing is there nothing is there becomes your substance then so when you use in the language then it is always difficulty whatever you say you want to say something interpretation may come differently so not thou not me not even the world not these planes which are the abode of the created beings nothing not even a trace is there no for that for sure that nothing nothing exist at all then nothing nothing then what here is the only addition of difference from buddhism and hinduism he says ok the next verse he says your cable brahma matram there is only one absolute truth that is the brahmana brahma matram sat that is the reality no not there is nothing other than this ostity bhava now reflect on this think day and night on this and then then you may say i am seeing these things passing you are seeing but what you are seeing servant we are seeing like a dream you see the dream does that mean the dream exists in your mind it exists it has no reality so this is a no reality it is in your mind only sapnavat they are giving the big philosophy it is the vivar tong you are seeing the bivarta bivarta means what you have imposed on that unchangeable absolute truth you have imposed the snake on the rope so how much you have imposed how much you have cried there was no snake ever at the time of your fear after the fear went away or before your fear came it was rope rope rope then snake is all so here is the addition of vedanta that is saying there is nothing but they don't end in nothing but they say something but so see you see it is not that you it is your it is not there you are not seeing anything but you see but that seeing is like vivarto you are seeing the vivarto the superimposed reality you are seeing and you are not seeing the substratum upon which this superimposition has been committed and that be what is chetan the substratum is the consciousness subterranean is the blissfulness nature of the thing and then fifth first we also did b [Music] kinchana again the same they benant what is there the same what they talk again and again but it does not enter into the brain that's why they are so kind to say the same thing again and again that's otherwise what is in the vedanta scripture we read years and years old life that is the essence of all vedantic understanding so here also vishwayam the sense objects the vishway which is perceptible to the senses they should learning and the space time as you see etc and here bhakthi gatri i am enjoying i am experiencing suffering i am experiencing joy gatti i know this i don't know this kriya i do this action and this action leads to me this all these activities etc are mithya whatever you are doing is mitta very difficult to say that's why gita says that they would be this uh in the 12th chapter bhagavan says that thinking about in this vedantic thought non-dual thought is very difficult for people who have body identity because the body identity whatever we say it around and down comes to our body and my sense of sense world and my perceptual world and the suffering we get through joy we get to anxieties we get to see really if we think day night why do you get angry are you getting greedy who's anxiety what to lose is sup no if you say stop doing then that's a big problem solution of the problem also problem so only mere saying will not do tonight that means there is no prick there is no trouble and you only say i am brahmana will do that is the testing point someone will poke and you say oh it is not there so that is this test that one have achieved that point so myth tight is false that's swap number bharanam everything is appearing varnam sub number like that of a dream no kinchit certainly there is nothing the slightest stress of anything any reality in it again now we start with verse number six what the sixth verse says it says [Music] that is the reality that is all the time saturn prakasham it is always shining that truth that is the shining reality all the time um and that is stainless there is no darkness there is no ignorance in it at the end that is the bearer of the flow of worldly existence the worldly existence seems to be perpetually flowing on because brahman is there unchangeable so you start here there is brahman you start there there is brahman and the flow going on this flow of sangsara is on that existence at all alone and which is shining through no not kimchi there is no other rather than what taranga pina salilam taranga is the wave pheno is the poem you know sully long again so the water that's as these are all name but it is the water similarly that shot this world you see it is only thought the existence reality that misit is the reality of brahman the prashaman this shang and this what we see the disrevisible universe sense experience what we experience through the senses it is the dasham the visible softness among and what we see these are like sapno like dream no there is not at all and what is a spread it is beta-tom that satya this truth has permeated but man permeated everything maya mayam and it is made of this drishya the visible universe is made of maya today we are reading in the other book no they are saying that it is coming from in a different way how the creation came so bhagavat was telling that this is it is the end from that came his will you wish and that is the ego and it split into three kriya shukti gyan shakti and karma sakti so that is the division it came down like that pancho bhuta and sense organs and all the material that means it is only that is the reality which appearing by the inscrutable power of ishara that they described there here the inscrutable power of maya this dasham you are seeing this visible universe but it is like dream no there is nothing the reality it is widespread and is made of maya maya this shatter is sin but it is caitanya only caitanya and vishwayo bibhati the sense objects are shining or manifesting in diverse ways brahmadikam even starting from brahma brahma vishnu maheshwara starting from that down to the created universe all by mahaya maya maya so what is the new thing they are talking about same thing every verse is the same so he says that brahman running translation will be like this that brahman is eternal shining stainless reality and the bearer of the flow of worldly existence that brahman is the substantive that is the substratum of this flow of the worldly existence time passing things are changing some are born some are dead all the changes in the cosmic reality we see in our visible universe happening happening on the substratum of that stainless shining eternal brahman that is the reality and that is the ground on which these changes are possible i think the ocean ocean is the ocean water is the substratum upon which all the rolling of the waves and ripples and forms and so much activity goes on on the surface substratum is the ocean so brahman is the ocean and also the ripples and bubbles what you are talking it is nothing but brahman nothing but the ocean water so in this is the great closest example which makes us little realize this truth as is the in this uh bearer of the flow of the worldly existence and nothing other than this is a good meditation also if we can think quietly sometime that what i am seeing my sunset experience this experience is coming to my mind mind and other what you call media senses and our mind and our intellect and our ego that's why it is getting it is a giving a misrepresentation of the truth which is unchanging truth but this changes are possible because there is unchanging substratum thinking of the ocean like that and all the ripples and waves they are all playing their role and this flow is going on and this flow is a change but this change upon the changeless and the objects of change what we see they are also nothing but the same content of the consciousness constant content as is the presence of waves and foam in the waters so is the presence of the dreamlike visible universe dream like visible universe in brahman meaning the water is real and not the waves and the form it is not there but this universe of maya appears to be widespread consciousness due to the cosmic ignorance maya appears to be matter in various forms like brahma and others so even in the creation the highest creation the concept of brahma the creator from there to the blade of grass that's why it is called brahma the stumbopur jantam light from a little grass blade of glass to brahma who created this whole universe so all is all permeated with the same consciousness used to see this all the time no in his mystic vision he used to see nothing but he could not he went to plug the bell leaf and it's just the little bit of the skin was pulled out and he could not do that plucking of the belly further because he saw the same consciousness holy mother in kothar she was in the noon time she was just resting or not sitting unmindfully looking and then radhi found one and running like and she wanted to kill it and mother stopped ah don't do that don't do that and what she said i saw exactly it is takur's feet his feet his eyes so this is the point even in the moving things which is in the level of our real perceptual universe this is division what we are reading this is a theory here is a practical demonstration that's why it is said that swamiji also said that you have to read these scriptures in the light of sri ramakrishna's life you know then you can understand a little bit of it otherwise it is too far away over our head it's a theory only and then in most of the time [Music] people talk philosophically but it is it can be it can be experienced it can be experienced some ego is experiencing the suffering of people at a distance no that means it is all one that concept of oneness variety variety is there but there that variety is not real actually in a sense it is the one that's why oneness means if we feel like that no if you if your pain leg hurts you feel the pain if your pain comes in your arm you feel the pain it is you all through the body from head to toe so similarly this universe is brahmana and the one tunes with that brahman naturally so they will feel that presence everywhere and that's why if they suffer also and they enjoy also as they suffer with the suffering of others they enjoy the joy of others everywhere any joys he feels his joy so this is sixth verse that means is this a teaching us that whatever you see manifesting that is the eternal truth and also that flow in the world which is changing that is also the same reality seventh verse bisham drisham akhilam bisham dhrisham [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] these are big verses so it says visham means this universe drisham the visible universe what we see our eyes open vishwam drisham or shattam you we see but it is not real that is the again and again the same point coming i am seeing but it is unreal what does it mean seeing but onion means it is always changing its form it's changing its nature with the split second we don't understand the change but we can understand this change after one year you see a plant after every day you don't see the change but you someone comes after one year oh the plant has become so big oh the baby has become so big oh you have become old so everything changing every split second but because we are not able to recognize that change we think it is true and whatever in in our day-to-day life this is our mistake but we are a victim of this ignorance whatever i want to grab i do not know when i am trying to grab it is already gone it is not the same what you are grabbing by that time with the split second it has gone to take another form another another [Applause] shape size another change of transformation shadow car it is growth decay destruction death in this journey it is all moving so the sham or satan in that sense this dress is also but it is called probably it in the flow in the sense of flow it appears real but they are not real because it is changing every split second but when it see we stand on the bank of ganga you say we are saying the ganga water but is the same water that ganga water has gone when you saw one even in a split second you saw something by that time it is gone it has gone where it has gone to the ocean side or it has gone the upstream into another direction so it is changed but i see the same ganga flowing say i in berlin what we go we show this same ganga it's not the same ganga that water is no more there that silting is not the same thing every day some more silting coming some place they're dressing so all the changes are happening but to me it appears to be the same so that's why it is unreal this entire universe whatever you are seeing it is this unfeasible universe this is maya bilal so ask for them it is the object of the play of maya it is it is just it is a maya maya means yama samaya yes simple formula what is maya that which is not there ya ma not there what appears to be there that's called maya yama samaya so it is a bilasa it is a play it is a fine drama played by the maya maya is dancing in this way and we are seeing this whatever we see is are not true that's we think that we give testimony i have seen myself but whatever we see we are seeing something wrong because what we see there are so many factors are there my seeing is imperfect my eye glass maybe my power of the eyes are maybe defective my attention has gone somewhere i see something but i mis understand that in another way so this this is the all the play of maya and atmo [Music] it is it is the nidano the very cause or substatum of the organo ignorance of the atman this this play is going on it is unreal but is the play of the maya and it is organum the support of all our ignorance and we all ignorantly looking at that whatever we see our perception is incorrect even scientifically incorrect i see the sun rising and sun setting but the thing is happening opposite way i give the example i am sitting in the chair a 90 degree particle no but you just imagine them globe as such and see the position of los angeles wire and now imagine in which position you are sitting like this all the time we are walking like that we see i'm walking straight so really what maya we do do we want to understand we never think that way we we are thinking we are straight but we are doing like that we are seeing that there is no stars during daytime sun is so bright there is no start but there is we think the stars are little twinkling twinkling little star but sun is much bigger our earth is much bigger all conception even realistically every day we are living in this mistake in this misunderstanding and we say we are scientific that is the scientific how much scientific we do not know so everywhere we find this dichotomy going on and then what we see what we feel is something truth is something other than that it is the nidhana the primary cause of the bharnam of appearance of unreturn and it's it's it's a false it is mitta on newton that is not sad but it appears like a real it appears like real and it repairs not only that it appears real when it appears real it becomes mahal i am it creates a delusion it is true i will get it i will have it it will make me happy we try to grab it and that's why it is a source of delusion where moho generates delusion is generated bharathyam to be obliterated to be destroyed nauseam or chintu inconceivable so it is to be badam nation thus this ignorance is to be this delusion is to be obliterated it is to be destroyed and all chintam chitra or chintam means inconceivable chitra rochitam i cannot imagine how beautiful is this world achievem beyond my chinta and it is it has been rochitam created this munich universe has been created and like it looks so beautiful so charming so alluring but it is it is like a dream you can create a dream universe beautiful universe no like you say in the sky and the kalki you can say beautiful word in the akaso kusuma there is a flower garden in the sky as if somewhere it is hanging flower garden flower garden cannot hang in the sky now the laser uh so and you go to disney world every day they so didn't know that is it real that there's so much thing going on in the display there may be some you go to the light and sound in deadly ram lila no they're doing so really lighten sound but is it is it really true no i see it i get a inspiration or it may be fight going on in the but their appearance but have no reality modern science has given us much more clues to understand the unreality but still it is mayanu maya you cannot describe what is this really you know we see the body you know doctors see the body must closely and they do or dissect it operate it cut it and blood is coming out past is coming out this is that but still we love the body if we in reality if we look at that way he will not be very interested into the body but it is the fact that that is called the maya what a tremendous force of maya acts on our mind delusion that it looks so good and so nice and people want to decorate it and keep it forever even after death they want to keep it as mommy and if not even they put it under the so many ways to keep it as if it will be permanent it will stay so it is to be bothered to be obliterated it's to be destroyed it's our chin it is inconceivable it has been rochito it's created by chitra mani bichitra bharadways but it is saknopam it's like that of a dream thought therefore don't keep your trust astha astha means trust don't keep your trust on this changing universe this apparently looking nice no appearance of the reality don't get stuck there hastang is throw away destroy give away [Music] when you in your world of suffering like the ropes a simile of a snake so don't look at the snake but look at the rope this world is not it is not nothing but it is not the way i am seeing that is not the truth but truth there is as sachidan and the rope is the reality not the snake the world of appearance so charming so beautiful so diverse but it is not reality it is an appearance and it gives attachment to us therefore we are to get out of this attachment we have to get out of this delusion it is to be removed from our mind because it is the source of all attraction into the unreal objects of the world so this entire visible universe is unreal and is an about of amusement of maya for maya it is a fun maya the magician magician for magician it is a trick but for us we see we are caught into the trick and we get one a wonder stuck no suppose one jew pc sarkar i saw the magic of pc circle big magician his son is now junior pc he is now also showing those big tricks [Music] oh she was there so he his father so he was too i was in the star theater that time he was in the star theater showing that appearing the first so uh he was we are all sitting and hall full and it is like a gallery and he came in the stage after about few minutes late and everyone started they're talking about that late late why it is so late and that was pc circus said pra full circle he said oh am i late my worst says i'm a correct time and everyone noted their own watch and everyone saw the correct he has come at seven o'clock seven o'clock but it wasn't actually five minutes passed or seven minutes past i do not know everyone he has the magical power or created some i don't know what is the skill every person didn't see anything but seven o'clock and then after that he said this is my first show and so oh this is all so now he said seven a minute late so we are behind that wow he's doing it is bewildering so they brought one box one there is a showing machine and a piece of wood and made it through it and really cut into two pieces and you saw before us the throw in one girl came and she saluted and she was put into the box and now the same swami said now so we are all we are very young then we're scared oh my god what will happen to her and then they cut that and make the box happen this side have that side and and then everyone is what what and then this this same girl came and saluted everyone and left there is a trick probably dropped below or whatever way but that's a trick for him but we are be fooled we pay money to be to become a fool so there's so many here standing in the audience in the diocese and suddenly he's talking about this that something and disappeared and even sorry where did he go and we saw that our rows be behind that row he's standing i'm here entire audience was looking this side and how he came so fast to this back side it is his trick that's when god's trick is called maya but we are under the maya he is the boss of maya but we are the under the mind and under the maya what he shows a magician source thing and we all have our money forced to see that god is showing this maya play so what to do we'll have to see it but we have to see it as it is the play of the divine play of the brahman player batman playing so this dream like universe created by inconceivable images so many images inconceivable diverse types is unreal and is to be obliterated and destroyed as in the example of a snake on a rope conquer the false trust you created in your mind about the world all this conception is in our mind no so advice is that therefore you conquer all this trust we put so much trust in our worldly things you know in this world whatever is there we we depend on them and the courthouse says but this dependency is very unstable this is the plumber problem in a float in the river suppose you want to hold it when you are sinking you hold some something to hold it will carry you but if it if it is not strong enough it sinks how can it help you so this worldly dependence on anything is like that sinking float which has no power it drowns us therefore snake on a rope conquers this trust false trust you create it in your mind this is not to be done but you have created in your mind about the world the world of your own suffering as a stable entity we are thinking this world is stable the world is permanent it can give me joy it can bring happiness in my life it can give me satisfaction but it is a false understanding it is unstable itself so it is changing it is not there it is first of all it is not there what the question it will give us this but it is in some other form which we do not know huh rupangarupang prathurupa it is all that that one that is has taken so many rupa so many forms any question has coming no question tally we have 15 minutes time so if you send some question then you can stop here okay now juno is putting the question we can read that another verse verse number eight is is a good question you say that is nir ghunang paramang brahma that supreme brahman is beyond all qualities all changes everything and guna means qualities and descriptions and it doesn't need to be kaar it has no change in it being is kriyam it is bigotronis there is an action in that brahman tell a geography how this world is created then from that tasman bhavati how that which is beyond all gunas and this is all under gunas so nir gunang paramang brahma the brahman is near guna it is the parama supreme and that is brahman it is nirvikanam it is changeless being screamed there is no action in it then javascripty how the jagat this world is being created so this is the question this entire scriptures are created like that is the question answer question itself here too otherwise discussion will stop like that like that in the light like that where in the yogavasta know that the vasculi and his guru what is his name so he asked sir please tell me what is brahman like that the teacher basically he was not saying anything just silent quite a few moments passed then he said sir please tell me what brahman is like and then again he was silent teacher was silent and third time when he asked then the teacher responded my child i was teaching you what brahman is like brahman cannot be said anything no beyond speech beyond expression so i was telling you to relate to that idea but you cannot catch it so nir gunang it is this supreme brahman is beyond all qualities it is changeless it's beyond all actions how then is the creation of the universe possible from that truth that absolute truth how this changeable and delusional universe has come out please tell me and here is innocence so he will say sister nasty there is no creation at all so that will read the next day you've got some question two questions [Music] so tomorrow there will be class by sami so tomorrow will be gospel reading by shiva pranam mataji prabhupada i am talking about thursday thursday will be vedic mathematics vedic mathematics and vedic christianity vedic christianity by swami brahman okay so two questions have come how does the perception of this world as being unreal and illusory relate to seeing god in all everywhere i think there is no distinction that is the two two sides of the same coin how does the perception of this world as being unreal when the perception of the world is unreal will go away this world as i see is not real it is only name and form but its content remains the same our upanishads give the example that the in all the ornaments made of gold have different designs and it's a beauty of the design and change change in the design but content right is gold so if one sees brahmagani they will see they may see the name and form also but they know it is all gold they will see every person as consciousness and bliss such but at the same time they can see the form but we get stuck into the form and don't see the reality that's why we are so different we get attached to someone we get angry with somebody because i see separate i am separate but when this world as being unreal is experienced then what will say they see the gold and when they see the gold that second question comes god in everything so long they see that means this use their mind but their mind becomes pure mind so pure mind shows the reality at the same time the name and form when they come to live our level when they're in samadhi there's no world there's nothing only that reality they will be absorbed but whenever ramakrishna is coming down look at that he's not making a mistake one day because he's coming from samadhi and and saying so naren he's mistaking as rakhal it never happened in the in a relative existence he is recognizing everything and telling everything what is right and what is wrong but he is saying you say i see god in you that's why i love you see that means that is the point they don't see the apparent name and form only we get charmed by someone's beauty ramakrishna somebody complain oh he's a rich man's she was a very rich and born in a rich family no not in and curly hair beautiful eyes what not everyone gets charmed so ramakrishna has mesmerized that he said no the day i will not see narayana in you i will not be able to look at your face so that's why they see narayana there in the language you can say he is brahman so brahman becomes more important in the eyes of his share of truth and the name and form it they see it in a transactional world they behave that way but they know it is all god nothing it is you don't say god better you say it is brahman that will be so so as soon as one as much as one sees the world undeal that much one should see the reality of god it is like as much one is moving towards the east is so much is away from the west if the world is unreal total he goes that means he has reached the destination where is only god and god is only reality these are all illusions that we are reading all the time so hope it is the it is my understanding so now another question has come is it best to constantly saying not this not this to help our minds to realize we are dreaming in this false illusionary world illusionary world yes i think so because this what we read just now this is the same suggestion constantly saying not this not this but we should have to say two things together that is better probably not this not this we are not trying to be going into void but what is that also is being reminded both are in our mind to train the mind not this but that not this but that and not this means this not this name and form if it is to be hammered harimaru said that sami turia no no no day and night say i am not the body not the mind no i am that i am that i am that and that is the idea in our sankara just teaching no the prayer manage i'm not this not this not this but sankara jains shivoham shivoham so every time to hammer not only on the negative side but also on the positive side it's a helping the mind to grab something our mind is very weak it always wants to hold on to something so if we don't give something tangible it will be running in the void and that's why non-dual meditation is so difficult that's why when people meditate on the ostravatro and others they think of the infinite ocean the waves ripples all these ideas are given in the mantras that means they are giving some reality that reality vast reality infinite reality but the temporariness of the changes not to pay attention to that side they're withdrawing from that side not this but it is the reality this way so i think you are right that is best to constantly say not this not this to help our minds to realize what realize that we are dreaming in this false illusory world it is actually vedanta sadhana is for good but we should also be careful here that it is we need to not be intellectual but to feel that experience that's why prayer meditation and simple other practices are also congenial otherwise only non-dual thought we are not capable of we are not capable of uh staying in that high altitude where nothing is there i am that many people may think it is easy but because body identity brings us down whenever i say i am not this but i think i am the body i think i am atman but i think that i have a fight with you and i cannot forget that so these are the contradictory things playing in the mind therefore we have to be careful that this is true ultimately this is the truth but we have to equip ourselves with that let us not misunderstand constant prayer from the heart helped to cry out for help in seeing seeing past the solution helpful or the way out constant prayer of course constant prayer and analysis this is the path of bicharo this is called the bichara margo the path of analysis always to analyze impermanent nature of this thing and there is a permanent thing behind so everyone is permeated with the same consciousness i give the example wi-fi connection wi-fi is available everywhere who have the big money and connection everywhere they can get wi-fi everywhere no but others may be searching with a computer and not connecting his wi-fi does not connect so so that those who have capable of connecting with the wi-fi they can work everywhere the same way they can see god everywhere that is the and as i suggest sometimes the mantra guru mantra that's the password or your understanding that i am that i am not this these are all helpful to open up the door of that connection and stay world is changing but we have in this world we have all the relationships and everything where we have to do our trauma so how how does that go together again god playing with god god in this form god in that form like we give the example sometimes that some people friendly people they want to have a drama they will have to play and enact a friendly yay that acting some something so they are all friends but they know we are friends but they take different roles and they act accordingly but when they go back in the back screen of drop when they the screen is drop skin and then go and then how i beat you and they smile and talk but maybe you have heard really you have hitted me hit me hard you should not have done no they're all friends but this is for fun they are doing so knowledge when knowledge comes then it is all joyful because we are not in that level so we don't enjoy we are playing with god but we don't know we are playing with god i give the example that you are in the hot summer you are going to take it in the swimming pool and you jump into the swimming pool and enjoy the swimming and cool what you call deep no but i am not willing and somebody pushed me into the into the pool what will happen my anger and frustration will come though my body is getting cool no so that's why we should be equally prepared mentally prepared to see that his only play of god is going on so this is very high level to go there that's why we have to do where we are dream world is mithya is very clear but why does this working world appear so real what can one do to see that world is mitta this is true dream world is mitha is very clear yeah for us true but i saw you study the same pews here and i came in the morning i found the same pews here so that's why i think it is real and i dream i what i dreamt that's gone i don't see it second time so that's mytha so we can analyze this way in consideration to our dream this is real but now this is unreal when you go to deep sleep consider your deep sleep state we don't think much that's why we think this is real this is also unreal to me when i go to deep sleep so if i can by spiritual practice withdraw my mind from here and put it in god the divine the sachidona then this world will manage that's why so many planes hindu religion talks about a musician lives in this world of his music no he is not here his body may be here he is not here he does not pay much attention scientists big scientists when they are absorbed in their research they forget about this world the world is not there so in different situations the so real world also appears unreal but it is to be practiced so that we every day if we analyze these three states of our existence jagrats of no susti waking state dream state and deep sleep state as we experience deep sleep state every day and that moment this world does not remain it is as the dream is unreal this is also unreal because it does not stay with me so we have to bring that analysis again and again and again then probably we will understand this world and as i said another explanation is that dream is my mind's creation my individual mind's creation and this world appearance as you see the stars galaxies everything it is cosmic mind has created so cosmic mind whatever he has he has created sun we all see its sun in your dream you create the entire dream whatever your mind wanted everyone is acting accordingly you do not know that you are controlling everyone that the tiger is attacking you by your own will you are asking created a tiger in your mental world and the tiger is jumping up by your own will your mind mental power is so strong so if the cosmic mind creates this because of that this sun we all call some and we see it is remaining as soon as you come to the waking state it is there so that's why it appears to be so real but in reality the mind becomes purer and purer and purer then this universe will be appearing unreal as the world as its name and form but real in the form of saccidananda so this mitta will be also world will be mitta vivek and other areas if we read they talk about this world and sankara said that this world i was seeing just now why did it disappear before my dawn of knowledge i was seeing this world as so real but at this point of having that wisdom what did it varies [Music] is that will be the experience that is where it's the most surprising thing i was seeing this world so real so real means everything is real but um what did it vanish kenobo and who stole away this world of appearance why did he disappear nasty kim i don't find anything of it then mahatma what a strange play so this is the experience will come so the real truth another question so the real true self is still one with the creator it never separated yes of course true self is always the same and even we are talking about god duality avatar in vedantic term they are all in the realm of the mind but a higher mind purer mind in pure mind pure mind that is all the play of that's why ramakrishna said not according to your vedanta he talked to with vivekananda here is exist in the realm of the maya but that is a pure maya but if you talk about absolute barrantra then there is no rama there is no krishna not the world neither the world neither is creator neither is destroyer neither is sustainer it's the whole world appearance zero okay we have had many questions okay we end here today and as i said tomorrow will be seva prana giving the class of gospel of ramakrishna um peace peace peace you
