did so that's okay that much is my i can continue with it messaging the link so they just need to click and they can get it did you click there yeah this is the link for the class anyhow so we are starting uh today we are mother sarasota's celebration day the mother saraswati is saraswati our mother saturday is called saraswati ramakrishna said that she is sharoda saraswati has come to west to knowledge and wisdom so she is our mother and today auspicious day in that sense and it is also our great fortune that we are starting to enter into a new text which is called shanti gita as you know gita is the message of krishna given to arjuna bhagavad-gita very popular similarly in the entire period of sri krishna's maharata and all these big things krishna has to advise arjuna and others in different times with their spiritual knowledge and wisdom so that we can get out of the troubles of life as gita is an eternal message which it brings for the good of whole humanity and in the whole world how much service it has given it is its impact is really unfortunate but this book which we are trying to get in shanti gita is not uh available it's not see people do not know much about it because it is not much discussed or it is not even been translated into english and it is not found in the neither in the mahabharata but it has this originality so we'll discuss about that its origin is simply when in the big war it is called the uh greatest war largest war as the mahabharata where the two brothers are fighting kazim their kazim and that's a huge war which we cannot imagine and there fighting means killing each one each one is and who will be the king just around just right no worries but anyhow this arjuna son his name was he was killed breaking all the ethical rules of war and other things and then naturally father arjuna got so much depressed and down so then sri krishna advised with this santi gita about 334 verses for only 324 verses in the entire book but we have we need to know why it is so important to study this book because this advice given to arjuna with this advice he conquered he attained peace and conquered all the frustrations and depression which he underwent because of the sun's death so let us go back to the history where it started today we will be talking about that it is the introduction so you know that mahabharata is a great text it is largest volume of incidents of the war how it happened and vyasa is the speaker here he has compiled it via has compiled so many things what is extraordinary genius in the in the indian spiritual tradition he has written this mahabharata with some somewhere it is 13 volume or something 13 13 volumes and then he has composed what is called the bhagavata the story of sri krishna's life at different time of course the namashutras and apart from dividing the whole vedas into four segments so it is extraordinary spiritual personality with infinite capacity he wrote this mahabharata and this mahabharata war you know arjuna and they were kazim but they durjan was cunningly inappropriately taking away all the wealth prosperity and the whole of india under him and arjuna was deprived of that with the five brothers and the mother and then the war started it is a such a war it happened it says give some idea it says that there was there is a army's army's number where 18 to 20 they call akshahini soldiers aksho akshay any means what that i am giving you one akshay any means how much one aksarini means is soldiers group will be 28 0870 chariots you will fight from the chariot that will be its number will be 21 8 70. now such 18 to 20 times of that is the number in both parties if we act together so chariot fighters 28 1870 elephants standing on elephant they're fighting that was also 28 870. cavalry cavalry was 65 610 one i am talking about one akshohini in that one oxford this much is the number and infantry there will be 101 109 350. that means in one oxyny you get more than 200 000 soldiers 200 000 soldiers some are on chariots some are an elephant fighting some are in the cavalry and some are infantry and the war destroyed the 18 to 20 akshay any soldiers were involved into it and it was totally devastating all mostly killed at the end of the war so this was the condition of the war going on and there that war every day who can kill whom that was the point who can can kill whom and the big warriors are like targeting every day i will kill this today's judicial tomorrow i'll kill this person and big warriors in his german military general circuit in each department so drono was one of them and he took him how one time that they will kill the giant figure of the pandavas that means either arjuna and he decided to kill judas tiram the elder brother of the five is the military general also and that day was the 13th day of the war already 12 days over this is 13th the day of the world and in that 13th day of the war he designed it is called a chakra spinning circle hence it is chakra so you enter its soldiers circular circular and they will allow you to enter into it but then you are trapped into it they want you to trap and kill but anyway no one came but in that chakra the puzzle it is called the puzzle circular puzzle if you enter into it like you know it is meant for spiritual purpose what is called what is that in in jewish tradition in other traditions it's like that it's a spiritual significance is different so they enter into it and this is such a puzzle why to come out unless you know very intelligent and remember all this is very difficult to come out so actually that the instead of judistira ovie the son of who sum up arjuna he entered into that i go to the story later now he ended and then he fought with so many soldiers in such a way big warriors were all trembling in fear but when he entered and all attacked only one person alone is 17 years old boy and entering inside i've been just encircled by all the soldiers on the opponent group and amongst them were great warriors like drono karna krippa krito karma asatama like that big names of the warriors they called maharotis they can fight with one huge amount of soldiers alone one person the such skill of their fighting they have mastered that they can alone fight with hundreds and thousands hundreds and thousands of soldiers alone to kill them so that's seven such powerful uh opponents then attack this uh this women and we want to fought fought for fourth one ultimately he and actually he could not come out and then he was killed very unethically they were ethical all the ethics of the world was just overlooked so in the deadly trap who could get in and know there are few people in the entire army of that time generals only four people used to know one is the krishna himself knew how to enter into that trap the circle trap but come out also you know how to come out and arjuna himself and dorno and vishnu these are the few people used to four five people used to know i know we wouldn't know how to enter but we didn't know how to come out that is a story there anyhow so this boohoo that means this puzzle spinning wheel like size and looking entering this way and that way and that way and that way the center and then you are trapped they are all covered by the fighting people around you so you cannot come out advancing what to do and now it will discharge uh so so this this is for defense it can be you want to protect your military general you can keep him protected there and it can be defensive mechanism is also offensive one and there are seven layers of that circle and strongest people will be inner core weaker will be outside when you are trapped inside you have to fight with the strongest people and less strong less strong restroom outer periphery so this is the plan of that which is called the chakra is that that vuho means the puzzle and chakra is the spinning will design so this was an elite level of military strategy in those days and and then women know under that condition his weapon is being cut so his weapon without any weapon then he was fell down at is rule that if someone is have no weapon you cannot kill him then he fell down then he tried to take the will of the what you call the chariot but by that time unethically in the breaking all the rules of this great war they killed and it was stabbed by the station his brother's son his name was dude he killed him stabbed him and killed now seeing this condition this news came afterwards and naturally yudhishthira he was to be there their target was to kill him but this boy dedicated as it were and he was sad but he was so upset and then he was moaning bitterly and then vyasa came vassar appeared and gave him some consolation and when judiciary was lamenting and they fall off of human then gasol came and said what he said is it in the evening when the women was killed the gurus withdrew to their incumbent and campaign they all went back what is over the sun lamented on in on the fall of human and baso came and consoles him and naturally he gave the eternal message of vedanta he says death takes all without ex exception then related a story what he has heard he means now he himself listened heard from other naruto rishi and then told that story and the judicial become free from grief brasher says obi-wan has attained to that eternal goal which is attained by the yogis and those that are living in heaven never prefer this world to heaven it is the living that stands in need of our grief and not those who have attained to heaven his sins increase for whom the living saying so and many many other instructions then vaso disappeared and judi still become free from all his sufferings and so what does it mean with bhaso said that why are you vyasadeva said you are living for we even know but everyone has to die and mohimanu thought in the righteous war and it is believed that if anyone fights for the right cause he need not have to do job or meditation he will go to heaven because of his merit of his great service given to fight against the evil so so he is already at in heaven by his courageous fight and righteous fight and who are in heaven they don't like to come back here to stay and suffer like us so he said oh you this terror why are you lamenting like that those who have gone into the highest fear they don't like to come back into the like us and you doing that it is leaving it is the living that stands in need of our greed rather we should grieve for those who are in the world no oh my god they are in so much suffering see suppose in this difficult time so many people have passed away so they are not to fear about oh ho ho i will repeat the mask and we will have to do this six feet distance all this trouble who is coming what is that really tested is that no worries about that they didn't know so they don't have to but rather to lament for those who have gone they are not to be pictured here so they also very wise person tells it is the living that stands that stand in need of our greek we should creep for the people who are alive and not those who have attained to heaven because his sins increase for whom the living grief that means one person who grieves who has gone to heaven and giving for that it is unnecessary you are making your authorization much so it is like a sinful act anyhow this was the message and judish terror then cooled down but now he remembered how how shall i say this news to arjuna what shall we do there comes the question of this book will come so we'll go have to go to another history you know pandava in the pandava and kuro pandu's son was arjuna and five brothers and the wife drew kudu was married to them and their mother kunti this is the pandava group and this one is hundreds and thousands good is only few evil or hundreds and the name is also very good do do do bad bad bad in the world that is the problem bad is so much and bcs they fight with the good and good who have to fight the entire mahabharata story is for justice for truth for justice so this pandora the arjuna is the prime figure there and always cunningly tried to take the property take everything grab everything but very jealous about what you call everyone arjuna yudhisthira bhima the five brothers yes everyone was there from this child you did even childhood even though judah was jealous about arjuna and now when situation they become young and then through the play of what is called dice there is a rule i sometimes used to think why this wise people went for playing dice and and debate is what the kingdom gambling gambling gambling this gambling is considered bad is it not gambling but this gambling was a acceptable norm for the kings rule was there your honor is much you should keep your honor if anyone asked to come in gambling any king offers gambling yes you say yes you are otherwise like that and called into gambling and with all tricks conquered and then judistiro the head of the pandavas was playing and he's losing losing losing fast he lost it okay i'll give this okay let me pay as a gambling bait is what the half of my kingdom or quarter of my kingdom or something start with little and expand expand experience man then the whole country okay and that was god then my brother all the brother and is every time winning winning and he is losing and losing [Music] even for his wife what authority they have to gamble with the wife and he lost everything and then humiliation came all these stories are one after another then then they are given 14 years of punishment again they have another gambling issue okay if i will if anyone loses the game they'll have to 13 years in the forest like they will not be king there will be nothing and just go in the forest eat fruits and roots and then and one year will be you have to live incognito if you are caught during each of income and all the five brothers and drupadi and mother kunti will have to live in cognitive in such a way that dude if he done does understand all his all the brothers and all these cunning people then if it is caught that is your arjuna is here you have to live in nicola so that no one can recognize you and if he's caught then you'll have to repeat another 13 years plus one year 14 years punishment see this type of nasty deal and gambling and for you know and everyone was captivated drupati was humiliated in the courthouse all these went off and then again again second time also another gambling happened there also mean in this way it went on now so when ultimately these five brothers had to go for a exile or you say in the forest that time many stories has happened but krishna the lord krishna was good friend of arjuna all through the life so she remained so when arjuna married the krsna's sister her name was suhadra that's why even in javanat we get three pictures are found so balarama and krishna they are brothers balram the elder brother are krishna is the younger brother and sugar is the sister so arjuna married suvadra but in this marriage balarama elder brother was not very happy but krishna was supporting that so balarama though he was not approving but krishna did it as a result they married but how in those days the balram is not willing so arjuna made a treat it is called in those days run away secretly to get married no kings had that abduction we call abduction but sure the right was you know she was agreeable but the marriage was not possible in this way so arjuna suddenly appeared and took away suhadra and she was married with her so now arjuna and subhadra they have their [Music] so that way they got married and in their womb came this while in the womb arjuna was one day talking to subhadra in the war with the seventh circle we talked about so how he was describing and the baby was in the moon of the mother uttar in the suvardras no abhiman was in the whom of the mother and then arjuna was telling in a war how one can enter into the this puzzle and chakra the circle and enter and how to come out but what happened shubhandra was listening and arjuna was talking and sugatra listened he was she was tired so she only was awake till arjuna said how to break all these barriers of seven layers of army and enter into the key point where your target person is held there captivated no suppose i want to kill judith hero i say say on the opponent's side so this function will be there you can penetrate through that and go and kill that person but after killing you have to come back because they are all circled they are huge number and you are the only person what happened this suhadra got got to sleep so she entered into sleep when arjuna was talking about how to come out so the baby learned only his such a baby he learned in the mother's womb how to enter into this chakras and go to the center but by that time mother has fell asleep so the baby also didn't get to hear about the way to come out so that was the problem which the cause of women's death so now this is the one episode where everyone was born and women was a very bright brilliant in archery in all types of war efficiency fastness she excelled everyone so there's a bright child [Music] actually then arjuna obi-wan is the son of arjuna and subhadra and you can say a woman is the nephew of krishna shri krishna she krishna's sister married towards you now during the period of exile during this period of exile when they are hiding in cognitive that time what happened in the family of uh what is called that in the family of the there is a king never in king he was birato name was virat virata miranda is great fast they are very open-hearted and everyone took some job with them in that virata family virata's palace so arjuna used to know good dancing he took this job of a dancer teacher dancing teacher and virato has a daughter she was very sweet and young girl and this arjuna taught dancing to her and this uttara her name was uttara she was then arjuna married him with this [Music] is married with uttara understand uttara uttara was bhirata's daughter and arjuna was incognito or in hiding their um what you call their recognition and they're hiding their own identities identities and he became a dance teacher and then this uttara and that he was married to afterwards to with this when they married they have their son his son's name was parikshit we know about foreign so this is the relationship arjuna and subhadra they get married they have their son a woman was a young boy growing he was married with birato's daughter whose name was uttara uttara and got married and during that what time uttara was pregnant when they came to know that this broad baby is there in the boom so they want to kill everyone so even they tried to kill the baby in the um that time krishna came and protected this baby and that's why the tradition of krishna lineage or arjuna's genius continued so krishna protected this king this this boy whose name was pariksit and pariksit as you know the great story he was one of the wonderful king of india and he was so righteous he was so kind and so loving whole country used to love him his subjects they used to respect him love him but you know that story that pariksit when he was a king one day it is kingly thing that they go for what you call hunting they go for hunting so one day he went for hunting and in the forest here and there he was so tired and he could not get much but he felt very thirsty and finding where to get a little water in the deep forest and they found a little in little distance there is a heart and the heart is normally seriously with the forest in small hearts so he then made a journey towards that and went there and he very politely he is the king but he was very politely requested that household man sage here they said they are married says means they have their wife husband i don't know why he also may be out and the children were out and the sage was sitting in calm meditation and the pariksit went and said sir please give me could you give me little water i am very thirsty one time he requested but yogi sat like that the rishi was the sage was unmoved just sitting like that and then again the king parikshit requested second time please please i am so tasty can you give me one little water he was not there she was in deep meditation third time when he requested and the sage didn't move so yeah pariksit probably got little angry i am requesting how much meditation you are doing the king of the country has come at your door and bringing a glass of water is it too much but he does not respond because he was not there so what he did he found oh you have become yogi you have become shiva like no okay the shiva should have a snake so he found some dead snake in the summer nearby and he picked with his arrow and put it on the neck of that sage and the sails do not know anything because he was he he was indeed somatic you know i meant the meditation and after that anyhow but it got frustrated and then left that place and came back to the palace but before that this boy the rishi has his son he was playing with some at some distance with some other friends and when he came back saw a snake around his father's neck in the father's neck snake and he got annoyed and he said he cursed he who has put this snake on the neck of my father respected father he will have to die by the bite of a snake within seven days and this type of commotion is going on after big commercial the sage came to come down and saw what is happening he saw a snake around him his neck and the sun is furious all this situation then he said what has happened now see somebody came here and put his dead snake on your neck insulted so son said i have cursed him they have the power that's called rishis are so austere whatever comes out of their mouth it will follow truth will follow their words will be fulfilled so his father coming down came to know that the king pariksit has visited their heart and he was asking for a little drinking water being thirsty he said it is my fault a guest has come not an ordinary taste such a king who loves every person in the world because of his presence the whole country is full of peace and joy and prosperity and i could not give one glass of water i am sorry for that and he requested his son please withdraw your curse but the boy has his own own ego or you can say you your own respect for father he said no what i have said i will not go to going to withdraw my curse his father was really upset but anyway then by that time brexit the king put his has come back come back to his palace and this news also reached him that this son of the sage rishi putra have cursed that he will die within seven days by the bite of this neck there is such a pious king he immediately thought oh yes i did very wrong the sage was not in awareness of the outside world he was meditating and i out of my anger and put that snake on his neck so anyhow let this be a blessings so let me give up my kingdom so he gave up his kingdom parikshit gave up his kingdom and so he gave up his kingdom to his son his son was january january title and giving the kingdom to their hand and the ministers and others he just walked out and went into a forest which is called nuimi it's still now there people go to visit that holy place he went and retired there for seven days because his life is only seven days so he thought let by these seven days and be passed in the thinking of krishna krishna because he is the grandson he is becoming the grandson of krishna because his purik shit's father was who pariksit's father was [Music] obi-munu's mother brother's mother is suhadra and then that means you can see krishna's sister and his son's son [Music] talk to him [Music] so in this life grandma what you say again grandson or something like that and now and she was she should should have been killed unless creation of protected in the womb so brexit then thought that is who she went and it had and then whole community of the uh elite of the society the alarmnet people the scholarly people all followed pariksit and requested please come back come back what a snake will bite you you will be in your palace how the snake will enter there you can easily overcome that a child has said something out of anger you need not take those things very seriously he said no this is a warning so i want to now seven days are before me so i want to spend this seven days day and night thinking of krishna and if you know please talk about krsna but when he entered everyone was very morose the whole community was sudden very much losing such a wonderful king parikshit for no reason somebody has cast something and he's leaving then in this assembly when he was and the sages were also many sages came to take by from parikshit and be with parikshit this last seven days became a congregation of holy people and key person is the guardianship and that time is suddenly found that sukhodev the son of vyasa he just appeared he was ever free sukadeva is called you are free he is never in bondage seeing him purify this beautiful description in the bhagavata so parishes stood up with reverence and saluted him and says oh what will get fortune i have only seven days left please tell about krishna who has protected me before my birth who is protecting me till now and i will go to him but i want to know about the glories about the life about the lila divine sport of krishna then this brahma sutra this divided the whole vedic literature into four segments reek sama jaju a turbo like that so this is the whole wisdom of vyasa and his son he heard from his father about bhagavata bhagavata was written by whom his father sukadeva's father that's with him so the vassal from vyasa his father he knew this bhagavata story then he related that story days and days it went on for seven days and at the end of the seven days that shukriv said okay now i will leave then he said you have any more question because it's a question answer question answer then sugar they said that if you have no question i will leave tell me if you have any question parikshit said no i have no more question all my doubts are done um all the doubts will be cut ascendant so so in doubt he said all doubts are done i have nothing to do and my bondage is gone and i don't care for i don't fear death anymore death is no fear to me i welcome death so they say this is the whole story to cross the fear of death to jump above death that is what the physical body that is vedanta so he said now i am fearless i don't care for any fear for losing this body or anything i have become deathless with the bow now be weighing me on i will never be frightened not frightened by them so sugar they passed away and the story goes that this snake venomous snake came and pushed and with that biting sugar purity divine body subtle body came out and it was taken into the higher abode by the chariot so here sugar so now we find that his son became the king in the instead of purity passing away and so now this point is that this book which we are going to read that when a woman who died then who there was a story that when obi-wan who died then we see that when obi-wan died then their great journey to heaven all are going then bhagavata spoke about bhagavata to par pariksit and suko got it from vasudeva not that is not found in mahabharata though krsna's teaching they are all christmas teaching similarly here this book we are talking to santigita it came from satanic the grandson of prix john bonjay's son's son so this this satanic rishi king was the grandson of pariksit he was asking questions to hear about some noble truths and from a sage he's called psalm to bruto and santa bruto heard it from his guru and then what shantan says he came to the pariksit's son's son time in his palace and then there is a custom anyone comes and he says comes the king will stand up with proper adoration offer their salutation and ask some spiritual question so the son january's son this is satanic is the name of that king he then asked the son of brother rishi when he came in his kingdom to say please tell me something noble and satanic said i have heard this message from my guru and so that that's why though it is not in mahabharata this what will read something it cannot be because it is a story of much later story but he is this says shanta bruto has heard it from his guru and his guru has heard it from someone so that is the way the spiritual tradition goes so though we don't find its origin in the mahabharata or it is not bhagavata also but it is christmas words as some oral tradition in our vedant also something you find so many books which is the written tradition no it is confirmed there are many oral tradition swami people can understand something that oh the india will rise but it will not be there is no power in the world which can stop it but it is not the political india but the spiritual india and it will flood the whole world like that there are certain statements there's a statement like that you know india ramakrishna has come no one will be able to do anything but first attack will come from china he said that another 50 years will be your only worshipping god will be your motherland and when he spoke you had 50 years it is 1947 india got freedom we find certain things are there if you say where it is you know and it's a oral tradition so from the oral tradition it came to santa brother from his guru and then tradition and santa protocol is from his guru and he related it to this king which is shatanika who is the parikshit's grandson so this is the story about this major thing is that when obi-wan was killed that story will read here a woman who was killed then actually arjuna you can think that such a bright boy being killed brutally breaking all the norms of war so you are so sad and depressed like bhagavad-gita when before war started he was depressed this also he went to deep depression but see krishna came and he asked guidance and he told the same you when you read you will find that this he is being saying this body is temporary atman is eternal it has no bath it has no death exactly a similar type of message but it is wonderful to see how this teaching we may think that how in the workfield this type of scripture will come no that question may come to us no like authenticity and other things but you have to understand whole gita is how much 700 horses no seven hours versus if you chant it will take how long two hours two and a half hours maximum three hours so when arjuna was depressed in the field war field itself sikh is now spoken colloquial sanskrit as you are speaking in english that was the common language there is no commentary note that is not important he's speaking directly oh you know why are you doing like this jojo said no no no my mind is restless please please you tell all these things no no no no you are the controller of your mind your mind is getting attached to the worldly subject all these things have been spoken the high philosophy but you have to understand arjuna is not an ordinary guy he has the past wisdom of the scriptures also in the early days that was the tradition you are a king you are a ordinary person you have great knowledge about these scriptures so with that background when krishna is saying something and he understands it and after listening the bhagavad-gita what happened then started fighting so here also in between the fighting period of 13th day when arjuna's son of evan was killed then again he being depressed then krishna came and advised and that is called shanti kita he says means peace he got peace arjuna got peace and also now is the period of kobe for so many reason death is a very frightening thing people are really panicked even panic means really no one knows for certain when we are there and when you are not in this uncertain period this will be a big bomb in the mind of people who are really worried full of anxiety and other things so that they will get peace so thanks to our yoga dhati she found out this book but searching here and there i do not know what to do i was thinking i asked suggestion from all of you but i didn't get any suggestion but one suggestion came so i took it up but it will be a struggle for me because there is no book but verses are there we will try to give you the verses how will we do we'll think about that to computer or internet or something how we send the message original verses and we are also trying to give you sanskrit original and transliterated original with hyphenated because there is a conjoined center is is very difficult to understand it be first of all sasket second of all it is a one line maybe one sentence one word one one you have to break break break otherwise you'll not make any sense so we'll try to supply that as we move on next week before that we'll send something uh online to our website or something we'll think about that how to do that so this is the simple thing then chanting will start again reading next time the key point is that that he got peace arjuna listening this was when his son was dead so when we lose our friends we lose our near and dear ones we also grieve and we also feel despondent so this can bring us something at this critical time which is very apt to study thank you all so we end here is there any anything in there i do not see it anywhere these are of course the preliminary talk so probably there is no question at the beginning of the beginning at the beginning when the 1 day 13th day of diwali yeah but that is not incorporated in the book because uh mahabharata only has certain things such big and also some oral tradition it went from what he has heard he told someone and then so santo bruto came to get from his guru his guru his will how so it's overall tradition and and you find that is the teaching is so alike it it's it it confirms that it is message so i see that something really let me see what is that okay so thank you all for attending but sorry for the disturbance i do not know whether this is working or not working it's not working it's not working very good so it is not the first day is gone this way second day will be like that [Music] 12
