[27. Shanti Gita - Class 27 - Chapter 3 , Verses 16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WL81vhgIV4Y)

[Music] [Music] shanti shanti shanti oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face own peace peace peace be unto us all so we are on the shanti gita peace song of peace and we are in the third chapter reading from verse number 16. so this is a big question now arjuna is putting arjuna is asking this question it says that we have already read the previous verses that brahman alone is one this is are unnecessarily involving yourself and getting into bereavement this is all not wrong neither you are there no no neither me not this art nor children family friends you are all deluded and getting deluded you are becoming tormented with your believement and satyang matwaam shatmakum it is your grandest mistake that you are thinking which is not true as true unreal as real that's our prayer lead us from this unreal to the real why i am seeing what is unreal but not seeing what is real this is our darkness that's why he said lead us from darkness to light in this light so that we can see what is the truth twang we have read the other for other day drama by urupa you are always of this form of nondual reality you aren't the only reality there is there is no trace of duality there is no trace of many fullness only one absolute truth is there and that thou art that tom ashi that thou art doitang mayam then what are you seeing this is maya made of maya servant or spirit what you see servam as all material objects sun moon stars galaxies what is realities pleasure pain suffering all these what you see these are all maya made of maya and to inaudible it does not touch you in your real divine entity it cannot touch that absolute how did infinite can be touched by any mundane thing so that was the thing we read you are successful 15 months you are seeing the sucks you are saying i am the witness there is no succeed there is no object there in the subject if there is a subject object then it is called duality but there is no successive idea is also one idea yes from this standpoint where we are now it makes sense that we can think that i am sakshi witness of everything which is name and form but in that reality truth there is no one to see one is observer and one in nothing is there to be observed and there's no tool true to to true which you can see because only one exists therefore this is the this you have to understand with reference to the objects witnessed you are the witness no is there is some object with reference to that you can say i have observed i have witnessed with reference to object sin you are the seer there is some object i have seen so that i am the seer due to the absence of an implied object you are the undefinable one you are the knowledge as you rise above the mental modifications as soon as you get out of the mind this whole universe is really it's a fussy it's a fuss is it not when you go to sleep what happens where goes this universe of crisis earth's joys fun his tension his worries his anxieties where does it go it has no existence as much as the moment you can get out of your mind and this modulation then world it disappears you experience every day why are you identifying with this thing yes now you are here you see that you go to dream you see something else and you go to sleep neither the dream neither this object is there all disappear where does it go vanish into void this is the thing we read now would you know hearing all these 16 verses arjuna like bhagavad-gita arjuna arjuna said what he said krishna what is that maya you are talking about maya my eyes it is feminine gender they put it like prakriti etc so ka kaamaya ja advota and you are saying it is advocate astonishing it is means what wonderful it's mesmerizing it is absurd many meaning you can do so kamaya which is wonderful and kept us all delusion o krishna tell me ka abiddha what is that ignorance you are talking about what is ignorance what is maya nitya maya is all the time there ba or arithya it is non-real is it real or is it unreal anita cause what is the nature tayor of these two what are the two that is the maya and abiddha you got the two terminology now maya and avida so naturally arjuna is putting this question oh krishna please tell me kamaya what is that maya what is maya yeah that which is wonderful mesmerizing confusing conflicting what is that and ka abidya what is that ignorance of the individual jiva sutika which has given the birth of this jiva i am jiva how do i become jiva as you are saying that i am infinite there is no dosta there is no this show witness there is nothing to witness nothing seen nothing's here reason what is this jiva this individual cell shrutika means what is produced from was the womb of this creation what is the where do i come from this ignorance i jiva which comes from abid that what is that how can it create such delusion as we are always charmed by that when we see charm not only charmed we are overwhelmed we are crying we are sobbing we are having fun we are intense and we are in anxiety we are going to take medicine we are going to doctor we are doing pranayama we are doing spiritual meditation we are doing how many things we are trying to do so what is this so what is that and what is that maya and is it maya all the time really i saw from my childhood i am seeing this world so maya is real then or otto anitta no no no they are not real and ill cause what is this what is the natural nature what is the innate nature of these two oh hurry tell me so oh krishna what is this cosmic ignorance maya that is so wonderful what is this individual ignorance of it that gives birth to this all being individual beings of these two are they even eternal are they all the time there or transient or what is their nature so tell all these things so now sri bhagavan krishna is responding this question she is the responser is the krishna advocate maha advocate this maya is extremely strange advocate wonderful unique strange and unprecedented so my eyes are boot so great wonder maha mahadmes great maha is great advocate is wonder or surprising srinu listen maha advocates mahada is great wonder satadi trigono it is composed of this maya is composed of three gunas you know sattva rajas and thomas the maya is made of three gunas sakta rajas and thomas it is uttati rahita without origin what is that without origin my eyes without origin existing from eternity nausea in its own nature that is called its own nature the most wonderful cosmic ignorance maya is composed of the three gunas such as satyr rajas etc of thomas and is said to be without origin it has no origin means it has an origin means you go go go find where is where it started you cannot find where it started you go we saw we are seeing thousands of years past our forefathers saw they are therefore father yeah if the age when when people saw they saw this world no when their dinosaur is the dinosaur saw this world so it is there where is the beginning go go go oh the it came from the sun and the modern science will say where the sun came from go to back to and the sun yes this planets were all scattered and it is rotating okay what where did it come from before that the sun what happened where go back back back back even to infinite creation you don't find any beginning that's why maya has no beginning so maya you cannot find its original source noise but it is continuing all the time we are as soon as you open up open the eyes it is here in some kind of places another way this is eternal nature continuing to be here all the time it is it is said to be so so maya so listen that that is the definition of maya maya is wonderful cosmic ignorance which is maya that is mahad bhutah our most wonderful satadi triguna nita it is composed of the sattva rajas and everything in this world you examine you find that i it is either more of sato quality less of rajasthan or more of rajas quality less and certain the permutation and combination of the three items it may have infinite variation everything has infinite variation rajas and tamas it has no beginning it has a certain thing the plant was not here you put the seed it comes out it is the beginning when the maya started where from i don't know no one can say when which day how it came anadi and you search his root where it go back back back back you cannot find the source of it and nurture it but it continues and we see it it maintains its existing its own nature and it is from infinite nature it is going on for a long time in this way and long there is no end of long what what how many millionaire billionaire trillionaire there is no time it is within we cannot say anything but 17 is done 18 months 18 months says obviously almost [Music] that is the point that which is not boost means reality that which is not real bharti means appears at boston as reality not there but it appears the water is not there in the freeway in the hot summer when you are driving but you see the water there you cannot deny that you go to the desert area so you see miles after miles there is water even you can see the reflection of the palm tree as in the lake it happens it's there i see it but you go and catch it there is no water you see water but there is no water this is the definition of my you see it here it's not there in reality when the knowledge will come you'll see it is only one cosmic consciousness that is sachidan and you are that but when it is you are seeing it it looks like that but it is not so so all of us do masturbation which is not boost to a reality appears as a bus to real that means unreal becomes real becomes as it were for us it is real who can deny that i saw it my eyes but these eyes will be open ramakrishna he didn't see the when his ecstatic moon you see that samadhi picture his eyes a little bit open but what he sees he does not see as we see obviously for him this appearance is zero but he sees divine everywhere so obvious to masturbate party that which is unreal appears as real how adhering on to essential nature of brahman how it happens to satta samastrida because it is close to boston muslim means the reality brahman you know you see can you separate out the power of the boss and his closest person people say don't go to the boss go to this guy you will get your things done why because as much close to the power you become powerful if you are so far away less power far away less power less power less power but you become very close suppose who is close to the president so you can get your things done if you can convince him so similarly when it is close to brahman this maya which has no power power is given to the president not to he confess the power and that goes on he said no he becomes a finance minister any say you become the secretary education secretary okay that he chooses no in the cabinet they built up who will be given what who does that in his name somebody does but it actually it is his doing the power belongs to him but the guy who is empowered he becomes powerful and one sees the power from which it has come that is the maya you go to doctor's appointment no when you go to doctor's appointment your urgency you don't get doctor but if you have a good friendship with the the counter lady and you have made friendship with some sweets candies and this and that and then then you they call it this is my situation please please oh yeah yeah yeah yeah doctor connected so who is powerful the power person is sitting somewhere else powerless as it were and those who live close proximity to them they become powerful so this is the maya living close to brahman we see the magical power of maya where we will learn wow wow but whose power because of the proximity of brahman so that's why satta samasita ashrita means taking refuge setting on boost muslim is the essential truth that is brahman maya has no power of its own maya cannot do anything without the brahman and that's why in used to say brahman and his sakti are one because it is a philosophy philosophical difference they say that philosophy brahman is also powerful same shakti is also eternal brahman is also mother is also eternal no but here in absolute vedanta then this shakti is an expression which is nothing but he appears to be so powerful this is to philosophical distinction because brahman alone is only reality in vedanta but in this philosophy of shakto idea brahman and shakti may be manifest or man manifest both are same so the maya and muhammad this is the distinction maya can be ended by spiritual practice when you attain knowledge ignorance will be dropped off so you can attain your own brahman nature but muhammad no muhammad all the time so long brahman is there mahamaya is also there it's a play divine play yeah that's the bedant extent brahman is the only thing so maya is there you appear but it is not there it is brahman actually even if you see whatever you see it is brahman if you're [Music] the great mother great mother and mohammad a great mother who is everywhere she has become all these things but she and brahman are not to see separate ramakrishna's example he'll be sister do it a little bit on that side the snake is snake snake is moving that is called jagat this world when the snake does not move it is called brahmana it does not do anything remain like that but the power is always within it can manifest any time the creation comes so it is not separate inseparable without beginning without end but maya beginningless there is end there is the end suppose you now experience your divine nature maya will just vanish there is no maya you see only the reality this is the difference now what is called about got it obvious too which is not real appears to be real bostova bhati satya because naughty of his intrinsic power but because of the bhustu-satya closeness to the brahmana that is the maya that's why it appears so powerful but in actually it is not there then what is that it is called sat and also you can say maya is there yes my eyes are i see aj see hard it is making a noise sound how can you see it is not there huh so you throw some paper in my eyes how can you say paper is not there it burns my eyes it is there my eyes are there that is there it is so i cannot deny it i say yes sat it is there maya is here but again awesome as soon as well no no no how can it be you have to just you go to deep sleep best this world goes it goes away so it is not there if it is there it should be all the time there but no no no you i don't see but others are seeing you are sleeping you don't see but i am awake i see well no no no it is not that it is individual you tell about your experience when you go to deep sleep where goes this world if it is there it should be in your deep sleep also but it is not there so maya cannot be defined it cannot be said it is it is not how can i say no i am seeing this it is it is not well yes in the deep sleep or when when one gets illumination which is not there in samadhi rama is going to somebody where is the world where is heaven where his gods and angels all merge into that one void so it can so it cannot be defined it cannot be say it is it cannot be say it is not sadasa on irbacca you cannot determine indeterminable there is no instrument to understand this existence of maya by measuring something how much degree of maya is here and there more or less it is indeterminable it cannot be determined shanta there's 18 verses which cannot be expressed through speech and she's anta anta she's in and it has an end maya has an end and it is bhabur when he exists in the form of reality which i just exist as if it is there has an end maybe not for you and me but anyone who realizes the truth for him this moment maya will go away so anta so maya has an end so you see now few definitions you got it if you add these two verses 17 and 18 then you get 17 says trigunatmika maya has three qualities wherever you find the three qualities sattika quality rajasiko or tamasiko whenever you find any of these qualities you know it is maya satyadi trigunanita it has no birth on adi you cannot find to you go back go back go back to find where mama maya started which point but it is continuously visible and second eighteen verse almost two it is not there but it has the power booster bhati it appears like a buster like an object because boston real booster is brahman being close to the boston this appears to be real because of the reality of the boston brahman it appears to be brahman maya has no existence of his own it only appears why it appears because as i said close to the ceo close to the boss they are powerful people but when they come out there's nobody ordinary person huh you're a superintendent of police big thing and when you go to your home what happens they get into to his wife or his children how they treat the superintendent of police in other place those are superintendent police oh my big big big so but you coming to who cares because you are not on the position there out of position gun your strength is gone you can get good scolding from your children or your husband or your wife no so so this is the point so it is boost close to because it is resting on the basta sapta and it can be saw the swatbam it cannot be said it is there it cannot be said it is not there then what is this it cannot indeterminable it cannot be a certain it is sahanta it has in the end i see and bhava rupini it has an end and it exists in the form of a reality okay that's okay in the upanishad it is said uh simply it is a description of the maya is this it is three made of three gunas his most powerful and most astonishing that is only the power of brahman ali upanishad has described that thing [Music] that devastated it is the power shakti of the devatma the effulgent atman saw gurnewing by three gunais niguram it is embedded into it the three gurus are embedded into that brahman and from there as if it is coming up that self-effulgent full of consciousness and that is the power of brahma and his power is shakti and it is by his effect it becomes grows it becomes subtle growth is now it becomes subtle when you go to dream and when you sleep it goes as if not there involved into it and then you wake up it springs again so it is resting on the atman every day it is happening look at that every day when you go to sleep now behind this body suppose the subtle body is there subtle body is their causal body is there and causal body behind the atman so every day what is happening it is springing from causal body springing from the atman embedded the power pushes it becomes the ego body then becomes the subtle body dream body and then gets gross body so it goes from gross to subtle to causal and beyond but it cannot go there is a veil ignorance that's why we are not illumined illumine people can break that veil and see brahman everywhere and when they come back they don't see this world the way i see you see this is the reality for us they have no reality it's only name and form a wax museum everything made of wax but in only name and form wax made the trees wax the road is wax the car is wax everything made of one so the ganny the noir of truth sees this oneness everywhere therefore what i said para brahma the brahman is the cause of this universe and it has got three powers gano shakti kriya these are the powers these are all within the realm of this maya the maya is divided into this type of expressions my it is the advice to see rama over alma brahman is totally filled up it is eternal it is non-dual that paramatma when it becomes associated with this maya power power of maya maya shakti then it becomes all powerful suppose you have a talent now suppose you're music talent or you're playing the guitar talent and i don't see it now but it is within you you can manifest it sometime and you cannot or you do not it is your freedom similarly the brahman had that maya shakti can project and sometimes not how it happens that's why i say by maya you cannot explain that it happens when you lose sin it is your wish maybe one day we don't sing don't sing you want to sing you sing but the power is always there the maya that all powerful supreme self becomes transformed according to the expression like sometimes it expresses as like a god deva sometimes like human being the same power manifesting in different ways gods humans animals birds insects and in there the as consciousness you can see that a little land you see how powerful is that and it how much is the way and it runs you can blow away but you see this activity level it is manifesting through that then you don't want you want to see maya he's a maya maya shakti manifesting to an end maya manifesting to a giant manifesting to you holy person maya's word here is sato here is rajas here is thomas isn't it so maya the whole world is an expression of maya shakti and somewhere in some way purer impure but it is all brahman manifesting by the sakti mayasakti this beautiful idea to think about it it can gives us it can give give us very good conception about brahman idea it is all the shakti the world ramakrishna said this everything is in it within the region of the power and when power is not manifested you live like any other ordinary person and when your shakti manifest then people oh he's such a musician oh she's such a prolific speaker who is such a writer oh he's sachin this dad that how many descriptions people give but when that power is hidden within it is not lost it is there the maya shakti is like that and it manifests in so many ways even it it says that its power is manifested in the in the wind by you in the solid rocks and wood in the waters is it as a liquid power and a fire in the burning power in the space like a void power and all the destructible objects of the universe as shakti power so what you see you see brahman ali maya sukthi you see the ocean only but by the power of the oceanic power of creating waves and ripples you see so many ripples and waves each is different than the other but this power is behind every ripple every wave every bubble every form is because they manifesting as shakti so so long we live in the world we are in the realm of the sakti that's why vedantic sadhus also swamp also worship mother the shakti is the mother to unveil the truth that shakti unless that shakti is withdrawn it will not go to brahman it will remain in his own dancing mood in the on the surface of the ocean we are all dancing on the surface of the ocean not knowing that there is ocean behind all the shakthi and focus is on the shakthi and they are crying and weeping whatever we are doing or smiling or rejoicing it is all shakthi and that maya is on earth when you are saying enjoying that means you are shakti otherwise how will you enjoy enjoy naturally little shakti is there to separate out from brahman that's why you enjoy enjoying is possible and when you become the ocean who will enjoy whom you are that bliss you are that reality but can you enjoy yourself that's why yeah there is a language they call atma rama that's where they become fully satisfied with him you know knowing again knowing what is coming buddhi now you cannot say anything that's the point whenever you want to express any way you are coming in the realm of your ego or your intellect or your mind but there is no mind no intellect no ego so how can you say what is that that say all these scriptures have been speechless at that point at the point of samadhi they cannot say anything they only say when they come down again in the realm of shakti and they can remember that a little bit of remembrance whatever they can express that and expression is different those who are ordinary sadhaka a little bit they go like that come back and their expression is one but the expression of ramakrishna is different expression of holy mother is different expression of brahmananda is different expression of samit turiyananda is different so they are all brahmaganis but that's why brahmavir bara these are all definition who but when you reach the brahman awareness the same all the people in the samadhi is the same but when they come they have their ability to express shakti within the range of shakti which one's someone is a cop someone is a mug someone is a jar someone may be big container right so so each as capacity is different maya it is never one can accept the coming up of maya because brahman is without attachment without action without any changes pure consciousness then if if it comes from then then it will be brahman becomes then changed if you say brahman has changed no that is not possible then it becomes again duality so before one attaining the state of liberation maya cannot again come up then our all efforts of practicing this disciplines will be meaningless if after attaining my knowledge again maya comes down it is not once you gain maya cannot play anymore that is the point let us read then 20 20 verse no 20 verse now 19 verse [Music] [Music] sheila [Music] this all this maya is standing on brahman it is resting on brahman holding on to brahman or resting on the brahman chit bishaya who's filled his consciousness brahman is all consciousness on that ground and consciousness manifesting that's why you know i am conscious of my hand first of all there is consciousness that consciousness is percolating through the ego coming to the brain buddhi not brain buddhi intellect intellect to mind and mind to this physical body to the prana through the brain then coming to the nervous system action reaction talking all this going on so we see the consciousness here its root is somewhere else so it says it where on the brahman or the atman brahman are the same individually we call atman collectively we call brahman individually equal avidya ignorance cosmic we call maya only individual or cosmic so sum total or individual so the material is the same so brahma astraya and how it is chidvishaya it it is adhering to chidbishaya is the who's filled his consciousness brahma shakti whose power is the power of brahman she has no power of its own it's a power of brahman no this hand my brain the neurons all working if that connection is dis dislodged they will not a robot is working but the robot power of the robot is taken out then the water's hand will stay robot is lifting such heavy weight no then take out the power you cannot lift even one blade of grass the cotton caught upon says no the story remember the gods and demons as a fight always now also today also god and demon good people versus taliban people right in society there are nice people versus uh they well bad motivated people no thomas mercer it will always fight not to blame anyone but it is the sakti tamasa sakti rajasu satti koshyaki these are all manifestation so whatever we see it is only the range of manifestation so it is brahma astraya it is resting on or holding on to brahman its consciousness is only apparently seen here but the background energy that is the brahmana depending on that everything is working see how many great people of the world big scientists big philosophers the alzheimer comes what happens consciousness is still there but this brain neurons are not acting reacting not connecting it so without that power inside nothing can work even everything on this side is correct but without current everything is gone so this is the fear there so brahma-sakti that brahma-sakti is mahabala a great brahma-sakti whose power is the power of brahman it is very powerful strong and durga rude gotta who's capable of making impossible possible got to know cortana put you see another language those who have played the vedanta they have left so what shall i study for they should match what vedanta sarande is saying so here is a vedanta says but you see that gautama that incident which is impossible to happen maya does that there is nothing he creates a castle impossible appearing so possible possibly see it feel it so that's a gyano nasia but when knowledge comes destroyed only by knowledge this you cannot bring a sword or a atomic bomb to remove the ignorance ignorance cannot be cut by sword or by weapon or by water or by wear whatever you use or ignorance you cannot get out of it it only can gannon with the dawn of knowledge only it will go so the maya rests on brahman 19 verse and consciousness is her field of play without consciousness he cannot play ramakrishna gave the example the waves are waves are dependent on the ocean ocean is not dependent on these waves there may be ocean without wave but the wave cannot be without ocean so similarly maya rests on brahman and consciousness is our field of play see is the power of brahman i she's not a separate brahmana and shakthi as he said she is the power of brahman and is very strong capable of making the impossible how strong he has the power to show us what is impossible to happen as possible bewildering and can be destroyed only by the knowledge alone only knowledge can destroy that okay we can end it here few minutes are there for questioning oms [Music] [Music] next day we'll say here that there are two types of shaktis there two types of sakti avaran sakthi big super super auburn covering and big sheba means projection these two shakti will read the next day is there any question so this is i feel a strange contentment nowadays but do not know if i am progressing is this an obstacle please guide by only understanding that you are strange contentment if contentment is blessed why you should strange that strange if i you are peaceful will you doubt why am i peaceful no no if you feel that it is peaceful that's a great virtue and see that it is continuous in your spiritual life it does not fade away yeah that that is means that means we should not get stuck there but move on the problem is that if you feel that i am very happy i got it if you get it then you will be always in bliss but have you reached that perfect bliss if not then move on but it is good sign that you are content and means people are restless always so restlessness not a good sign of spirituality and there are more people some people are they are unnecessary restless they don't do any practice and say oh i have not seen anything i want to have some darshan i want to i am doing one has a 1000 japan what is one thousand japan what is one thousand one hour practice but be contented means your mind should be peaceful i think if it is not from complacency and and you are losing the spirit of doing anything more rather your contentment will give you more inspiration for meditation prayer thinking lofty thoughts keeping the mind always in the world will go on your focus will be more on the spiritual issues turning point of life are those and if that continues this contentment is good but restlessness for at least you should remember i have not yet reached the ultimate second question is please guide us how to differentiate between maya israel and protect ourselves in daily life and that is every day we we are here maya's realm we are we know we are in this world we are deluded and if we are only maya's realm that's why we feel suffering that's why i feel emotionally up and down i feel fear anxieties worries because i am in the mayans realm so how to overcome they are talking about that that you know that you are not so this is the lesson we have to remind ourselves i am not though it is happening because of my shakta rajas and tamas i am in the maya stepped in the maya if you are out of maya then you will not be bound by three gunas that means in you there will be neither thomas quality neither is raja's quality nor subtle quality that is a big development to to happen in life therefore you should pay attention let me come out of the thomas sleep lethargy negativity to get out to be the other sikh to be active and active actively self-less actively doing good to others actively thinking good of our benefit to be a benefit to others charitable this broadness of the heart and activity expansion becomes subtitle more thinking that i am serving god is not a worldly thing worldly business i am doing though i am doing every world every work you do is worldly is it not you are cooking is it not worldly material thing but it can be spiritualized by subtitle quality develop that subtitle quality and whatever i am doing it is by the power of that you read that if you want to correct today's reading all our actions are coming from the brahma shakti brahmastra because i am staying living on the consciousness itself it is the effect of the consciousness trying to manifest through me so we'll have to practice this thing and all will happen in time so and we see the world and what we have to understand is the play of ignorance or maya because big ignorance called maya an individual ignorance called so i am in the spill of ignorance and that's why i am reacting acting this way but how can i not react knowing that i am pure these are happening to my body mind and emotion and all these limbs and our three gunas the play is going on in the three gunas but i am not that the uh like if you're a bad person or evil it's a tamas but to to actually you know say if you're gonna rob a bank or something it takes rogers right you gotta that is good yeah but that's why you should be rajas rather than thomas and with the rajas if we cultivate saktika quality then our efficiency will increase our perfection will grow in the work level also and at the same time insight will come that i am serving god only so these are the development our thomas and rajas will say i i did it so much i for myself and they will project themselves so much they suppress others so satiko quality developed you know they try to push others up the thomas quality will push others down anyone around they will be trying to just subdue them and put project themselves is another question in this day and age when immorality is so prevalent in society what favor or blessings one gets from god if one leads more or less a moral life you know moral life has its own reward you know those who live this reckless life or taking advantage of the immoral situation they may be happier one day two days but they cannot be happy all through a frustration will come repentance will come it is happening to everybody maybe at the face of it we don't see that people are leading immoral life and making a big show and people getting giving them big clap true it's for a few days but in his own mind he'll be weak because he's not living to the truth up to truth that's why it it that is the reward what is our spiritual reward is internally you will be happy you are because of your morality because of your truthfulness because of your greatness you know that how strong you feel inside and these immoral people are very weak inside and that is the spirituality yeah i will say the gain of becoming a moral and and also morality i am doing not for anyone's any purpose but my own spiritual growth for my own peace for my eternal life for the mundane life this life two days happiness making how long one will live with job and joy all immoral life will one lead 10 years 20 years then what will happen body will be old mind will be old then what all repentance either you pay tax to the health disadvantage or you go to mental depression and things what what i did so much what happened what happened so that is the gain of moral life spiritual life no one needs to tell from outside you will feel your inner strength inner purity in her character and that's why you said character if character is being built by that is a dietic meditation possible for ordinary men yeah why not but dating meditation is yes we can think sometime we should be feeling that we are not limited and or you can think you're the lord you are meditating upon think that he is everywhere dating meditation all the books are talking about is possible but maybe it may not be suitable for everyone some may be very comfortable with worshiping god in the form name and form like gods and goddesses or incarnations but some may be constitutionally cannot think of that much rather they think of infinite ocean and that's a way of thinking and all the ideas given in ashtavakra sangeeta or we belong to text we are reading that type of idea so yes it is possible but you have to talk to your teacher then about all these details what is your nature and how you can how you can do things it's your some good guide should be there in your life another question you stated that ignorance can only be removed by knowledge can the path of bhakti also remove the anger of course bhakti means what by by devotion to god no and and and vedantic meditation is what ignorance means what they are also you are seeing god not the maya our emphasis should go vedanta student should not pay attention to maya but try to see brahman and knowing maya i see but it is not there but in bhakti i see it is god's creation and everything is god so maya will then open the door if you understand that maya then maya does not block you if you call god ramakrishna said if you call her as ma then mother cannot delude you anymore so our sincere prayer when it goes through that when our sincere devotional practice can take us to maya's cross to maya ignorance will go away in bhakti school we say ma and grace of god comes and that is mother's grace and mother holds taki we always talk about that and shankaracharya you can break through oh mother you can open thy door swamiji says open thy door oh mother i am tired of playing in the world so swamiji's beautiful song is there in in the in search of god probably i am tired of playing in this world anymore please show me and give me your your your child who seeks your rest in you so purification of the mind is the question bhaktipat gyanopath matters little whoever whoever is comfortable each one okay so thank you all for these questions and if you have any special question you can then write us email and then we'll try to respond to that thank you tomorrow will
