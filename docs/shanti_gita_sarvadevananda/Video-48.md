[45. Shanti Gita - Class 45 - Chapter 4 - Verses 47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BpuDm9MC0Ws)

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and ever more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to shanti gita and we are at the end of the chapter fourth chapter and that fourth chapter i will have two verses left to discuss i will do that first and then go to recapitulate the entire fourth chapter so that we can go to the fifth chapter next day so we have read the other day that econ with the verses we have read the other day there we find that the verse was that ekang maang sangsreid parto saccidanan therefore everyone should take refuge in me only who am i i am not the man as you see i am not the person as you see but i am the sachida i am the absolute consciousness bliss and that unfaltering unchanging reality and i am also lakshan in vedanto we say ahum brahmasmi so what does it mean by your hum saying this this word what does it mean what does it indicate brahman so ahampadhasa the word aham indicates that thing i am that that absolute reality he's telling that i am i and i am um and i am that witness consciousness i am that niskalam there is no color there is no parts partless everything has a part human being having so many parts hand leg eyes ear head the table has a leg hand there's top so part but i am i cannot be divided into parts i am partly absolute so you take refuge or everyone should take refuge in me but don't mistake by me i don't mean you don't should not mean that i am this embodied being that's why we misunderstand the incarnations about ours many people have a big question who is incarnation incarnation is like they look like human being like you and me but no he is not what he is he is saying again and again that a kangmang only surrendered to me alone who is that o parto saccidananam which is sachitananda and which is imperishable truth in abbayam and that which is indicated among the that is indicated by aham in that analysis tattamasi now are that what is that thought i am indicated that what means brahman tom means individual atman this atman is one with the brahman so that indicated by the word what is called the ahampada i am the eternal witness undivided witness and understanding not only this but you have to find the identity with me swat mana brahmaru payna not only knowing god is everywhere you have to know i am that divine the same success so next line is 46 marks we read very important it they have made it separate another vars number he has given first part is ahangpadha and brahmasmi aham as me means i am feel that i ness am-ness that what is aham brahma that eyeness what is that eyeness eyeness is your nature of your atman the self so swathmanam your own self as brahmarupeno you know yourself that you are brahman gatwa and knowing this this is not intellectual knowledge this is the experience so you know me and no no you you know me and know you if you know and this identity you feel there is no difference then get to a mukta bhavar you know you will be totally free from all bondage all suffering all coming and going eternal freedom so this is very important verse ramakrishna says one place you you are to know two things who am i and who are you and what is the relationship it's surprising the exactly the same word sri ramakrishna in the gospel you will find is talking to me vivekananda and others norae and others you have to know only these two things who are you who am i and what is the relationship brahma was me is the relationship thought that r that r means identity so to know this identity is important experience that identity not to feel that you are separate from that our brahman is there i am here that is a duality but you should have to know krishna i have said so much thing but your total freedom will come when you will understand this truth that i am that and you will feel that oh this krishna is brahmana sachidananda abbayo partless and i am that saccidananda one there is no distinction so this should be the ultimate goal now 47 verse which you read today that says 47 de haath rishti desa [Music] m so what he says those who are deho atma obi-wan obi-wan means identification those who identify with the body those people in their vision this always they think this is me and this is mine me and mine and because of that kubudi the bad buddhi wrong understanding gupti means understanding because of this wrong understanding they never know muhammad my spirit which is my spirit which is beyond all on free from all disease disease of worldliness niramaya means one who is sick gets cured is called niramai so so this is very good guidance that's why rama krishna said vedanta is good but not for these people who have the body identity they hath iman it one and they will misunderstand everything eyes they will not understand the real import of i i am brahmana when you say then you think that this body this visible universe what you see it is nothing you are nothing you are not this not these not this you are to be established in that what you are really but those who have strong body identity vedanti is not good for them that's why purify the mind that's why they should be studying bhakti yoga practicing bhakti yoga doing karma yoga bhakti yoga karma jaguar ghana yoga will be coming this intellectual understanding and hana yoga that means they should have to practice long time meditation prayer and karma good karma then chitra should be will happen mind will be purified then and then with the pure mind then one will be able to meditate on god they will be feeling this they it will catch them that i am whenever they say i they will say no no no no it is not this this this physical no no no i am not that it will be they will get in inside it so the atmo those who think that the body is myself real self capital self not more self this tihi with the eyes of notion they ha in the body aham mama sabdata when they use i and me normally i think i means this momo means everything they don't think like that those who are purified they will think i saccidananda not the body not the mind i am that shiva shivoham shivoham now naomi have the de hey in the body hong and momo me and mine idea then kubutri their buddhi is not purified that's why they put these wrong buddhi wrong understanding wrong buddhi no jananti they do not know momo bhabham or namayam they do not know what is my bhavam my spirit which is beyond which is beyond the all sorrows and suffering or all the disease of worldliness my real spirit is beyond all disease of worldliness there is no trace of worldliness what is worldliness world is true whatever in the life situation happening so important not understanding these are all play of maya yeah it is happening we have to act and react but it is not important it is going on like that but it is sachidan to understand that sachidan on the aspect that is called he is not worldly who is worldly who is not worldly being in the world we are all worldly but no there are people who are pure intellect they live in the world but they don't belong to the world they are not worldly they live in the world like a boat lives in the water but water is not in the boat so worldliness this me and mindness oh simple word me and see whole problem of our life spiritual life comes from this identification me and mine me and mine so whenever me and mine is gone then there is no problem problem all problem vanishes me and mine when it goes so this is kubudi they do not know janananti mumma bhavam my bhabham my spirit which is beyond all worldliness so very simple thing it is so the worldly minded people should not read fast vedanta those who are purified little bit by should pure karma selfless service egoless life dedicated to god and by karma by meditation by prayer and devotion they have purified themselves on my then they will be fit to have this vedanta that's why in the um in the study of the vedanta at the very beginning it is said who is a competent student we normally we don't talk of the competent competency of the student we talk about the philosophy too much but we have to understand competency is more important issue what is the competence we repeat many times the scripture said vedanta sarah says who is a competent person he has read all the vedas but the question of few books approximately is that no the entire vedas they have read apart and have understood what is the overall meaning of it why so many languages so many verses so many big ah practice of sacrificial fire these that why it is said for purification of the mind he who understands that apart yes apparently understood not deep that's why he's a student and us in this life and in other life he is free from kamu nishida bharajanapura he does not perform any work with desire material gain he does okay it is to be done done hands up huh so kamu and nisi doyo it is forbidden i should not do there is no such thing he has finished with that that means he does not do negative karma forbidden karma and for the pleasure of god i am doing it for god or it is for selfless activity so so this selflessness should be there otherwise he is not fit to be a student even and not only previous life many previous life he is a good soul he didn't do any um any karma which is entangled with forbidden you should not society prohibits those type of bad karma killing people uh torturing people having indulging into unethical moral unethical lifestyle so these are he is so pure that he didn't do do the other life this life also see if we find such candidate then he will be a good candidate but what to find such candidate that's why it is said those people and then what is left outlander we see apartheid oh he has become very pure very pure nirmala shanto and that is a candidate who is fit to read vedanta so that that means it should be very sincere and pure soul and always think that i am not the body i am seeing it i i am a failure but this is not me i am that pure soul so this should be hammered again and again and again so that's why this is the con this concluding verses 47 saying that he this the vision it is said those who look upon the body as the self think of the body only when they hear sounds like eye and mind always i think whenever i i know this body mind complex mind means which is connected with my my shot my watch my books or my this my that so it is always connected with the physical body mind and his associate things this ignorant people we think like that that's the the movie so this their buddhi is not yet purified because of that they do not know even they see me krishna even rama ramakrishna moves around even buddha moves around this kubudi these people who have this misunderstanding or impure mind not purified yet they know janananti they do not know momo bhabham anamayam what is my spirit who am i really though i am embodied but i am i am beyond the world worldliness that spirit of pure beyond world state of mind that means he is god himself we don't understand sikhi ramakrishna also said hey can everyone understand avatar that's why he occasionally used to ask some of the disciples what do you think about me and to test how much they have understood because he looks like an ordinary person he behaves very ordinarily yes he feels hunger he feels thirsty he sleeps he scolds he is happy he's unhappy sometimes like a child so hide and seek play goes on that's why he says they don't understand they say abu tara always misunderstood in the bhagavad-gita also krishna says says the same thing ignores me misunderstands me abuja timon mura manushing tanumasu why because i have taken a human birth i look like a human being my two eyes my ears my hand my feet i also grow like any baby i also reach our maturity youth i also go and die one day i have disease also so all the human characteristics seeing abujananti these are mura means fools and here they are saying that that person kubuddi his understanding is wrong wrong understanding people are wrong so abujananti because i take partake an ordinary human body manuscript as like a human personality parang bhavam this is the human aspect i have a supreme aspect divine aspect infinite aspect the supreme bob the supreme state supreme mood they do not understand bhutan they do not understand i am the lord of the universe buddha means the created being anything created universe i am the lord of that creation they do not understand that misunderstanding because of their impure mind so bhagavad-gita says the same thing here also same thing and shankaracharya also comments very nicely on these areas that bhagavan that bhagavan sacha bhagavan that bhagavan aju pishon being birthless he has no birth how can he be born infinite can he take a bond but but no adjudication being infinite being birthless of bhayatma which is imperishable nature he's born and he dies no it is opposite of imperishable nature or sacha bhagavan or your vision being birthless as imperishable nature not decaying nation evil he born like any embodied being is born christ also born in a manger so how people will understand he is a god but he is god himself as if he's born from madason jaativo kurban lakshati it is found to act like that by samaya he does it by his own power that is called the maya power by the magical power of maya he the infinite appears to be finite the infinite sky looks like a dome is it dome sky is dome no there is no flat there is no structure like that it's all flat you go as much as you go you will find that it is all straight and flat no but we see the dome but it evokes it seems like that as if he's born like a child he cries and he looks like that sometimes plays like a toy and yes every child is born they are also born like that so they take medicine like us when we have some problem they also go to the doctor rama is known to doctors so many doctors used to visit him so how can you think he is god hey so it is by his own maya but why he takes this trouble is it not a big trouble for a great personality to behave like this that because bhutan krikshaya for out of compassion for the created being because they are in dire darkness to sow them light avataras come that's why they sow light for thousands of years christ is showing light thousands of years buddha is showing thousands of years rama krishna like that they are sowing light he born died but immortal and crucifixion was done and resurrection they are not dead they are eternal so that is the idea kuru the person those who are not purified in mind they don't understand that and that is the repentance of bhagavan krishna here 48 verse that's also the learning running translation will be like that those who look upon the body as the cell big self capital cell atman think of the body only when they hear any sound like eye and mind they think that everyone says i i whenever i say i and your body mind complex mind means it is connected with my body my emotions my intellect no you wrote a line few in article it's a mind article my me mine anyone does something praises it i feel joy how many articles are coming in the world but if i write something someone say oh wow why is he say i am getting appreciation on the online two people have sent appreciation but we are very happy with them and when it was published uh that only swamis were seen not these brahmacharis so uh one of them told them hey come come come our future is published so they came with a lot of interesting [Music] so we are really see every day los angeles times is coming out no i said who pays attention whose name has been mentioned there but suppose one day my name goes over there on that day i was referred in this magazine in this article in this testis and i am very elated so this is always the weakness of human mind that this is the one magazine one page and which line where how many names are coming every day but i think my article my name my little thing my photo has come somewhere as you said the photo story so similarly so this is our weak point it's a de hobimano and this is kubuddi this buddhi is not purified that's why it is taking to wrong direction so it should be in the right direction therefore those who look upon the body as the self think of the body only when they hear sound when they hear sounds like i and mine these crooked-minded people do not know my capital my nature which is free of the disease of worldliness which is free from the worldly disease of worldliness free from the disease of worldliness now 48 verse tom aham [Music] wonderful conclusion this is concluding verse of this chapter 4 but it says caitanya tom you are krishna tells us you are caitanya you are consciousness i krishna i am consciousness everything you see serbum you see it is yours essential nature you say you see this it is nothing your nature your divine nature is here in the form of table it is that same consciousness appearing in so many forms that means this is a very bright and beautiful conclusion was conclusive advice of the fourth chapter arjuna you see not only i am i krishna as such i am also same and servant everything you see look at it swarupam it is your own spiritual nature abu lukyah look at that see that find that it so it is it is the i am telling you this kotitang means i am saying you or i have described it to you gottam the truth this is the truth i am telling you sarbo saharam is the saaram is the essence a sense of everything which is noble and absolute and on uttamum there is no higher knowledge beyond this there is no higher experience than this to feel that i krishna i am caitanya you are chaitanya and everything you see it is that chaitanya and this is the essence of all knowledge and this is the highest and is the final of experience of all stages so look upon you me and every object essentially as your conscious self this is the satchida on the thing you me that's why god here is the unity god the sadhaka and the objective universe jiv jagat ishwar jib is the individual soul jagat is this visible universe and ishara the lord who manifests in the form of avatar all gods and goddesses is sure they are all one and what is that one nothing but that consciousness nothing but that sachidan think this meditate this and feel that here we find that simple question came from or did you know that he is so much believed he is crying for loss of his son of human nu and the what type of advice is given here so where is your son now where are you sound there where are you where who is the slayer who is the slain there's nothing remains it's only chaitanya remains consciousness remains bliss remains and it is you who have become this universe so that is the sorrow sarah means essence conclusive essence of all knowledge and wisdom so look upon you me and every object essentially as your conscious self the big self this is the truth and this incomparably best and the essence of all that i have narrated to you thus far so far from beginning till now put in the fourth chapter i am trying to tell you the same idea again and again that there is no two there is no as there is no two there is no question of loss there is no question of gain if there is only one who will add to that one who will subtract from that one that's why it's still pureness purna mada punamidam this is visible universe is full that which is transcendental that is full that means that is one full two full two infinite how can be two infinity that's why they are expressing these ideas to imprint on our mind that is also one absolute infinite this visible universe is also infinite and if you take out a chunk of infinity from this infinite infinite remains the same so it is it is mathematically now mathematicians accept this philosophy infinity plus infinity is equal to infinity suppose you have two infinities it cannot be then it is not infinity if you say this is infinite and that is also infinite so how can it be infinity infinite word is very small but its meaning is so great and profound so infinite plus infinite remains infinite because there is no two infinite minus infinite not also then why do you say in minus because we have the concept this world we see the world no there is no consciousness for me no consciousness so what is this one it's a part of it so it has come out we say it has come out of that but come out means it is it has become something else this the snake has come out of the rope is there rope at all in the darkness i am crying snake snake has come out from where the same rope which is lying down it has come out of that so if that ask amount of that rope then where it will merge is same so there is no coming going that coming out is all imagination buddhi kubuddi bad buddhi bad understanding wrong understanding so whole life or spiritual struggle is nothing but to purify our understanding correct our understanding that's why here it is said that day and night one should meditate on this idea that i am not the body not the mind ashupty only in the class time but it is all the time every moment to be aware that i am seeing something wrong miss because of my buddhi is not giving the idea me and mine but it is me is also atman and mine that's also atman and that top that is all satman everything is atman and everything is sachidan on them that's why in a and here they have given one word the you me and all objects of of the visible objects are nothing but consciousness itself you have to analyze this again and again and renounce give up which is which is a created something out of elements shanghai we talked about that technical term sankhata means which is a mixture of all these things this body is a mixture of so many things five elements no this object this is a mixture of other elements so everything is a mixture only unadulterated everything is adulterated i know in the world because nothing all this compound mixed mixture of so many items compounded together but only atman is the pure self uncompounded so analyze with that so this is the end of this chapter so if you have any question quickly come out with the question so that we can so the conclusion what we end remember this idea that this is the essential truth bhagavan said here what is that essential truth that is this i am atman you are atman you are consciousness i am consciousness and everything is consciousness look try to look at this world in this view in this in this attitude start seeing god everywhere simply if we say simple another simple language try to see god everywhere in you in the material world and also transcendental world there is only one reality that is the essence of all lessons essence of all teachings okay so we end the fourth chapter here so we'll be uh going to the fifth chapter next day when we start again and if you have questions just quickly we will have sufficient time 15 20 minutes ah yes [Music] krishna [Applause] the question is ramakrishna said for householders to take at least three days now and then to be in solitude focused on the divine does being around people tend to amplify identification with body and personality no yes that is true sri ramakrishna said that look at our life from morning till night we are always thinking of me and mine or my family my business i'll have to go to do this business i'll have to go for shopping i me mine it is it is a part of life we cannot deny that so when shiramakrina says that if and and when we are living in the similar minded people our that thought becomes dominant you go you live with some holy people 10 people living singing bhajan so you forget your highness you forget your miners you forget your family problem when suppose here we have previously we had our kitten kitten days so everyone is coming there whatever their thought as soon as they enter here bhajan is going on participating into that singing that suppose in the evening prayer time we all whatever we do we tune ourselves in that so our highness my meanness mindness is pushed away little bit so that's why when we mix with people of different character our mind gets influenced by that but we have no way out we'll have to live there that's why ramakrishna said you cannot do that totally so at least you can see a difference if you push yourself out and go to some monastery or some resort for two three days separate i am nobody but god i take a spiritually inspiring boy book and you see you have no association to give more panning on the flame of worldliness so that helps that's why uh in insurance you know suggestion is very pertinent to be away from the place even you know if you live at your home and you are very busy and why people try to go out going into the beach why they go to beach and feel a different view of life see the ocean see people are smiling and you may be depressed in your home alone but if you are worldly minded then their worldly thought will be more more gathering in your heart so if opposite way we go to some secluded place beauty of the nature you can see how many birds are chirping you can see their color everywhere you can see a difference so that isolation makes us away from our old rat thoughts of our worldly thoughts me and mine so in that respect it is better if we can get a chance ramakrishna said if you can go go for one month if not for some days if god not one day if not for few hours even that's why our meditation is a good practice in the morning though you are at home or wherever but you are separating yourself from everyone for one hour evening one hour or whatever as much as you can and if you go out of place out of the old place where you live it makes a great difference it is the experience of everybody no even if you go to for few days for san francisco or you are san francisco people comes for few days here no aha one day because this psychology is that you are there you are entangled with your old so many duties responsibilities and other people are talking about the same type of worldly things no and now you just come out and in a different environment your mind feels expanded another question is it true that in case of sadhakas for whom this is their last birth have to suffer for actions for which they don't have any distinct memory probably not even committed in the present birth as most of their if not all karmic account needs to be wiped out yes that is a that's a one type of idea most of us carry that idea we find that holy people many of our shadows not our sadhus so even wondering swamis or great swamis in those who have done extreme spiritual practices in himalayas or in some area they also suffer last part some someone goes very quickly without much suffering but some people lay down quite long time and only what can be explained some karma that is the faith that is the belief that some karma is to wipe out a little remnant is there you should have to clear and as we give the idea of the trajectory idea throwing a stone if in the previous life whatever i have done i have an idea that i will shoot the gun in this angle 38 30 degrees angle from where i am standing no 30 degree you could have changed it to 40 degree also but you decided that that is my target one thought my next life i will be something and that one thought that trajectory that a goal you through the stone it is on going on in this journey what is to happen it happens that's why holy mother said what is to happen it will happen but if you want joy then you will have to repeat the lord's name so that these happenings will not affect your mind so life is like like that is getting accumulated there but also it says what we have done in this life that impact also comes it's a complicated thing complicated complicated we cannot say exactly the prayer of the but also in this life he said our scriptures say if someone does much horrible things very bad things they get their consequence in this life itself or it gets stored up so it is very complicated idea about karma theory but only one theory that this this it is this life as a destination and it will go through the suffering or your train journey you may go to the snow or you may go to the same destination every day train drivers drive the train no for them how many experiences they get some day rain someday frost some day what you call your snow and someday something comes up in the middle here to break make a break so all these experiences come so that is part of life and that karma may be considered as the prayer of the karma we find that mahapurus maharaja shivananda maharaja remain in paralytic condition paralytic condition for a long time swami shivananda high blood sugar and pressure and all these situations ramakrishna himself severe trouble of cancer pain and also yeah i'm talking about them they're they're what you call vicarious atonement that means taking the sin of others these people are pure in soul they eat so much austerity they have nothing any bad karma in their life but still they suffer taking others karma into their full bad karma so this is called the uh karma so you took others karma that is also added you want to power prado that's the question is the problem no they are pure they should not suffer they would have died but this is also included into this plan of his this birth in his planning he has accepted he has come down in this world to do good but that good condition of the good to do good it is incorporated there so we can think that it is proud of the karma but it is anyhow some karma whether you don't understand or not another question who is competing to study and practice vedanta is the path open to all yes path is open to all but we should have to equip ourselves if we don't equip ourselves and even suppose i am not equipped to learn say chemistry i am not that much efficient but i anyway i have my influence i get admitted into the school a phd class no what shall i do if i enter there as a phd student even by who can cook if i have entered i am not competent so i'll be a failure there so that's the point that you always what alternative he is not asking he's asking the vedanta path open to all yes vedantic background you can do karma yoga all you can do that's the best that's the contribution of ramakrishna vivekananda vedanta yeah but karma with vedantic perspective that what swami vivekananda brought it and also bhagavad-gita it is mentioned that karma can with the vedantic perspective you are doing karma it is it is not doing karma you are serving the self your action is the same you are cooking but cooking is i am doing karma cooking karma to please these people this is one idea and i am serving god in me mean me serving god in others so this is karma but it is in a vedantical purified one right actually actually we say i am not the body not the mind i am the atman actually we even could not imagine whenever when your intellect also cannot perceive that to have a clear perception gradually more and more and more purity of the heart is necessary that's why we are even not competent that does not mean that we should not practice it ah we are everyone we as a born when we are born we are we are all competent for studying the classes what we are studying now but we we earn by studying by listening to others by practice so we should practice vedanto but be careful not to misuse vedanta misunderstanding of vedanta that story goes that someone did something wrong and he was caught and he has taken to the court and the judge punished gave some punishment and he said sir i am vedanta i don't do anything i am atman so why this punishment then says i am not giving punishment to the atman i am giving punishment to the person who did whose hand did this whose speech did this so that person i am doing see vedanto applied wrongly but vedanti if you say vedante is everything does not do anything he cannot do bad thing he cannot do good thing it's beyond so yeah and and also what uh this suggestion came that vedanta should not be only not do it it can be a different bhaktivedanta love god all god's form you love and you can do your devotional practice and take the name hindu culture they take in the morning krishna rama govinda kali shiva ramakrishna even in early morning he used to come and uh and then clapping in the hand used to dance and sing all the gods and goddesses name no they so they are not different in a south india also you know many people in the morning they chant so durga ma and then saraswati kali durga different aspects of all the names of different gods and goddesses so bhaktivedanta karma vedanta karma can be applied with vedanta another question is script reading a must can we just perform japan puja with the bhakti and trust religiously can we get the same effect yes scriptural reading is helps us to uplift our mind but if you can do japan meditation that's also good everyone's temperament is not the same someone likes to read books and keep the mind uplifted someone does not but someone does the other way they are practicing worshipping and then they can get the same benefit depending on that temperament distinct memory probably not even committed in the present part as most of their if not all karmic account needs to be wiped out clean distinct no all karmic all karmic accounts of the sanchi that's called accumulated that's a life and life and life infinite store house is there we need not have to bother about that but what what is now acting in this present and with this understanding i am not the body if i can disconnect then this connection will go away then my freedom will come immediately we are not to bother about what is passed what is stored in my bank account i am how much date are they if i disconnect if i declare that i am no more bankruptcy so all goes away of course bankruptcy also just takes away some rights and privileges but you get the highest privilege being one with the brahman and then all your previous loans and interest loan and 10 percent and 20 credit card loan this house rent and this and that bus all gone nothing will be able to touch that is the way okay thank you tomorrow yes tomorrow is our guest swami please attend that swami uh ishat manandaji has come from chicago and he will be giving the evening class on gospel but we'll ask him to also speak something about his work in chicago he's done doing other work also so i would ask ask to you people to join more tomorrow online or in person with with vaccines mask as is our normal protocol we are maintaining so thank you all for joining and mother bless us all om shanti shanti shanti hee hari hum [Music] sri ramakrishna too you
