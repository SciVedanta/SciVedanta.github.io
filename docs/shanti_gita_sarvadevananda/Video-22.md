[19. Shanti Gita - Class 19 - Chapter 2 , Verse 24-27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCJZ93fk0-s)

[Music] [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face on peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to the reading of this wonderful book which is called santigita the song of peace narrated by bhagavan krishna to the disciple arjuna the last time we say read that a student who is very fit student i do know not one mask is there can you bring it and give it to you go straight straight behind the chair the relax racks so it has been said that it has been said that a student competed student who is pure in heart who is practicing discipline the special respect whose mind is controlled who has deep faith and respect for the teacher spiritual teacher and the scriptures which are the revelation of the truth this type of genuine student then he should approach his spiritual teacher and this spiritual teacher then the spiritual teacher will then approaching the spiritual teacher then they will go and please the spiritual teacher because this treasure is in his hand it is not the book knowledge but it is the knowledge from this life to life so the spiritual treasure which the guru is embodying then he converts it to his disciple through the mantra and other practices or so we have read the other time that the sri guru kripayashi sturridge sangsaravadim the guru the giver of the wisdom and knowledge will be able to help us to cross the ocean of this birth and death and suffering and pain and and it is so important that spiritual teacher is an important factor in spiritual life without vena asharjam without any ah without any spiritual teacher no he ganum knowledge cannot be done in the heart of the person no mukti no question of freedom is possible gotti neither one can reach the highest level of spiritual truth therefore one student's duty should be prajat natubi dwan david don means the intelligent student he will serve the teacher to please now with the bhajji said now the books are available online and so accessible but in previous time in the earlier days the guru used to know the entire scriptures and you know the entire meaning of the scripture and then he meditated and prayed and in his life those knowledge was manifested so it is all in the brain of or in the mind of the teacher so if guru is pleased then say via some prasadan atma if one that guru feels that is a real student genuine student wants to really have the wisdom and knowledge so he becomes pleased and then teach the student what he will teach that is the vedanta essence of the vedantic teaching that what you are analyze neither you are the body because body is changing if you are the body how the body will be unchanging then so it is body is changing it cannot be you you aren't always no we always feel i i in the i in the childhood i in the young age i in the now so all true there is consciousness i consciousness behind that i cannot be this changing body because from our childhood time till now the body has changed so much so i am not the body i cannot be the body but i am the witness of the body i see i have a body i stand before the mirror i see myself i see my hair start getting gray it was black so change has happened i'm not the same guy body is changing medically body is changing so i cannot be the body but i am in the body i am somebody who is separate in the body this our room house we enter into the house house becomes old but the person who enters he can give up the body that that house enter into another house so this body is like a house so i'm not the house but i'm the indweller in the house i am somebody who dwells inside i am not the senses i see through the eyes but i don't see always to the eyes i close my eyes and i also in mental level i see something in dream i see so many so i'm not the body not the mind not the senses nor the emotions so what am i then the bedam the guru will teach my boy my girl this is you are not the body you are not the senses you are not your mind you are not your intellect it is not your ego but behind that ego that eternal consciousness the sakshi drastica the witness that you are come and that you is not mortal that is sachidan is the ocean of bliss that is the consciousness that is the reality so you are that reality eternal there now no change happens the body changes you see your body is changing you see in your when you close your eyes and see how mind is going here and there so you are the observer of your mind like that you are the observer of your understanding you are the observer of your pet ego you say oh i was so deluded that time that i now i understand it is not so so i is also an observed ob thing to the observer which is called sakshi eternal witness that is the vedanta says it is the cosmic consciousness which pervades everywhere so that is the substrate unlike the ocean is such a devotion of bliss and uh consciousness and all the ripples and waves billions and millions of ripples and waves like we are like one bubble bubble bubble yes some is becoming big some is dying some is born so these are all play of the water waves are happening and but the ground is the ground of all waves at the ocean of consciousness ocean of bliss on ending there is no end of it body can come body can die mind may be up today tomorrow may be depressed understanding is clear today tomorrow foggy my ego today is high up tomorrow it gets day down so these are all controllable item but i am not controlled by anything so this knowledge will come if there is no obstacle he says pratibhanda kasuna saganum that knowledge that i am that infinite ocean of love and consciousness buttless deathless am i the body dies body comes my mind is sometimes high or low emotions are sometimes working but not i am not ishan doshta i am the witness i am the observer of all these things so i am that eternal this word should come out of the mouth of the guru and guru when he tells to the student if the student is just ready in one stroke when they hear in that moment illumination will come and shruti mata as soon as he hears from the guru he will understand that he is top quality of student like ramakrishna heart from tutagori thou are that you are that that reality that sachidan that ocean of bliss that consciousness are you as soon as he had his mind shoot up and he went to samadhi you know so this is for the top grade student so pure that they can instantly understand no no no i'm not i am never the body i am just dwelling in the body i am just observing my mind observed object is always called matter this is i am observing table is jorah matter i am conscious entity who is observing the table similarly mind is i'm observing so observer is the conscious entity and this is matter so this is the regular analysis but this advanced student is so advanced that it does not need anything say instantly once he hears this and then immediately then his knowledge will be down in him so that we read last time after verse 23. now today we are reading 24th what does it 24 say [Music] suppose someone is not that much advanced and that person has what there is some obstacle because mind is clouded mind does not accept this truth suppose we are talking all our mind it's not easy to accept this truth what type of talk you are you are describing i am not the body i am the atman i am this president body mind and i am seeing i am infinite we have many obstacles body identity we are identified with our material things money wealth and our mind is distracted mind is not pure but when mind will be pure by daily analysis analysis analysis then we'll come second grade of student yoga reflection what i read just now i'm not the body not the mind i'm the observer of the body i'm the observer of the mind i'm observing my intelligence understanding i say my intelligence i got puzzled yesterday i could not get the point now i got it that means you are observing your intellect the ability of the intellect so you are observer observer observer so when this analysis it will not happen for us we are doing for so many years 20 years 30 years 40 years we are doing 50 years still if you we have not the experience why because there is some obstacle so so if by manana reflection what we have just discussed sit quietly and think really am i the body or am i the observer of the body am i the mind i am so much depressed oh life is meaningless i am worthless guy i will die today what is my life value you are telling talking to your mind mind is nonsense the same mind gets elated he said hey i am the lord of the world i can do i can change i can kill somebody i can conquer a country all big people did like that no it is the play of the mind i am not the mind i observe my mind so analyze analyze and reflect and reflect deeper reflection and you are to be convinced yes it is a matter mind is a matter your intellect is a matter your ego is a matter analyze analyze analyze that's why it's called manana reflection reflection yogina with the help of this analysis needed the astronaut and deep reflection contemplate i cannot be the body i am the witness of the body this will be so convincing that when you water this world you will feel yes i am the observer i am not the body so this concept when it becomes again and again by practice of repeated deep reflection and contemplation when prativandaksha when the obstacle which is between it is like the truth is here and i am here but because there is a blockage i don't see the truth there is this suppose this temple where there is a wall it is an obstacle i cannot see what is beyond but there is space there are things but the obstacle is not allowing me to see but you by refine make it refined it is a solid wall now by reflection by contemplation you refine refine the wall becomes thinner and thinner and thinner it becomes like a glass when it becomes glass you are convinced yes i see the light there but still there is a difference a level of separation is there that's called sabi alpha samadhi or that that breaking that should also be broken let's see to reach the absolute knowledge of self so but it should happen for the second category of people who have done this not for reading the book not attending the classes only but only seeing one's haha it is a good idea no it becomes a serious thing of our life that you find sadhus in the himalayas or in even in many traditions many people day and night thinking like that that major thing that to solve the mystery of life who am i that is the question and that goes on if one contemplates regularly reflects on this deeply and regulates and when the mind becomes cleaner and cleaner and cleaner of the dirt and dust of attachment and other things of the world the truth will reveal spontaneously because it is here it is like a bulb 1000 watt bulb is covered by some two three layers of clothing darker clothing different colored or black something so that the internal light does not come out but remove that by contemplation by reflection one by one one by one one by one buddhist i'm not this i'm not this i'm not this go on go on day and night every breath try to think like that then this obstacle will be released and then prativan daksai when this obstacle will go away suppose the wall is gone what will happen [Music] knowledge will be spontaneously manifest the bulb which was light always emitting light if the obstacles are gone the light will shine in its own way we are not too we dualistic religion says call upon god god will come when o lord when will you come before me vedanta says god is with you are you ignoring him you don't look at him he's here without that you cannot talk you cannot smile you cannot move your hand you cannot blink an eye you cannot breathe and you are saying oh lord where are you when shall i you are ignoring that to this analysis you have to do day and night so i am evil it will be spontaneously it will be revealed the truth that you are such and under that knowledge will dawn so this verse 24 his translation is otherwise for the next category of student first category of student srobonomatra as soon as they hear from the guru's mouth they're so pure soul that instantly they go into samadhi means instant experience that i am neither the body not the mind i am that conscious only the deep dive deep into the consciousness and blissfulness their eternal life but next category they are saying that otherwise for the next category of students knowledge comes forth of its own we are not to cry for god to come god rather says i am here look at me who is looking him at him we are always looking this our life's values are where everything in the external is our values where is the value of what is inside so that's why it says that the second category of students knowledge you need not have to bring anywhere it is here but it is obscured and the false knowledge giving the idea it will not only obscure the real knowledge but it is creating a false knowledge that i am the body all of us no one needs to prove that i am the body everyone says i am the body no one needs any proof there's a wrong perception that vedanta says ignorance and it's called the maya in another term abhidyah these are technical terms but very simple formula this ignorance has make me forget my real identity and not only it has created a false understand misunderstanding but has created a new concept i am the body for it has to function it has covered my real nature i am absolutely pure soul birthless deathless eternal that he has covered not only that he has created a misconception i am the body and that's why our scriptures give the very beautiful example very old example snake and rope in the darkness we go and we put our pit on the rope and we cry out oh snakes next snake we cry out but when he cry out and when he run away the rope remains the rope the rope concept is covered due to ignorance darkness that is the ignorance when you bring a flashlight then you see it's a rope what a fool i was i was crying touching the rope thinking it is neck so this is the abhorrent and big shape these are two functions of maya or ignorance ignorance covers what is there and it creates generates a false thing and proves that you are that so these are the things when it will be gone from your by your spiritual practice by your repeated analysis how can i be body which body you are talking about if you say yesterday's body is not today and i am the body which body you are talking about 10 years before your body that is your body or someone's body what about when you are five years old when you are one year baby what that body where is the body which body you are talking about two days body by that time you are talking about one click second body is changed so which body you are talking about that means day and night if some people analyze like that they'll be convinced really we are standing on some fictitious idea as buddhism says now you a ball of fire connected with a piece of rope or string and wheel around what happens it makes a creative idea of a circle ball of fire circle of fire actually it is ball of fire but it it makes it circle of fire fan is a close example when the fan is rotating in the highest speed sometimes you don't see any flight m blade but it is the blade rotating giving an appearance that there is no blade at all so this is the concept misconception so when these will be eradicated when the obstacles are destroyed by combined practice of reflection and contemplation again and again then the knowledge will dawn spontaneously what a beautiful it seems so easy solution solution is very easy easy to handle you have to do nothing just day and night analyze that you are not this not this not this huh but you have to hear it from your guru because that power transmits from there it is not just not reading a book you can do all these things ah so you will have to have this awareness that a spiritual teacher who can transmit this energy in you therefore we go to guru so that is the point 24th verse now let us go to the next verse 20 person [Music] bismuth so what is the beautiful conclusion shri krishna the lord krishna is giving telling to arjuna you have forgotten like it is an example bismitham which you have forgotten bismita means forgotten you have forgotten that sarupam tattro loved yatta suppose you have a a chain or alcohol called a bracelet and you have forgotten sometimes it happens no we are searching where is that we search for our eyeglass what is eye i i am i what did i keep it by that time your audience is already here so we do these mistakes so loved our so when somebody says hey why are you searching guru will say hey here is your bracelet then you find joy but what for joy comes it was yours it was yours it was with you all the time only you become aware ah i i lost you didn't lose anything the chain or the bracelet was all the time with you the eyeglass was always in your eyes you thought that you have lost it and you are searching here and there and your guru comes a teacher comes or somebody who is your friend comes says ari what are you searching for i'm searching for my eyeglass then says what is this that's that is it pus in one word but there are many doubting my mind that doubting mind will say no no no how can it be it is not my eyeglass you can argue sometime as much as the darkness so the second category student third category student fourth category student will be according to the doubts after according but doubt should be there until you realize the truth and until your analysis is very clear and perfect so this vidanti is in one sense is a very powerful tool which gives us all responsibility on ourselves you do this and you get it you think this way you will be clear in your mind it will not come from heaven suddenly some ghost will not stand here to appear before you it is you you you are the consciousness you have forgotten yourself you only see what you are by correct analysis correct analysis so as you as people's normal example that there is a bracelet and the search for here i lost it why did i keep it inadvertently i lost it and crying and weeping we are also crying and weeping like that where shall i get joy who can give me joy who can remove my suffering i am in such a miserable state we are like that same lost your what you call the bracelet then the guru comes with the with the knowledge that saying guru is knowledge guru comes and then gives their direction think this way why are you doubting touch it you can touch it hold it if it's much deluded people you know psychologically when you you see many people who are suffering from uh psychiatric and psychological problems they have created some fantasy in their mind and they live in that fantasy how much you tell them no no nothing has happened why are you thinking this no this is a good proof that in how we are deluded in our knowledge of the truth it is impractical you go to this psychiatric hospital and see people they have created some because of some reason but somebody has said something somebody has done something these are arguments you created a concept that you are this and you cannot get out of that and what the psychiatrist do they want to bring you back to your awareness no no no this is your misconception nothing happening to you you are strong i have seen people very powerful strong physically they become so weak when psychologically depressed yeah i saw him coming from one step to other like a child pushing and pulling one step as if he has no power to stand up and come down the steps so weak we become this is a gross example how our mind gets deluded and we are misconception takes possession of us like a ghost and does not leave us so that's why to drive out that ghost we will have to work hard this psychological depression comes in one lifetime for some reason after few years and this depression that i am worthless i am nothing i am body i am mind i am emotion it has been gathered through lives and lives and life's experience that's why it has become deep rooted so deep rooted you have to upload that that's why you go to the psychiatrist what they talk what what the treatment they make you talk and understand what is go on what has happened to bring out to bring out to bring out to bring out no vedanto says yes why to work that way in one stroke say yes get out you are not that i am that and there are great brilliant examples of vedanta now sami bibekananda is a great example buddha christ these are the examples brightest example in the world yes they have achieved that when crucified then he can say bless o lord bless them they do not know what they are doing no forgive them so they can say that and in one pin little needle lip is punched into my finger what i i cry out that means they are not the body by crucifixion christ proved that he is not devotee he is not the mind he is not the emotion he is the self athman absolute that is the proof he has given so all the great souls have proved it so it is not a just concocted story of some fantasy some people are sitting and idol thinking hahaha and many people think idol thoughts it is not idle thinking it it becomes a reality and you see people those who day and night think their facial expression their movement in utter distress in outer condition they are powerful because they are connected with the power within so this can be practiced as our daily sadhana so he's giving the example as bismitang sarupam for getting the nature of the like a chomika jamaican chamicar means like a bracelet forgotten it is you think that you got it back you are happy your last thing has been gained now wow what god's grace it was there you you forgot so when you get it back similarly bismitam you have forgotten your divine entity your beyond body mind you are the absolute source of bliss and joy why did you forget that and when you remember bismi tang and then when you know that dr when you attend that krita to paramount you'll be feeling ah i am fulfilled i don't need anything of the world i don't care for anything in the world who will come to praise me who will come to hate me who will chop my head down or who will praise me to the highest heaven i don't have any change in me i have understood i am fulfilled i don't need any money i don't need many house i don't i am so big that what money what pleasure what thing can be given i am the source of all joy you'll feel that you are the supreme bliss that this you cannot imagine what the worldly bliss worldly joy we get it's a tiny it's like a sand dust and it is like a huge star ourself we cannot compare anything at that moment when you just understand that krista you feel fulfilled you feel that you are the supreme ananda you become mukta you become totally all free from all obstacles touchstone at that moment so what a great calling for us that's why the upanishadic sages when they realized this out of joy they said he listen to me he people of the whole in heaven and earth listen to me i have realized that truth which is beyond all darkness you are also same you are the child of immortality i have known that truth will be to utter by knowing which you can cross ocean of birth and death this suffering this absolute misery i have known that come come it is your property you also know that's the call of dupunishadic sages so that gave given by sri krishna here to arjuna and this has a strong dose medicine no when you are in crisis doctors keep heavy dose medicine no not not 25 mg it goes to 25 mg 50 mg 100 mg you know so it is a strong dose medicine vedanta is a strong dose medicine why it will not be not not done not depending on anything but depending on your what the talent you have into intelligence analysis like a scientist be like a scientist to understand your divine self so that's why you will be quite arthur so arjuna said krishna said oh you know you will be totally free from so i'm reading the writing translation as one feels happy when one finds on his neck or so gold that was forgotten in the same manner the person who has accomplished his goal or found his real self attained supreme bliss and total liberation at that very moment then you are totally free who can mind you that same story he repeated again and again the alexander the great went to india and he was taken to see something which is the greatest miracle of india what is that so he was taken to so a monk and the monk was in the himalayas what is his position he is nothing in his position he's a lion cloth and he is lying in a rock bathing sun someone he does not care for anything where food who will feed will come and alexander went and seeing this austerity he was moved he said sir i like to ask you to come to my palace i'll keep you with honor and dignity there then that that penniless guy had the courage to say hey get out of my way why are you talking like that i am sunbathing why are you disturbing me huh and alexander got angry no he showed himself do you know who you are talking with i can kill you then the sadhu the holy man laughed burst into laughter and said ye you kill me me this medi me the fire cannot burn air cannot dry sword cannot cut i am worthless deathless and alexander was ward by the point of death yeah one can say like that there are great examples like that swamiji told about one story that one while he was moving in the walking in the forest and he found that one sound is coming so hum i am that i am that i am that so hum so hum so whom and he found that in the deep gorge one tiger has caught a monk and his head is like that neck is caught and caring to eat and at that moment this this holy man is saying i am that i am that i am that it's not a story it is really to understand how profoundly is this knowledge which can give up such a strength in the face of death and deathless i am deathless i am fearless but how much we say we have our question but but for us but we know but we are weak no so now but you know hearing all this powerful message what you know now puts this question what a question question is arjuna is a student and krishna is the teacher here bhagavan krishna jiva karta sada bhakta [Music] means individual also you me these are jiva we are called individual souls individual i have i have an individuality you have any newly what is the individuality your mind your emotions your ego is different from my emotion my ego my understanding so but kathman is the same here and there the outer costume is different but inner power or the truth is the same but here is the question jiva i is a karta i know i am doing i am lecturing i am reading i am talking i i i i am the karta so jiva karta and i am bhokta i enjoy i enjoy the fruits of my actions i enjoy the food we prepare and eat so i eat i enjoy i suffer i i i am the bhokta i enjoy all these things i am the karta i am the lord i am the master i am in charge here i so i i i i i but brahman you said niskriam brahma does not do anything cosmic consciousness it is there there is no function in cosmic consciousness brahma does not do anything maya when it comes ignorance comes then the place starts so these are two we cook two different things jivo as individual i am my ego i am eating i am sleeping i am doing i am working i i'm working hard i'm relaxing i i i i i this is individual soul and brahman in israel it does not do anything it is beyond all action action is in maya not in brahman so we could annum you are telling that you think that you are one i am that no i am that vedanta says you aham brahma was me i am brahman that is the meditation vedantic meditation is think i am not this not this what i am i am that sachin it is negation and also assad asserting positivity so this two way we meditate one way meditation is not this not this not this that is buddhism and ultimately what is remains it cannot be said here it says no what is remains vedanto one that is the difference that there is some ultimate reality which you cannot erase out you can erase out everything but you cannot erase out that which by which your all knowledge comes to you you can erase your you are not the body because in the deep sleep you will raise out your body identity you erase out your mind because in you know deep sleep you have no concept dream time you have your mind and dysfunction when you go to deep sleep you erase your body you raise your mind you engage your emotions and everything is gone but still one thing remains i remain but who says i had a good sleep that eye is the big eye the conscious eye that you cannot release you cannot go beyond behind that you can peel off the waking state experience you can peel off the dream state experience you can stand in the deep sleep experience but who sees the deep sleep i am sleeping how do you say i had a sleep good sleep last night who has seen that unless there is an observer you cannot express that as experience you ate your breakfast then you can say yes i had my breakfast is it not even if you have not the breakfast you know i had not the breakfast to know something there is an observer not to know that there is an observer so how can you deny that observer there is nobody to deny that so that is the atman so here it says you are saying but i understand myself that i ego i do is my consequence i did this bad karma if i'm suffering or somebody did something to me i am suffering or this is my joy this is my achievement this is my accomplishment i i i i i am that karta bhakta i am always the enjoyer and it is and you are saying brahman is without any action without any desire without any fulfillment toyo we come how these two opposite thing can be like how it will be what because they are like darkness and light you are saying it is brahman is not no not functional and i am that how can you be i am always bubbling i'm speaking i'm dancing i'm singing i'm happy i'm unhappy this guy how can it be brahman we should have no action so understand the very pinpointed question brahman has no functionality it is there only and i as i understand till now i am always having some function action or feeling our emotions and this experience also i enjoy i suffer i get it i lost it always is there how these two thing actionlessness and action how can they be equal you are saying they are you know that you are that how can i know that because they are opponent bhavit [Music] i am i take refuge in you i am your student i beg your kindness to remove my doubt sangsayang sangshaya means doubt that i being doing everything and brahman does not do anything how can it be doing person will be non-doing so this is my doubt ethan may sanctions sanctions means the doubt cindy cut it you are the teacher please cut my ignorance destroy my ignorance cindy i am you may say why shall i do you i am your child please help me i take refuge in you proper no home that's the fundamental question a student should be humbled before the teacher it is not like going to shopping place no you get go with 100 and use just hey give this give this give this this is your hundred dollar you cannot purchase like that it is spiritual wisdom so it should come by the grace of guru so he's saying tuang bina i am totally surrendering at your feet tuangbina without you duangbina bina sangsa chetta there is nobody to cut this doubt of mine there is no teacher who whom i can approach you are the best teacher you are the lord of the world you know everything yeah so please teach me no there is nobody question minister i am sure about that there is no one who can help me in this utter distress so please try to clear my doubt so that is the question on verse number 27 so i am reading the translation here then we can go for the question answer no question oh no question today okay okay let me finish this oh ya means oh krishna the individual soul is always the doer the enjoyer as we are whereas brahman the supreme self is actionless given the incompatibility being opposite nature how is the knowledge of oneness between them is possible oneness comes equality this is also same this is also same but here i means doing action ego pride all these are there and brahman is beyond all action all expression that these two opposite thing how they can be equal so then 27 verse 8 on may sung just i read this is my doubt o arjuna there is no other than you who can destroy this doubt for me i have taken refuge in you please remove this doubt totally from me so once students should go and search for a teacher who really have practiced and have experienced something they can really remove the doubts of others say ramana morsi you all know baal secretary and what is the name of other so many non-dualistic teachers and dualistic teachers you go who have experience to go to them and they have given illumination understanding to many people like that so this is the two questions here now the vasudeva vasudeva means krishna now krishna will be answering those questions so we shall read those next time verse number 28 will start where this question put by arjuna will be replied by the lord krishna so we'll do that next day so we end here first and then we go to the question answer om shanti shanti shanti harihat sri rama krishna too okay so there is some question we will go to that you can see these verses and all original verses what i chanted on your vedanta.org when you go yeah vedanto.org shanti hyphen gita there you can find all the verses which i read i read the verses of which chapter 2 dot 24 25 26 27 okay so question has come so by surrendering this i ego will have the experience of that witness but how to have that witness state though looks easy is difficult indeed of course you got the question the question is that so we understand now if i can by surrendering this i the small i this i which will die when i die this eye i am so proud of my eye when i die no one will remember me few days ahaha he was a good guy or he was a bad guy or some place some blame no after five years right 10 years 20 years if you're a big big guy you'll be 20 years 30 years 40 years maybe after 100 years but infinite span of time of millions or billions of years what is that so this tiny eye will be forgotten by so by surrendering the small eye ego will have the experience of that witness yes if we this ego goes then what will remain if my ego goes what remains of me ego goes means i have no identity with the body body also is not though it is there see some people who are mentally up they have no idea of their body they cannot keep the mind in the body so body is there but he does not feel it is his body so that experience of that witness and as he said who is the witness consciousness going back and back and back and back that is i'm saying back and back it's in the words i'm to say something in words space if i divide space like that go back and back and back and find the space what does it mean space is space you cannot get it out get out of it so but how i am coming but how to have that witness state no no you need not have to have that witness state you analyze the way just to learn that i am not the body not the mind very deeply deeply deeply then you can see who is observing this body who is observing this mind who is observing this understanding who is observing my small ego as i said in the deep sleep when you are coming out of the deep sleep you feel that you slept well who observed that sleep i observe no but that eye is not the small eye small eye is dead because deep sleep you have no idea that you are there at all it has been observed by somebody else third party other than your this ego what i am now this ego somebody have observed that and that knowledge comes speculates to my small ego then i say oh oh i ate and i was happy why do you feel so happy tell me in deep sleep you are not eating ice cream yeah your body should not say i was happy because i ate something you are not seeing any beautiful flowers or garden or anything nothing was there but you are feeling greatest joy where the joy comes from that eye which is behind the eye so that witness is a state it is there now at this moment i'm talking i am feeling i'm when i'm in frustrated mood when i'm in an angry mood whatever situation happens this consciousness is all there i cannot be angry without that consciousness dead body cannot be angry angry dead body cannot be loving dead body cannot be hating that body cannot come with a gun to kill somebody dead body cannot give his life for saving someone that is the point that consciousness is always there that's why it will spontaneously come but how to have that witness means we are this is the policy has been mentioned in the vedantic paul policy of analyzing analyzing elijah so yes you are very correct though looks easy is difficult indeed we are trying that for last 50 years 60 years in our life so we have to do it continuously follow until technical i'm asking everybody what weakness indicates there is a action aspect in the right in the consciousness but i think similar to what arjuna says there's no consciousness so more than witness i mean it seems like the right way to explain is it enables this experience but it's not really a witness itself exactly experience that there is no other experience good good you have got the right point i am using the term witness witness witness who will say witness if there is only one then who will be the witness now i am in the body mind so that you become witness witness witness we are using the term witness we will have to use to make us understand to go for the original witness as if this witness is there is another witness and thought we know ultimate witness is only one witness when it reflects to our ego ego gets illumine ego becomes the boss when his power transcends it is like any government ah we see latest thing the president's power is the president is the here suppose the big eye the brahmana you go down one step his power comes to the next he's what you call the next vice president or some some next next next next powerful powerful power they are big powers but all power is because of the president or that is the cumulative power of the whole humanity or the citizens of the country so cumulative totality is the brahman you cannot say it witness you cannot see who is witness or it is the observer or you cannot say it is brahman you cannot say it is absolute when you say something you are making duality but we have no other way to express that's why the the sages have taken this terminology they have they're using this terminology just to make us understand who don't have an idea of that absolute truth so this language is also creates confusion now another question in the sense of ego is the transition from worldly desire to realization results in expansion of the ego limited to unlimited or does it mean the destruction of the ego that means how the ego this question is that ego if we consider the word ego is the transition from worldly desire world ego to divine ego or it is total annihilation it is it is only language our ego identity expands more and more and bigger that's why we say some people can understand self-lessness is god as i forget my ego and i extend my ego with 10 people my ego has expanded if it goes to 20 people it is much expended 100 people thousand people christ buddhas ramos krsnas ramakrishnas vivekananda they identify with the whole world that's whole world suffering anywhere they are suffering he feels the suffering anyone enjoy he feels the joy that is total identification of our eye so i expands like that as we move in our spiritual life this i sense our ego it is not transition from the worldly there is nothing worldly it is all permeated by that consciousness as we expand that understanding will come everything is permitted with joy and bliss everything is divine the ugliest thing to the holiest thing because but we cannot say it now because i am in a state of duality and i should not destroy this conception by forcefully wrong analytic analysis in the real analysis when you are expert then you will see only god is manifesting as good as bad as holy as unholy but that is too far to go and that is the expansion of the heart that's why we find that christ and buddhas and ramas and krsna's they don't care in their eyes right the prostitute to the holiest person they treat them all equally because they see that oneness so ego expansion is the right way could you please speak a little about why we have taken incarnations was this about learning what we have been all along yes you have got the response he is saying can you tell me a little why we have taken this body why we are incarnated why we are we were infinite so why did you come to the finite and why did you enter into this play of maya you have no demand because you are full in vedantic self or brahman you are already full but why do you come back again in the body oh there is no reason i give the example suppose after working whole week people are tired no moment to look at anything else weekend comes the plan to go for 500 mile away and driving driving driving and taking the stress of driving and then where to stay these that why they do they find joy in that it's for fun our scriptures say jivan mukti sukha prabhti haita bhejjanmun haritam to understand what we are we have forgotten in the turmoil of this duality or we are very happy happy people sometimes go for something for fun no as i is giving the the person who what whole week weekend could have been okay i won't go anywhere i'll eat sleep very well and restfully see they watch the television and enjoy why are you taking trouble to go for a cross country what you call that skiing and falling down and breaking your arms you didn't plan to go to break your arms it's not fun you are bored as you try but in vedanta there is no boredom don't think brahman is bored because it is all joy there is no such example but we may think that he was happy why he take this trouble he took this trouble because you want to come out of it to have experience to what he is to experience sometimes it is called fun that's why ramakrishna said god's play going on why it is who will say that we do not know another question sometimes we see we are not the body mind but from inside someone forces us to do or think which we do not want to do things how can we stop that thinking and think i am the witness that is your response is that how sometimes you think i am i we are not the bodybuilding sometimes we as we at this one hour we are thinking that we are not the body it makes sense no after this discussion but as i just i'll close this chapter book and then get out i know i am the body so what is the use of this this how to get out of it how to get out of it as by one hours in money in depth study we can feel a little touch of that bodylessness if we can increase it day and night it will be automatically that concept will enter into it our misconception will go away it is called by a needle you by a thorn you pull out the thorn we are pricked by ignorance thorn you take a thorn of knowledge this is the knowledge town we are talking so long take that and use this medicine all the time pull out pull out pull out that means you have to day and night think this truth if you are a follower of vedanta you will have to think not on the class time not in the work money when you are really relaxing in between your work you have one minutes time you think oh i am doing the work but it is your body mind doing i am the atman i am the self so it should be enter into every thought process in our body and mind then it will be one day by god's grace it will be released by guru's grace okay thank you another question uma so this is the last question okay i don't mean again bhakti margot okay in bhakti margo different lokas are mentioned where jiva go after death what is the adult view of what happens after death is there any kind of identification left yes if you are totally free from ignorance then you need not have to go any other plane but if you are not completed you have done so much with your austerity and purity you live in a higher plane higher plane higher plane it is very natural as if you are going with a rocket and to go outer space so in a zone outer space in the absolute zone so if you go yes there is different planes and you can view the things differently so yes at the point the ordinary jiva according to their spiritual practice someone is thinking of god as krishna the sachidan has come to me as krishna yes if they think day and night is krishna krishna so the name and form and this they will after they reach that flight where they will this embodied reality they will go that is called the krishna loka vishnu loka like that but those who are realized here as absolute i am that infinite they need not have to go anywhere that's why they say they attain all everything here and now okay so the no contradiction bhakti yoga and gyanojaga no contradiction ganoji is talking about the climax identification bhakti-yoga also says when you think of your ishta and you get merged into it totally you lose yourself totally and then you see it is no more form the form melts into the infinity so there is no difference in it okay thank you all for questioning and being with us mother bless you all and tomorrow is swami sharma will be speaking but as you know our we are restricted
