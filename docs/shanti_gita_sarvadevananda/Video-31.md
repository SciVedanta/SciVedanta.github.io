[28. Shanti Gita - Class 28 - Chapter 3 , Verse 20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGXG-FmR3nI)

[Music] [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face o peace peace peace be unto us all so welcome to santi gita and we have read the other day verse number 19 but what did he read probably forgot that's why let us recapitulate what we read here arjuna in the verse number 16 of the last reading said in the third chapter the kaamaya you are talking about maya what is that maya which is adhood which is very unusual kaabita and what is the ignorance individual what is called cosmic maya what is mahavida with the technical term which is called jeebus which is the cause of the birth of this individual soul [Music] nitya eternal ba [Music] or otherwise it is an it is real or unreal real like this it is real or it is means nature of these two what are the two maya and abita that was the question and then sri bhagavan was then see krishna responded in verse number 17 srino listen mahada bhuta maya maya is extremely surprising or wonderful wonder wonderous satadi that is made of the three gunas associated with the trigunas maya means maya is equal to sattva plus rajas plus thomas these are all made of the trigonas if the three gunas are not there maya is not there so this whole world is a play of trigonas maya satyadi trigna [Music] some say that it is it seems to be there but it is not there they say [Music] that a wonderful cosmic maya is the three qualities and is said to be without beginning utpatirahita there is no beginning you go back when the maya started when this cosmos came i saw when i was born i see my father my grandfather his grandfather great grandfather great great great grandfather find out you don't find where it started which day maya started in brahman we do not know in the beginning beginning at the same time moisture gekko and it is there eternally you know everyone sees the same this same world is there same world maybe you say that it is not the same because it is changing but apparently it looks like the same same sun i saw yesterday today the sun yes someone may analytically say no no it is not the same sun because so much of energy has been dissipated but for me for my little mind and little personal personality these are all they are eternally as it were so this is the way we read but why it is happening then we read the verse number eighteen opposed to gustavo bhatu almost it is not there not the but it appears as opposed to that non-substantial appears to be substantial non-existent appears to be existing in the common example you see the water in the mirage so when you travel in a desert area you see the all water water and it's called the horin the deer they run to drink water in the scorching sun they exhaust their all energy to get some drinking water thinking i see the water there and they go to find the sand hot sand so it is obvious to it is not there most of advanti but it appears that as if the water is there as that example is also this this is real i see you're making noise but when you go to sleep is it there for you when you go to deep sleep even if you go to dream this does not exist for you this reality this pain pleasure anxieties worries whatever we have now here gone so it is fictitious sometimes it is here sometimes not there so of us because it is standing on the bush is brahman there is something there is sand hot sand what you are seeing is water because without sand you cannot see that there is the watery reflection that means there is something that is called brahman that is the satya that is the essential truth it all these are appearances and these are like a mirage sword asadam can you say maya is there well yes i see how can i say it is not there can you say it is not yes it is not because when you experience all these sages who have experienced brahman atman my vanishes for them there is no existence of maya they see only god they see only brahman everywhere so sadas therefore you cannot ascertain it you cannot say positively this is this that is that it is not definable positively definable it is not positively definable [Music] it has an end because whenever you have knowledge comes in your mind knowledge dawns you have the wisdom brahma ghana comes knowledge of the self comes on top this maya ends this ignorance ends santa that's why it is unreal inexpressible and it has an end sha anta exist in the form of reality what appears it is real it is so real so brahma can you see that it is permeated with consciousness god simple language they see god everywhere and we ignorant people we see god nowhere so it is the play of why do we do is we play up avid or maya and last verse 91 19 first we read it says we read it 19 last time again emphasizing this maya it is brahma austria it is taking refuge in brahman all the waves and ripples have taken refuge in the ocean so brahman astraya it has taken refuge in brahman brahma australia chidvishaya its subject is consciousness it is consciousness brahma master holding on to the brahman chit beshaya who's filled his consciousness itself brahma shakti it is the power of brahman brahma means it is the power of whom when creation is not there the shakti remains hidden when someone is big singer great singer sitting before us does not sing the singing ability is hidden there brahma aswaya that person have that singing art or the [Music] ability chimney brahma had this power of projection but sometimes it does not snake sometimes coils and rolls down and stays there a snake sometimes moves but the coiled up snake is also snake who has the power of movement is inherent there similarly the shakti what has come out it is brahma astraya it is on the foundation of brahman chidvishwa is subject is consciousness brahma shakti is a power of brahman it's manifest from brahman is no other than brahman the water waves ripples are no other than the ocean so brahma shakti and this mahabala tremendously powerful mahabhala and that power is what durgato would got on a shilla it is it creates such thing which is impossible to create which is not there it appears like that see how solid is this world how our experience every day how we cry and weep what things in the world how can we say it is not there that's why it is a mahabhala this power is tremendous powerful shakti and durga wood garden it is it has the capacity to go to know agatha gautama the same that which is impossible to happen it makes it happen jordan the matter appears to be consciousness and consciousness we don't see anywhere we see we are doing we are doing we are doing this who is doing hand is doing mouth is speaking eyes are seeing i think it is all no it is a shakti of the brahmana nothing you that say ramakrishna said search your eye and see where do you end there is no i what is i your eye ego such what is that i the speech the eyes seeing the ears the hand feet touch test what is you no go back go back go back then you say brahmaswah then you go back to the brahman or the atman or the consciousness but gyanu nasiya hmm when knowledge comes it's all trickery is exposed suppose someone is saying some magic magician if you can catch that trick then there is no magic magician then smiles at you oh my god you got it got me so this is the trickery of maya and maya is no other separate from brahma shakti the power of brahman so meaning what it indicates you know one thing appearing as meaning main purpose of this scriptural reading is that you are seeing god you are feeling god you are touching god you are testing god but you don't recognize it as god so that is the [Music] reading we read that now twentieth person today we are reading shakti yang maya shakti dwayam hima yaya bikshepo [Music] [Music] [Music] has two power not one power it is two powers what are the names [Music] covering covering so it has two power the magicians also do that to power one mesmerizes you push up light sometimes to do something and then push the light on so covering and projection movie take the example of the movie when you go to and see a movie then you re enter into the room before your movie just to start to put the light off huh that is the trigger he says it that that is covering you covering your vision that you are sitting with friends and talking or somebody is there you forget this sin your focus goes on there so before that your attention is withdrawn and immediately start parallely mumbo mum some song or some boom stuff that means your attention from this direction suddenly pushed on that direction so it will have a two power one is the auburn means covering and another is the projection projection there is a white screen nothing is there but so many projections are coming and you forgot yourself so much then you look at that and you get intrigued into it and you cry sometimes someone is you are a soft hearted person and you see some injustice and someone is beating someone and you start you are in the tears array what i have to do it it is all the play of the fun of the light and shine and you are sitting in safe position no one is touching you and it is not happening truly they have all done it by for money and they kill each other for money they make what you call they be friendship with money or love with money so for money-making but you we are fools we pay our money to be fooled so this is the maya's play two aspects of maya one is ability covering aspect another is big shape of projection this is in the b b you will find also more description it is very much discussed there so big sephora and tomo tomodhika which covering aspect is more of thomas thomas means darkness we are we sleep that is your tamil state when you are working your raja state raja's activity when you are meditating trying to become [Music] it is called the sattva state sattva rajas and thomas so we move in the three planes so it is shaktidayan these are the two shakti maya of maya one is called the big shepherd shakti projecting power and one is abriti covering aspect when you see abriti and avaran covering that is tamodhika there is more of thomas there tamangodhika shakti or big shepard when his big ship projection it is of the or termites rajasam people are also or some in the 17th chapter of the bhagavad-gita it deals with this three gunas and very critically they are analyzed there trigonos what are the impact of the trigonomets what are the expressions of the trigonal satico person sattika nature will be make everyone calm serene soft sweet loving caring rajas i do you know who am i hi so always i ego and always pounding on my ability my success what do i say and dominate over everyone sativa quality will be soft sober humble be very that is the nature of the subdue that way so these are the three qualities and permutation and combination we are humans we have all these so rajasi so the running test i will be there for doing anything we need we should have to say ah you know otherwise how can you deal in the exact thing in this world no i am going to eat i am going to sleep i will be sad but this i is arrogance beyond my ability i am saying i am oh my who are you seven billion people is there who you who cares for you how big you are how how many phds you have how many nobel laureate degree even you get two nobler duty that what is that who cares after you die no one remembers even you are here who no one remembers but still we do that any anywhere say do you know who we are talking with i am such a such person so i'm the head of the center no need to talk talk to me so i'm head head guard head this head is that but of course in your work situation you will have to say hey yes that is your duty that's a different thing duty is something different you know go to our belong mod our president marriage was the head of the spiritual organization he takes very strong decisions that is not with ego that is for the good of the sangha good of the society good of the astronaut no that is the that when you subdue to god and express that in a transactional world you have to say something but that is not the point point is the what attitude is coming from your heart your surrender to god humble and waitable jesus it will automatically be shocked a person of sattical quality very soft they will not be able to fight with you they will it seems that they are all idiots because they don't talk and don't shout with you but they they know this is all foolishness truth should be hold on and we have come to improve our character to remove our tamil careless nature some people go oh something is there oh did you see no oh i am in what are you in meditation samadhi why not you see when you see see everything our order is like that when you move you will see everything but you will pay attention to do it anything or not that's your thing but your awareness should be there bhagavad-gita says when a person becomes satickal in every organs of his body will be more of revelation let's say xiaomi vivekananda stayed in one place for two days he knows all the history and he can give total um history of that particular place what has happened which year it has happened this that he his mind is so practical when they are also there but that that is not for this ultimate purpose they see on only one place they may be successful not in other places but spiritual saftic will be whatever you are doing wherever you are going you will be a lot money your eyes will not skip you may say something or don't say that is not the point mother holy mother one noticed everything but she would not see the fault of others that's a different thing that's the quality seeing that but we're not um you know we have many stories now our seventh president of the order we are staying in on some of our educational institution in calcutta what we do suppose i am a guest here so what shall i do i'll do only to talk to people and this and that am i going to see how many the banyan tree is here or how many hibiscus tree is there saludo and so he was there only honor two days then he asked one local monk he went there to salute i said hey maharaja acha how many kokuana trees are in this campus it is one mile campus big educational institution if campus starts on the road by bus it will take few minutes to cross that stretch of land and he asked how many trees are there he did not know what to say but he made up a mind to quickly escape from maharaja's scolding 1992 or something like that and ramadan 992 means all correct yes probably not very very pleased and then after getting out from mara especially in maharashtra and and the person who is in charge in the garden who notes all these things refers he came and told him swami maharaj asked me i gave this number don't divulge the real number i'll be caught the point is that it may be ridiculous no ari you are a guest you are coming to stay here a few nights what is the need of what is how many banana trees are there how many lemon trees are there in the right that is not the point point is your attention attention that is the saktika quality i mean i know our president mars atma who became the president that swami came over here and in the morning i wake up and i was just walking with him to take around i first started asking our internal monastery what is the name of the tree [Laughter] i don't know started i don't know then he said how many steps are here aj from the front step down to the cul de sac how many steps are there what is the need of that we may justify it is a crazy thing to know but subtitle mind shakti mind wants to know yes knowledge and alertness and after some time i am so afraid of walking [Music] if you have a mind to make up stories like that then you can always take for example i count those steps and then i have a story for everything so it so that's how i remember things but it has nothing to do with mine no do you ever ever think that how many steps are here it is stockholders property takus land there is the not this plant is not yours it is it is in for the garden for this view so everything belongs to lord even bilirubal it was a tradition even the cows how many cows are there which cow is keeping each cow has a name and president president has time to inquire about that one day president sankarananda manager is sitting in his room and the principal of biddamunder called his samite joshua came he was brahmana was his disciple he came to salute and then he said i saw that there is a bulb on whole day what is the mean why it is on whole day he is from a distance where is viddamander college hostel in one bar which somebody have daytime it is all wastage of electricity oh my god that attention it goes sarbo de he use mean that is the saktika quality it is said when you become sattica you cannot avoid your attention will be there you can feel it and their feeling is that everything belongs to god so there should be no wastage you should know you feel identity with the astronaut because it is lord's astronomer so you should know no as as we keep our personal uh things we are aware of our personal things you know if you ask how many how much money is in your account almost we know how much is in our account no because i think it is my money but if i ask you how many money is there in the bank today of this yeah no i don't know of course i should not know have that but the question is there are other things so these are alertness comes satiku quality so it says that the modica you had this tamagoon more that is the abriti shakti that is the covering aspect in sleep it covers our knowledge it covers our buddhi it covers our mind that's why when you go to sleep we say i do not know anything about now it is we are working in the project projecting our mind our our senses are acting even in your dream you the projecting power is working mind projecting things so these are the rajasi oh i have read you know the powers of maya 28 is are in the two types veiling and projecting the preponderance of inertia is the veiling power preponderance excessive no excessive of the healing covering aspect that is called the veiling power and one which is called the projecting power is a passionate nature that means it is always uh aggressive and it goes into the [Music] now next verse 21 [Music] that means when when the knowledge comes you know your software quality is a developing in you that is different no do you know how many trees are there do you know the steps are there it may be irrelevant but it is relevant because it you i am interested because it is thakur's place it is large place so i should know it but that is a knowledge and if we don't know are you in meditation just for say just for sake suppose i don't know how many steps are there because i go over there am i meditating so deeply that i am not aware of these steps i am how many times i went down the steps but i am never cared to know that knowledge and the sense of knowing that that sense is did not develop much satiku is not developed much what if you don't know like the number but you got the feeling for them that is also awareness awareness awareness not counting but he's i'm giving one example but not that many awareness is more satwik quality awareness is more with darupa so it is the form of knowledge cosmic ignorance of the pure essence of sattvality more what is that mohini it is charming sat to quality also you know is also creates bondage is like a chain made of gold and thomas is made of iron iron chain i don't like it that you can give up but even someone binds me with a golden chain ah it is gold we like it because it is gold that's why satiko quality sato is a decoy that ramakrishna story three are the highway robbers no tamasa is what abriti what he says hey beat him snatch him take away kill him that's a thomas obliter knowledge wisdom love affection all gone and then then second person comes and he's also a highway robber he said i said why to kill him we need money we need his parts i have taken out okay let let him bind him raja is binding him let him bind him in the tree and butter will not be able to go anywhere and not to give any information to the police okay let us go and then another highway robber was there in the same group he said we have taken away the money and in this deep forest he tied him in the tree no one will come in this road so he will die out of thirst and compassion came and he came and untied it and then showed him the path up to the end of the forest forest is sangsara this world now and he said hey that is your home then the gentleman was very grateful to this third burglar no he said oh you did so much for me why not come come with me in my home and i will entertain you then he said i cannot go there the police will catch me that that police jurisdiction means freedom evil activity cannot be done these three gunas are all decorates all burglars they rob our qualities person enjoys happiness suppose they get a beautiful flower and they enjoy that it is not that thomas people will enjoy differently and raja's people will enjoy different saktika people will enjoy differently they are looking at this moon and that is also attachment whenever full moon comes let us go to see the full moon huh you didn't go to the witch beach okay that is also good much better than any any other sin see the vastness of the ocean but that also binds you attached very finer attachment that's why the rupa sutra mohini that's why it it is mohini means it is deluding it also deluges us at the same time mohonashini or cosmic ignorance is of the form of knowledge pure essence of software quality it is mohini it is charming and also it destroys dilution why if you cultivate more subtle quality detachment will come automatically because saturday is clean if the mind is clean you can see what is beyond the mind that's why meditation meditation makes us mind that's why you say even in your meditation you may get some vision experience our scriptures said don't get stuck there because that is the you can be caught there not to go further i'm happy why to go further that's why it is called two obstacles in meditation no a and another is thomas which goes to sleep big shape okay what is the technical level it is the meditation time two obstacle three obstacle another is the rasha sadhana rasha means you are experiencing meditation and you are feeling great joy great joy great joy and you're stuck there joy you're you're not getting caught into the joy itself you have to go beyond you are that joy you are not to enjoy that there's a devotee's attitude i want to enjoy god but it is if people get there before reaching the highest climax they can get stuck there they ballet russia you are enjoying the russia it's a very good state for us we pray for that but those who have reached there they should have to be careful no this is also a bondage which is in the plane of duality so destroyer of delusion so it is it makes delude as shorter quality and also shorter quality he frees us from all bondage got it sat the quality will be able to take out all our bondage all our attention because it is so clean and so sanctifying that you can see the truth be beyond thomas quality is too low rajas is the action and sattha is the purer and soft starts from here sattha ends here beyond that brahman so be careful even to cultivate don't get stuck even that's why many people say i have this vision good yourself to quality but don't get stuck there go move on till you reach the goal reach the goal means you reach in a point where nothing to go and you feel the oneness the absolute that's called the samadhi it is that state of samadhi so so this cosmic ignorance is of the form of knowledge it is of the nature of pure essence of sato quality it is charming and it is the destroyer of delusion it can destroy the delusion this is the collective ignorance no maya the question was how the maya functions how individual ignorance functions no your individual ignorance you are ignorant i am ignorant how my ignorant will be ignorance will be destroyed that is my abhiddha will go we will say my abiddha will go how now know what is abhiddah and what is maya maya means you also we are all under maya is a cosmic level it's called maya individual level it is called abiddha remember two words individual and cosmic is maya but still they are defining abid the it is quality because god's characteristic god by his maya created this so he is fully aware but we are born in that maya that's why we are avid we are in us thomas is due to the preponderance of the inertia of the tamas and sahabriti she is endowed with the power of covering that truth in us tomogoon is more and in the cosmic maya shattuck is more that's why god created this universe but he is not bound by it but whatever we create because of our tama's nature more we get attached to it now twenty-first verse right twenty-second twenty-five twenty-second twenty-seven virgin maya [Music] [Music] is a cosmic ignorance by which the whole sun moon stars galaxies has been created no it is maya and abiddha my ignorance but i like this like god has created everything why you say i like it's god's thing why i dislike that you have your own ignorance projecting on it understand that god is not bound by anything ignorant why because it is duality it is duality absolute truth is true there is no creation whenever you are seeing duality that's why the creation comes and there is the sun moon stars and all this life all these forces come actually what god has created that does not bind us we are bound by our own choices by my own obita by my individual ignorance my individual ignorance is creating problem the tree and plants are all same you go to the garden so many flowers are there god has created equally dispassionately but you say i like these hibiscus i don't like this flower which falls down so quickly you are saying that in the eyes of god all equal so that's why maya or with the nobody vinna they are not separate somosti and bestie it is the cosmic sense and individual sense individually call abidda and individual orbit the why my the likes and dislikes come as a result of my likes and dislikes i suffer or i smile i enjoy or i cry all this dual activity happens because i am in this level of duality so maya no boy at all binna is different why samosti and vestirupata one is the collective form another is the individual form totality of the mayana they are only one appearing as many suppose by your abit you create the night dream you are the only one but you create so many things there see see them fun and then you can understand what is god's creation in that maya what you your dream creates your abit that creates that entire dream and there are people and they are liking something disliking something all these are having their problem but you have created you have created for fun your dream is for fun but the people created there they are having their choice of likes and dislikes and detachment or whatever so this is the cosmic plan of god and it is equally created for fun he that's why gita said no question does not give anyone some punishment of giving some sin okay do sinful activity or not saying okay you do all what you call noble activities no not say he was shukritang people he does not give the results of good karma bad karma he does not do anything all your karma all your likings disliking is back by coming back to you again inaudible because of ignorance you are thinking that god is giving god does not give you your karma is giving you back so there comes the karma theory what i did my karma has brought me here and mohojam comes where that's a delusion that's part of the karma our ignorance both of them belong to abhidha because maya is god's from god god though create he is totally detached that's why the song is there the child plays with so many toys and things but child just for fun it plays it has no attachment for anything that's why childs when a child means a really who is just a a small boy a little attachment will come as as it grows as we have grown now our attachment has become so deep that has been detachment likes dislikes pleasure pain the feeling they are also strong so it says from the collective and individual perspective if you look at that maya and abhidha they are not settled different it is only cosmic and it's single it is called the example brick kawachinova you have read all these things you are not saying anything bono about china bono means the forest the space covered in the forest and space taken by one tree the space are they different you got it there suppose here is a forest you say oh this is the space garden space no garden space and space taken by one high viscous plant are they separate space wise same space whether the plant is there you cut it space will remain space whether you put 20 plants there the space will remain this space so in space wise there is no difference maya with that that's why collective and individual perspective is a collective of so many trees plants that's the garden space and individual space taken they are certainly no different not but the combination of maya and avida are one alone avida and maya they're one alone only but she is thought of as many maya individually is they are materially one but it appears many maya and they cannot make a separation and people see it by their ignorance meaning 22. you ask your questions okay 23 let me finish this 23. shall we go for that [Music] she standing on and refusing taking refuge taking refuge on chit chit means consciousness it's taking refuge on consciousness suppose taking waves are taking refuge on the ocean you understand this now similarly this world is taking refuge on what brahman standing on the foundation of consciousness cheat chit means consciousness chit chitty bhasya [Music] being revealed by the consciousness how everything is revealed because of the consciousness i am talking how this talk is expressed if there is no consciousness if there is no consensus dead body no so the consciousness is the foundation and consciousness is helping me to express these words being revealed by concept without consciousness you cannot see you cannot talk you cannot feel you cannot experience anything without the heat in your oven neither pot [Music] fire without the fire in the oven your your cooking will not be done your rice potatoes and they will not jump when you cook and your hand will not be burned suppose it is no heat you put the pots pans and everything with rice dal mixing everything it has no power so cheat it is standing on the cheek consciousness revealed by the sheath it subject matter makes it as subject matter the standing on the support of consciousness revealed by consciousness she she means what maya makes herself the subject matter she splits herself into two one is subject another object thereafter covering the nature of consciousness she generates the projection from the existence got it little bit you see again standing say just keep your idea focused in the kitchen there is the oven and the flame is there and you put the pot and pan no actually now you put your hand in the pan your finger burns you say oh the pan is hot pan i burned my finger in the pan pan cannot burn you pan is jada it is like this but the consciousness the fire it has entered into the pan and the pan which is not he has no heat of its own you touch it you feel the heat there is heat is coming from somewhere else it is transferred into this and giving the identity that the pan is powerful enough to give you burning whereas the burning power is in the flame only so cheat is the consciousness is the flame it penetrates the matter it is body mind is a robot it is entered into this and it is functioning you see oh i said this you said that i understand that there you understand we are talking about that but the chiti this consciousness is behind and it is manifesting even this world but we don't recognize the consciousness we see it is the robot telling ex-robot talking to the y robot said this is the point so therefore covering the nature of consciousness that consciousness claim no one talks about that she generates and projects generates projections from the existence that whatever other things you see you see they are all conscious by themselves we are foolishly thinking the tree is conscious the plant is moving towards the light you know a crawling worm is trying to save his life it is all conscious conscious concept what is the consciousness whose consciousness who is allowing that consciousness to make this jara this matter has consciousness it is consciousness so feel that way that's a meditation that is afterwards that goes after knowledge yeah before the knowledge it journal is jorah okay so we ain't here now om [Music] so some questions 25th september 2021. [Music] 21-217 so the question has come a wrong impression is that from outside outside appearance of tamasika and sattika look alike sattigo people do work a lot but not like rajya sikhovan who are full of ego they are worker fully selfless right yes actually subtitle quality sometimes we mistake raja's thomas quality we sometimes define as sattva understand when you meditate it is called sattical quality but i am sleeping and i come out and i say i am meditation i did the meditation actually you are real thomas when the softer quality you are practicing your meditation will be vivid transparent awareness will be there focused on the inside but apparently thomas thing will appear that i am meditating and come out i'll be calm i'll be serene but i did this due to tamas due to sleep but when the awareness comes that face will also shining but that is a shattering manifestation that will give wisdom knowledge peace inside but this will give a peace of sleep not peace of mind piece of meditation so that is the true so this question is very correct substitute people when they do work they also do work but they do with detachment they do with freedom they do with joy rather sick of people thomasical people work they will be angry they will be frustrated they will be disturbed too much because of the impact of the thomas and saturn so we have to be careful that's why shattu thomas quality please read the bhagavad-gita 17th chapter you will find elaborately discussed there and we can know what is my quality and how i can improve we are all that's why in the morning you do that we sleep huh we sleep and then we say oh ho ho temple is open we'll have to go huh then body says okay another five minutes there is thomas then that's why i said don't allow that jump out of the bed okay and then go and take a shower say thomas to rajas and after finishing that razors then try to come sit for meditation but many people we used to do and in the morning we got i'm meditating and the bed itself and i am meditating and within few minutes i'm back to my eternal meditation so say thomas rajas and satya that's another question in bhagavad-gita it is stressed that one should approach any work thinking of it as just as a duty and without any attachment to the results of the action to avoid bondage in the material world yes but in reality almost no one in the world works with that mindset everyone is preoccupied with the outcome of their action what is the fate of people who gets bondage in the material world i would suggest that in reality almost no one in the world works with that mindset is not true uh some may be more some may be less we get attached when we do work but satiko people we can make a practice i am done i should have a goal i'll have to finish this work today that target should be suppose for a holy man sattica person he has been given to cook and he's goes on cooking cooking cooking the taku's book time is gone then one hour late two hours and he's cooking and he's cooking and he's cooking it is satiko because he's satiga no you should have to make a target that i'll have to prepare the meal by one o'clock the thakur spoke bogu will come before that the target should be there and i'll have to active in that way but it is the attitude why i am doing for whom i am doing i am doing for god it is doing for my spiritual end is to purify my heart i am doing all these things so this attitude can be practiced and there are people who really do all their activities centered around this idea so but it is too hard you know without the attachment yes i am not attached to the result but i am attack focused to the goal i have to finish the work this time with full attention time time frame is to be followed otherwise this world in which we live you will be dysfunctional then you go to a cave event someone lives in the cave and habits infinite time you can eat now you can eat night 10 o'clock you can eat poor around three o'clock in the early morning or four o'clock in the morning and do whatever you like but when you live in the society you will have to have the target and that is the principle this ramakrishna order teaches us to do with utmost attention utmost focus with deep intensity but at the same time know you are doing for god and keep your mind free from our attention and focus on work and work and work only okay okay last word next day there is one question i could not attend to that the question is that please can you explain how the atman individual consciousness is same as brahman infinite consciousness i understand that i am atman to net but not able to go beyond that yeah okay very good question when we can do not this not this not this then you will reach what you will reach the atman atman does not mean a pocketed small thing you will go to that consciousness and that's consciousness which was thinking my consciousness my will go away consciousness will remain and that consciousness is everywhere just i gave the example the tree occupying little space when the tree is caught this atman remains there and brahman goes away brahmana total space and the space occupied by the tree is the same space am i clear or not just imagine a garden with say thousand trees are there bee garden and the total space occupied by all the trees added together is the space of the garden that you think that's brahman and now i and one tree is there you are focused on that that is the jivatma one individual the solang jibatma consciousness is they are interpenetrated no before you have destroyed the tree some of the tree is standing there so the in every pore of the tree there is the same space the space of the atman you call space equal to atman that space remains the same when the tree is there what tree you destroy so if i am here if i can destroy my ego my body mind idea my idea identification with my senses with my mind or my ego with my buddhi intelligence if we can destroy then what will remain he'll go back to the consciousness but the same consciousness is the cosmic consciousness there is no two part there this what is making the part individual plant and that another plant they are making this space but one plant when everything is cut down it merges into the cosmic consciousness so cosmic consciousness and individual consciousness are the same that means you need not have to think about anything if you can really reach that consciousness analyzing i am not the body not the mind not this thing i am the witness i am the witness and go back to that state then you will see that the same consciousness is the cosmic consciousness brahmasmi that's why it is called brahma usmi how hong becomes brahman because with the body mind making me separate from the entire space when the body mind is gone the space is the only space is there where the trees are there sometimes you know certain garden people go and all the old trees they cut no in big business people do that and they plant new trees no so what happen the space becomes open then that is the brahman but when the space was covered by individual trees thousand trees it appears that each tree is taking space and there is with the consciousness that is called individual and that is called the cosmic but atma and brahman athman brahman are not too different here is another question could one say that this whole world is the play of consciousness or sakthi yes that is the way that is it is a stand this stand can be taken everything is play of the consciousness so you think consciousness everywhere if this attitude is taken in every movement of our life what i am doing that's also expression of consciousness that whatever everything i see action is going on it is also play of consciousness why i am saying play because i see the name and form if my mind were transported to the nameless divine entity then i will not see you and me separate so it is it is a play god playing that's why in devotional term we use is it not the ocean if i say ocean is playing with itself all the ripples waves they are only playing who playing with whom ocean is playing with ocean the ocean is so big but only the surface a little play and fun going on but it is nothing but the ocean so ocean is playing with the ocean consciousness is playing with the consciousness shakti is the power of brahman that is manifesting it is brahman brahman brahman and its power so this type of attitude we can take every moment and try to see consciousness everywhere here also consciousness they are also answered yes individual ignorance and that falls under the cosmic plan cosmic ignorance when they're that's why those people who realize god they have no karma they transcended all karma both are under maya no maya nobody there no difference that we read only individual and total from the perspective of individual and from the perspective of totality that's the same thing only what happens you know when it is vast ocean a ocean does not get polluted no but a small bucket of water that can be easily polluted so individual soul gets polluted much when the same is in the ocean you put one million buckets of bad water what will happen to the infinite pacific ocean it will absorb so in that there is not bad thing in god there is nothing bad but individually we are under the influence of maya that's why we are having so much shortcomings okay so thank you all for joining and tomorrow sami oh tomorrow is wednesday you know uh [Music] prana prabradhika shivaprana will be giving the gospel class okay thank you all one more everything if we try to think all his consciousness will it help me though we do not realize yeah realization comes after repeated thinking because this is the reality yeah truth is that because all the sages you go to read the upanishads and they say that it is permeated with consciousness satchita and the rupo and then you go to the astra bhaktrasana all the texts they say it is all consciousness all consciousness no so if i think that am i right thinking but the wrong thinking will go away and day and night thinking like that one will be able to feel that i am consciousness i am the same consciousness you are the same consciousness whatever i see he feel experience act react everything is permeated with consciousness nothing but consciousness nothing but h2o in all the waves and ripples how big is that how small is that how meaningless is that how meaningful is that so that will happen that's why we have to otherwise you say i am atman how do you say that i am atman repeat it again and again that is real nature of us but i at this condition i don't understand that i think my i means this body i miss this my mind so to overcome that we have to say i am not this body i am the atman if we say everything is consciousness say again and again and again you see consciousness that will happen thank you you
