[79. Shanti Gita - Class 79 - chapter 7- verse 21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2sgvgvI0Ac)

foreign [Music] lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your display and face oh peace peace peace reading of the Shanti Gita hung of peace and where last time we read that this given the example of this space in a picture and the space and Trust space as those two spaces are the same it is not working so as the two spaces are the same space inside the jar and the big space as they are same as their same one and same similarly that's a conductor unbroken is that Unity knowing that Brahman that this individual soul is the same as cos pixel and then that example was given that act that if as AP as the one space is only is revealed in all diverse types of pots and pans therefore all the limiting adjuncts in that all the limiting adjects all those name and forms behind is that ecoatma that Atman is the one is Purna is full there's no duality in that and then they give the example as yet as in the thousands of the Lambs Ara the fire alone is there everywhere in all the lamps similarly Tata but similarly in all the bodies different types of bodies physical bodies only Atman is one residing chit that is consciousness that is sat there is a reality and that is up by Eternal Eternal absolute Consciousness and absolute existence that example again means has been given last time that in thousands of cows of different colors different sizes foreign though it is coming from a black cow or a cow of different color size what you call the origin breed may be all different but only that ghee or the buttermilk is now a bit dirt in Austin that is similarly prastar issue in different Stones there to Flint they used to rub and get the fire so in in the different Stones the same fire is hidden there only one fire similarly all these varieties what we see is an afferent appearance but the sachidan under the Consciousness that Bliss Eternal is the same so now today we start reading the mass number 21. 21 says simple example in different lakes all the different reservoirs Jala says even jalamikam it is all water one may be Square Lake another may be rectangular Lake another one mile Lake another may be with little device M A curvature is there in the in the leg size it may be dive divers shape and size of the lake as in all the Lakes jolas all these are wires foreign it is as it reveals as it come as it is sin as Nana bharneshu special the honey the bee sits on the flowers and that flowers are of different colors varieties but the module the honey then that model that the honey is only one that means though you know there is difference people say that one type of Honey is little different if we critically analyzed but overall you say call if you call it is mahani the honey is the same so like that these are the examples are given to make us understand that varieties may be there but in varieties there is Oneness in the manifold to see that Oneness what is that Oneness and how to teach our mind to see that and that Oneness is apparently impossible in varieties when we see varieties how can I see Oneness seeing many is the vulnerity and seeing one is called Oneness how can I see Oneness in the variety and varieties are very real so how to work Alexa okay tickets oh then Myron is back blocked okay now my run is moving that's okay so and another example he is giving it so that let us read the learning translation of it as milk and clarified butter are same there is one and not different in thousands of cows fire is the same without any distinction in the fleet stones of various types these are examples similarly that's the same water Sparkles equally in various water reservoirs if the sun's trees fall on that the water Sparkles no but that sparkle is the same only water it is only and that is same sweet honey is the flowers of various colors similarly another example that's [Music] he should understand with the cane sugar cane there it when you go to the sugar cane field how many varieties of size and these are there or maybe uh varieties of different kinds of sugar canes Maybe innumerable sugar canes ham when you squeeze the juice that comes out you call cane sugar cane juice no can juice is the same sugar cane so that's that that in sugar canes as this sugar cane juice that juice is the only same Tata he likewise in every respect caitanya the consciousness it's absolute it is non-dual it is their only one so this is the point to focus that varieties may be of different examples that we see in the material world as all the in the Stars you see the light is the same all the stars the heat is the same generalized principle if we see then we can see that Oneness is there the varieties are there similarly these examples are given that in different reservoirs water is the same manifesting in many many varied colors of flowers variety types of flowers the honey is the same the sweetness of the honey Remains the Same and in the cane sugar the cane went in crust and the juice that is get it is the same though there may be 1000 steps and size of the cane sugar stands Roar that in in the similar manner in all our moods and temperaments people are angry people are peaceful people are restless people are happy people unhappy all the moods if you think about the moods of the Mind but that is all grounded on the consciousness without that Consciousness the anger frustration joy happiness misery no experience can be available and that is and that is nothing but the absolute Poonam pool am without any second and Consciousness alone that is the Consciousness alone now 23rd verse or do I purana or Dubai poor nature akilam or yeah means where there is no two in that one absolute that absolute Consciousness in that one absolute consciousness Walk Hill this whole universe that we see it is all kulpitom it is an imagined it is an early imagination there is no varieties no many but it is just your imagining how you are imagining my yeah by Maya by ignorance Cosmic ignorance two types of ignorance it is called the Maya the cosmic ignorance and there is individual ignorance to ignorance my own ignorance plays a role Cosmic ignorance plays a role truth is all Brahman but I see diversity because it's the Maya Cosmic Maya Cosmic mind Cosmic mind has thought there will be sun moon stars and that's there but I have special Fascination for I like sun someone likes cold so this liking is coming from where the same temperature that's why many people who live together three four two three people some like heat and some like cold there's a big fight when you are going to bed then which heat temperature it will be there we are in trouble here because when you do the Puja some those who do Puja they want little cold and also cold is necessary for the flowers and those flowers get dried no you give this and that is good and some like literally hot they feel a little cold on a cold cold so they don't enjoy this if this is temperature is little down so there is a conflict there is but there is why temperature is temperature but I like I dislike I like more heat or less it it's my choice similarly the God has created this entire universe no it is nothing bad nothing good it is his own playful mood God has created no now I come with my personal baggage hidden inside with my own salskaras when my mindset and when I come there then what I do then I project my likings and dislikings that's the Maya ignorance subjective ignorance it is called avidya the cosmic Mayana panchatoshi said these two types of mistakes are happening but if we first get out of our personal choice then we go to the better place God's play you need not have to say I like I dislike it is God's play God has become so much and God is playing in all the roles but when you bring your own personality then you get into fight in the material plane every Day Struggle is there my likings my thoughts and my wish versus your wish this contradiction is always therein so it is called the Jiva sister The Duality created by individual soul and ishwara's sister daita God created a duality got the absolute one there is no two as we have just heard different examples but he created a Maya by Magic power of the three gunas have created diverse objects in the world but he is a he is a many cheerful guy he creates in his own way hello no artists they create something to us it is good holy Unholy ugly very exciting for our vision but you look at the point when the artist is creating that art out of playfulness of Joy everything is discretion so there is no ugly there is no holy there is no Unholy in the eyes of the artist similarly in the eyes of God there is no such distinction that's why our individual ignorance the whole spiritual life starts in removing our individual ignorance in this ignorance which is bothering me are my likes my dislikes my favorite my Disney discover it or whatever am I this food I like that food I don't like this is this this man I like this person I don't like I hate this person I had all these Duality play is going on my individual ignorance the G individual is Jiva sisters so if this Jiva sister daughter we are to transcend that it goes to this and his son is a playful Joy joyful State that's why you go from our plane to ramakrishna plane and the ramakrishna plane he would enter it will be all play and joy and see the Oneness there it is all fun for him in your dream look at that in Every Day's Night Dream who creates the entire dream your own mind is creating no entire world of dream dream world all its experiences whatever is coming in there it is created by the individual mind so similarly God's mind if you compare the sun moon stars we all see the sun you also see this and I also see the Sun but I like the sun rays I don't like that is my choice it will go to the beautiful flower you like rose I like Dalia you like some other color you like yellow I like maybe White so these are all changing because individual choice is coming so this is the point that this we have to go back to these projections Cosmic projection is Maya and individual projection is the likes and dislikes and the cause of our suffering and identification individually I this is me therefore anything happens here I cry and weep so similarly this disidentification that's why to see these are all projection projection projection by Maya this akhilam this entire universe is created by Maya then foreign false is imaginary it is not there what is there oh this turn that substratum that is sachidananda and that is appearing to you in so many varieties of way why because it is Imagination whose imagination Cosmic imagination plus edited my imagination double double e double mistake I have no control over God's mistake is not God missed as I said God said is not mistake it is not for God is suffering it is a playful joyful creation of God that says [Music] oh Lord you are playing the children's play you go watch the beach and when the children go in the play in the beach they create castles which how seriously it is all for fun there is nothing no it's compelling hey he will have to do it otherwise he will not get food no one is charging anyone but out of playfulness that is that here the poet has come considered God as this big big baby and it's his own playful mood you are playing you are creating you are destroying you are throwing away it's all your fun so then who are you are a God's plan but we are dying well then who are you where do you come from you have no existence it is my imagination God will say it is in a dream if the dream when you are dreaming in your dream that someone is beating heavily the person who is beating that your mind has created the person who is beaten that is also created by your mind and you are another person standing there say ahaha why is beating trying to protect and then you've got one or two stroke all are going on imagination and created by your mind so the cosmic mind you can meditate on this type topic very seriously then we will make at least we don't understand the truth but we can get a glimpse of the truth this whole world let's say ramakrishna said that when someone questioned it is God's play but it is our problem our our pain then I was going to say who are you where do you come from if everything is God where you stand you you have no position here identification your ignorance is creating your trouble that's why we say don't blame God you normally be questioned oh today's world see what is going on what God is doing God should not allow these things if God does not do anything it is you your identification and disidentification but there is only one reality that is called the divine so Misha sarbam whatever you are seeing that's the vedantic style it is it appears but it is not true uh whatever appears like one thing is not true a who is old traditional examples are the Mirage ah like that of seeing in the freeway our present experience you are driving in the hot summer in the freeway you see in front of your little distance there is water on the road did you see anyone no I have seen many times you don't see but we know we know the science but with this water I see someone so we see it yeah you I cannot deny I am seeing it I am seeing you it's reality yes I see because I see it is not absolute reality when we approach close to that you see it is gone and they know what everything in further at a distance like you know we see the sky has touched the trees on the horizon okay you and then you go on one one or five and stretch long Stitch of five miles seven miles ten miles at the distance you see Horizon no actually you try to catch that house which is in the Horizon and you catch the sky now you move where is your horizon you saw that Horizon the Doom it trusted trees and you cannot deny that because you see does not mean it is true here is the point whatever we see because we see it is not true we see the all the stars and dots of light because of that the stars are not dots of light many examples can be given in this way which we are in our mind how we look at the object because of our background you come from a very one very pure background you will observe the same incident differently another person will say watch the same incident totally opposite so this is the point to understand that it is all mrisha in that sense it is it it is false it is unreal but it is there is some reality it is unreal there comes the sankara's philosophy it appears but some it is not the appearance you are may be wrong water is not there but you can see there is a rope rope has been miscon understood as snake there is some existence there is some reality behind unchanging reality that has been misinterpreted by the mind my mind misinterpreted it as it is a Horizon it is water it is small it is Big this concept is all in the mind and this is not true astronomically if you look at the galaxies and things in comparison to the Earth there is one popular picture no see Earth is so big and then comes the next planet and the next planet and the next planet then you see it looks smaller smaller smaller smaller no it is in there then you see is it small or is it big what is B what is small they said in the space it is happening but what is the truth that if you analyze that way you will have to say these are all false appearance your conception mind is creating that conception and that conception is not true so go beyond conception that's why you go beyond mind your mind is the on the only instrument which catches all these ideas go beyond the mind so sarvam mrisha what is though this is appearing in sovietnam is appearing in name and form which is visible Universe in the subtle world in the mental universe and this that that which is beyond your mind cannot catch it foreign foreign Brahman is absolutely stainless Maya cannot penetrate there Cloud cannot penetrate into the sun cloud is so little meaningless in comparison to what is some but little patch of cloud covers our own territory foreign we read that my drishti eyesight has been covered Ghana in darkness no no I think I my eyes have been covered with some Cloud I am saying the sky is there is no sky sky is covered how can one mile two mile ten miles expanded the cloud can cover the huge Sun how can it cover it cannot but it covers to us that's why that um that's that our real nature or that Brahman is unbroken undivided Bimal absolutely stainless and pure it is all saturated with that consciousness there cannot be any two there cannot be any man any any Duality or many do it again even the trace Gundam is the thing is not there even this male love that is not there it is a very intense way of talking condom is the smell of fragrance it is the the fragrance of Duality even the fragrance not the material flower is not there but flowers fragrance is here in in that way there is Duality is not there even its fragrance is also not there it's least presence is not there no not kinch it there is nothing anything there is nothing at all here Buddhism comes there is nothing at all because no thing at all is there everything is gone but vedanta comes One Step Up no no not King cheat there is nothing a trace of anything there only remains that sat that Eternal existence and then what is this universe this University I see so many where I see Oneness holy mother is teaching my child the world don't if you want peace my child don't find fault to eat others try to make the whole world your own there is no one is stranger so one how shall I do that here he said that truth is only existing only Nana bhavi you know rajati it is only existing in diverse names and forms diverse conditions so it's time to hammer in our mind though you see the duality do you see many fullness it is not there it is even the trace of that is not there it is your mind is showing you the little cloud of ignorance in your mind is covering the entire son of consciousness here their absolute truth is here and here little cloud of ignorance in my mind in my understanding in my ego because of that I don't see the infinite Consciousness the infinite blissfulness what is inside therefore these are very beautiful verses no one can sit and meditate vedantic meditation is one type of meditation is that just to sit and say take any verse otherwise non-dual existence that full life solute full and that in that Consciousness this entire universe Cosmos is just culpitum imagined by Maya by Cosmic ignorance foreign whatever you see all are non-existing and it appears only in diverse names and forms now modern examples are much more better no as a laser projection no you can see in the space so many things cast them try to hold them in olden days there are old examples from modern examples are much clearer you go to the Disney World every day there is a particular time they have some laser soaps and everyone knows but people want to see what you are seeing you are saying they empty space 3D glass another example Maya glass take out the my address one thing put the Maya glass another thing so when you're wearing the Maya glass you see that everything as if you were in the middle of that and you are affected by that even you're tensed by that but when you take out nothing he has nothing which just always seeing that around me but it is happening in the distance then you say oh nothing here the day what is no actually knowledge knowledge means taking out the Maya glass taking out the ignorance out of my our consciousness be our be aware of that truth that undivided absolute truth which is mentioned here so this running translation will be like that the entire universe has been imagined by Maya on the non-dual absolute consciousness falsely the substratum of everything appears in variety ships and sizes formed [Applause] and now in the undivided stainless absolute Consciousness which is beat up even a trace of duality there is not the slightest shadow of anything other than the existence alone which shines in various ways the translation is one line and sanskritis also can read one line but for meditation it can take hours and hours and hours those who cannot meditate on the form they sometimes take these verses as a tool to meditate some people are mind does not get concentrated on the form but this is vedantic meditation it is all goes to how much you will think of the absolute anyhow how much you've seen at least it is not the limited form but this is also formed but not the limited form to too limited form to the absolute again another example is giving given here Bieber [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign all these you are seeing it is a Daydream Night Dream you understand now last night what you saw whether you got frightened or whether you got a good feast all are imagination now we understand that but now what is happening this this is also another dream it is called daydream there's Night Dream this is Daydream so here he says you see whatever in the waking state it is like as you see in your dream because when I go to dream where goes this existence this reality every day when you go to sleep where goes your whole days the reality in which you lived or we live we interact we cry we weep we smile we rejoice where are those where do they disappear right mind moves in one plane to the other plane when it connects here this world is true it's there that world is true people is sitting in his own room perfectly protected he's imagining oh there is my enemy she is searching for me and with a gun in hand he will kill me and then anyone makes a little noise there or even the wind blows who is coming there you get scared and you die it happens every day -to-day examples are there when you pay value and attain attention to those things mind people live in their mind only the external world is nothing some people think that is the oh the helicopter is coming why it is coming over us oh yesterday it came today is coming they are searching for something am I the and they are getting a maybe something is their background and he is totally lost into that fear but these are all imagination most of us suffering even in forget God or other thing is imaginary mentally we suffer mentally we deserves then old examples are there someone said that one lady was sweeping the courtyard and someone came and said you know today in Village information one lady came and told to that sweeping lady you know such and such lady lost her son and the lady was sweeping the same way as it oh she was such a good boy and he passed away what will be mother's condition how little sympathetic statement and within two minutes later they said no no no it is not a her son it is your son and he just fell down in the ground that may be wrong information but with with minus is see with a little twist it's the same person same sweeping was going on and she didn't stop the sweeping and sympathetically saying some beautiful sweet words no and as soon as it my son but he lost she lost outer Consciousness and fell down flat in the ground we live in our mind and if someone comes after five minutes no no I am sorry I gave you the wrong information and your mind will be cheerful same person will be smiling and dancing then and they'll go to the shrine okay give five Rupees to that mandir to the temple it's a good news so you all work on our mental level good bad so so what you see we see in this world it is all like dream sapna but what is then what is this it is they say as I just mentioned the word Beaverton be worth is the philosophy of Sankara be what the philosophy means without changing the original it appears it has changed as it were creating great great example without changing the Rope anyway you are Imagining the snake and the snake bite and the consequent the results of restlessness and running to the doctor and hospital and this and that everything happened with the imagination the Rope there is no rope snake but it was rope all the time when you are mistaken when you are running when you are in hospital it is the rope that without changing rope characteristic it appeared to us as snake that means we see name and form everything solid liquid gas but it is all sachidharanda that without changing that disappearance is coming that be worth the word so that's why it is consciousness Consciousness it is nothing but the snake when he has beaten the one part of the Rope has hit the lake no it has hit it so it is it is nothing it is consciousness only it is sachidananda Brahman there is nothing else but that is only Brahman and Brahman alone absolute Consciousness blessedness and reality you know [Music] that's a now now this is taking us to a very lofty flight of understanding that aksharam aksharam is the later or akshara is the unchanging reality you know by the tat laksham by the south sudananda that is indicated the thing indicated that laksham said that it is Imperial akshara means they are imperishable foreign [Music] that is this real nature the knowledge that you are a Brahman but it does it renounce that means previously they said that uh subnauti sarvam this world is appearing as dream and you understand that it's a dream but it is not a dream as such but it is a reality one thing you are seeing for the other he was not seeing the truth but you are seeing something imaginary created by your mind when you understand it is only Consciousness that and Brahma mastram there is only Brahman and nothing else sachidan that is sachidananda that is absolute and not is non-dual this is called Brahma Gyan now after knowing Brahma can we may think I am you have to give give up that also is talking about that in this last verse when you say sachidananda what does it mean laksham we are we are pointing out that is pointing out that its end point end result what is that means absolute Brahman non-dual there is no trace of ignorance there is no takes of Maya it is absolutely sachidharanda and you are also not there now aksharam foreign that is beyond all expression it is beyond all sound it is absolutely stainless that knowing that that real nature don't think I am a Noah Brahman that knowledge part also give up and you sink into it to lose your all identity ego so that is the state Beyond Brahma again that means even people say when they come down with the knowledge that I know Brahman that knowledge is to also go away because that is also knowing Noah knowing nowhere and known three things are there three things are there but these three things should collapse there is no no knowing and no knowledge that means what is that that is that so this is the 26th verse by the word existence Consciousness and Bliss definition indicate it's objective that is the Brahman consciousness that is imperishable aksharam beyond words Beyond sound or expressions stainless niranjanam and knowing that real nature of yours by yourself who will teach you Guru system when he chant in the morning huh in that state there is no guru there is no chela there is no eye there is no doubt so by your own effort by your own spiritual practice or analytically everyday understanding what are you foreign by that knowing that real nature of yours by yourself then renounce even the idea that you are a Noah Brahma so give up everything that means there will be nothing but the reality so this is the state we are expecting to reach okay so we end here what is the date today 13. okay so you can read that because it is available in the we have given in the political posted in the what you call the screen you can you can read this versus it is a good way of meditation uh to think that though we see this reality those who are overwhelmed with this reality but this is actually a false identification it is it is only the cosmic consciousness appearing like that of the world not too much explain what will explain here here is absorption stainless spews it does not change it is the goal of all spiritual sadhana even the idea I am meditating you have to give up I am the Noah Brahman that is to be given up so I know then I is there non-knowledge is there and something object which I know so all the time there are three no unknowing and no object of none so see our sin and the science of seeing you know so always drink this show s always say do we live in Duality so it is saying yes see you live in The Duality but try to understand it is all appearance these are not true not the way you see it is that okay so today is good no question [Music] tomorrow is Wednesday at 7 30 tomorrow okay bye
