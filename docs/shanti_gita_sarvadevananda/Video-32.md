[29. Shanti Gita - Class 29 - Chapter 3 , Verse 24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QSqpmBhKb-M)

foreign hey [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face on peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to our reading on the shanti gita the song peace song of peace so we we have read after verse number 23 last time the 23 verse what does it say we're talking about 23 let me go to back then 22 what they say the question or question arose what is maya and what is abhiddah that to understand what is maya maya is maya abhiddah now even on 22nd verse he read maya and avida are ignorance cosmic maya and individual ignorance cosmic ignorance individual ignorance are not two separate identities maya abhiddha but there is a difference one is samosti one is the totality total ignorance cosmic ignorance we call that ignorance covers everyone's eyes everyone see the sun moon stars not that i am seeing sun and you are seeing stars i am seeing a tree you are seeing it animal no so this is called the cosmic ignorance because god's mind have imagined this as our mind imagines our dream so the cosmic mind imagine that is the this whole universe we see what is in our ignorance our ignorance is that is ignorance centered around me and my little personality i my intellect my mind my emotions my my my my it's a limited these are the maya 22nd verses they are not separate samosti bastidupata one is the level of the cosmic level or totality another is individual mind is one individual they are almost the same it says from the collective and individual perspective maya and avid are certainly the same the combination of maya and avidha are one only but she is thought of as many the cosmic ignorance is the same but we think that it is different then that has been my further clarified in the last verse we read 23rd verse 24 what it says it says that this maya is resting on what maya has no power of its own its power is the consciousness maya cannot function so maya the power behind is the consciousness chit astraya it is resting on chit consciousness chiti bhashya and his manifesting his gandura this maya is so grand and beautiful all around is revealed by what that same consciousness shiti vasya vishwayang tang karuti and it makes the same consciousness as subject my object it covers the consciousness aspect consciousness nature and creates big shape means all singing and dancing we talked about last time about the cosmic play what it is like a movie that example we gave entire movie depends on what on the projection light no so it's rests on the projection light here some real is moving the astra the support is from the consciousness think that light as consciousness chidaswaya and how the film which is matter nothing is there only real it is being revealed as a singing dancing fighting whatever happening is revealed by whom revealed by the same light consciousness and it makes the subject as consciousness consciousness is the subject here whatever comes it is the only light percolating through the film so what it does ah british the screen which is white all the time it covers his whiteness crystal clear purity of the screen and big shape and it's producing so much of turmoil in the movie screen everything we see where every day all the things you see in the television don't you look at the screen only is there anything but the screen but all are the production of maya but his support is their light so this is to be understood that this world we see it is all the play of the cosmic mind and that cosmic mind how this is revealed by the light of consciousness only and that light of consciousness is making this object as real and the consciousness absent as is the normal example we give that the rope remains rope but snake appears that is a big shaper reflection that is a projection projection of rope happens on what on the rope itself there is a rope and you see in ignorance snake so where the snake come from where it is resting that snake is resting on what same rope is conceived as snake and revealed to you by the snake itself no snake but the rope itself rope is the only thing there rope is the substance rope is the object on which snake appears as big shaper as projection you project in your mind it's a snake and then thereby you see the snake has beaten me snake strangled my leg nothing it is ropes tangled your leg and and even bite you feel it is the rope snake never came that's why it's called everything based on consciousness and the consciousness is appearing as this world of delusion and the consciousness is making this the worthless jorah material rope to appear like a living snake so this is that means there is nothing but consciousness this is the subject we read twenty third person now it is a good thing to read like that but again question comes gotham how so we are reading the verse number 24 today but what we read it is a very serious subject you should all pay attention to that that this is happening on the misconception but misconception is on maya the misconception is or that that is the what we see is happening on the consciousness only sachidan is the reality so children under manifests as the world by the power of the saccidananda the other example is also good there are potatoes and lentils jumping in the kettle and the kettle is hot the water is hot the jumping potatoes and others are hot hot is the part of the sachidan on the pot it is the oven that is the heat heat does not belong to the pot or pan does not belong to the potato the water nothing but we never say that the best fire that is the cause of all suffering oh my hand my finger was burned by the pen how the pain can burn you it was big shape projected and percolated and the it give the appearance it is hot whether it has no carry intrinsically characteristically it has no heating power hitting power is from saccidananda so all we are working we're seeing viewing acting reacting everything we do it is only the power of consciousness our brain is functioning because of consciousness our ego is functioning because of consciousness mind is functioning commons consciousness if we go down down down my hand is moving consciousness it is coming through that different layers and making this as real i am talking i am working i did this i did that but actually it is only a robot robot is functioning because of the consciousness behind this is to be understood that that is nothing but that consciousness now arjuna is putting the same question [Music] as [Music] [Music] the power of brahman sat brahman that existing that brahman that's power that power is called maya huh do you get it all are silent yes sad brahma that brahman it's power ja what is that power suppose you are sitting here you are a musician that music power when it comes out we go oh we call you musician whether you call him mr sanchez and such or mrs sachan is it not so it is brahman when it comes out with the shakti it is a manifestation then it is called maya and maya sapi nasia and if that is the maya how can i destroy that saupi that maya also nausea destruction katang mohammed how will it be possible to destroy that [Music] judi mitta if you say maya is mithya non there he saw maya then there is no question of his destruction you say it is the brahmar sakti no understand the question arjuna says o krishna you said it is the maya is the power of brahman no if it is power of brahman you cannot destroy that because brahman is all-powerful there is nothing which can be more strong than brahman that to destroy this maya no so it is then the question comes how can i then destroy the maya maya will remain there because the brahman sakti the power of maya is called power of brahman if you call it shakti or maya then solang brahman is their power element surrounding the snake is there its poison will remain or the snake is there its going in wriggling motion will remain so you cannot destroy any time maya you are teaching us get out of maya how can i get out of maya what the logic that maya being the power of brahman you cannot destroy that then you have to disturb brahman but who will be there to destroy brahman now judimitta if you say it is no okay okay there is no maya then if it is not there why are you thinking of destruction of maya you may say oh no no no maya is not there so why are you bothering us with so much studying text that it is to be killed it is to be destroyed maya this is the very question so 24 verse the question is tell me how maya which is the power of brahman and power of brahman brahman is who eternal existence it is all the time there you cannot destroy that which is all the time there so the eternal existence can be subject to destruction if you say it is brahman's power as brahman is all the time there existing so you cannot destroy that which is all the time there by any means to destroy all the time means beyond time so in no time you can destroy that so maya cannot be destroyed if that maya is merely false if you say maya is all only you see for a moment but it is not there then the question how it's destruction then possible when both ways you cannot talk about maya and this destruction point got it clear logical fallacy economical that is the response bhagavan will have to say this is the question of arjuna on our behalf this question does not enter into our brain but arjuna is a very bright student so he is putting this question we take accept everything but here it says that arjuna said now you said that the special power of brahman that is called maya therefore that brahman is all the time there therefore the maya is also will be there all the time and because that which is all the time you cannot destroy that then the question of destruction of maya is impossible on this argument and if you say it is false mitta then there is mitta if it is not there how can you destroy that if it is non-existing there is a question of destruction here is no suppose one what example bad example okay support suppose one taliban person comes over here and tries to find to kill somebody and he found that everyone is wearing burkha and all this covered and this and that and find no victim then whom he will kill them there is nobody to kill because he does not find maya there so similarly both his destruction of the maya is not possible that is the argument of arjuna now sri bhagavan now bhagavan will have to respond bhagavan krishna responds [Applause] [Music] maya how it has different moods as it were maya has its different moods as it were and that is get associated with it how that i am telling you what are these triguna satya rajas and thomas when it does not function it does not do anything then there is no creation there is no projection but when one gets up another less three gunas this balance creates this universe so maya is also equal to three gunas shat ananda but no sorry rajas and thomas so three gunas and when it is in perfect peaceful state brahma it remains in the brahman stage it is hidden and when this balance comes in that creation starts see when the three gunas are in balance a person is very calm and quiet no this balance comes i am tired then what will happen your head will go to bed thomas your mind is sometimes oh i have to do this you jump out and go on doing something it's activity so both are activity going head down to bay pillow that's also activity thomas activity raja's activity you jump and go and do some active thing sattva activity also will say i'll go and meditate no so these are all functional things so long you are in the three gunas but when you are samadhi when the three gurus are perfectly balanced there then what he does he has no work that brahmagani has no work he is enjoying his own place that's all so the maya manifests because of the three gunas this this balance and when the three gunas are perfectly balanced creation destruction sustenance nothing remains the maya function of maya there is no function of maya there is no maya at that state that say brahmagani in the state of samadhi they have no maya but when they come now and again shatna rajas thomas brahma ganesh will live in satta quality more others we are leading rajas and thomas so this is the world of duality maya world so 25th verse says mayakam that which is called as maya cosmic ignorance bhabha sanjuktam yokt with various ideas qatari army i am telling you sinusoidal listen listen to me the nature guna samyak out of the balance of the qualities of gunas what are the gunas trigonas satyr rajas and thomas tom that mayam maya also advocate is the doer of wonders actually maya does all wonders because she has three gunas and with the help of trigonos she can create wonders in the world all good things holy things unholy things frightening things soothing things beautiful flower poison oak to the beautiful fragrant flower no everything is in this creation thomas rajas are sattva that is the way the world is created so the running transition bhagavan says listen to me i am describing to you that which is called the cosmic ignorance what is called the maya it is yoked with various types of ideas maya is always connected with various types of ideas ideas of sattva rajas and thomas that maya the doer of all wonders to the balance of the qualities shattered rajasthan thomas is called natural prakriti when it is perfectly balanced it's called prakiti prakiti means there is the existence of the trigonometry it is not dead only it does not raise his hood only samadhi level those who go beyond prakriti otherwise what happens to us every day we go to the prakriti and come back from prakriti when you go to sleep all your other organs are withdrawn withdrawn withdrawn you dream and then we turn return return to your ego it's all there hidden as soon as in the morning comes you jump up all springs out at a time so that is the maya it is doing all wonders how by the balance of the trigunas there is no expression of it when disturbance comes then it appears to be the world and that is called the pradhan so we get a technical term the maya is wonderful or spectacular or unex unbelievable uh things mysterious things maya does all this thing because prakiti gunasamatwat because of the balance of the three gunas when the three gunas get balanced it is called the prakhiti and disturbance prakiti bikridhi should now use in the chant the mantra prakriti creation nittama this is the balance bikriti in distortion when it comes like this world prakriti is disturbed then it manifestation comes prakriti in balance there is no no world appearance it is like sleeping for my consciousness whole world is gone that is the state where we are in that unmanifest form that's why it is termed as prohibited is also called unmanifest state second and that manifest is when we dream or is we wake up and believe in this world so listen to me i am describing it to you which is called the cosmic ignorance maya that is yorked with various types of ideas and then maya the doer of wonders through the balance of the qualities the quarter the quality saturation thomas is called nature that's called the prakriti [Music] foreign this is the 26th verse 26 says praghanam pradhanam means the the original source atmoshat kritwa appropriating within himself serbam entire district remains udaasini indifferent destructible by knowledge tatadas avida individual ignorance shakti power brahma sweat blood because it's rest in brahman so what does it mean it means it is to be known that the power of consciousness is its essential nature this the maya's nature we are talking about maya maya's nature is the power of concept we have already said it is the power of consciousness is its supreme consciousness essential nature whereas the illusory power maya is changeable and dull two things are the power of consciousness is its own nature consciousness does not borrow anything from anyone but maya has to borrow understand the waves have to borrow the strength from the ocean ocean need not have to borrow anything to create waves and ripples brahman does not need the help of anything but maya needs the help of brahman [Music] if you say so there is no two but they are all trying to understand we are seeing the maya therefore we are establishing what is maya and then we will cut that maya because we are in the realm of my intellectual level yes there is no maya because the brahma-sakti he here krishna taking the same argument that it is to be known that the power of consciousness what is the power of consciousness it is consciousness power of consciousness is it's that supreme concept essential nature essential nature means you cannot change that the heat the power of fire what is the power of fire burning can you make any time separate the heat fire is there and no burning power yes what is the chemical something chemical is there no mica or what you scientists are sitting eye silently what are you seeing fire my car what is there that you can put your keeping mica and then you will not feel the heat but anyhow for our that is not the i'm bringing you may i bring that argument but i am not uh going to that that will destroy our argument here so rather take this argument that you cannot think of any any anywhere there is fire and fire there is no heat or burning power that's called its intrinsic power ice and it has no cool coolness you cannot think of like that so that is called the intrinsic nature so here it is known to be the consciousness consciousness is the content of brahman it cannot be destroyed it cannot be brought out it cannot be done it is that is intrinsic nature whereas this maya what we are seeing that illusory power maya it is changeable it depends on something which depends on something you can change that independent there is nothing you can do when one depends on something that person you can change his views opinions and other things so here also maya is changeable maya changes all the time in in different gunas manifesting sometime in satin and the blossoming flowers are coming sometimes no sometimes dry period going fire is coming so maya is changing his different moods as it were so this is changeable and it is dull dal means what matter maya is matter brahman is consciousness this is the analysis consciousness is intrinsic quality and in brahman you'll find nothing but consciousness and bliss but in maya it is appearance and it is dependent and it is dull it can be changed this is a product of maya it can be changed you can change the chair you can change the table you can change the floor you change the wall everything you can change unconscious because conscious it appears because of the presence of consciousness behind it cannot function anyway that is the thing to be understood in vedanta that maya has no consciousness of its own it is a borrowed but it's not two things if you say maya and then you're making two things two things yeah but we are taking in the question how you destroy the maya when you bring the question of destroying maya then you are standing on the duality because i am seeing maya i will have to destroy the maya but ultimately reality experience maya there is no maya it is brahman ali but i am not seeing that that's why this all this discussion is coming how can i which which process this maya which is so strong before me really existing how can i get out of that and to feel that it is yeah yes how can i feel or be that absolute consciousness where there is no change the maya in maya everything changes in maya is it a matter matter appears to be consciousness because of the consciousness behind brahman brahman is all the time consciousness it does not depend on anything no secondary thing is need to support but maya needs a support prakiti needs a support the potent pan needs the support of the heat but heat does not depend on whether you put a pot or there is a flame only or you put a piece of wood its function is to burn that will it continue it is that intrinsic quality that consciousness is the quality of brahman so 26 verse is translated like this that when she means maya when she appropriates everything and remains indifferent she is called the primordial soul no we have not come here we are reading what which verse we read 26 we read mayak kang bhavasan 26th direction [Music] that is the verse 26 let us read that one by one man meaning i read but running meaning i am going to that 26. so what is the verse which is chanted means when she appropriates everything and remains indifferent she is called the primordial source pradhana this maya when she appropriates everything yet it remains indifferent she is called primordial purdhanam sarvangti [Music] she remains in who doesn't mean different things are happening he is not affected by that when that appropriates everything remains indifferent she's called the primordial source that is called the pradhana as he is destroyed by knowledge or he is destroyed by biddah darkness is destroyed by light so ignorance is destroyed by knowledge so as she is destroyed by knowledge that's why she is called ignorance destroyed by knowledge that's why it is called ignorance knowledge opposite is ignorance so because it is only destroyed by knowledge that way is called the ignorance likewise she is called the power of brahman as she rests on brahman so these are the two ideas pradhanam what is prudhana when she appropriates everything he does everything in the maya changing and transforming one to the other to the other to the other but it remains indifferent without doing the change yet he she remains independent that's why he called primordial source or pradhana she functions as pradhana pradhana [Music] as this she is destroyed by knowledge bidda that's why she is called ignorance of it likewise she is called the power of brahman brahma shakti as she is resting on brahman cosmic level he's resting on brahman that's cycle brahma shakti and when it's appropriates everything and remains indifferent that means identifying with the consciousness then that is called the primordial course or that is called the pradhana pradhana means a state when it is not manifested putana is the seed state and that manifests into the gross causal level in the subtle level and this gross level there's all manifestation down ego in intellect you cannot cast them it is very fine but it all sucked into that prodhana and then manifest itself in the world [Music] [Music] eternal caitanya means consciousness if there is no consciousness binaci this maya does not come if there is no consciousness there is no question of maya i'm sorry without the consciousness without the ocean there cannot become any ripple or wave so the consciousness is there the maya is sin because in the power of brahman that's why he says 27 that it is bina caitanya or nattra na deity and not yatishtati it cannot rise this maya cannot stay you cannot play therefore that's why maya is called the shaktiya brahman by brahma-badi naha brahma-badina means those people who are realized brahman and then tells us about brahman not ordinary people but people of realization of brahman they relate to us so what are you getting we are getting back to the same argument again that binaca eternam without consciousness without the ocean there cannot be no udaiti noticity in the ocean there is notion here is notion can there be any ripple and wave and foam and big waves smaller is possible no because there is notion ocean can remain without foam wave ripple etc but ocean must be there fast then comes the all these so maya is functioning on the ground of the ocean of consciousness so bina caitanya without caitanya without consciousness or not throw in another place no deity nacho tishti maya does not spring up cannot dance then this whole world drama is going on you have to understand there is ocean of consciousness behind and on that the drama of stars and galaxies and planets and humans and sub-humans and ocean and rocks and mountains whatever we see are all dancing in that because of that foundational thing the consciousness whatever that's why the realized souls brahmavadina those who have realized brahman and speak about brahman brahma ghani's what they say brahma shakti ahu they say this is the shakti of brahman that's why my eyes defined as brahma shakti 27 bars so running translation maya can neither arise nor remain in any place other than in consciousness therefore nwarshar brahman declared her to be the power of brahman brahma shakti alone i think it is easy okay is any problem here anyone all understood what i i cannot see previously you said that the knowledge is what destroys ignorance and everything that we are seeing is maya so what is that knowledge that will remove the knowledge of the consciousness knowledge of the brahman that this is problem yeah is brahman and the ripple first you say it is maya but when you know the knowledge of brahman then you know it is made of the same waves and ripples are made of ocean water only but i always see matter i am seeing i am seeing in the ignorant state that's why when i get to knowledge knowledge is what but that is maya is brahma shakti that is the knowledge will dawn in our power of brahman this is nothing but power of brahman movement of brahman in this name and form so that that that is the knowledge when it will come then there will be all confusion will go what you see you are standing on brahman you are eating in brahman that's a brahmarpanam brahma brahmagnu brahmana why do you say all these things everything there is nothing but brahman even the hand is brahman misunderstanding is brahman your understanding is brahman but but that if that is a state when you really see brahman everywhere i am seeing in the money ignorant state and for me good is good bad is bad hot is hot cold is cold i have all duality i cannot say that but i will have to hammer on my mind i am seeing wrong but it is all brahman it is all ishwar is never ignorant of itself yeah right so why do they call the cosmic thing cosmic ignorance you say because for it is for our understanding when my ignorance is called they call it ignorance because yes he has created this to create duality the duality is ignorance but he is not under the power of him under the power but he is the power to create also so though he creates creating creating when you create this duality is coming so we will say that it is he is creation it is duality is come whenever duality comes it is not that absolute but when a duality comes it is his power being in duality he retains his individuality absoluteness he has the power to do he can withdraw that power and that is the point therefore 27 verse and then we read it it says that maya can neither arise not remain in any place other than in consciousness therefore the noah sabraman declared har means the maya to be the power of brahman 28th verse and then we stop shakti [Music] tell you shakti prabhaksami i will tell you the philosophy of shakti sriniv listen taught that what i say samahito means very perfectly poised mood calm and syrian grasp it it is a subtle subject i am going to tell you so you know i am going to tell you the by which this whole universe has come from shakti this power of brahman taku said in the gospel brahma and his power brahma shakti that i am going to tell you sinus show but it is not casual hearing will not do srinovito with your one pointed mind now listen not here but listen listen means pay attention what is that brahmana chitchat brahmana brahman brahman its two power is there chit and jala consciousness and jordan means the matter as it were as if to add brahman has two powers one is the consciousness side another is jordan brahman is all concerned you are saying jara and jordan because i am in jala so you will have to explain says in the matter so brahmanas there are two types of power parikita it has been proclaimed it has been sung by the sages that there are brahmanas two shakti and one is the consciousness another is the matter ramakrishna said what vidya shakti or vidya here two shakti but here they are saying brahman has two shakti one is the consciousness aspect another is the jala aspect because inner maya the what is jaura that is dependent on consciousness and what is consciousness it is independent of anything it can retain so that is the verse number 28 let me read out here the translation i shall describe the power principle shakti to you listen to that with straight past mind due to the difference between consciousness and matter two powers the power of consciousness and the power of inertness of brahman are proclaimed here power of shakti and jawa may matter matter is better explained the innateness it does not want to move when you put consciousness behind it starts moving so that's why it is another way of matter is explained as inertness so two shakti here to different points of consciousness of matter it is the power of consciousness and power of inertness in advancements which does not move it is dull it is it is it is a matter it is subject to change it has no freedom of its own that is called the matter so these are the two powers of brahman let us right that all the science technology minus brahmagana everything is opera everything is changing everything is subject to say today's science tomorrow it will change today we say science science sciences he has gone up to this part but tomorrow someone will bring some new revelation will come in his mind so it is changed but brahma ghana no change as has been experienced by the sages in the thousands and thousands of years in the caves and forest and now today also as buddha have realized today also same that's why it's called the changeless and that is called the changeful approximately experience yeah when you go to the apparatus you see experience it just direct directly directly means without the help of your eyes ears senses mind no tools are there direct means minus any media now i am seeing you i have my eyes i am my nervous system my brain i have my connection with the mind and then connection with my intelligence in connection with my ego so all these are so many factors so it comes a distorted image is coming but when one becomes bereft of all this then you see the brahman and brahman there is no brahman even no difference no gap it is brahman alone everywhere makes it this division okay so we end here om shanti shanti shanti [Music] so tomorrow we'll have our gospel class but we'll spend some few moments on this keyway if there is i think that so many things are written here oh [Music] okay oh it is not given there no question is it so then it's good say something oh too yeah here somebody says say something okay but then one question came so oh one question what is the difference between brahmana and part of are they the same yeah brahmana and parabrahman are used in different places para means supreme and brahman is brahman so to define brahmanas para or opera opera means not primary you know ultimate but brahman in the case of brahman ultimate non-ultimate these words don't make any sense brahman is brahmana but in some places they say parabrahma parasakti etc to in a context to put a idea of brahmani supreme para means stress to highest highest super so that's why they use it the term but i don't think there is any distinction between para brahma or brahman brahman is brahman if you say parable does not add anything like you know you respect someone in hindu culture they say c c c c c math 108 so it does not mean anything no name is name that is the person you are glorifying c one three two three five c ten shimat holiness high he is highness holiness and thus you can add more one more thing but you mean that that that holy person whatever you are meaning so brahman is such a word we use somewhere to make it understand to make it much clearer to that it is the supreme truth the truth if you say truth then why can why do you say supreme truth because we don't understand we make a mess [Music] if we say truth then we say oh is it what type of truth so it is supreme truth unchanging truth unchanging truth truth means unchanging why do you say unchanging the extra words you are using because we don't understand that and if if someone gurus or our scriptures say that we go here but it does not register in our mind that it is meant something higher so that's why this language words are always just to express some greater idea and people use it in different place particularly the sages for our benefit to make it more clear look at that what book we are reading what is the newness it is a name of the book is new but we have read this exactly these ideas in other books also you have read that with some servopiano approach then what are [Music] many other dog dishway etc the truth is the same it is the supreme truth is the same thing only in so many ways they want to captivate our mind so that we can grasp the object rightly [Music] brahmani sachitananda and if you understand saguna brahma sometimes brahman is used as sagoon brahma that's why in that reference parabrahma is understanding as the nir ghuna brahma because brahman has no name no form no limitation it is all the nature of consciousness but at the same time guna when you attribute guna god is kind we say that's the saguna brahma when we have i pray to god christians the most muslims in the judaic religion when they pray allah isha or whatever they say is a vast expanse of infinity but it has this quality of guna saguna is the first manifestation of brahman niruna to shogun one step down with the help of maya that maya with quality qualities if everything is brahmana when we desire same subjects all is brahman but that is clearly not the case for example a beautiful sunset is brahman but wealth etc is not how do we differentiate this is the question if everything is brahmana when we desire sense objects that is also brahmana but that is clearly not the case a beautiful sunset is a brahmana but wealth etc when to accumulate they are not same true you are correct that's why everything is brahman is the ultimate truth one who reaches the flight of understanding perfect understanding he sees coming from that experience he's brahmana everywhere for him sunset is as beautiful as the ugly thing in the world there is no too because he has had the experience of oneness but we live in the duality for us though we say it is everything is brahman but my my mind does not understand that it is only lip service my leap is talking distinct it is a lip service but i have to go from which is ugly to good good to best and best to beyond so therefore for us yes last greed and all these things lower category of truth and then love affection and sacrifice giving something to the good of others these are another level it is higher truth and beyond that as ramakrishna said a god if god comes you will ask for school hospital help rehab center this that you will ask for that you'll say god so this is another level so that's why swamiji's definition is very good we travel from lower truth to higher truth to higher truth and reach ultimately the highest so we'll have to do that because we are in ignorance because we are in maya for us it is true we will have to handle that and see that way that it is yes maya brahman is there lost is bad love selfless love is better charity is good than hoarding yes these are qualities we have to adapt gradually and that is the way we step up one step up one step up one step up one step up and when you go all these duality vanish then when you come down ramakrishna said everything is made of the same element as the roof is made and the stairs are also made of the same ingredients everything is sachidananda that will be the state ultimately okay so but we are here so we have to understand our opponent condition and gradually step by step go on okay done jai shri guru maharaj thank you thank you shanti shanti shanti see you tomorrow again sarvadevan will i will give no gospel tomorrow okay so tomorrow i will be here for gospel again jaima thank you today we celebrated siva maharaja's memorial and just wonderful everyone was overwhelmed with the experience you can you can all can see everything is there in the youtube a beautiful program about two hours no yeah 10 30 to 12 30 or 12 at almost two hours program many interfaith people came and they spoke uh some giveaway center then also some christian denomination from buddhist denomination wonderful and harmony she he was a person of parliament of religions person always we are one we are one within one with that truth ah you say that was his heart oneness oneness oneness and the sun in the moon indus yeah in the rainbow yeah wonderful yes he was really liaison between the world of diverse fragmentation to the idea of unity oneness wonderful and ramakrishna stands for that harmony bringing together did not dissension some is vivekananda in the parliament of religion says not dissention no dissension but acceptance embrace everyone everyone is in the path of the lord going according to their own tendencies and that was the way he used to go and mix with everyone and really really was wonderful anyhow we miss him and we don't miss him also miss him in this sense that he was sitting there meditating every day three two two three times yeah with uh anyhow how much he loved people and their suffering and in their difficulties that is called spiritual life now we were reading this morning no swami buddhism is saying that you have your vision and experience is it right or wrong you are seeing that's good you are seeing something you saw some experience of vision and experience but has your life been transformed and that is manifesting as a love and blessings to others and sacrifice for others this is the sign of your spirituality then you know that your vision is meaningful other meaning is you see something that's okay what it matters neither it changed your life it should change your life and that will express in the world as love affection we cannot forget someone if someone has is that person maybe have behaved with me for 20 years one day something has happened i remember that incident what is my spiritual growth who am i what type of god meditation and prayer is that huh and ramakrishna i can remember i remember everyone buy a little thing if they have done any any point of time for me a little something i remember with that good quality and we remember with that that entire thing goes that big as a bad big and all are gone all the generosity all the love all the affection all the dedication is gone one day so that is not spiritual growth that's why we are stunted our spiritual growth spiritual growth means manifestation he goes out of the way you know our swami shaana namaj was here he used to go out of the way to help people sometimes we at the cost of us our really little uh this discontent bringing someone always let him stay honey he stays creating trouble for all no no no let it be let it be gone so is it that's the heart so anyhow some may say it is bad administration in administration is not our purpose of life administration is only a simple thing because we are put into that but developing our spirit developing our heart for all but balance is good because we are also to understand how much we can do how much we cannot do but he used to go out of the way so shiva maharaja used to go out of the way all the time jaime thank you thank you you
