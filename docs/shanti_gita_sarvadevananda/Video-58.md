[55. Shanti Gita - Class 55 - Verses 29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmY6KpxVIfs)

[Music] [Music] lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and ever more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace to you are reading the shanti gita song of peace and we are fifth chapter we read the other day 5 25 to 28. the sum and substance of that is that if you can give up everything and you get engaged in you in devotion to me and if you one pointedly do your spiritual practice again and again and performing activities nishkama karma performing activities with no desire but with the desire for my pleasure my grace you are working not for any other desire but one desire is there mata pretty loud with the mind intent on the getting the pretty the favor the love the blessings of me means god and not only that moi kristo arpanam serban at the end of the karma offering everything unto me offering krishna orphanage then all this performance will lead you to the path of purification of your mind and if you do that then what will happen then we'll dawn in your heart the viveka the discrimination the discernment it will generate upon you and then you do the spiritual practices as and with atmo with the personal desire for knowing the self then that idea will come even and as a result then your heart will be seeking for hungry for god or you will be very restless for god then it does it see it is it is not an easy thing to get into we always think that samadhi and this and that but we don't do the preliminary works so preliminary works are very important first of all that's why these verses are very important in personal life to apply first of all one should be devoted to god and god alone and then one pointedly keep the mind to practice whatever we got the instruction from guru another or even we studying the scriptures and things we got it and then we cannot sit idly biddha karman is common performing actions without any desire but with the desire not pretty loud also but for the desire for gaining devotion to me or my favor and at the end of the karma mahikri dua or panang serbum offering everything unto me at the end chitto mind will be pure then naturally discrimination will come mind mind will understand this is wrong this is right so from inner inside it will come nobody needs to tell that we need not have to read the book to tell that your mind will be your guru your mind will tell you vibe and with that you will do this then you will start the sadhana how as viveko sampracti your own biblical analysis or discriminative mind you gain in your mind and that will direct you to sadhu nani what are the sadunani suddenly vivek rago samadhi shatsam bhakti et cetera and atmo then then you have the desire for the self very important point no one feels attraction for atman or brahman or the self unless his purification of the heart comes and unless he does sudden spiritual practice and then mind will be eager to get to the realization of the self then he will be searching for a person who can show me the path huh that's why surah muni he says that that sancharo then the student will go to the teacher and said oh teacher oh master guide me i am burning in the hell fire of this world and worldliness you please show me the path samsara my ill fate it is guiding me in wrong direction here and there ma tarayo please please help me shankaracharya you're teaching us and by your kind and gracious grants please accept me so here 28 verse we read sangsrei sadhgurum pragam dambhadi dosovarijito then sangsrat gusadguru then he will go to a real teacher and who is pragma which is well versed in scripture as also wisdom damn hardy-dos they'll be bereft of ego pride this type of fault many vanities and imperfections being bereft of that then he that student will engage himself guru sheba tonitam he will be serving his guru and it turns all the time by that two-swith guru to swayed guru then he will satisfy or please his gurus who is isharam who is god himself meaning why because this guru previously all the scriptures now it is available you know everything is available on google you don't need any teacher what you want what gurus do not know even such things are available in the google at a time you can get all the commentaries all the explanations all diverse world thoughts are together but in early days it was not so all the knowledge was within the guru's guru absorbed and experienced and he will tell you little by little that's why so much guru sheva was emphasized nowadays guru sheva does not mean guru rather you follow the guru's instruction that is guru shiva and also these things so you have to start like that because that is the knowledge that's why we say in our tradition guru is takur that also we say guru's guru he is the oddi guru so you serve ramakrishna i love ramakrishna our tradition is much modern because this guru bad my guru versus your guru is always a conflict no and people don't like the other gurus my guru my guru's group and you are that guru's group okay so separate but not that ramakrishna is the guru so realize god what is the guru's message and through this channel the guru's grace has come god's rama krishna's grace has come in our life so we respect them that's true but we need not have to fight with my guru greater your guru less and i am earlier than you so you are only this so this type of whole foolish ego ego fight comes between the disturbed disciples so that's why not that guru is the guru is god and guru that that spirit that that guru is that purity incarnate that and earlier as i said that was in the very you have to find a guru you have to go to himalayas where you find gurus uh they will be seated some corner and you have to learn sankara when he got he was out of the crocodile he was to leave for eight years and crocodile was catching him and mother he cried out ma mama please help me help me crocodile is taking me my life is gone you give me permission for sannas for monastic life and when mother gave the permission and fainted and by that time the crocodile disappeared and sankara came back and then said mother and took by from mom to be because eight years was his life lifespan that was he was born by that time he has mastered all these vedas vedanga with the guru eight years old boy all the scriptures heavy scriptures all memorized in his mind so now he's gone but there he is to take sannas but where you find a guru he had he's in kerala in southern part of india in those days no train no plane no car hey you are coming today after a long time no google maps no google map so those facilities are not there and his google map is what where is the guru he found that one great guru is there what his name is govindapad where he lives postal address on the bank of narmada which is 700 miles long you find your guru how will you find guru find on the bank of normanda on the bank of norway where will you find that boy with the tiny eight years old boy with the tiny legs walked walked walk to october and norma all through the bank of narmada and ultimately it is at umkareshwar because they are all hearing there is a great jogi kamindapad he lives on the bank of kanuna where where where you go here and the other sadhu say he lives here okay go go go like getting that type of information ultimately reached say govinda and he was waiting for such a guru such a disciple so this is the searching for guru why there are so many sadhus india is full of sadhus so why this govinda path ah that is the guru who can give me and he is the better when you bargain shop shopping you go so guru guru bargain you can do at the beginning because who is better guru so you can choose that time but once you choose then you think that this guru is god that's all finished you have done marriage is done it cannot be disturbed so that is the so that guru is to keep that wisdom that's why when shankaracharya went there and he first met govinda father govindapad was stepped in samadhi after some days operating and shankaracharya went and saluted and chanted the bars composed the sasket verse and yogi came down from samadhi looked at him with compassion and said yeah you have come i'm waiting for you to give this treasure the home to give so he was and the student also went there and then he had the wisdom transferred so he had there holding the treasure and to give give to him he cannot throw the pearls among the swines normally that happens when you throw the pearl on the swines swines do not understand the value of the pearl so they treat it like mother said no oh no there was one one jewel nike there is this jewel on the cart and the bathing guard right like a stone and costly jewel but village women used to come and take fetch water from the that river or something and they used to rub their feet to make it clean and all the uh pit rubbing they to make it they don't know the value then they thought it is a stone so washing and cleaning the feet they used to rub on that and then one day it will dwell that that's why it is difficult to understand the real guru and if you don't understand you treat him as a ordinary thing no so that's why guru is that who gives unconditionally but he tests us disciples competence that's why it was so much you please the guru please the guru that was the idea beforehand but nowadays you don't need to please the guru else yeah you can go and say hey give me good diksha okay okay come come come no no doctor these are all jokes am joking no now he said guru sheva tonitam then the student going to guru after doing karma after having love for god generating that devotion for god chitto is becoming pure and offering all the karma and the results every day at the end of the day i offer everything offering that and you become free like that so chitto becoming pure and then sansai sadhguru you have to approach and take refuge at the feet of a guru who is sadhguru wise person and will be freed from all these draws of human character then guru shiva to nittam then they will be engaged in guru sheva there are two ways guru sheva means guru's personal needs are being satisfied so he will feel compassion we are reading that when brahmananda was leaving his body he called yesterday night we are reading that when he called the one of his attendants mentioned the name sami nirvana and called my child you have served me so much and compassionately he said i offer i i bless you that you have realized brahma ghana and he was ibrahim by the blessings of guru so these powerful gurus whatever because of their compassion and of course they are full of compassion but you have to draw the attention of that compassion fan is here if it is a fan rotation you want to cool your body you have to come close to the fan you can sit over there and say oh there is no fan so that is the going to the guru and to draw attention of his grace then to sweat guru and then he will try to please the guru ashish he is god guru is ishara tattati you can then by the grace of guru tattoo even the tattoo means the truth we can sachida these are awards also beyond that means beyond speech and mind you attain to that loved one attaining that knowledge that the tattoo the truth of the truth the truth over the truth that eternal truth guru prasad by the grace of guru one will attend that so that was our preamble now today we read now what happens if guru gets pleased what happens 29th guru prashani paratha [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do now what happens if the guru becomes gracious upon you guru prashanthi when guru becomes president no compassionate and prasanna means pleased simple word pleased when guru becomes priest guru name you attain lago means attainment of paratha to me supreme truth what is supreme truth supreme truth is saccidanando all other truth relative truth the table is here it is relative today it is here it will not be there tomorrow i am here i will not be here after some time so the clock is there clock will not be there after some time sun is there it may not be there after some day but that tattoo is a paratha to the supreme truth which is unchanging absolute truth so guru personally when guru becomes prasanna when the teacher become pleased one attains the supreme truth that means brahman atman identity tata from that what happens if you attend that supreme truth tata tartu you become fully accomplished oh what i am to attain i have attained i don't need anything perfection comes you know there is nothing in the world which can tell this that i have got i won't get it you get a job of hundred thousand your heart will be seeking for more 150. 150 you get 200 200 you get 250. it goes on 300 400 500 i know some ceos earn 1 million but they are satisfied no still but this this paratha by guru prasanna guru's grace when one attends i don't need anything i don't want anything nothing is my i'm lacking nothing so that and that is the first point total satisfaction there is nothing that's why even the last temptation comes no these temptations are nothing this this this this joys and fun like cut openings oh jama you are showing me i'll give you dancing girls and i'll give you how much pleasure in the heaven give keep all those your dancing and singing and all these things i don't have any i didn't matter little it is like a ashes before me chive also those who attend that we do not understand if one gets a gleams of that joy this whole world palettes into nothing in their own little glimpse of that that makes them fully saturated with joy you know unspeakable joy so kritato so i don't need anything i don't need anyone's support so latu maharaja was latimaras and the uh some devotees who are taking care of la to mars at the end and latitude is not eating or cooperating sometimes and they sometimes they just to feed him or tell him something swami if you do like that then i will not be able to come i will not be able to serve you anymore so i one day he said if you don't eat i will not eat that was the last trick every day then out of compassion latimer will eat but that day he said if you don't eat swami i'm not going to eat i'll also fast matka so don't do we don't do it what is that to me then then he said kon killati who feeds durgamayi khilati do you think that you feed me and because of you i am surviving he said kon khilati who feeds me durga my killati mother durga is feeding me so they are so inner conviction they don't care for anything unwanted that's why that is the real unknown spirit not egocentric spirit but divine centric spirit so krita but it is interesting that uh on that this uh you depend on guru and guru will do things for you but the animal to look like that for example yoga says that guru shastra all teachings friends are only supplementary only students effort is the main thing to accomplish yeah and why this is because but still it is focusing so much on oh that's right this is not a matter of joke gyano margi is saying you are atmo you okay you will understand after that you you are nothing you do your all spiritual practice at the mature point you will find you did so much hori maras then skripa kripa agrippa that is the bhakti margo genuine bhakti margo is that when i cannot do anything you are everything but does not mean i'm not talking of insincere bhakti yoga practice student or i'm not talking of the insincere gyanojo student ganga yoga student will have to make an effort bhakti-yoga will also have to effort bhakti yoga also have to come to a point that it is my effort is zero as much if what i do i cannot bhakta speaks every day that way oh lord you are everything i am nothing i'm not but still ego is there in gano jogo you do your effort day and night you say i'm atman two but you'll find last god's grace that is the last needed part hari maharaja says now so this is no contradiction here you have to make your ego zero and bhakti also you have to make your yogurt zero saturn bhajan is necessary otherwise you will be lazy okay the whole christian world stands on that what vicarious atonement or is christ has suffered for us all so we have to do nothing we'll go on sunday i have to dress up and go to the church listen to the sermon and come back and christ will do everything for me and i go on eating drinking and do whatever i dancing all this that is an excuse that is not the point bhakta should love god love thy lord with a heart with their soul read the gospel of crime bible but people don't do that only going to church once a weekend and for one hour and then that is your spirituality no that will not happen unless you have tremendous faith in god tremendous faith comes when the cheetah is we have read this just now bhakti-var nagayanapat no distinction result in result is the same only language is different bhakta starts with i am nothing i am nothing we are lord everything you are everything and really he believes that he prays that he try to be convinced in that idea and settle and understands really my effort does not do any effort but i am crying i am praying every day every moment i am saying oh lord i am helpless please help me i am helpless i am nothing please do something for me i cannot do meditation i my tears don't come and all this this should be sincere prayer for the bhakta yuga name that i i cannot be away from you even for a split second i don't see you it should appear to me as if i have not seen you for so many years eons no so this type of intensity a bhakta should practice and with that practice you will feel i am nothing he understands taken this philosophy is not my effort can do anything i only can cry like a baby cries for the mom no mom may come take care or mom may take care half an hour later or mom may be busy outside and you cry for some time but it is you have to cry even the babies cry to draw mother's mom's attention mom knows the baby's needs really mother knows our needs but still mother likes [Music] don't repent that you will have to see call upon mother mother is always mother is waiting for you and when only you call ma then she will come forward and grab you she's waiting for your call mom loves mobs wants to take the baby but mom wants also this much they let i hear the voice ma from my baby so that's that's the real devotees of action then ma is always waiting for us our call to just take it up so this is surrendered as i said this ghana yoga what is saying yes guru's grace is there guru grisham krishna vaisnava as you know even in version of sastra says not that vedanta says only this bhushnawa literature says you got the grace of guru guru's grace krishna the lord's grace bhushan your devotees who love you those who are spiritual people their grace are saints saints holy people saints and holy people are always blessing good people are you not he was a good person don't you pray oh lord do good to everyone they are suffering we ordinary people pray and those who are illumined people they always pray for the good of others so three grace is available but one grace is lacking the grace of the mind my mind does not go towards god that's the self-effort question coming in bhakti in ghana no contradiction so guru prasad name so when guru becomes very pleased then the supreme truth will be attained tata will start to thereafter because of attaining that one will be fully satisfied i am fulfilled i don't need anything the whole world let it go all the pleasure of the world come to me it it is nothing you know and he becomes mukhtar means freed from bandhan the bondage of the samsara of the world world and worldly bondage you'll be freed and now paramatma specially free sangha from attachment totally free from all attachment so paramatma rupa he becomes i am that paramatman i am that that idea and that is the identification with that paramatma comes na song sorry after attending this he has never to come back to move into the world and worldiness and sophie punar bhabhav too in the bhabha updo in the world ocean of this worldly worldly ocean of turmoil no punahou he will never be born again and no sanctuary again he will not win the will of birth and death he'll be totally free that means all these problems of life is solved so but understand all these steps we have talked is very beautiful step by step decision that what to attain to this goal is not a matter of joke people take it very easily that okay i am reading vedanta witness consciousness there is that i say listen to this lecture and i understand everything what is this maya this is that it is not so easy bhava you have to be purified mind should be pure mind should pray for saguna brahmansu and nir gunavrambo you will be feeling attraction for sagunabrum also because it is condensed form of nirguna niruguna is nirvana the milk and then you boil and boil and boil and make what is called you know condensed milk no hootie purchase that is not condensed more corners more corners and with that conscious milk you make every form of ramakrishna milk milk minus water nir guna and that's condensed condensed condensed condensed by compassion he takes the form of your ish to devata your chosen idea think that and it melts it becomes ocean again so that is the satchidarananda ghana compact compact compact compact squeeze squeeze squeeze when you squeeze everything with the hydraulic pressure it becomes small no so god out of compassion hydraulic pressure else he condenses himself and appears because rama or christ or buddha or ramakrishna so you touch there it is condensed you touch little bit so sweet your brahman you identify totally you have to lose but when it is condensed milk you touch a little bit that's why taku said i don't want to be sugar i want to taste sugar the condensed so that's the expectation of the be beginners began is began or began that is their idea so nasang sarita so no songs are it they will not be in the cycle of bartender so be that person opi but what will happen in this ocean of worldliness they will not be there in the upanishad it has said the same supporting this idea if one knows the self-effulgent part of brahman the supreme cell then this bondage of the samsara which is the lust and greed those ties get totally shattered that means that ignorance which has these five forms they all die what are the five problems i rashmita attachment i then i get attached i attach i dislike it raga this one combination once i have accepted that second time i want to i i want to hold it not to once i got something i get interested in second time to have that and five types of a places that binds us into the cycle of bartender so avid ignorance osmita or with first child is ego ignorance ignorance has separated us from divine no ignorance first child first born is ego i the whole world putin eye i in our day-to-day home front i in our monastery form i everywhere i play up i i i i i'm attached to this i hate this that's the fourth and the fifth is the obin division of universe means once you have got it second time to get it again and if you get it not to live and hold on to that that is the clinginess of innovation clingingness to once you got some experience from something good or whatever you liked it the clinginess even the life clinginess for life no you don't want to die physical body is failing and doing and if it happens no some people cannot think of death and many people are ready vedanta people are always saying let that come i'm already that's a different thing but many people death they cannot believe it they are crying to till you know life support this support that's the word and some people say don't put me in lights out they'll die that's okay i'm ready so then and if you are really holding on to god then that will be more strong no that body goes what is that so this is the gattwa devam knowing that they were the self-evaluated truth servopash honey all bondaged all ropes of ties lord destroyed but in a moment clay sweet john moment to prahani all the claisha klesa means the afflictions all the afflictions which the birth death six changes you are becoming teeth is going high here is hearing is going out here is going grey so and one day everything but two these are the five so all will be conquered by this knowledge that is the punisher suggest now now you are your the main question was that how the people of wisdom live in the life so now that parts is coming now you have attained the knowledge by this process by guru kripa by your selfless work by making the cheat to suit the heart pure and offering all karma at the feet of the lord and guru prashad guru kripa and practicing everything and being detached from everything you will not be able to come back that is the first number you have read now you become a gandhi now so how will you how i will understand that you are organic as holy mother said two horns will not grow in your head one horn here that is fifty percent game gana has happened another horn is coming means another fifty percent is coming there is nothing as such outside yeah i can say that i have achieved ghana so you all come to me and i am against so nothing nothing as such to understand from outside is very very difficult so what he says [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] diverse are the ways of the ghanais after attending this knowledge they live in the world but that behavior pattern is so different because what you know the science proud of the karma means this life was going on in the trajectory you know you throw a stone and the stone lies last life stone is our thought last life when we died we had a thought that we will be this one thought and that is taking us to this trajectory of life all these stories happening in life we are moving and destination one day we will die but in between if you have a realization of god this way then what will even your rest of the life will go how can you change the trajectory now so that trajectory will continue so he summons samskaras no no more no more force added all are gone but the last trace of the what is called mass into velocity that momentum that momentum which is still pushing the body to down say another 10 years you will live or 20 years one will leave that 20 year will be by the impulse of the old momentum that's why someone will be totally detached from everything and silent withdrawn someone may be [Music] apparently enjoying good food good ornament in the body some some some holy people also behave like that you cannot understand a boogie he's a he's a enjoying everything and being a monk what he's doing huh because that is his and also the story goes one get a good food like a princely diet comes whether he goes he goes into jungle there are also food counts and another person he doesn't get four chapatis dried chapatis you may be jealous but you cannot do anything it is the past life's karma that this is the past he was a he has done some good karma so he was born in a rich family so or not now he becomes so nasty but his princely food luxurious things will come it will come around him because his momentum that is the way it goes that's whenever it is to go small people used to flock around him but you know there are many swamis some are very withdrawn they don't meet with people but someone is very friendly with people and they love him and swami loves them and they it's same wisdom is same inside but how the body's action and reaction is going on different so it's a four line big bars so i will quickly run again i will read next day what you said and let me finish this translation what i did [Applause] objects of enjoyment and belief of expectations some men of wisdom are indifferent they don't get attached to anything the thing is going on but they they will be in the midst of the people but not very popular they're not talk to much people and don't don't don't be very popular uh expression but that's why he is indifferent to who is talking what is that and don't care and withdrawn from sense objects that will be common of course they will be abundant of the objects of the environment be left of any expectation they don't expect from anyone anything all brahmacaris will do that internally but externally you will see someone more dominantly expressing them and some are well renowned as pleasure seekers you look at them there is what is the name that that renounce it is a monk um he came in this country also um he used to use gold ornament we are wearing gold ornament here and there and that all luxurious things and when he wants to eat everyone will have to give on nana [Music] and then bengali swami anyhow it is not coming in money but you will be shot with 100 items of cooked foods no all given in a in a silver silver bowls and uh but but i have heard from the host you to host him you need huge amount of money use big car luxurious car should be there and the people will silicon dress and all gorgeous like a lord but but when he is given he will eat so people have prepared maybe 50 items 60 items maybe all in the small bowl they said yeah and all silver silver plates silver this silver all silver and he comes and i have heard he just looks at everything and only takes maybe a glass of water or some little something because you can say he's not eating anything but he's like sorry outside people will say it's a boogie [Music] so it's very difficult to understand that's a greater example suppose you look at that krishna krishna is a royal king no he's a royal letter he's the king he's all so many um women in the gopis gopis in the childhood forget that when he is the king of the dwarka he has conquered how he has conquered so many countries and he will freed the country from the evil forces so they are born they are dead so their palace had women to protect them he brought all of them in the dwarka his own kingdom so apparently you will see oh my god so many he is enjoying he's like a kingly all pleasure he is having fun and he is he is a knower of god and this is the result but you don't rama one way have a rama krishna and he's half naked no cloth no food he cannot touch corn and coin his handbrake bends what will you do so these are exceptional example of course these are avatar you cannot put into category but the example is you can find that here is some will be behaving this way and some what is god is god himself christ came born in a manger no so sort of pitiable situation of birth and then whole life and carrying the cross and this and that but it is to grow devotion in others they come back but even the brahmaganis they are talking about that being deeply attached to sense enjoyments they move around sense objects their actions of the past lives are the root cause which create various tendencies due to the actions performed in previous lives the one who is distinct to have enjoyment due to the results of his past actions makes an effort to nation and live in luxury being internally being internally dispassionate and bereft of enjoyment so internally there it does not touch them because they have their once touched god one once you touch god it is called the that is called parasumuni and once you touch god then you have become perfect so internally no attachment but externally people will be found like that so ganny's behavior is really difficult to explain okay so we end here om shanti shanti shantihi harihum now question we have a gospel reading tomorrow by siva prana mataji how can you please you please your guru especially if you are far away from him there is a very easy way of pleasing your guru if he is a guru genuine guru they don't want that you should go and just serve personally feed him and put good food good rice good thing you may do that but that's secondary but guru will be happy if you follow guru's instruction and real way of serving guru is to follow the instruction good guru has given and divided a grow in love for god that is pleasing guru guru will be pleased genuine gurus don't want anything these are all externals but out of our devotion we do that when we go to our guru naturally we offer our respect and devotion but guru will be pleased if you become a spiritual personality if you transform yourself every day by doing more japan more prayer more in inwardness and more peace you get that will be guru's grace so even if you are far away but when you meditate on guru guru is near you where is the father he is with you your guru is merging in your easter so in your heart he is sitting there which guru the man guru no the spirit guru so the main thing is that guru will be happy if you realize god and you do intense japa intense practice guru's instruction follow ditto don't edit most of us edit even we forgot what guru has told many people and they create their own confusion because computer and everything is telling do this do that do that do that so i do this and i do that and i do that then you are doing your way not guru what has told and guru what is given is a traditional way so that is the tested gps now you don't take it you take your own gps and move so guru to please guru is very simple to be devoted to our spiritual practices second question if a householder attends brahmagano will he be able to perform his duties yes when swami vivekananda how he performed the world all the duties of speaking preaching correcting no and ramana maharshi he has a realized soul so realize soul how he did so much work for the good of the world no so no yes they will be performing only their internal attachment will be not there and they will they will see god everywhere they will see the gold everywhere not the ornaments only gold ornament thousand types of ornaments may be there we are all different outer casting of the some something truth is inside outside is something is a costumes so they will penetrate the costume and see the divine in everywhere and there are that's why they are always happy so brahma ghana once attends if a householder also attends will be able to perform all his duties but his presence will give joy to everyone he will be a source of peace and happiness to all and his knowledge and wisdom will be fully awakened so we are done two questions very good anything more no one has any question very good okay so mother bless you all and tomorrow then gospel class will be given by shiva prana prabrajika shivaprana at 7 30. thank you jaima you
