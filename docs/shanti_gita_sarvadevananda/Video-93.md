[89. Shanti Gita - Class 89 - Review - Swami Sarvadevananda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1keu16CD-M)

hmm Aya Thomas oh Lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and never more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face come peace peace peace be unto us all so we are revising the shanti-gita chapter one and we read up to verse number 20 last time now how do you read just you read that that's number 18 says at the time of deep sleep this visible universe is not there in the Deep Sleep state all the concept of the whole universe as if it's withdrawn and kept in the mind itself as a mind in the mind it is all involution it's involved into the mind and some prabhati when we get up when you get up in the morning in that mindana you see the entire universe comes up pops up Suddenly when you are in deep sleep this universe and its existence was not there at all you don't know the universe is is its existence was no perception of anything neither this universe dream Universe nothing but when you get up in the morning when you get up then manashi prabhati that in that mind in the prabhat in the early morning you see the entire universe then how can you be nausea that is not true that is not truth truth should be all the time but it comes at certain point of time when the mind is awakened in the external world and it goes to the dream world you see the dream world and when he goes to sleep nothing neither dream neither world so these are all cannot be true true should be that which undying and unchanging and all the time there so here is a very good analysis given that means but our eye Consciousness does not go away I slept I dreamed I was in the waking state that I that is the unchanging one it is not changing but this waking state is changing into the dream state dream state is changing to sleep State sometimes the world is here sometimes the world is gone from my mind there is no mind in my sleep time so if the mind you are paying so much attention to the world it depends on your mind only just to switch the Mind into another thing the another world will come up this world is all false let's say psychiatric patients they live in their own world people say no is an example how we see the world as our mind shows us that person we call seek but we are also sick peasants mentally where we seek this see the world not God so we are all mental persons don't from that perspective we are all mental percentage but but you know it is the point is that how one perceives the world as his or her mind gives him the impression no so this is the point therefore this is this world as you see you think it is true but it's not true had it been true it should be all the time in your awareness then we read 19 verse come on foreign before this manifestation it only the reality was sucked that reality existence was there only so no not there is nothing else kinchit nothing there is no deso not space no time no created beings which has come out of the Buddhas then what are these you link all these three verses you can get a good picture then he says before creation only the reality was there and there is no existence of this strategy jagat there is no time there is no space there is no condition no created being which arrives out of the panchavuta's five elements no five elements and its diverse infinite number of Divisions there is nothing as such so what was there then what is this universe it is Maya played This Magic there is nothing you know magicians do that we saw in our childhood nowadays they don't so I do not know there's a empty drum and if she said this is the table and he puts on the empty down see it's empty drum do you see and they put a stick and say this is the empty EMT empty then put it on the table Now cover it with a little cloth red cloth or something like it and then said what do you want you say I want mango and he puts his hand and brings out take a mango [Music] there is empty and nothing out of nothing mango is coming if really he could create the real mango then he would not be a magician because you can treat mangoes after mangoes after mangoes and big mangoes within every day he will be thousands of mangoes he can bring out and they can sell it how much money he will do without anything in the empty stomach but they are just a delusion it is a play of some what is called which is not existing but appears to be so and you're gonna deny they give you the mango you see someone says I want some another thing apple and apple comes out so anyhow so this is Maya you know in that reality shot this Maya which is non-existing but appears like a reality it is like suck funny Evo titam like there's a Garland and you thought it in darkness it is a snake snake has come out of what from the Garland Garland snake cannot come out but in your mind the snake has come out out of the garden the garden remaining same the snake has come out the world is come out but out of that existence Eternal existence there is nothing as such but it appeared from that nothing to something that means it is not so true therefore that's up Maya pravino vishwakarinavasati like that influence of this Cosmic [Music] you see the sun I also see the sun did you see the pews I see the pews you see the trees I see the tree all we'll have to see the same thing because in the cosmic plan Cosmic Maya Cosmic the power of their divine therefore we are under the spell of that so like in the dream you create your dream but all the people you create all the animals you create all the road trees plants it is your mind you have created everything and everyone looks the same in the 10 20 people they will see each other similarly but it is not there it is just yours lying down and you see the dream and where is that space so much fight so much fire so much fire is there rain is there car driving car class where are all this going on it's in your mind it has no reality at all so similarly this world has come out of the cosmic mine play play of the cosmic mind now 21st bus therefore under this context a they enjoy the enjoyment and the object of enjoyment in there I release the food enjoy enjoyment I felt the enjoyment and the object the food so three divisions of our day-to-day life of enjoy enjoyment and enjoyer and cut touch I am the Doer this is all dream there is nothing real very difficult to the reading is easy reading is easy to say is easy as if you have understood that I am also saying that you are also saying that it is easy but it's very difficult it is Maya food now foreign the action all nothing how can you think like that it's very very soft no like a dream you had it in the dream you were dancing your dream you are eating you are getting a good fish there in the dream you went to restaurant and they were having friends and fun and all this but nothing there is no reality in it so this is also no real it is like a shop now why are you having this big dream because of the mayanidra you are you are under the spell of the cosmic ignorance of cosmic ignorance Maya because of that you see this done drama drama going on it is appearance it is not going on at all they do so many things in their space you know Disneyland you go every day in the evening they have a soul in the space with the laser beam destroy everything at the real and that's the point now modern science has helped us to understand Maya much easier old example of snake and rope only the example now you have many examples you put your three eye 3D glass eye glass and go to see the movie see oh my God the whole world has changed it is something that you know nothing is just take out that and you see oh it is going on in the screen about 100 feet away from you see this is the 3D Maya sachirananda Cosmic Maya it's playing its own role so [Music] therefore this is this Maya Nidra that has caused this dream sansar this world and the Jiva individual being you me interacting with each other he foreign what is the cause of this not knowing your Atman you are ignorant about your Atman because I do not know who am I I am seeing the dream and I am taking it to be true we cry in dream we die in dream no we wake up out of heartbeat no even that is so much impact in the physical it comes but this is all dream so again um and again also is according to gunas and his power of expression yeah it becomes it becomes Maya it becomes that one consciousness appears in two ways one is individual ignorance another is the cosmic ignorance no this is to be understood Maya and Avida so he says it is a um because of this reflection of the Consciousness this it becomes two which becomes Maya and it becomes means the cosmic is your name master plan and individual what I create God has created every man woman I like one person I dislike another person I am creating my ignorance there I love someone hahaha he's my friend I hate someone hey he's a bad guy I am projecting my mind I like this flower I don't like this flower I like this food I don't like this food everywhere you are making a choice that's your ignorance your ignorance you are projecting on the cosmic ignorance Cosmic ignorance is innocent God has created the whole world we get attached to detached because my my ignorance has projected there so this is the very important point to understand we all see the sun moon stars someone may like the sun someone may hate the Sun [Music] bad days is crowded so it depends on the our individual projection that's called the Avida and the cosmic projection is the Maya [Music] ah 25 bucks [Music] because with the reflection of the superimposing on the teeth it becomes a reflected this sun reflects In the Still Water you see the reflected Sun it is all reflected sir here is some Consciousness it is the reflection of that real Consciousness on the Mind Lake we have mind in our just imagine there's a pot and the pot is the body and there is the water and the reflection of Consciousness reflects there and according to the click click Clarity of the Mind you are a holy man reflection is shining if it is if it is a pill with scam think of the one water pot where this come is filled out the sun is coming the reflection is not there but sun is there fully the same amount of rays are falling into the a picture where it is filled with scum and with water where there is no scum it is clear but dirty or it is clear distilled water difference will be done in manifestation but is the reflection of the same constitavas the consciousness which is limited by The Cosmic consciousness because of that other superimposition it appears like that and that makes what that makes a distinction it is called Isha karta saksi Cosmic Consciousness when reflected in the cosmic level it is called he is the Lord God kurta the Lord Brahma saksi is in sakshi you see Maya by the effect of this Maya so then the foundation of all this reflection is that Psalm that sun is unbroken it is the foundation of every object foreign that does not you cannot create that nothing comes out of that as a creation it does not die it has not burn it cannot be dried up it's without any change it is all the time on a test things are happening but this Consciousness remaining unattis is eternally free it is I told you about this truth that that reality remains unchanged that is and you have forgotten I told you the same principle same teaching in the bhagavad-gita Atman remember past also I am telling you now also but I have told you before remember that past and try to understand that this reality which is the Consciousness and this is the appearance this Consciousness does not die does not Bond it cannot not be burned it is unchanging it is always detached it is ever pure and is stainless so that is the truth you have to remember this is the verse number 27. now this body 28 verse [Music] is it very descriptive and it's been a very good description they are giving even when you think that it is a relative world is an existence but that relativity is also non-existing because it affects us you are standing on the pritis's ground what you know this body has come because of the sperm and the whatever for the mom and dad and boutique hospital this is called the body the body is born and his child it was like that same combination of the sperms and things so it then becomes a child and then child becomes crawling and ballet when his small boy it behaves one way and Germany when the youth comes he behaves differently and at being young then you marry someone's daughter someone's daughter you marry and you say you become this he's my wife he's my husband you get you get attached in this way and mohitamins deluded that way my wife my husband is the Chain of Thought here it is no connection to anyone I was born in my mother soon and when I became child I was shaped playing childlike when I became young my desires my Cravings my worldview changes and giving a gross example that someone gets married and then married on a situation they they are never related to each other that they know is my wife this is my husband and then there is no relationship you created relations you say or dhangi is my wife my husband all these things and dig it again their own child and that child it you are telling is my son and then getting attached to the child and father and daughter or son or something in that relationship how it is they are saying how the relationship is really created not through knowledge but through our thinking it's mine and me and mine is coming into just in the play of light things are coming and we are associating and sometimes we are detaching with that so he says then then they get attached to the Sun and that relationship so foreign there is no relationship with any other body now neither husband neither child you become entangled by your own fictitious imagination imaginary chain and you have become totally horrible and then you are crying my son he died in the war how can I survive without him son how it came into your life and you get related who who how you were born but we created a relationship one by one one by one this was critical analysis and don't take it very seriously when people will feel that this vedanta is making us a very heartless people in the society now no here you have to focus on the analysis the the teaching is here that we are depending on some relationship which were not connected of course you go Karma theory that will say something because you are connected you wanted that parent that's why you are born in that family where I am not coming to that analysis here is an example example is how without any relationship we are creating the relationship and in creating that relationship when someone is passing away going away or I am getting something I feel sad I feel suffer I suffer so much there's nothing nothing to suffer you are Atman we have just analyzed it is on the background of this context this analysis will prove that you are don't think your body this body behaved in his childhood one way in the youth another way in the old is another way and when you die it will be another way but even neither of these and when you are in the body you have relationship here and there and there and there but this relationship what does it go when you die where we believe in past life where is our past lives relationship where was my mom a past life or my brother sister whatever relationship so this is all they are trying to prove that we are in this vedantic perspective this is all the play of ignorance and that is appearing that you have really have lost your son or women know what a tragic thing but unjust thing has happened etc etc and you are overwhelmed with that but you are not that you are Atman you are worthless fire cannot burn you air cannot drive you this is the principle and this is all happening due to your immediate ignorance of individual soul and therefore get out of it so that is the tie of me and mine this is it is very difficult to get out of it this is a parcel it's the bondage it's very difficult to cut that bondage me and mine me and mine me and mine is the cause of all suffering Sami Vivekananda in modern language he speaks in his lectures no be and thine that is spirituality not me but thou and to expand me as with everyone that is spirituality swamiji said selfishness and selflessness selflessness is God why expanding yourself in the cosmic selfishness me mind my bank account my car my home my my my my my me me me my son my daughter there are many son who are suffering much more than your son your son may be having good home good car good thing and there are so many children who have nothing to eat today so make your child extend your children to them also that's called spirituality so but this is very difficult to get out of our mamata parcel the Thai the bond the circle of mindness but it's very difficult to savor that Circle by Surah manavi in Gods the god of death says see my condition I have some attachment I want to rule the world that say I mean caught in this trap and you boy no chicken they say I don't care for anything I want to know the Brahma again he appreciated the inner urge of that boy so um human to Divine gods and goddesses even they are also caught into this trap and is very difficult to cut this circle my wife my husband my children my relatives thinking that [Music] you are living in the world we will be overwhelmed with this relationship idea and you are thinking and living like a mura like a fool yeah he's stealing us all full we are so intelligent people and how they can say Yeah in the full in the sense because we don't understand what we are and we in forgetting that what we are thinking about ourselves this is the sad story you are not body you are neither the body where the boy child will come out of you see your Atman your Consciousness yourself so where the child will come if you are a body then you are not the body you are not the mind so servant therefore you give up all these misconceptions how you'll give up by analysis analyze analyze the argument here in santigita this chapter say bhagavan is giving the argument why you are not think seriously really what is the relationship with whom when I die what is the relationship with whom someone may be dying for me crying for me whipping for me but one when one dies who is what who is going with whom who is my near drd is that all this who is my enemy who is my friend Analyze This Way be realistic vedanta does not ask us to think hypothetical it's saying think realistically who are you don't that does not mean we have no relationship so long you are here you will have to keep this relationship mind it people's listening vedanta make a mistake of everything they damage their relationship their family life because I am better than I am not the body are you in that position in your mind to think that you are not the body and all relationships and fictitious but you have to love God you have to see God in others and you have to change that how you solve the problem but analytically not the body we love someone but the body with some love one because his sweet words we love someone who is beautiful no what is behind that that is to be loved we are not saying give up why you loved only one web and you are only loving the way away to think that it is water and love love it is ocean and Wallah so that is the teaching of the bhagavad-gita here at least Santi Gita we are reading today is very very realistic and vedanta is the most inspirational thing to give us connection with everyone because we are connected in that level of Consciousness not in this point of your little body mind transformation and changes we are all hanged we are all hanging on to our very limited bad ideas that I am like this this much this much is connection with somebody it is not the body it's not the mind but it is the ground which is called sachidananda the Consciousness so not Tango therefore saying bhagavan says Almighty where is your son either you first you accept that you are the body then body to body you have your own son but you are not body then where the sun comes from the ghost created world no that's called the when vedanta like a flower grown in the sky in the akasa does a flower grows in the sky you can imagine it in flower you can create in the sky so we are like that you are imagining something it is not real real is sachidan and then you are connected with yes in that sense you are connected with the whole world while your son yeah his holy mother was asking ramakrishna for some son or child then one ramakrishna said I why are you thinking of one child there I'll give you so many child you'll be tired of hearing their call Mama Mama no Cosmic that is a example this is not negative military is giving the positive the whole world is your own what mother says try to make the whole world your own that is called vedanta not the negative side and only breaking the relationship because I am vedanta what is that who is my wife but oh my God is that for vedanta don't listen to that vedanta many people are getting deluded by listening to a thing and thinking that this we are to start where we are and we have to understand what vedanta leading that one Consciousness wants a blissful state that is the ground of all of us we have to focus on that and not to focus on this apparent appearance an apparent appearance appears disappears it has come it will go what has come must have to go what has been created must be destroyed but what is uncreate is non-destructible it cannot be done and nothing can be done there which are you know then that people don't pay attention to the last one you understand what is your sarupa what is your real nature try to think of that better this negative first part not tongue you are not the body then you were not the body where is your son comes your body is not there but the sun will come out of nothing sun will come no cutting butter you give up every identity every relationship like that mentally and Bichara you know by your analytical mind and Analysis deep analysis understand who the wave you are talking at the dropped into the ocean and in you also standing on that ocean so what to lose why are you losing whom you are losing that's your essential nature try to avoid her to understand and create an experience said you said all these things that come back to our position we give big talks and lectures but when suffering comes some dissatisfactory thing comes we get lost that's why Arjuna is very humbly saying sir I understand what shall I do you are the lord of the universe whatever you say but my heart is burning with pain because my son is dead see the realistic part of it I am thinking Day and Night of the beauty of my son and his ability and his power and what a great warrior he was all these things are coming in my memory I have thinking I am becoming totally Harvard with bereavement I try to forget but my mind is always getting connected with those thoughts I cannot hold myself for even a Split Second Krishna now you tell me o Krishna is by which my sugar my bereavement will be just calm down there will be no more bereavement again bhagavan Krishna is responding to this question is your mind you are all affected so much you feel bereavement in Monastery in your mind you are feeling what do you feel I have lost my child what do you feel in the eyes in the nose no in your feeling Center is the mind in your mind only your soccer and you are burning in your mind no oh what if I cannot bear it anymore it is happening in the mind you are seeing your mind being believed you are saying my mind is burning in pain my mind so we are saying the dosta my it is I and mine so it is separate you are seeing that your mind is burning because of this situation you are the witness Consciousness you are not the mind just to go back analyze again you are suffering because your mind is suffering and mind you are not the mind dostasy you watch your mind that's why you meditation time we know are you not the witness of our mind don't you witness our mind that's why you were at the time of meditation what happens mind goes here and there and then but you say oh oh my mind is so Disturbed today I could not concentrate that thought again and again came back that means your mind is thinking something and you have observed that anybody put into yourself my mind was not money helping me and it is going here and there so even the mind oh witness of the Mind so that's the very important point you are the witness you are not your mind just uh now you understand the point foreign this is the mayor the logic is that drushta and drishya they Observer drushta and this show means the object which you see they are pritta is it not I am pretty I am separate table is separate my eyes can see the table because it is if the if it is the table it will not show any difference or subject object subject object subject object this world is the object my eyes are the subject eyes are the subject in the same mind will be the subject object a subject I will be the object like that you go in our you know so here it says take one simple example you have to fight with it analytically take this is a drastar and Russia drishyam is the object is the witness they are all different take that logic is the separate from the object You Are by due to non-discrimination non-discernment you think you are we have become the mind you are not the mind you are making a mistake blunder your shot is torn you are nothing has happened to you you are wearing this art but you know I am I I am gone I am God the car is lost not you you are the you are sitting safe and sound in the car the car is damaged car insurance you are not damaged so see identification identification wrong identification because due to non-discrimination you are not mind for all of us I have become the mind we all run as you were saying before we run according to our mind what about mind dictates we are that in mind we love in mind we hate the mind tells them something who is my beloved and take a gun and kill the next day because mind says it is so we are all mental patients and mind drives us like a his servant but it's a mind is yours you are separate that is the point is this it is think in this way even unnecessarily dug through it will be burning in your heart because you are thinking you are the mind on the Quran the philosophy is coming is one it has four British waves ripples mind what is mind when Mind song mind says hesitance intellect says no I shall go I shall do definitive aspect of the mind is called intellect vacillating condition is called the mind munition [Music] we go and we bring out our old memories and things that is called the chitta and aahankara I so these are the four functions of the same mind ah bunch of Bhutan how they come they are going to match details in the analysis five elements what are your water rear fire space and artery water kitty kitty of water heat then the year and akaso the space so all these five elements constitute permutation and combination this this body is what not we are breathing no we are eating you are eating calorie modern science will take you whatever food you take how many calories you have eaten so it is calorie the Heat then you are eating rice this is the Earth element here element to your breathing drinking water without drinking water people can survive so all the five elements going into the system and transforming into my body what your body your body is nothing but the combination of all permutation and combination of these five elements and your mind is a permission combination of the subtle mind subtle board subtle elements physical element creates this body subtle illness that's why it is called Satya food if you take Satya food that creates your Satya mind satiko intelligence so this become the final level anyhow so it is the all the impact of the five elements this body so these are not the this is this so foreign therefore foreign [Music] the mind is tormented and you are thinking that you are tormented it is the mind not you don't be a fool it is your action of the mind not you not you not you not me it is my mind it's my mind it's my body it is my body it's my body same point coming round and round when a person whose hand is burned or finger is burned he thinks I am burned no I am not born my body is burned my finger is burned I am knowing that burning has happened to my body I know I know how do you say I am my finger is burnt you know that your finger is burned that finger belongs to the body the body whose part is the finger that has been means burned and you think I am burned we see this is the common experience I am hungry I am this I am that I am that I am intelligent person I am this person that person you are not you the drasta Consciousness is separate and this is not you because of this indiscrimination you think that I am engrossed or forced to to be in the bereavement and [Music] this body when is awakened you see this world and when you go to Deep Sleep it all merges into void and you are the person who is supposed to see watching buddhistam you are Consciousness you are not the mind foreign when you go to deep sleep when your mind gets merged into the asleep you have no sugar say even someone has a huge problem when you go to Deep Sleep where goes the problem all the anxieties worries when you go to sleep where does it go because mind is not active your anxieties worries pain suffering fear everything is gone that's it people like to sleep sleep is very good antidote to all these problems of life but we cannot go to sleep yogis can go to sleep how they put sit and put their mind in God finish the only problem shall come that's the points having the carbuncle in the back doctors came and operated upon and doctors say I need Anastasia but no no nothing really tell me the time and they did the operation surgical operation for some not quite a Time without anything without but he and then because you can withdraw the mind and give it to God he said no I can keep this what you call plastic content here I can put it there that's all it is not here it is there so mine can be put from here to there but yogis can do what we cannot do but that is the purpose of life there is no Trace even a DOT iota of of your this big pain of losing your son or bereavement is there foreign you are watching everything look at from morning till night you are watching trees plans every experiences I was reading this other 35 000 decisions we make every day with our mind how did how they know I don't know never is they say average person there's 35 000 decisions every day you are seeing how many photography you are taking through your eyes do you remember if there is a rental and you have to deposit the photographs there and you will not be able to pay the money for that from morning till now how many photographs has taken this this eye camera no so Sarma pasusi you are all watching and you are the sakshi the witness where is your bereavement you are thinking your trouble your pain where is that bereavement because you are the always watching only the team you are the Observer Observer does not get involved into the plague he'll go to the soccer play no how many are Observer no one is observant Observer those who are critically analyzing and the road is a good shot it is a bad shot no they are Observer but all are involved all are fighting with each other scoring I follow Lakers so Lakers Lakers I am jumping in Joy only Constitution I am down it is the only mental connection other company will be feeling the same way but there are fewer Observer who can enjoy who enjoys the sin who enjoys the play who has innocently observing only good of that good of that like they we go to watch the movie no but movie critics how they look at the movie they call that actor you didn't do it rightly you should have to jump this way you missed it your following time you looked like that that should not be this should see how many times Tech cut Tech why they do is a play you have to the critic eye you have to keep and critical eye in the world what You observe so saramang is happening in your mental physical five sheets are there so the physical the energy mindset intellects it and ego inside is that bright light Eternal Light it's covered with so many so it is happening all this pain magonies in your mindset therefore the code so it is happening in your mental ship therefore now what you do 45 births sharupan you know [Music] [Music] you are because of your not understanding what is your real nature and not only you forgotten your real nature you have identified your mind with the object other which is the in the Maya you have forgotten yourself one side other side you are not only forgotten you have put your mind into other thing which is unreal to be real your Dharma your nature of your mind looking at the nature of your mind and like a slave following your mind you are be you are in bereavement you are in crying you are Weeping you are lost as you feel therefore don't Mata chat money now you do what the Atma go this peep it has been in the upanishad it has been said that one can conquer the bereavement and Pain by those people who know their Atman therefore you are certain that Atman in yourself and you do all your efforts with all your weight with your man of wisdom Atman and biddi know your own apartment conclusion of the first chapter know your within Court know your own self that is then and it is all happening in your mind in nutshell so don't get so much caught into the Trap this is all happening just start analyzing with your careful analysis find out where is the problem and detach from this thing and attached to your own self ishness so today we have finished the chapter one only so we'll have another six chapters to go through okay no question very good today no question you have any question here any of you no question so good it is now the task is the home task what is home task I am the witness they are in me is the witness body mind is functioning it is in the cosmic spill of ignorance and also my ignorance individual ignorance so we are attached to this that attached to inside and to know the witness Consciousness or the self how to know live in the world detached see the world in a different perspective that we are not too badly kill the body I am not the body therefore take a gun and kill your body this is vedanta no no that you are not the body intellectually analyze yourself and see what wrong I am doing in wrong thinking brainwashed actually we used to talk about communism communism means ordinary good bright brilliant boys of the University they are given some brainwashing you are doing good you are doing good you are doing good go and kill that guy and go and kill that because he's a Rich Man enemy to the society so you should kill them that's the wrong idea but this communism means spiritual coming in communism is today is everyone into a higher level so to turn to our Eternal dignity now one question is coming body mind gets affected by rajas satta and Thomas the intensity of the sadhana differs accordingly what can one do to stay constant with changing prakriti here this this your question is uh the response is there also the intensity of sadhana differs accordingly because we are in the rajasik mood or tawasic mode or Satya mood then what shall we do we shall try to not if I am tamashik I'll try to get out of my Tama Sikh mood to go to the higher level rajasekh mood Raja Sigma there is no quick pair journey we'll have to move step by step so where we are let the target be there that I am the witness Consciousness I am unaffected by anything these are happening in my mind but my mind is giving me the wrong interpretation so how I can purify my mind that is to be found out and we have to work on that in whatever level now we cannot jump from Thomas to rajas we have to do everyday as I said in morning time we do we do overcome our Thomas to rajasthu Sato when you get up in the morning in the bed bed and your mind says no I'll be little more no so it is the Thomas but you ultimately say no I'll have to get up no then you get a and then what you do some people read something take a cup of coffee some people go to take a shower rajas all activity Thomas to be covered by rajas and rajas then come and then sit in the temple and then do meditation so rajas took to conquer like that and in Satya mind we'll have to think of what is our Easter that's witness Consciousness is another language vedantic language devotional language is called the Easter focus on that and then gradually gradually mind will be trained to think that way and then automatically witness Consciousness idea will be much more stable when I witnessed fear arising in the mind I get caught up in that fear it is difficult to stay as witness why it will be fear because you are not doing spiritual practices you have to don't go to bedanta first if you are thinking I am in infinite ocean and just think that you have been thrown into the middle of the Pacific Ocean will be fearful because I am tiny I am dying in the middle of the ocean but if you know that you are not the body not the mind you are the Consciousness then it is thrown into the middle of the ocean you drop becomes the ocean you become motion so this fear is more natural that's why we don't do too much vedantic idea keep that idea practice that but should be supported by bhakti practice devotional Karma Yoga all these things should supplement it will create the platform the ground upon which this knowledge of the Atman will be flourishing much therefore what can one do to stay as witness when mind gets strong until mind gets strong we'll have to wait for that do the say balance spiritual life is suggested you use your bhakti use your karma ability yes Karma Yoga to purify the Mind purify the mind and mind will be so pure then drop you will think that you are not to lose you are becoming ocean as you was talking in the last Sunday class 9 the river is going running running running for what to get to the ocean river is dying yes I am fearful my tiny identity will be lost into the ocean but that fear is wrong when you understand ocean is my real nature I was off from that by the cloud and I went into the sky and the cloud and the Raindrop came and I had to travel so much to come back to my source I was devotion so to go back it is not repair it will be a joy to come back to my own home so this is the Fearless path of peerlessness but it makes us feel good so that's why sadhana is necessary it is called this spiritual practice our guru's instruction we have to follow for everyday serious meditation practice prayer meditation bhakti sadhana Karma selfless activity and analytical mind sometimes keeping eye a watch what I am doing in the world why am I identifying why can I not say I am David no no no this body mind is doing today that is done I am not why not for five minutes think like that not 24 hours we are capable of thinking like that membrane will go uh wrong it will be beyond the capacity of the brain to take because we are not habituated to think that we are Beyond mind and body we are born from our childhood to think I am the body I am the body I am the body I am the mind no and not only that I have been taught I am a man I am a woman I am a boy I am a girl I have been I have no idea of my nose the eyes ears hey this is called the nose no this is called the nose how many times mommy said that this is the urea this is the area no no no this is there no no this is there so all have been taught that you are the body you are the year he only knows you are this you have this now we have to turn the wheel opposite way I'm not the nose not the eyes not the throat not the tongue not the hair I am not the body I am the Atman so this opposite direction we have to have to start our journey foreign go to YouTube that's it foreign
