[87. Shanti Gita - Class 87 - Review - Swami Sarvadevananda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5CHoPnHoUM)

foreign [Music] [Music] foreign lead us from Darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts we do resplendent face from peace peace peace so today we are here to read the Santi Gita again but I think that what we have read most of you have forgotten because that is the natural rule I also forgot so now they're better to devise the entire santikita what we read for so many two years almost I see that we started this reading around March uh in the beginning of March and like that so yes March 3 was the starting date so almost two years 21 22 23 two years she read this book but what we did when he did read but we forgot what we read I'll also forget now even if I say again tomorrow forget but it's better to recapitulate you're not again going to another two years for revising like that but better to do synaptically quickly rewinding over the entire book so getting overall idea so we are starting today to start second time this book what it implies and how it came out what is the background and what is the teaching so this book is at the very beginning there are some prayers that is natural to start with many spiritual text we start we read those now it is that is is salutation to all pervading Lord Vishnu who is the witness of the universe who is the basis of all the illusory forces called Maya and who is the Syrian truth alone self-refaultant and unmanifest in his real nature I offer salutation to that River and supreme Guru whose words revealed the extremely profound and supreme truth of Brahman who proclaims the Oneness of the absolute and individual self who needs this Rich Seekers of Liberation to the absolute Blissful State who pacifies the deluded persons agitated mind rest and very sore destroys all the doubts of the mind so is there any time we read this that is the major thing we could do the guru pranam uh Guru pranam and we creep the blessings of the great grace of God and Guru now it is the introduction how it started it's a beautiful scenario its history is that that is so foreign whose name was satanica who is the son of the renowned great king a descendant of pandava dynasty the refundable dynasty coming down towards you know descendant descendant to come to January to his satanica is the king now he is sitting in his court with his ministers and that was the style of early days there will be many holy people in the court it is not only a Royal Court but it's it is Guided by the rishis so he was like that he was sitting with your friends and the singers the suit of sutam is the singers chanters in the every Courthouse there are some people who are to praise the Lord praise the emperor please the king so they are called suitors so the singers are also singers who have the tremendous memory they can relate the stories of the past and future if some are sometimes they have heard in one place that's why they call is a class of People Extraordinary intelligence you could remember everything so there is sutu singers from magada Providence and they are singing magadam is present Bihar isn't it present Bihar so that name is mentioned here now anyhow the king his name was satanica and he was sitting in his Royal Court and surrounded by all his ministers he was very much enjoying the uh as a mountain on the throne the king is sitting he was shining like God Indra on the powerful Indra like the king of Gods who was delighted in the spirited conversation with the scholars they used to always the Kings where also the north of Brahman so that is the specialty of India kings are not only fighting and going to conquer other Kingdom that is not the idea India never did that to rule the people means to love like a child everyone should be treated like the king should think that everyone is subject is his son like a daughter to how they should be protected from Evil and all this so and this to keep their mind in a lofty level so there was discussing various Scholars were kept in the Royal Court and their discussed in various topics and at the time they are doing like that at that time what happened to one great says his name is is what is oath or resolution ah he will be in peace always right it is the name given to you says and that great says came enter into the king in the palace and that they're always free the sages were free to move anywhere and the Kings will respect them because they are the man of perfection man of wisdom so uh spirit when they are discussing Scholars who are discussing and the King Shanta brother was discussing at that time this Nursery Santa Pluto entered and when the King was that is his name um was discussing with this Scholars and spiritual issues and suddenly that sound the brother says appeared in the court and as soon as it came out um that's the great respect your holy man comes he may not have that money but he had the wisdom so as soon as he came the king stood up at the very sight of the states the king naturally differentially and cheerfully stood up with delightful mind stood up and not only he stood on his whole ministers stood up and friends and Companions and then what they did not only to them but [Music] it's a great honor yes come the king named what is this overwhelmed with humility foreign polite and with devotion the king stood up and saluted prostrated lay flat at the feet of the sage Santa brutal and then he offered his own seat there's the throne to the this is the uniqueness of India a monk comes a holy man comes the king will stood up and give his own throne respect for the spirituality so humility politeness and devotion the king prostrated at his feet then he offered his throne to the sage wishing him to be seated there then is took his seat on his Heavenly Throne the Royal throne the king in a befitting manner and with the mindful of devotion of our water to fetch his feet a clear see that the Royal personality falling at the feet of a penniless beggar and washing his feet and giving to honor and put them and all those respects and purpose [Music] foreign how is your health and how is your spiritual practices and the welfare is there any disturbance from anyone anyone disturbing your spiritual practice like that because King had the responsibility to protect this is replied the happiness with which everybody is connected that is verily the happiness that means I am happy everyone is happy in your kingdom you're such a great king and so I am happy everyone I am happy with happiness of all foreign [Music] while the subjects will be happy so we are happy with your happiness therefore please tell me about how is your health and Welfare of the Kingdom how it is going on everything is okay with you this is the exchange Raja then the king said Raju bahasu what he said yes [Music] foreign then they see it will be all auspicious because where your species person like you Santo brutal says you leave that place and that Kingdom will be all peaceful and a glory to the austerity and the purity of the Holy people so he said the king said oh Brahman in a kingdom where an acidic like you you are Santo a greater City you is constantly engaged in austere practices you are doing for good of all of us no so you are there and you are observing your austere practices and meditation and other things their happiness emerges naturally out of its own accord there's no glory of the king or anything eurostarity your son is helping the whole Kingdom see how respectful relationship that they had shame giving the glory not his my ah I am a great king I am ruling rightly see everything is going on perfectly arrogance and all there is no touch of such things here we find he's saying prasadena by the welfare and wellness of my family and the peace in this Kingdom there are all times due to you your protected blessings and your glorious gracious glance Shema prasadena by the grace of yours they are all the compassionate presence your casting glance of auspicious glances in my body and in this house and the palace and the kingdom Raja santir me all the time is peaceful there is no nothing to complain everyone is happy because you sent like person you successful aposterity and meditation and you are doing thinking for the good of welfare of us under your umbrella as if King is Under the Umbrella of holy sages like Santa brother so now he says now is the question our Gita says when a holy man comes you have to treat him how Guru and holy man how to do when you see only man ipat you know fast salute be humble at the feet of the holy man or your Guru praniva then Puri prashna the question second thing is that don't only think that lying down the defeat of Guru will do anything no asked questions that's spiritual question how we can overcome the ignorance how what is your internal problem in spiritual life ask those questions and then third just do some activity what will please him in the because his he will be kind towards you and if he and nowadays Google can be Guru no so don't need to be him and good but no no sorry Google Guru may be there but even Guru has a place in it most important place that is not God but I am saying all it is all the Google was in the heart of the Holy people they carry the wisdom they carry their knowledge so if they don't tell us we do not know anything see it depends on his grace so that's why in early days and also their lifestyle was very austere and their food was not available easily by home firewood is necessary to continue their home of fire Keys necessary milking cow is necessary so a boy a good student will have to help the guru otherwise he will go for milking the cow and then collecting them firewood and then making the dough will be saying Guru I am in the Japan in the story you know let me tell the story the story is that the guru a boy came to be a monk or it would be a disciple of a guru and when he came he he is a lazy guy but he so he said when Guru get up in the morning and he is doing all the activities and getting and he's asking come come it came up and then he started now to prepare the morning breakfast is asking come come now to do no sir what can I do you have given the Mantra I am on the japa I am in the Rosary the guru said okay Baba so what to do Guru now fixing the breakfast and all these things and then he said are they do help me to make the milk hot or something like that Guru I am in the rosary I am then third time Guru said now food is ready come and eat how many times I can ignore my guru's instruction so he lived in Japan came and eat so this is the point that Guru Shiva is is essential because guru's Grace will Dawn on those who feel that this sincere Seeker but real teachers they want that the sincere Seeker he wants to know God those rather than who come for personal Seva that is one thing but main thing is that who listens to the guru's words and follows the instruction and just practicing that spiritual discipline and bring him in the awareness of the Divine with him that is Guru Shiva so so pranipat was a pasta and give up this King stood out of his throne after the seat to him then washed his feet and then pulled krsna now he says [Music] the king then asked this question therefore again king of heart dissolutation to the great says and with folded hands he said what he said you know so by your grace I have heard from you in the past whenever you visited you gave some instructions I have heard from you before others will say what this is there every day they are talking about Atman Brahman God these that not to hear anymore no no the king is saying no I have heard it many times but I have not yet been able to absorb it so but Your Grace by yours guess I have heard that message of the truth Buddha in the past now again the nectar like words about the absolute truth I've heard before but now again I do desire to share those most precious words therefore I I still wants to listen that message of spirituality therefore kindly tell me who says listening to which I shall feel that I have attained the purpose of life I'll be fulfilled I feel that my human life my my existence has a meaning and purpose and I am fulfilled my mission of life so that's why the sastra is called again and again again and again we have to listen the same thing uh what is there I mean Guru gives the Mantra look at that is this small right it is this much and you are doing practice every time you mean sorry I have done so much why to do more if it has not done any effect what is the use of doing no ability there is a aphorism which is called repetitive repetitive practice reading the same Vivek surrounding reading the same approxan with reading the same something which is santigita again and again and again the Rama that is the beautiful statement I mean you are thinking that you will get out of the Mondays how you have entered into the world thinking this as real real real real real I I and you did that so many lives and lives and now it is the sunset is true and you are established in the sanction that that entanglement into the world that feeling the truth only the reality is here you have to counteract holy mother when you you release the kai kite and the thread no as the trade goes to measure how high it goes they used to color the thread 100 feet or 200 feet one stage another stage another so hello when try to bring back it you have to rooted the opposite direction I am the body I am the body now you say I am not the body not the body not devotee not devotee I am the Atman I am the Atman I am that one so today and long period of practice this counteracting will not be possible that means you will not be established in the Atman we were established in our Atman and we have now established ourselves in the body and mind and the world so real anything happens now in the world will be crying and jumping but what about my realization of God one night passes another who is crying for that ramakrishna is a fool he used to cry when the son used to say he used to cry I am in this world I have not realized myself or my own mother you have not revealed to me but we are very happy one day goes I sleep well I have done this I have accomplished this and I did this and then another morning comes okay another day goes another day goes that's right it should be practice should be done so he said that I have heard it but I want to hear from you again to just so that my purpose the meaning and purpose of life is God realization or knowing the self will be fulfilled now hearing all these praise from the King then the rich says Santa brother he is then started to address the king he saidamang param you know oh you know oh King sinu listen I am telling you in details most secret and supreme truth what is that truth which has been spoken by vasudeva means Krishna to path to the Arjuna shoko Shantae for appeasing or removing the pain of bereavement so God grief so oh listen O King I shall relate to you they send something extremely secretive space Supreme truth which was spoken by vasudeva towards you know for removing his overwhelming grief now what is that over ending grip that will come to next but important point that you think see what the Lord Krishna taught to remove the despondency the grief the bereavement of Arjuna when his son of even was killed on the 13th day in the war and unethically it is Breaking All the Rules of norms of War and that when this message came towards you know he totally was devastated and lost all interest in fighting anymore like the first time original was very much despondent and the second time it happened foreign [Music] this is famous his name is Shanti Gita sadashanti pradayani Sada Shanti pradhani all the time who reads this his mind should be established in peace it gives bestows Shanti purasi guruna datta it has been coming to me how I heard from my Guru I listened to my Guru so Guru nadata that has been given to me this Shanti Gita the trees are this no wisdom this knowledge my Guru has given me this wisdom this knowledge this Santi Gita because there is no textbook there is no writing a it is not into in the iCloud nothing can be done it's all in the memory so you get to from your Guru and memorize that's why memory was so sharp in in early those days even though you go to South Indian that means those who are very Vedic chanters so how they remember thousands of verses you start on one point and continue continue continue they remember even Rick Veda Vedas that's why their name is one Veda one expert I don't know and then then he is mastered in two Vedas to memorize in their brain it's in their brain nothing you can find their Vedas anywhere their surname becomes divedi two Vedas they are proficient in memorizing and expressing the two just just always read the guitar in the book we read they don't need any book just like that they will put their hand like that and they will chant all the verses and then Trivedi then three Vedas what a brain I asked one time in Malibu Temple that the priest he first first day went long back to give a class there and depending the the that Priest started talking with me in Sanskrit I cannot speak Sanskrit so I said no I do not I cannot speak sahasran but you can understand little bit but I cannot speak then he said he I said what Vedas you have read said they said I am but yes I can chat I can I have I've memorized the whole some of it somewhere with the whole well yes how many years he took 10 years it took for them to and every day rigorously hours and hours are chanting chanting chanting they live a different life no I went to kaladi and I found that there is school even now the small kids seven eight nine years old the teacher is no book sitting within his clothes with a small stool in the front and with his hand gesture up and down up and down and and the children are chanting like no book nothing so that is The Vedas are kept that's why he is mentioning by Guru by graciously give me this shanti-gita and which is and it is always delightful to delightfully he has given me teachings of well known santikita because this Sage took the resolution of his insurance maybe that may be Shanti and shanto you can match but maybe so anyhow that says Shanti is now Shanti Gita is is memorized and this is now destroyed rakshita to Maya foreign now and king among the Kings Supreme among the Kings rajendra I have kept that as a treasure in my heart so many years I have kept it inside for because of your desires to know being attentive not like us just listen listen Okay it goes here and goes out he's saying no sinus when you concentratedly focus on this what I am going to relate and I have kept it with much love and affection my Guru has kindly given to me graciously and I have the secret treasure that's why the secret reason why they used to keep it also important because you know unless the student is very serious and sincere I don't Christ said Don't Throw Your Parts among these wines the holy mother said there was a what you call the great gem that is Jim and it was there in the village and the in the bathing heart and the ladies used to go they started a stone so they used to rub their feet to make their callous things go out of their feet they do not know but one day one the Jeweler came and he understood the value of that so if you give a most valuable thing to anyone who have no sense of that who is not ready for that it is a waste rather it is misuse sometime that's why previously though it has turned to a different direction it's called it has become a been for a the growth of the civilization because only brahman's son will read this and only because you cannot read we are all bushes we cannot read We Are all uh name lectures we cannot do and that that is come back that is really not the point every Brahman equality you are Brahmin that's a Vedic idea that's the gita's idea so that is the sincere student that is the qualification of the student so he is talking about that you are a qualified person but at the same time you need to pay attention otherwise you're not so that was the shant of brother Rishi told the king what is called the I'll now go to teach you what about this what am I Guru got my from my Guru now what has happened now it is this book I have what I say just just for your reference very popular I want to say maybe that time it was popular but you don't find it in the Mahabharata neither in the bhagavata it is where it is and some reference we found in that book Mahabharata one place Santi the name is mentioned but probably it has not been incorporated into any print but one copy was found in an old book searching on the Google Google is get help to us and actually uh subscribe to document so she found out sanskriter document and she said that okay this book is that why not how many of our new book again I am to study but anyhow that is good for me to study the book and is my benefit and that's why this book is not translated into English and then there is no running translation there is no explanation there are only with much research we found one Bengali Edition all along back somebody has printed out and one Pandit and that is not available but you can find on online but no English version so I tried to for my own benefit I did it to what what for what meaning and running translation and this explanation not yet added with it but at least I have an idea that it the moon the original Sanskrit what for what meaning and and running meaning at least that can be published and that can be at least available to other so that was the idea of starting this as reading this book it is for my benefit and I really am happy that I could get a chance to look through this book so now the hair starts the first chapter of The Shanti guitar santikita's seven chapters and this first chapter it is giving the context as I said now War up kurukshetra was going on and bhagavan Krishna gave to Arjuna they are teaching when he was despondent at the very beginning seeing the Army area of Army and also seeing that your own people how to kill is it ethical very very serious question of life to kill your own grandson whom you respect to heal your own and need what you call all close relation blood relation here so it is difficult and then he cuts that Gita bhagavad-gita we get because of that now after that anyhow the war started again bhagavad-gita and the Arjuna got back to his War strength and then fought and fought every day so many things are going on and 13th day his son was killed and when that news was not revealed to him first but when he came to know then he totally lost his all interest in continuing the war and just to surrender then is this came so he asked us what the verses foreign observing [Music] original were well with the grip when when his son abhimanyu was killed in the war between kurus and pandavas the Lord comforted him with such Awakening words foreign did he forgot what I have told you before dear friend part two you have forgotten that like you wake him like a fool you don't be moved bewildered and your magnusi you have been drowned into the ocean of what you call bereavement and pain so Kim while lamenting dear part two being bewildered and sinking in the ocean of grief why are you lamenting almost like an ignorant person was forgetting your Noble counsel that was taught in the past you know I have given you the bhagavad-gita and you understood that again you are getting drowned into the ocean of that's the point even those who have the he see or you know already got the bishop no it's not a matter of joke people say I have darshan doesn't you have seen something that will not do unless further is there to to abolish all our egocentric idea one should dive deep into the depth of experience and then so long in the body body identity comes back again so he says I have told you this message in my bhagavad-gita you have seen me in me is the whole universe I have already killed them you just be an instrument all these things you have the knowledge I told you in 700 verses in the bhagavad-gita and now you have become totally forgetful about that and you have drowned yourself into ignorance because your son is being killed bewildered and you sank into the ocean of grief why are you lamenting almost like an ignorant one and forgetting the noble Council that was taught in the past the said he said there are ramakrishna also said that you know the parrot you can teach him Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna Krishna there are perhaps you teach whatever he will repeat that within short period Krishna Krishna but ramadina said when the cat catches the neck then what noise comes out [Music] so we can say I am Brahma I am Atman you give me little poke poke me [Applause] so I am the body I am the I am why did you do that is I'm worried I am not body not the mind you are saying and little testing and put then you can see me this way I am totally lost how can you do that I will tell you I will not do this I will order all anger frustration comes ah this is the this is the play of the Maya talking we will not do it has to be much deeper so he says like a fool who has forgotten his identity totally overwhelmed magnusi you have been sunk into the uh bereavement and then why is Maya in the month objects of the Maya which is flittering which is not there which is the appearance and you are thinking it is satta that knowledge and that is because of yours and this attachment is for what because you are making a mistake you are making Satya which is not SATA which is not true you are seeing that as true because everything in the universe what you see it is Maya and that you we all know you always analyze come being vedant you can talk one hour on this subject this is Maya it doesn't doubt but your experiences is Maya you go to sleep now where goes you this experiential world which your anxieties worries tension or high great white I'm going to get in accomplishment Joy well jumping in Pride where does it go just to sleep this reasonable Universe vanishes no no no it does not many City means for others I am not concerned you you talk your own experience and dream also is there but both Paris when you go to sleep so what is true is this true or that true or that true we go back to the story of that King janaka he saw that that big story that he saw that in the dream that she was attacked by some other king and the King he was defeated and janaka was running running running away which is all they quote people and also wife and children and to flee away from the country and the newly King who has conquered he declared his head anyway I can get the head of the janaka you'll be given one billion dollar like that or something and then he was and he saw running running running away running away and then the other military force trying to catch catch catch and this story goes on when she lost his wife and children and gold and everything and it was coming to chop his head and then the eyes just like that his dream broke and then he started in the morning got up and there is the the musicians they play the music to bring the king out of his sleep no it's kind of early morning that there were musicians in the Nava like in our induction the music Tower and that is an early morning the Lord will rise up so the Kings is to get that type of people to sing for them and then and one side he's hearing that this play of the Kings to come out of the sleep and another side he's building he said is this true or is that true it becomes so deep so impressive in the mind he could not make any distinction is this true I am hearing is this all the court people my wife my queen the queen he sees asking to the queen is this real or that real queen could not understand what he's talking about really and the ministers asking is Israel or that real is that is this real and continue to continue continued and he became like a man person and then rastava the king I have so that there is a man coming with eight bands like that he's a sage his name is [Music] that book and Osama created and the King was saying is this real or that real he gave the response this is as real that is also that much reality your dream world is so real as your this gross world is so real that means it if you say it is real all real if you said hey this is also unreal that is also unreal and find out who that's where your stomach talks about all these jagrat sapna Suzuki and Beyond the transcendental is reports and more emphasis on that side of it almost creation is not there that type of philosophy higher philosophy so here says your problem is here don't not the sun is killed or who has killed and this and that in the dream you can say see that the the janaka saw that he had warned fought and he was defeated and he's running away and he's a serious as serious and he could not make any distinction with waking experience and the dream experience so for all of us what is Maya and I am thinking it is the truth satta was garam that is the cause of Sukho and moha buddhi you are an enlightened person you're a man of wisdom be happy throw away your bereavement because it is just a mere show in the laser beam you go to Disneyland who went to Disneyland as you can see that every day they show in the year no the laser beam and they saw many playing going on and this and that are they real because you see because you see it is real you see your eyes are seeing you cannot deny that I my eyes are seeing this world is it real because you see it does not give you the guarantee that it is real it is if it is real it should be past present and future all the time it will be there in your Consciousness what is in your Consciousness in the past present and future what is there in waking dream and dreamless sleep State there's nothing in the universe these are all invalid experiences and one when you are a waking State you say working state is true when you go to dream you say dream state is true when you go to sleep sleep is true and when you come back again again this rotation of it is like a everyday making a circle in sometimes spending 24 hours divided we spend say 8 10 12 hours or 13 hours 14 hours in waking experience dream experience is little bit and sleep experience and again cycle is going on and this is true that is true and we are so much indeed into ingrained into it whenever we see that is the truth only that's why you are an enlightened person in in an intelligent person your wisdom is established you want to be happy give up your Soca sang sorry in this changeful universe in deep dark ignorance you have become Charmed thinking it are all true your mind is bound with the Rope what is the Rope mamata me and mine says that wonderful personal foreign the two problems of spiritual life is ahang and Mama Adam this is mine this is mine that is mine this is mine and this whole world is that when there is and no mama explained in a modern language on cell's business is God selfishness is worldliness selfishness is death because your con concentrating on me and mine my house my car my money my bank balance my this my my my and me me me me me me me this whole Maya is there yeah that is the highest level even if you say that is I will never I'll deliver it in a more earlier than you that is selfishness at the highest point but point is that how to this eye and mine me and mine creates all types of see when we run me and mine today newspaper you open or you go to the TV or and check in how many people are killed and brutally things are going on you you did that dispassionately is it not you don't feel the pain in your heart but if my friend my close relative my somebody is in the picture and he is having that bad time you will cry immediately you will be anxious your blood sugar will go up the same person another if the killing or torturing and troubling somebody is the cause of my suffering it should do for everyone no mind is in the attached to it me is attached to it that is the problem if it is not there we read how many newspaper we read how many stories we are reading we read the history how many times India was attacked by aggressive people how many temples had destroyed I read as a history but if someone comes here today and enters here what will happen is it better identity this is the design our sign but me should go to our should go through the universal that is the point spirituality is whole there so it's a beautiful idea song so dear friend part of being builded and sinking in the ocean of grip why are you lamenting almost like an ignorant one forgetting the noble Council that was taught in the past that was verse 2. and third says the conviction that the objects of Maya are real is the cause of grief that is indeed a delusion you are intelligent and wise be happy by giving up the bereavements that means there's a conclusive word to be happy give up bereavement give up attachment no one is yours who is yours even in realistic life who is my just one person have so many friends and relatives and everyone and who is dying what is the relationship the world will live in here and the soul will have to live who is whom you may say hi hi where is I where is mine it is all fictices in the mind it is working so that's why that you should be happy and giving and fourth that's what he did as a consequence of identifying the capital self with the body you have become deluded and entangled with the idea of me and mine taking objects of this terrible illusory world to be real so don't do that so we have done few verses it is the same vedantic teaching so we'll start from the beep first number five next day no question very good we'll end quickly this story so story is it could be huh [Music] so tomorrow will be medhananda Swami will be speaking on what the topic is there Gospel of ramakrishna okay thank you so tomorrow 7 30 Gospel of ramakrs so that is see if we in through we read
