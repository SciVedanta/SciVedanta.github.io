[83. Shanti Gita - Class 83 - chapter 7- verse 39 -43 - Swami Sarvadevananda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=um1eU6PtwSo)

Maya Thomas oh Lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and ever more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to our reading of santigita and that is this chapter 7 the last chapter and we have finished the advice of bhagavan Krishna to Arjuna and last few instructions are highly pedantic advice given so if you can put the my mask is good yeah that will be safety for all so last three verses we read that when you give up all the three states of your existence the waking state dream state and sleep state then you will reach that place where there is a veil and ignorance is the last Veil and then there will be a knowledge will come where your your wisdom that I am in order of God this idea will come and when that idea of I am a Noah that wisdom is also you can discard then Remains the ultimate truth and they are in 36 verse period Nash they are neither the sound or the sense organ is there narupam there is no form and no one to see the form darshanam Tata there is no idea of existence and non-existence what is there we cannot say anything it is it is what is that is you cannot say so you cannot Define it so it is that and knocking Channel there is nothing else but that but we are to practice that with this with the intellect very Fine Art and the finest of the intellect sharp intellect intellect which is purified purified intellect by that on realizing your own self you be established in your consciousness we are reading this momentarily our mind may say this is true but it does not stay there come down even you have a little glimpse of that experience but the moment it is there it drops down but it is said no use your sharp intellect find an intellect and that through that intellect you try to penetrate to this Veil and reach that state and stay on there which is your own self you're not to depend on something we all depend on something outside always but it is not so it is you what is your own self stay established in that cell and buddhu again when this buddhi this understanding this also will be absorb all lost into that lino in the Ghana in the wisdom then that should the saruba they've ever pure stainless nature that will be just that which is your sarupakam that will be you absorbed you dissolve yourself dissolve your body mind idea dissolve your idea of your Con on a ego idea and dissolving it and you're knowing that I am a Brahma ghani I have known the truth even that when you dissolve then you become you become that you become the ocean no more the identity of the drop or the bubble or the moon whatever different expression of that same Duality will totally collapse it is the uh it's a total collapse of all our identities into that self which is our Eternal sin and that's saying so foreign this is the tatwa means the truth which is a sense of all scriptures and who is the shubo asayo which is the Abode of all auspiciousness which is the Abode of all auspiciousness which is a sense of everything that the absolute truth I have told you about that and your son has been killed who is your son who is killed if there is only one who is the killer who is The Killing where is the knowledge of Separation where is your son you yourself when you are absorbed in your own self and established in your own spiritual nature essential nature then the question the entire book started with that that I am in bereavement because Arjuna he's lost his son of imanu in the war and that was she was killed by seven great warriors he unethically all attack at a time and without without weapon that is not the rule of the war you should not touch anyone who is without weapon anyhow so so that sukha is now gone it is not yours it is to your mind it is to your emotional area you are affected you are believing for your son bereavement is a natural thing for us but you are that Essence essential spiritual Ananda yourself there is no bereavement there is no delusion because the being delusion you thought all this then what you are you are of the nature of sudha stainless pure nature that is your real real nature and your Nish color you are without any parts this is the last verse of the teachings of bhagavan now the Rishi he is telling noun narrator is that he's telling Santa narrator tells he's telling the story of Santa brother Santa brother told the story of this conversation so story within the story within the story but anyhow what Santa brother was 39 we are reading today 39. you know foreign [Music] [Music] means listening to this message what has been said by vasudev you know by bhagavan Krishna to partha the Arjuna so sutva listening what vasudeva Krishna bhagavan Krishna what has he told to part through the Arjuna original listening that foreign or it droppedi the attachment attachment comes up afterwards attachment always comes from Maya ignorance see in the world who is my own we do not have any knowledge when you are born no a child is born he knows not who is his own who is not own no and growing in a environment he knows he's my friend he's my mom he's my dad Uncle Auntie all this relationship come no who is what what is the connection before who was my uncle and auntie brother sister cousin all these relationship we are setting up when we are born into the mind of innocent child nothing was there and it has been created and some idea because Mom said that that said that and they say he's your uncle I said he's my uncle so this this has been no Solid Ground of connection with anybody spiritually we are connected with everybody but physically our connections sometimes you know some friends connection with some friend becomes so deep rather than your own brother and sister we do that you know spiritual friendship our monks our devotees they have become much more our own rather than our own mom dad brother sister where their gun no so it is happening in in our ignorance that I am separate from you I am born Here I Am growth grown here I have my education here this is my identity special identity and your identity is that and in that relationship we create but where is that and and then we will get attached I get attached to the people I love if I have here that something has happened to someone I don't care you read the newspaper how many people are killed that they before yesterday or where there is a guns or no how many people are okay to say news to me but my ashokti if I know a someone I love and he has been victim there then they are and I want to call and I want to take note of it where is the hospital where is that person how is going on but why not I'm inquiring about others this is called the Ashok the attachment where I create a relationship and the relationship is all fictices created by our forgetting our real nature if we go to our real nature then we are connected with everyone but we are separated from that because we are dwelling in the level of Duality or ignorance so Krishna gave this advice to Arjuna and there are also think he gave up listening the words fiery words from the mouth of Lord Krishna he give up the attachment in this Maya in the objection the Maya in the ma in the mic learned which is awesome it is not this is not the reality this is the reality really the fictitious thing really Maya is so we we try to understand Maya but Maya is so clear that all all things everything is fictitious suppose I am here I am serious about what is happening here no suppose if I go to London what is happening in London Center that's I'm serious out there I go to New Jersey New Jersey Central what is going on they are serious so how fictitious is your attachment or reaction or action when we are present in a environment and we pay that as true for me and that I get attached I get detached I get angry I get upset all these things are happening it is fictitious that's why it's called Maya and when you are out of that place you forget that now what is happening in New York I am not concerned but those people are there they are feeling the good and bad experiences the cold and heat whatever is going on snow or whatever so thing giving off the attachment an attachment which is my key which is of the nature of Maya and what is Maya which is not true Maya shows us that which is not Yama that's definition of Maya is given in Sanskrit Yama Samaya yeah that which is ma is not there that which is not there but appears to be there see this world is not there we are in the eyes of people or a person sleeping now a person who is sleeping maybe someone comes and sleeps here and I am awake and I am doing something one person is sleeping for that person the world is not there but the person who is awake it is there so this is that's why it is called Yama actually it is not there if it is true it should be all the time there you may say oh all the Time in the World is there you don't know I am concerned about me all experience is subjective no so for me it is now here I go to dream it disappears and I dream becomes true and then I go to sleep and sleep becomes true and what is true there is nothing this of this gross World neither of your tension anxieties worries love hatred attachment Detachment everything is gone they are not gone the height and keep somewhere hidden and as soon as we wake up then spring up like the ramakrishna story The Snare this what you call that scene Waits on the top of the trees on the bank of the ganga and when you enter into the ganga the sin leaves you and goes in the top of the trees and as soon one comes out and again enters into it so this is our experience every day so that is awesome that's why it is what is the definition of truth truth is that which was there in the past which easier now and which will be afterwards so it is the same thing in the three periods of time unchanged unadulterated so that also whatever this we are seeing in this awakened state it is Al Maya because it is not the ultimate form it is not it is not what you call just nothing but it is something my mind is interpreting as something else the gross example the snake and the Rope I am feeling the snake but it is not snake that snake is asato unreal but rope is satta I am looking at the rope and calling me eat a snake in darkness darkness is the ignorance in ignorance I am creating all this diversity but in reality it is the snake a rope that is sachidananda there is nothing but one reality so he says foreign foreign [Music] the net of the net of Soca bereavement Santa for lamentation no when Once loses his son how much is the suffering no but this with this knowledge original went away where all lit give up or give up our all those left him as it were knowledge always removes the darkness so talk to us knowing the tattoo are the truth which is which is the essence Essential Knowledge of the Atman he become creature you become fully satisfied fully back to his own self so after listening to what was spoken by vasudeva Krishna original then give giving up attachment to the unreal objects in the form of cosmic ignorance Maya and Let It Go of the entire web of sorrow and anguish the original name realizing the essential truth become accomplished fulfilled satisfied that is the goal of life all the suffering all these achievements all these failures in life is a one goal to understand this is wrong interpretation of my mind sowing things which are not really there there is God there is divine but my mind is interpreting it in so many ways this is my friend this is my enemy I hate him I like him I this and that all these dualities play and its consequences attachment and aversion all this just dropped when you know the truth so what did you know got the wisdom knowledge of that truth so he became accomplished he could become perfected he becomes fully contented and satisfied then what he did Krishnan pranama [Music] Krishna pranamya that is [Music] [Music] naturally the consequence is this or June was now fulfilled naturally he is very grateful grateful to whom bhagavan Krishna because he has taken away this total misunderstanding about the world and our role at all attachments and all sufferings because of ignorance or Maya so he has given the wisdom to conquer Maya and conquering Maya he became fully satisfied and contented then naturally grateful obedient student he says then he saluted the Lord Krishna or to Benito then in a humble way with all humble mood meditation started meditating in his heart she reached them in the heart that time is meditating meditating in the heart vimalam prashanam that absolutely stainless perfectly peaceful that Divine form of narayana Krishna Christan he started saying but you know this type of statement original now started praising and praying the Lord Krishna with folded Palm kitan Jolie with all humility all his devotion he started saying these few words to bhagavan Krishna huh so thereafter having saluted with humility and then meditated upon that stainless and Syrian Krishna who is residing in the heart partha Arjuna folding his palms with devotion and been by the weight of emotion he spoke the following words he started saying the few prayers and his beautiful prayer about the glory of bhagavan Krishna like in the bhagavad-gita also we find the similar type of praise and just the glory of the who is Lord who is Krishna said your junior said [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] of the nature of Eternal and the root you are the root of everything this is the verse number 41. tomato you are the other the primordial form and of purusha is the primordial Consciousness Supreme Being purusha your purana you are the ancient one no one is more ancient than you because everything he is the beginning from him everything came so he's the ancient reality ancient truth even Vedas don't know you that means Vedas do not know the origin of it Vedas are experiences of the Sages but they have expressed the inexpressible truth that's why Vedas do not know your beginning how they will know the beginning if you find the beginning then you find the end and if you find the beginning and end this becomes a limited object so that says when one knows the Supreme nature of the Divine for that person be the obeda bhavanti this Vedas which is the highest wisdom which has the experience of the sages become meaningless it is no value experience of Oneness when you express through the language it becomes always limited distorted any experience any experience you express try to express it is always Distortion is it not suppose you get a good food lay you've got some ice cream good ice cream and if I ask you what is this ice cream like what will you say you will try to express that its flavor is good this is taste is like that this is that but what we understand by that it is only you are talking few words are you expressing you what you felt what you exactly felt here you cannot express this is the weakness of our material object which fights senses give us the touch of it what the question which is Transcendental who will describe that who will understand who will find the beginning of it who will find the end of it that's why the Arjuna says you are the ancient Supreme Being of primordial form foreign there is no one more incent than God the Lord The Vedas do not know your essential reality what is your essential nature no they try to describe but all description is limited and one spiritual experience comes how will you express that rabindranath tagore has a line huh um that is when I experience you how shall I Express that then I'll be like a dumb person overwhelmed with that Spirit of Joy I'll be just sitting just absorbed with that ramakrishna when he is talking his March down to our level he says 10 cubits in his own language I come down 10 cubits to say drink water I will drink water to say that his mind has to come from that flight down down down so who will describe that where is there no language goes there hmm see so only that expression is impossible to tell and no one can no one has ever successful you know and he says everything is going going and then ultimately he speaks about that this everything is Vanishing everything Vanishing and then he said [Music] foreign Stars galaxies are gone the whole universe is Vanishing into the void no here comes the bird Theory ultimate truth is not void but this is the point of wiredness this universe as we see that is white but is it void upanishad also said it is not void and here some epiphananda says there is something which is beyond Bach speech Mind by speech mind and intellect no but only that person who have the experience he understands no one can understand it but whenever you say anything you are off far off from the experience your personal experience suppose you went to a holy place and you failed something and that you went to your old church or you went to a old place a pill image and you felt something if I say how do you enjoyed it oh oh I I cannot express that's the normal language comes it is such an experience I'm overwhelmed you say few words overwhelmed I was very happy what does it mean very happy well over when uh I could not believe that that type of Joy I can get it anytime these are only talk talk talk talk what do I understand by that so it cannot be made other people to understand it is only who have the experience that person can say that's why ramakrishna's call you test yourself realize God yourself others talking from sharing from others is a more confusion comes that's why it is said don't read books written by anyone and everyone only read the books of the realized people because they have realized and they can describe at least close to their experience but if uh and the person who have never had gone there and they want to describe that City what will be there yes in my uncle's house there is a cow said and there are many horses in the cow said he has no idea cow said cannot contain a horse in this bigger structure and but that's why the confusion comes it's ramakrina said in the gospel you know that there was one gentleman he is giving the sermon the God is dry we have to give some syrup of love and add some syrup of love to make it juicy hurry God is all dry so this is dependent that's why she says to eat the mango taste for yourself and uh upanishad also inspires us to have your own buddhi sudhi so so what what we have here you are the um primordial uh reality primordial form purusha you are the conscious entity purano the Ancient One nabida virus four Vedas do not know you who you are your real nature or Krishna I am an ordinary person I also do not know what shall I talk about you it is given that that God's glory cannot be described if yeah so he says like that in uh with the mountain Himalaya that becomes the ink tablet and the ocean becomes the ink pot and water in early days we are old time as We Know ink tablets we used in our childhood is to use put in a ink pot with the water that example is giving here if the ink pot like the ocean imagine how big is the concept the whole ocean Seven Seas suppose that is the pot and the water and whole Himalayan Mountain range of all Himalayan Peaks is like a tablet and you just make it into the water and it becomes ink and now you are writing the glory of Lord Shiva so you mother Saraswati is a writer she is the knowledge given of knowledge and the heavenly tree that is named that that it will never that is Ordinary Pain you write after some time the the tip of the pain will be lost you know but this will be not lost to the Himalaya in the high heaven Heavenly tree and you sharp it in early days we used to make the Pain by cutting the eyes of the what you call Twig and make it sharp and make a pen so if that is the Heavenly tree and mother Saraswati starts writing the glory oh Lord Shiva and what page these are the papers but the whole thing of the whole um War not the ground of the Earth Earth becomes the page he starts writing from South America to North America to has all these lands of India and all the countries and all the land and that is the paper if mother goes on and goes on writing for eternity foreign Your Glory cannot be expressed so that's why Brahman cannot be expressed by so be this Vedas are expressions but close to the reality because those who have seen they are trying to express but seeing something himself yourself and expressing you know words to make someone feel that you can keep little closeness to their ideas but you cannot do anything how you felt inside who wrote you know is saying I I do not know Krishna Krishna what shall I tell about your glory o Krishna namami is saluti sarb this much I know you are residing you are established in the heart of everything every created being huh that is the same story ramakrishna on the 1st of January remember that story when Girish goes asked what did you find in me that you talk so much about me that I am Incarnation Etc then what he said Mickey could not describe their throat so much about drama's life krsna's life now but they could not complete they could not express what they wanted to say and I am ordinary a playwright person Girish maybe some I I write something but harshly how shall I express what you are the same question this we can match with that and ramakrishna went into samadhino and coming down he touched everyone and everyone got illumined yeah key are bully what more shall I say tomorrow you all become aware of your own self Who You Are see that's why 41 verse says that you are the ancient Supreme Being of primordial form the bearers do not know your essential reality of Krishna What then shall I say I do not know anything I simply salute you the one who remains established in the heart support this much I know that you remain in the heart of all so I salute you o Krishna any question has come no question today okay so then I can go another verse 42. Tommy will be showed up says [Music] yeah it is all given under okay okay so if you go to the voice of vedanta YouTube channel then you can get this all these verses there you can get the original verses because there is no book as such this book is not available and it has never been translated so that's why you can get the all the verses mentioned or I can find on the what you call the screen so it says you are Tom Evo you are very reliever only origin of the universe you are the source from which the universe has come out cardanam because you are the cause and you are the source from which this whole universe has come on means one who is the best of Refuge everyone comes up with you that's why you are Refuge of all see all the waves and ripples think about that notion all the waves and ripples is a sheltered where on the ocean itself so you are like ocean from which everything has come and you are the support and refuge of all creation you are known into the world of existence as existence no you are known as existence that's why in the world your form is infinite everyone has a limited form but your form is every form is your faulty you are always full of blessings kripalu ocean of compassion namami I salute you servo antara song I salute you o Krishna who you reside in the hearts of all created being servant or a pratishta so you are verily the origin of the universe the real existence your renowned in the world very much known in the world as reality the best Refuge of all you are of the infinite form you are the best tour of boons and full of compassion I salute you the one well established in the hearts of all so these are actually with these are good verses for meditation when you think of you we normally think of our rishtu devotana maybe your Krishna or someone is Easter is Rama is Christ they can just put these descriptions there and you can chant and think about that what is the meaning of the what is the meaning of ramakrishna ramakrishna is not a man Christ is not a man though they appeared in a physical frame but they are the truth principle Krishna is standing before Arjuna and he originally is praying to Krishna saying you are the cause of the origin of this whole universe you are the primordial cause from which the whole universes come you are that system such essential truth and some of us everything has this refuse in you that means you are the substratum upon which whole universe stands upanishad says foreign created from that comes this whole universe that alone stands and plays and dances on that ocean itself and when dancing is over they drop into the ocean much introducer so it is ocean in the form of name and form that's why it is you only and you play on it and you march in it so therefore upanishad says [Music] therefore what is our duty be calm and try to worship that reality that which is the one absolute and which is every creation has come out of that everything is singing and dancing and playing all this play of drama going on here and when plays over again it drops into the substratum that is the ocean uh 10 minutes are there huh okay another verse says we can see this also let me see but but [Music] I do not know I do not know what we do not know you know no no no no I was just bother me I missed one line what shall I say with all details what is your real nature how can I say Kim how they to you badami self related say s What is your truth with all details how shall I say that I do not know I do not know that the essential essential nature of yours what is the in in embedded truth within not how can I know is he a human being is standing before me giving advice like ramakrishna working in the street Christ walking in the streets how many people recognize that he is God himself his ordinary man looks like ordinary man and they have been crucified also so how can I you know what is your mama means the essential meaning marma is the mystery or the secret what is your secret this much I have understood that you are verily this city the creation sristi City creation City existence and destruction that's it Hindu Trinity no Brahma Vishnu maheshwara Creator God that must maintain a sustainer the Destroyer but you are the same three in one it is you who create review who sustain bless and you who consume so this this is you namami sarban I salute you who reside in the heart of all so here he says 43 which what shall I speak about your extraordinary nature I do not know even the slightest of your profound secrets you are very Lord of creation sustenance and destruction I salute you the one who is well established in the hearts of all okay so he can end here and Gita also 11 chapter after seeing the cosmic form bhagavan or Juna pray is like this exactly many words are the similar word um yeah um [Music] so we ended in verse number 43 no yeah 43. it will start 40 for next day okay the question is because it is difficult to extract the Atman from ego mind and body several times a day I try to see the physical mental and ego body as equivalent in value to all other Maya is this okay yes anything we see that is Maya when you see that is so whenever you see one sees another thing I see you it is Duality it is Maya I hear you you are saying something I have even you say I am hearing God Vision God is talking to me huh that is also Duality that's also Maya but pure Maya this is impure Maya that's pure Maya Satya Maya but it is Maya you go beyond all these things smell It Whatever seeing all the sense organ whatever you do that is Maya you mentally you are hearing that's also Maya mentally you are having some Vision let's see is goes to so far that your God vision is also Maya because you see to duality when there is one everything dissolves one remains only one and you are that and you also not the small lie that I Indescribable I ramakrishna said also used this language the beautiful article is there Army the pigai and the small eye so this is the question so long I am in a small eye I see another therefore it is difficult to extract the acronym from ego yes it is very difficult not intellectually we can do we can use our intellect but sadhana is necessary that's why we do prayer meditation Japan chanting dancing singing all these things going to pilgrimage going to Holy people so that our mind becomes little clearer and clearer and clearer then this truth will be more palpably experienced and then when totally the mind will be clean from everything the cloud gone you see the sun shining Sun so but ego mind and body and several times a day we try to see that physical mental and ego body as equivalent in in in value to all other Maya yeah this body mind is all Maya we can analyze intellectually every day but again this does not stay with us to to make it stable in our life that practices you on a vertical in a pond or a lake there has come and this feels sometimes they will find some place it is his scum is full you don't see water at all neither do you see the sun reflected there but if you go you try to Splash it little by Bichara by discrimination by analysis by discernment it may little the water is clear little bit a small portion but you leave your hand and it again this calm comes and comes everything so that's a spiritual practice is very important not me are saying this I am the body I am not the body not the Mind many people make that mistake because we talk about High vedanta but we never know what are the Preparatory ah stages we have to go through I cannot go just into the university and say make me a PhD student I must have some background to get entry into the PHD course vedanta is very powerful but vedanta makes confused we get sometimes confused that only three intellect it will not happen it will only the prerequisites is necessary are you really analyzing this unreal year analyzing is not if you know it is not good can you have the courage to throw away to renounce to detach to live it second and then you can collect some spiritual Treasures self-control mental control senses control endure in the Life little suffering little pain will come we could immediately reactionary just something someone says and I get immediately excited and start fighting with him and your and your endure and um and um that intense desire for realization of God I am not happy here that does not mean I will not do my job I'll stop my business no I'll do everything but internally I'll be craving for the higher truth so these are the fundamental condition if we pay attention to this then it will be more joyful life and that is vedanta will flourish in us only is intellectually or I am talking something it is from intellect but for your experience you will have to dive deep and pray and that's why the four yogas which is placed by Sami Vivekananda SRI ramakrishna that is the best medicine best resort to reach this goal Anthony in our real Nations we are connected to each other how is this experience intellectual what is your experience if you say I am one with all it's only somatic stage you can understand you cannot understand me in this present level understand real Nature real nature is only what is the real real not the body not the mind not the ego so real nature means what your question very question what you have written you have to put focus on that in our real nature if you say in your real nature then you are not in the mind level not in the body level not in the intellect level not in the ego level there we are connected each other of course we are currently that is only one infinite Pacific Ocean how many billions trillions of jillions of waves and ripples and Bubbles are there but am I not the ocean so this is the idea if it is real nature is this experience intellectual no this is not intellectual what I am saying it is intellectual I am describing that zillions of waves zillions of created beings this is intellectual but experience who will say then what will you say if your mouth will be sad ramakrishna is to describe sometimes what experience happens and after a certain time mouth gets sucked is saying that how sincerely ramakrishnan is trying to describe what happens when the Mind moves this plane to this plane after a few words boom so that will happen how does one rich Oneness is Oneness and experience yes Oneness is an experience and we are to ah only by spiritual practice and going Beyond intellect and Beyond ego that state can be achieved trace of ego even no there is still it is intellectual or it's one step down when ego will totally Allah needs to sing that song and say if I is little I this Petty eye connected with the body mind ego and others should die and when he dies then they all realization will come another question everything is happening by the will of God then something getting someone getting enlightened or someone remaining Bound in the world is also ultimately warranted by him only yes it is true if you believe that then you are done if you know that everything is happening by God's will you are a free soul but is it your intellectual word or your experiential world if you are experiential you will say ramakrishna said even the leaf does not move without you we love God but that's a high state to reach that state we have to realize God so that is true but not for me at this point of time where I am in my mental level when the mental level will be uplifted then it will happen so then being enlightened only means not in the message of Maya only but always under the will of God and not independent of it uh being enlightened being enlightened Enlightenment comes by one effort and when we find that our own effort does not work anymore I tried then surrender and when you surrender and ego dies I am nothing nothing nothing then God's grace comes but first we are to tired our wings as ramakrishna give the example the bird was the bird was sitting on the mast and the Sea could not went into the sea and finding no land probably applying this way that way that way that way and surrender try our best and then exhaust our wing and then you'll surrender then we'll come the realization is Oneness reflected in karma law the formula you are talking about Duality why do you do Karma you three things are coming one you are the Doer another you reach want to reach a goal and there is some procedure to do Corona Karma and Costa um bhagavad-gita to do when you do Karma I will do there will be some person to do there is some goal I want to reach this goal by this Karma and you do some instrumentality foreign I will not go to that it will be delayed but the question is that Oneness is reflected in law of karma Oneness is reflected everywhere but law of karmahoni talk about it is in the act in the in the world of Duality this law works here in the absolute word is the law for whom is the law who will in implement the law for whom he will implement the law but the question of law comes there so in Oneness absolutely there is nothing but when he separate out from that and come into the Duality then no and then there is a action reaction Newton's law of motion at third law of motion you do equal an opposite reaction all these things come over here so karma comes there okay thank you all see tomorrow will be gospel class will be giving the class and what is the topic I forgot that but anyway he will be speaking tomorrow thank you
