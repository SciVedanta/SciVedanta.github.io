[51. Shanti Gita - Class 51 - Chapter 5 - Verses 14-17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ItxLcF_Sy0s)

[Music] [Music] [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face o peace peace peace be unto us all right so we are on the chapter 5 and we are discussing the arjuna asked this question that how the knowers of truth live in the world walk eat like the bhagavad-gita suggested that was the question how what happens to their karma all this so in response bhagavan sri krishna said that they have no they're beyond there is no sign we are because they are beyond all signs meaning when you are in duality you are in ignorance you have your behavior pattern is there one person who is beyond all duality so there is no question of his behavior pattern therefore they they remain in the body but their body is led by the prayer of the karma led by the karma of the past life's momentum it is like the example given that sometimes a tire if a tire is broken from the car car driving in a high speed and then and then there is nothing but the tire moves in its own speed no think of a tire broken from the car and just it is going who is pushing him the past momentum of the car by which speed the car was going in which direction it was going and breaking point what direction it took plus that is the starting point and it goes in that direction so they are karma they are cut from their body their identification with the body but the body still was continuing and it moves in that direction in which the past momentum started so that's why we cannot judge them what they will behave what they will not because though they seem in the body like us but they're disconnected from their body internally mind emotion ego everywhere they're disconnected as they're disconnected from within their behavior but the the the will will go on and it will stop at a particular point when momentum will be all zero so this karma which has started this life when it will move on on on going through all these good and bad things experience it will zero momentum then it will drop from the body but he is dead he becomes physically dead all these spiritual seekers after illumination they live in the world but at certain point we show he has entered into maha samadhi that's the language we use that he has passed away or he has he has gone to the glory so who has gone to the glory the body remained here so who has gone to the glory the person who was inside and that person was inside but person has disconnected himself from this body-mind identity as a result what is happening the body till death it moves on but it has no sense of ego it has no good bad action accumulated anymore because it is disconnected from the car the wheel is rotating in his own direction so this life that's why we cannot say about the brahman ghanis that what will be their behavior how they will talk they'll know specific pattern so that was the last so we laid the verse number 13 which we read this body is carried away by the action of the past life this body continues no suppose you realize god today because you realize god you will not be dead then now he's not realized god he would have been dead but in samadhi when he comes back again the body functions so the body will go on functioning after that realization also but only difference that now i feel the sorrows and sufferings and joys and fun and we get affected by its good and bad action the reaction that time only it is cut so the body will go on in its own way i will not be involved into it the car is nowhere involved into the movement of the wheel which is totally detached from the car for some reason no so this is the prayer of though which that is a prayer of the individual and the body is carried away by paraphrase the actions of the past life just like a piece of cloth you keep in the high the wind is blowing no you a clot is pulled away and its flow flows into the air which direction it goes in the flow of the wind it goes by the wind the body in time is suitably fastened to experience sufferings and enjoyments based on product the body actually suffers they don't suffer that's the major point we say i am suffering they said the body is suffering samituriyan and the direct disciples of ramakrishna all of them say it is the body suffering not me and we are reading there and reminiscence is about him the body is suffering not me so this conviction comes for a knower of truth now let us go to the first reading today verse number 14 putin verses [Music] [Music] they remain unique in a unique condition nana base means the dress costume nana base diverse types of dress as you we are diverse types of days you look different this yogi nana vishuddhara yogi vivo though they have as if they are having a body but they are beyond body b freed from serbo means all being means dress being dressed in different costumes they are freed from all dress that means they are not attached to anything you cannot categorize like us we are attached you say this is my favorite shirt no i like that i don't like that so yes i may have many shards many baisha and somebody like samaya dislike samayanjas am i not but he's bhimkto he's freed from that attachment his likes and dislikes inside because he's a yogi he has united himself with the paramatman so nanabe one who puts on various costumes that yogi is remote totally free servo visa from all types of costumes or transactions in their life they have all transactions but they're free from all transactions they do all transactions like us eating sleeping talking interacting and getting sometimes angry sometimes peaceful no it's look at all the life of the great saints of the world they behave almost like us and sometimes in different mood but they are detached from him so from kachit bikshu so what they they question we find that these people are sometimes like a beggar they goes here and there stands there now somebody gives some food begging so you find them sometimes like a beggar because big shoe because sometimes you saw sadhus naked sadhus nanga sadhu you what you call they go to the kumumela you see so many sadhus but they live like that they have no dress they're beyond their body consciousness so don't live in the body they're moving they're walking they're taking bath in the holy ganga but sometimes they will be naked because they have no body identity no shame no laws what you call the other types of human imperfections so this brahmagani will be sometimes like some ramakrishna greatest example now uh we read yesterday say uh when yogananda came one day and he was in a different mood he has taken his own cloth in his armpit and they asking him to come so he is like a child he has no sense of so no sense of body consciousness that is the major thing all these things happen with us because of our body identity so he says sometimes you'll find he's releasing good food rama krishna is saying that he is sitting in the in the floor but there is a thick mattress yeah and over that there are some pillows around long pillows like when a rich people sit in on that with him resting on the back and like this and he's sitting like that so like a child sometimes they behave like as if he's enjoying that type of black zodiac sitting so say nana so the yogis these yogis the noise of truth who have disidentified themselves from the body they are in different vasodharims they use different different types of costumes and behaviors no the other you can transactions in the transactional world they do diverse types of things but sometimes like a big shoe bigger sometimes like a naked person sometimes he is engaged in engrossed in enjoyment of food posture huh okay sir sami uh mathur babu that that the landlord the ramakrishna said i want to wear a shawl and mature purchased a very costly soul and he brought it and like a child wrapped it this way that way and also this is he's wrapping this way that way and seeing him this way and as if he's like a child playing with it and he's so happy and after sometimes he threw away as as spitting on it mutual who got mad it is it in those days is very costly but he he as if it seems that he's enjoying this shawl but at the same time throwing even spitting on it that means they have no identification and you are saying like that yes the hubble bubble is sitting like a hubble bubble like a kingly piston so it seems that like a different types of moods he is behaving like us but he is internally total detachment it has no meaning for him as the children have no meaning for the thing of the worldly things no now they will be crying for a toy and next moment he'll throw away that toy it's fine with the children like that they will be crying and making make the whole house money troublesome and everyone will be frustrated with that he's crying and sobbing and like that but next moment try so this is the type of the behavior the brahma ghanis they do so it says the yogi who is free from all transactional behaviors takes up various types of appearances sometimes he takes on the form of a beggar at times the form of a naked one and some other time he seems to be engrossed in worldly enjoyment he seems to be in we think oh he is enjoying no but his inner feeling is like a child so he has no gut no attachment to anything fifteen verse [Music] [Music] those who are watching on the years or what you call computer they can find it there this slokas are given there but not the translation and not the meaning now basically suppose anyone can act in any role no like an actor they dress up and act accordingly suppose one takes a role of a holy person so he will have to wear such similar costumes as we do here for shivonite he wants to dance in the shiva role so what they do he brings such dress which looks like shivana and it smears his body with something like white it seems no so you use costumes be fitting to that role you are playing so similar similarly srila you should both like an actor base base way he basically with the costumes they use the costumes one who takes barite forms the one person one actor can play in several roles and when he plays in that particular role then he will have to have that particular costume which suits to that role sada all the time they use that as the actors do like they give engage themselves in begging food from door to door question means someone we find some of them will be engaged in begging food and kashmir to raj who is in the palace like like the pomp and glory of a king nah sami vivekananda ah he goes he's a penniless beggar no in india when he was wandering all over india he has depended less bigger but he will if you have to go he will go by train and train fast clustering and first cluster in those days india was under british rule he sometimes will be sitting in naked pocket or a little dress his dress is like a king no so when he's sitting and black skin so the white skin some british person has entered i said to pull him down he cannot go with the black people as in this country and then when he started speaking to the station master has come to say you get down this white british person will be coming in he said and swamiji got such a severe scolding with his dignity and started speaking in english they thought this bigger sadhu does not know any as a uncultured person and when he saw the dignity then they all left that means swami people cannot wherever he is moving no one most people will say oh my god he has come to the he's enjoying life we don't we cannot enjoy he's enjoying like that lordly style no so kasty raj like a raja he is invited in the king's palace many places in india and in this country also when he used to walk people used to think he must be a king who have told life i worked with the kings i know their movement and i saw you you must be a king that means that is there and so sometimes and vivekananda in the india when you're wondering this only one cloth bare body even sometimes there is nothing in the dress no so sometimes like nagna sometimes without dress sometimes like a royal dress sometimes so you cannot judge them and put them into a category because they have no body identity like a child behaves in all different moods in different situation this is the point to know about brahmaganism that's why people judge from outside the but you can judge others but not the people of this stature we know a person by their character is it not how his behavior behavior makes the expresses the inner innermost character a person is a humble person or egotistic person you by behavior you can find out if someone is very dignified or undignified no that you can look and interact with him you can find out knowledgeable person or he'll illiterate you can understand that but brahman can you cannot understand any way a lot more he never went to school but what he speaks all the vedas and vedanta will uh just use nothing he's talking about about vedantic experiences so that is the situation of the ghanis or yogis so the yogi says like an actor and i i'll take another one two together next verse is [Music] so [Music] someone will find that he is engaged even in enjoyment right it says there are some examples in the stories of some sadhus or yogis they seem outwardly they're engrossed in enjoying the worldly life but okay see the king janaka the janaka was a king but he has his full knowledge so you see a from outside is a king enjoying the all the fonts of the kingly pleasure name fame power dignity position but um queens and on sir servants and all these things you can find that he is enjoying like that but he is not there janaka is an one of truth so you see from outside but they are totally detailed then why these differences happen again you have to understand one person's lifestyle was a king so he has realized god but this kingly in article the swamiskaras that will take the body in that direction but he is not connected with it therefore from our perspective we think that oh my god how was how compassible he is a holy person and he is becoming angry ari that is a natural thing that is happening but they are not connected with it they are not identified with it problem is that we are identified huh yeah that's right yogis are trained the only thing is that that's why the here comes the uh we have to understand why uh we want regular meditation and prayer suppose by god's grace in a split moment you got illumination yes your body identity will go away but your past bad tendencies that will be remaining in the body and mind and that body and mind will make that body and mind work in in its own track but it is said after you realize even if you are angry and say something to someone it will be good for him his karma will be wiped out that is the another explanation given but if we look at the person who had this experience why it is happening because they are not practicing yogi sometimes that is said you find that in the name of religion some people after good people also also very spiritual leaders they are very humble they are doing saluting god and putting prayers and things but in their behavior you see they are making plan for killing thousands of people huh it happened in the history so what do you expect what do you explain about that they are not trained yogis that's why we say do meditation do prayer take all the values of life try to change your character and simultaneous spiritual growth so when you become perfected this your yoga practice has also your knowledge come you'll be perfect ideal to the society so there is a statement swami vivekananda has said someplace that some stumbled into realization you can stumble on the realization realization can come you have a good karma or by god's grace the realization happened many people know they have no background in their life paul saul become paul so the sudden change may come but to be ideal yogi from childhood do chant do meditate do pray do austerity all these are prescribed to make a holistic life and when that person realizes god he will be like a example of love compassion holiness they buddha do you ever hear the buddha buddhist people buddhist people what they do they may fight in sri lanka sri lanka and other areas for their some conflict with the political thing is it's that's a different that's not the point but buddha in anywhere did you see that he is going with a sword in hand or trying to convert anyone hey you will have to do this otherwise you'll why see look at his life he has stepped himself into deep meditation exam there there they are incarnation we need not have to compare with anybody but still they take all this trouble to prove that be like me ramakrishna from childhood look at his life that's why yogis who are practicing yogis ramakrishna says they expert they become expert dancers ramakrishnan said expert dancers don't make a false step now within court that means those who are real spiritual practitioner they cannot harm anyone by them only what is good will come to everyone and then they become soft their heart becomes melted with love they feel for the suffering of others they can give their life for the good of others all qualities you will find to all the people who are practicing people christ christ went disappeared for 18 years where did they go that is the time it is as there is a document that they say that that is the time he went into kashmir or some other places maybe may not be but to some yogis to got the training of meditation and prayer and all these things which developed into christ of compassion and holiness and you can find also in a some incarnation we call incarnation but with a sword in hand to cut and keys and they are doing the same thing why because that training was not there the body is going on in the impetus of the last they are born like that but that is why we are to learn that spiritual practice is every day's issue 365 anger of the roman ghani can make people like foreign it is hurting him right that's okay but they know who they are they did they that's why they can make friendships next moment they they did this swami be begun on the scolding that is a deep relationship that's a different thing for the good of the world they are behaving some such relations such thing to teach others to be perfect in their work how to be done how you are perfect but how why this much imperfections should be there when the uh that story swamiji scolded maharaja for uh the embankment of the ganga the steps and swami began on the gave an estimate how much will be the expense and he give you an estimate maharaja brahmananda said if you give this amount of money needed swamiji will not agree to start the one rather you make a little uh something less so that swamiji gets interested and can start the work and begin one has reduced that estimate total estimate to a little affordable amount and then suddenly swamiji saw that the work was going on and suddenly stopped and no work then he called what's the matter why the work is stopped and then they began mana said that oh there is no money there is no money then then he called raja and he started scolding him you you give me you said that it will happen within this money and it is not why why it is you are a jaminder landlord it is your own property that will come like that but beg from devotees who will do that and and he went on whatever he said i do not know exactly but some sort of thing which a brahmana not to cry and he went away but you know and then then they see the conclusion is different that was because it is work related thing it should be just it should do it should be perfect estimate whether you start not not start that's a different thing why it should be different if you give an estimate and actually you are asking more money like that is public property public work etcetera but then when swamiji came to know that raja is weeping and crying and then he called him and then he met him and then he said brother i should not stay in the monastery because you are ramakrishna's spiritual son and i have scolded you like that so i am not fit to stay in the monastery so i am going then somewhere brahmana said why why are you saying like that you are rama krishna gave all responsibility of us upon you you are our elder brother elder brother is like father so i have done the mistake giving you a wrong figure so i should not stay in the monastery i should go away so he is saying i said why i shall go and then embrace and stay down so there that's a different story behind but anger is there frustration is there but that is for the good of the society good of the people that is defined swami brahman on this to school how many uh pravananda said do you only scold us is he in the eternal companion takur used to give illumination and you only try to scold us so that that the scolding is for our good because they take away our karma says see something black little dust and dart in the heart so they clarify that so ramakrishna also used to do that went one day rakhal came from calcutta and looking at him he said hey rakha what did you do today why your face looks so something wrong in cloudy cloudy bad means cloudy there's some fog what did you do he thought i don't do anything wrong but after long thinking is found he had said a jokes and named joke she has made a hair lied he lied something to make a joke to a friend that you always do to make fun and we sometimes use those simple laughter to make it spicy a little we say little lie and he said that's why i cannot look at your face so that much cloud is visible by ramakrishna is giving scolding correcting them is that so this is the point right right in portland everyone will go get a good scolding whoever goes you americans you like that it was real but everyone knows that it is nothing in his mind but they go and some people say yeah that day someone went and didn't get any schooling he's look what they matter something wrong so that scolding from a holy people like that realized soul is purifying so they do it there is a story in the quranic story puranic know we are old story in the ramayana or what is there he says he's called durbasa and if anything little something happens everyone is scared if he finds anything and he may get mad for any small reason if we say something and that will happen so but why this to take away their bad karma anyhow so what we are reading that's why 14 and 15 we read our 16 15 and 16 we read so in translation will be that nana podhara like an actor who takes variety forms by putting on different apparel some yogi is always engaged in beggar-like behavior they go and bake food and they standing somewhere for little food some other behaves magnificently like a king someone being desirous in engaging in enjoyment someone is endowed with renunciation oh i have not gone deep someone you find a tremendous renunciation no they don't want to talk to people they don't want to see people even they some yogis stay like that they to avoid because it's a great yogi so people will come and talk to him and disturb his spiritual mood so so to avoid that crowd he in india sadhus don't eat meat fish then you are gone so because people were every day coming so he made a trick so she brought some the chicken bones collected some chicken bones and threw away in front of his whatever next day all the crowd devotees crowd came and they said oh my god this sadhu eats this chicken and chicken bones are here oh my god he's a devil and so everyone left and he was very happy so they behave like that and sometimes behave like a king sometimes being desirous when god in any engagement someone is endowed with tremendous renunciation someone wears gorgeous dress like the gods like the angels and gods no the dress like in our our churches we go no high churches so there you see the dresses of the angels and others though christ has a very tattered cloth but all is gold and gorgeous like that yeah so if you put ramakrishna in a golden seat how it will look no [Laughter] so christ is like that he has no half naked person now and he's all gold around and gold at air gold this and all the chillas and the food his leg is on the gold so but you know they don't understand if god does not like the gold he will run away from there because he is biting me rambo will run away of course they say baba you stay here i cannot sit here but it's a human in a imposition so the wears like gorgeous dress someone is covered with torn cloths someone is without any clothing someone is clothed with waist band girdle like this so so that dress will be like that their behavior will be like that you cannot specifically say the market this is sadhu means this this this you cannot say that because each has come with their own different tendencies but at the point of illumination there is the same experience but when they come back into the body the body goes in his own momentum oh as i give the example you throw a stone this direction it's trajectory it goes on if in the middle some way one gets the knowledge of the self trajectory will not change it will have to go continue till it drops so everyone behaves differently though they are only all illumined people so any question no so what we got the idea and it continues seventeen births also continues how they behave because economists [Music] anyhow some someone you will find that is very much got perfume spray he has sprayed his body with perfume there's a brahmagani spraying the body with perfume you can find like that kashi bhasmunu labito some people has nothing they will find many yogi's whole body smeared with ashes nothing but the ashes so some gorgeous dress shamwood perfume swam with smearing the whole body with asses kashit bhoga bihari he roam around roams around luxuriously they'll find that from outside yeah you see that some some people do this yogis we have so many uh what you call costly costly diamond diamonds in this all the fingers are diamond one two respected person he used to come for any home and and this in this country also he visited when he used to come all the people will be flocking around him and he will eat maybe 100 items will be prepared each one prepare this item that item that item and he will be given into a room and he is with you so many diamonds and this and all over the body silk cloth all the time hurt like a gorgeous and then he eats i have heard from the house where he was a guest and this lady was a host she said we prepared with pure cloth and taking shower and so many items and it is all it should be given in the silver bowls silver plate silver spoon is not like ordinary everything is gorgeous and royal seat and he comes and he touches it like that only touching that's all that is the food but it is to be given in that way and you take care of the this is prasad now you people eat see how it's possible i said no no he eats sometimes but no he stayed in our house and we saw he makes this preparation is so gorgeous and maybe see that juice or something one a happy cup or something juice or something but people from outside i also once went to one place in houston or somewhere somebody said that this this this yogi has come or something i went to see but i'm distance because so much crowd you cannot reach that i want it at first i when i came i used to go to different places to see how others are functioning no so that was interest to see the yogis how they do and but as really with the honesty of the person if i believe he said that he does not take but his every every behavior is so gorgeous he will just misunderstand that person and actually could you leave so many items and he's touching everything putting sometimes here putting in the tongue touch that's just past so why why the fuss of so much that silver bowl silver plate silver spoon pork everything should be silver and then even something gold i see he was like a royal family he was to be born maybe and he become little this spiritually illumined but the same old things are coming that story is not there there is a story that one sadhu he renounced everything he was a grass cutter he used to cut the grass and sell and then he used to order his money but one day one day he was so disgusted why am i doing all these things so let me renounce for little this thing so much work to cut the grass and take it to this hall marketplace and sail and then get little money and cook for food so in india it is easy to become a monk so he became a monk [Laughter] so he became a monk and went and then he was in a village went there with together cloth and things so india india if you wear this bus people will bring food for you don't worry you will not starve because they know the holy people buddhists also they will give any geruar means they will feed you so he was sitting and then and suddenly another sadhu also came and he saw that they there more people are going there and for him they are supplying chapatis little four handmade tortillas and little doll or spinach something and there you go through the silver plate good food like all these nice dishes going there and he said honey i am here nobody coming to me and all are going to there what is the matter and he was very upset mentally but he was a devotee of krishna or what yes ramadan the same rich person supplying food for two sadhus one is given some little simple chapatis dal and spinach and the same person sending for the other sadhu this very delicious food and it's rich and this sumptuous food then he felt why this and then he dreamt in the night he used to worship krishna or what barama rama rama and rama said baba if if this food supply you worship me that's why you're getting this food if it does not suit you take your circle and this this that's what you call the chopper a circle and and go and cut your grass and live on that you will get the same supply because you are destined to get this chapati dal and rice and he is destined he is born of a rich family he was he has a king or somebody or some rich family so his normal food should be rama supplies food for everyone who is what so the meaning that is the prayer of though takes them in that direction anyhow so what we said in the 17th that kashji gandhabi lip tango some some anoint the body with perfume then kashi bhasmanu lepito some smear their bodies with ashes then some enjoy roaming around with young women in a carriage chewing condiments wrapped in beetle leaves you don't understand this specialities in india you chew their bitterly and your throat will be little reddish no and it's a after full meal you do that so he is not behaving like a monk he is not behaving like a denunciate like any other ordinary person tambula so that is the you will find that there are some people will be behaving in that way question any question has come no check it five minutes oh so we end here then we can see further how he behaves with different costumes again their behavior that means don't judge them by their external behavior but that when they get into their own spiritual area you see that how they are god intoxicated how they can lift your mind in a higher level those are those who behave outwardly like that see as i told you this this uh holy man who came there people are tronging it's a very rich person's house otherwise who can do such luxurious food items and stay and there are hundreds of people are visiting him to salute him that means he has something and he when he sings when he's saying start singing version a total atmosphere is created everyone forgets about their own personality and the mind source into a higher level so their yogis they are there this real knowers of truth maybe their external behavior so different so to look at their internal spirit that is the point okay so india oms [Music] so tomorrow we'll have gospel class tomorrow gospel class by prabrajika shivaprana at 7 30. so one question srirama krishna has said humanity must die before divinity manifests itself but this divinity must in turn also die before the high manifestation of the blissful mother takes place it is on the bosom of dead divinity that the blissful mother dances at dance celestial oh my god it's a big question i could you please tell me where this quote is there i will i'll be happy to read a little bit from the before and after humanity must die before divinity manifests itself humanity if we have to explain humanity means not the human society but the persons the human nature of this greed lost selfishness should die before the divinity manifests divinity to manifest in the society means all the people will be good people they will be virtuous they will be god centered so therefore this person's little ego the personality should die then only society you can explain in that way but this divinity must in turn also die before the high manifestation of the blissful mother takes place when you say that divinity to raise the society into divine level and that divinity should also die to become brahman society is now now this society is one a mixture of pure and impure thoughts ideas actions and when these thoughts and ideas and actions will be gone then what will happen it will be all bad thoughts negative things our selfishness goes away from the society society will raise into divine level but the divine level it will it still it will function in the world no but that will have to be dissolved into that state where there is no duality so that's a very impossible state to reach there will be no society at all then if everyone is in samadhi then what is the society but when the society they come down then is the society about being unworthy and you have to look at the master as a father and that you are the child it's so in america we feel i've heard so many people feel unworthy you know so what is uh your thoughts about is that the feeling too is on the bosom of the dead divinity which is shiva that divinity means only divine only sachidan that the blissful mother dances mother comes where there is the this this comes and dances mahamaya means three gunas when it is dead society is dead it's in brahman state but when it's creation comes mother dances on the shiva has serious children that is the meaning that means to bring the creation you must have to have this duality and when you are totally society should die that means the whole creation will be ending there there is no creation who will be ignorant anymore all are absolutely merged into brahman as individually people go to the state of brahman consciousness i am brahman they become identified he is called realized soul so all the people if he goes like that then it is the state of shiva state where everything is merged into oneness that's one question my question is about forgiveness how does one practice this how holy mother has said forgiveness is tapasha could you kindly explain how to practice this the question is how to forgive yes forgiveness is correct you cannot forgive if someone done something bad people say i cannot forget you i cannot forgive you you have done such bad things no there you have the strength to say yes i have forgiven you have to be very austere you have to swallow much insult you have to capacity to withstand that that's why it is forgiveness is a tougher shot of means austerity we cannot forgive rather we react immediately one thing that's why it is said if you do 100 100 good things and 99 good things to a person do one bad thing the person remains remembers that one bad thing for god if you do 99 bad things and one good thing god remembers your good act so similarly it is our tapasha it will be our top of say if we can forgive because i know i should punish him i should take revenge of it but i will not do that that's my austerity because my mind is gaining more strength by austerity we gain strength we gain power but don't forget forgive or forget no you should forget because you don't want to repeat it oh no that's also what if you remember all the time then your anger will come i have forgiven you another question is that how can a young householder keeps his mind on god all the time it is for everyone no it is for everyone they [Music] keep his mind on god means we will have to take some spiritual values as i always referred to the brihadna kupanishad statement of the jagger walker and maitrey there it is said their husband and wife so the husband after reaching the third stage is trying to go to the fourth stage sannyasa he has student life married life and retired life and retired life to sunnah's alive so the when the husband is going to take the monastic life he said he called his married wives two wives he has married two two ladies so he called please come i am going to take the path of sannasa so you please stay home happily and this is the land and property you enjoy then one of the lady one of the wife she said why are you living all these things because i want to reach immortality then she was very intelligent she said then oh you are going for in many immortality so this building this house this food this all the luxuries of this life will give me immortality well no no no no that cannot give you then what then then she was bold enough to say jaina what shall i do with all these things if it does not lead me to immortality then the husband is a very highly evolved spiritual person he started saying that you know my tree was her name i appreciate you i appreciate your understanding you know in this whole world there is only atman we love each other it is only for the atman and he go when she when he went on and talking to maitrey [Music] the husband does not become lovable by the wife because husband dead husband husband dies then what happened the body remains the wife likes the body more he will have to send it to cremation so what you loved in the body the atman who was there similarly he said his wife wife does not become lovable because of the wife but because of the atman the sun is not loved by anyone because of sun but because of the atman people like money and wealth is not for money but for atman so he went on and that we love anything in the world i love my atman i see reflection there so long i find who is a friend i find some similarity with them if you don't find similarity he becomes your enemy gradually gradually you dislike dislike he i don't like him because he's not matching with my expectation so when you see your reflection then you love so the whole world you have to love by seeing god in them so i think what um the question is that young householder keep his mind on god by this way that whatever i am doing i am serving god to my wife to my husband to my children to my office people to the workers this would be the internal attitude always i am doing not for to please anyone or whatever i am doing it is a service to god service to god service to god so if this attitude is kept every day and along with your prayers should be there meditation should be there all these other listening to this holy discussions and gives us an idea what is the reality so all we'll have to practice all this and that will make it easier but it is a big task it is not one day's affair we are whole life struggling to reach this point how to see god everywhere that is the point don't seek god but see god everywhere that is the teaching see god don't seek god you see that there is god in my wife you see god is in my husband you see god is in my child you see god is in your mouth my mom my dad huh but behave differently in a in a transactional world you'll have to behave differently you behave the way you behave with your mom you don't behave with your daughter there's a difference is there you you behave with your friend you don't behave with your wife so there will be personal relationship but the center should be love for god god is here god is here in this costume in that costume in that costume and to keep this attitude we do need mantra initiation calling upon god prayer and all these practices thank you so we end here then and santi shanti shanti peace peace peace then i i'll please remind me next day i will you
