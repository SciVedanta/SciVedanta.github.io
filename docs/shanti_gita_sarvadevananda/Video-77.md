[73. Shanti Gita - Class 73 - chapter 6 - verse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZzXOrrJdnF8)

in total rest in your own Divine self don't know then we'll be really accomplished and you will be Christo you will be blessed you will be accomplished being jivan mukta and that is the state the state of total freedom total freedom while living in the body in most of the cases most of the religions talk about Liberation after death you go to heaven afterwards you do this thing and you will go to heaven that's an uncertain thing whether I'll go to heaven or where who knows who can guarantee but if one gets the joy of the absolute truth Here and Now then there is no doubt about it and that that peace will abide I'll continue that that experience will tell him not to fear about anything Not To Doubt about anything so that's why it is said that this goal of human life should be to know the get to a sarupam what is your roof of his form real form real nature saw your own nature but and these are not my own nature what I am imposing on me this my body this my mind this my emotions this is my anger this my frustration this may last this may gain all are related to not to real me it is not me it is something which is extraneous and whose nature is creating confusion or delusion so long you are in the realm of the mind this is the problem so long I mean the body all the bodily problems of disease suffering pain but when I'm not the body this is not me we every day we see that that we are not all the time connected with this superimposed items I am now concerned about the body so bodily all reactions and actions can be filled when you are in the body what you are thinking a meditative person or a philosopher or a thinker or a scientist keeps the mind in some other level they don't think about their bodily pigs bodily problems so these are not swarupa the swarupa is a word to be very deeply understood what is my own nature or own Divine form that is sachidan on the farm that is not dependent on anything that is not superimposed today it is important tomorrow it's gone it is not like that so this should be the understood and then will be perfect rest will come we are restless why Restless because you want something but we are not getting it and that's why you cannot rest no one can rest unless one reaches their own divine unchanging self because everything is dependent Everything is splittering Everything is running away from our fingers as much as we want to hold nothing remains in our control so this is the then only you will attend to a bisranti when it's perfect rest we want rest in whoever people say that I am tired with the life's struggles and sufferings how to do get out of that tiredness a perfect rest will come when get to us when you know who we are you will feel that I am fulfilled I am accomplished I have attained what is Tibetan I am blessed and that is the state jivan mukta vishwasi when that is the time he will be a person free from all anguish and anger frustration and all dualities and will remain free Soul while living jivan Israel in the life mukta you're walking he loves what like others but it will be a free soul like in the second chapter of the bhagavad-gita it says Tito pragma state of a guy whose intelligence or understanding is stabilized what is that he will not be disappeared by Sukho and mind will not be ignore anxious anxiety feel anxiety in happiness or in misery in suffering or pain in the dualities of life so that is the thing we have to Define here it is the goal of Life goal of human life has been exactly expressed in a very nice way and you know this knowing and when one can know when one can rest in his own Divine self then it's called jivanukta and the jivan mukta is now continuing here the same as moksharupam so 44 verses who [Music] makes [Music] you know foreign now this is called this jivan mukta state the state of perfect restfulness knowing your own Divine self is called it is its nature is called Moksha liberation there is a term people Everyone uses Moksha Moksha goal of life is to liberate ourselves to maksha so what is that Moksha Moksha is this jivan mukti state that itself that's jivan mukta state that state when one knows its own real nature and can really free him himself or herself from all these superimposed ideas that is called that is being called by ahu means called or said by the yogis not ordinary yogis which everyone is joke you know in this country when you see the advertisement in the paper and yoga's journal and everywhere everyone is a yogi or yogini not that jogi or jugini but here he says those who have thoughts and she saw those who have experienced it that truth absolute truth they say here is the point it is now I am it is Executioner's message but he's so humble he's saying it I am not saying but it is the statement of the yogis those yogis who have experienced that tatva darshan darshan is to see behold it is beholding like ramakrishna said have you seen God said I see God more tangibly than I see you so this is also C the word they use the seeing that type of saying not I see through my eyes whatever objective Universe not that that seeing is not considered here seeing the truth those who have seen or realized or experienced they are seeing means realized or experienced they have experienced not intellectually but experientially there every part of the body gives resonance to that joy and Bliss God is not a word for them for us God is his Child's Play we talk we play with so many toys God is one of the toy sometimes we play and talk those things and everything is interesting God is also little interest I have a little interest in God and I have so many interesting so many things God is only one part that is not will that will not do God realization will not come that way all the 16 previously 16 Anna is to have one rupee one dollar you can see a hundred percent like that you have to give hundred percent of mine hundred cents of the Mind mind has hundred units all the faculties should go to God through your anger to your frustration to your love to your achievement your failure to your accomplishments everything should lead to that one that one so that is the definition given by the realized people and that is called the moksharupam that is a really the form of Liberation Liberation means that is called liberation and what happens where do you get it we think that we do spiritual practice we become honest we become truthful we become this all the values but because of that we can get realized God but it's not so it says [Music] as soon as one assists this knowledge of his own Divine self that moment when one attends to that swarupogeno the knowledge of his own self they'd love that in that in what you're doing something else we attend means attend means always something else no I have achieved a degree it was not with me I got a degree oh I attain some money I got some money God means you got something which was not with you so everything in the relative word lava at attainment is achieving something which I had not is this Brahma Gana is this knowledge I like same well no it is then what type of thing achievement you are saying achieve one will achieve peace one will achieve liberation one will so what is that how will he achieve where did we get it that is the difference between dualistic the religion and the non-dualistic idea you go to heaven then you will be happy Heaven is not here after death only you can go to heaven and there Heaven you can find all the water flowing all the time all sweet music going on and no one becoming old all our young people no disease no suffering a plane which is I cannot imagine we are becoming old We are Becoming diseased We are Becoming death is knocking at the door no no no there is no date you are always born as a young man and enjoy the life as much as you can no payment is necessary you are all paid prepaid prepaid for your all Fallen Joy it's a five-star hotel you are all prepaid go and farm and you will achieve that he has to achieve that then you do good karma a good karma will take you to heaven Hindu idea because it is not yours she worked hard to get a good name in your company and Company they will say okay you have done well done so we will reward you okay you go for one month and have a beautiful experience in Hawaii for one month a five-star hotel all expenses this company will be here no okay you are going there why because you have done some good karma because of the Good Karma you are getting this result no that means karma is creating this result is Brahma cannot like that you do some japa you do some Mantra you did some spiritual text you go to dependent places of pilgrimage you see some Bhajan is it giving you creating some new result like that and that result is your liberation no it is not like that then what it is it is a beautiful means attainment what you Latin it is beautiful example you have one necklace here all the time but sometimes it happens probably all of you ready what did I do I lost that and you're searching here and there knocking in the drawer and this place that place hour is gone for searching here and there and then you find oh which is here so it is not to achieve anything it was with me are you as a fool I could not recognize that I am aware I become aware of that reality that is vedanta rather if what for this spiritual practice what for we do the spiritual practice to remove that blind that blind attitude that that remove that idea of not knowing the idea I am to such I am to find God as if God is hiding and science running in in his play he's always hiding and we have to find somewhere he's not here but he can appear in that corner but it is all the time we did not know so this beautiful one word that attainment will be taught like a horror and the what is here so that is the point that it is not that you are to gain something new but you know what was with you you have forgotten that's a typical example is given that the 10 people were together and they are crossing a river in the high Himalayas and the river was very torrential and Snow White right cold water so while cook no one could look at others everyone is trying to cross the River and then went to the other store and then they started oh are you 10 people are you all together so they are counting so you know that story everyone is counting how many are here one two three four five six seven eight nine so everyone counted nine so they came into a conclusion that the 10th person is missing and they started weeping and Howling and crying our condition is some that we are missing God will not find God we will have to dig God where it is under the stone or in some cave or in some high heaven but this crying weeping our lifelong struggle going on that is called God that is called love that is called joy that is called Limitless absolute peace we are searching searching searching and not finding anywhere then what happens then one Guru comes one gentleman what is the cause of your suffering why are you all crying and because you know we lost the tenth person who was with us it is a silly example though but that is we are doing that silly thing throughout all the life and we are crying and weeping and being battered by the world because you don't learn what to search for and where to search for and what to be given away so we give too much value to the world and day and night think of the world we become worldly we never turn back think first for all these things so it is called then jivan mukta state will attend and that state is its nature is Moksha or liberation and that moksud it is said by not by me Krishna he is enough but he is also quoting that Yogi naha those yogis who have attained that spiritual wisdom is it they say that this is called Moksha this is the state of jivan mukti that means knowing your own self and getting perfectly rested in that Blissful state that is called as and knowledge here they are making all equal when you realize God or realize Brahman in real nature as your own self you can realize God I am the servant you are the boss it's a two two entities are there is loss there is fear you are the boss you may abandon me I may forget you in any relationship there is a fear of losing is it not a dangerous fear losing in God also there is a fear of losing that's why the gopis are crying all the time hakrishna oh Krishna that means they're in the real name of duality but they are not Ordinary People Like Us they are all realized Souls they realize moon is of the last life so they are enjoying in a different level that that separation but we Ordinary People on all our relationships see how bitter how suffering full of suffering and misery is this because you are separate I am trying to find you and I it depends on your mood in your wish in your attitude my you is my mood my attitude to connect together but if it is not it is my nature then I'm not to search for anything rather we I'm only one work is there what is not me covering me pillow he loves the coverings which are giving a wrong interpretation of my real nature that means I am the body is a wrong interpretation so Mind Body prano you know all these are wrong interpretation of me so we are to work hard on eradicating this wrong interpretation that's why all this don't think of anyone's evil or don't talk about you we are reading in the bhagavat the years are made to hear that is the perfect use of the year when it hears the Lord's glories in another place bhagavat says this voice [Music] [Music] oh Lord when he will be my everything in my all suffering and you know more my joy he will be appearing and my voice this whatever Mount God speaks Contour in all my money all all my words will be talking about you that's the absorption in that truth so but there is separation it's a question when it will happen it's not happening now I wish it should happen but when this limiting adjuncts this objects which separate us from our real self is eradicated then what will remain when the clouds are all eradicated what will happen the Sham will shine in its own Glory oh was it not shining before it will sign only when the cloud goes away it is all the time now also it is shining but it is only recovering so our saturnas would be all we do to purify the mind to de-clean the heart from all this dark course of separation so this is the important part for spiritual life to understand that Moksha Liberation or whatever we talk it is not to be achieved as an outside thing whether it is here like the country like the bracelet in here and searching and there is another song that they did in the forest the deers run for hundreds of miles in search of this beautiful fragrance which comes out of our own pouch it is there in the pouch and the case deer is running hundreds of miles in search of that joy that pre-beatable fragrance that making it to be restless and we are also searching for that Joy and I trying here and there and running hundreds of miles in our day-to-day life no time for doing anything world is so important Every Beat of it is important day and night talking about world thinking about world [Music] mind totally absorbed in the world and we want God realization funny things side by side we are rather adding more of the coverings clouds we want to throw more cloud on the already covered area which is separating me from my real Nation so we do not know we are really frustrating thing we are all spiritual people but we are not aware what we are doing whether it is helping me in my spiritual journey or it is just distracting me and throwing me off from that more and more to have another life another life another life so here is that it is been important point that maksa the yogis were the Seer of Truth declare that state to be liberation that state to be Liberation what is Liberation now which is attained the moment one reaches the knowledge of one's own self as soon as one understands and really reaches the knowledge that knowledge nothing is happening knowledge knowledge that I am the body I am such a such person goes away and then knowledge Capital knowledge not the secular knowledge the limiting knowledge when that knowledge this just one can the moment one by spiritual practice just that moment one reaches that understanding that big knowledge then he will be declared as liberated soul in the world and it is said by the yogis who have already experienced this truth it is like that of regaining the Forgotten necklace it is like it happens for our using the glass sometimes glass you are searching everywhere that glass is in your receive all the time so this mistake we do we are searching for our keys everywhere and the key is in your pocket so similarly the knowledge of that truth which is searching for it is already here only to acknowledge that understand that and that knowledge Capital knowledge will come by removing the lower knowledge 44. now 45 . Thomas stomach gorgeous [Music] bhanu [Applause] [Music] foreign so what does it say S one who is awakened enlightened in the tatwa than the truth we are sleeping in the truth now we are awake of the world anything happens we are so serious oh Who coming the door who is knocking there very serious but who is knocking in the heart we do not know the Lord is knocking at the heart all the time but who cares but those who are awakened awakened in the and in that awakened State when you are saturated one can be saturated in that fullness of its expression no that awakened state in its fullness not partial awareness what is talking about it may give little qualified non-dualistic idea or dualistic idea but is absolute non-dualistic idea so that person who has been awakened in his own real nature and attend purana Buddha full awareness fully aware means not occasional experience in our life we find that many people say I had a vision I have a life-changing experience I was doing this and I always and that suddenly it came and I found the world is different like that but what happened next moment it happened for one time maybe one day one sec few seconds five seconds two seconds one second and that has changed your thought process but what about doing whole day after that your 30 years 40 years Life 50 years 60 years life what what were you experiencing it is not with you so that is not poor no Buddha means the fullness of his understanding there have been every breath every moment every experience that is this is and to that person no Maya Maya is not Satya this Maya the visible universe is not satta it is not true foreign not only that not Maya is also not true not only that its activities its products Maya has created this this universe of Duality no and big vedanta says it absolutely God absolutely Disturbed why we see this one because Maya so for that person there is neither Maya neither it's means effects Maya's action is this entire universe is me I am also created by Mayana we are all under the spell of Maya that means all the activities we see this is all Maya's product Maya has produced it and so Maya does not remain to be true neither the effects of Maya which has created this universe and transactional world they are all untrue Thomas the Thomas three qualities of quality reveals Tamil quality Commerce Darkness deep Darkness we are a deep deep Darkness about the truth when we discuss something it appears to be oh this is true when most of the day whole day we are covered with Tama Darkness to Tama Tama karjam darkness and its effect what happens in darkness we only get deluded when we are in darkness we create so many ghosts when you are alone and in deep darkness something someone is maybe one raccoon is going over your roof who is coming this night no and some people say oh this is a ghost room ghost house but but uh he sees I I am hard then you tell our old residents will say yes I also heard like that so you can create Tomo but daytime daytime broad daylight really people see that I saw a ghost running over my head but when darkness comes or Night Comes alone then you get more into all these things and those who have little more imagination they can create much more so it is Thomas quality and the Thomas quality produces such fear anxieties worries all these things discard them they are not true they are not there is that which is what is the definition of means eternal meaning it is now it was before it will be in the future any point of time it exists that's why because you said which is non-existing but appears they have conjoined together they have coupled together United they have become as a result the first result is I am I Has Come I arise because of Thomas because of the ignorance I am Brahma but I say I am such and such I am John I am Jacob I am the whatever I am Mary I am this I comes the snake and the Rope superimposition has happened snake is not there but it is imposed so Tama darkness and its effect the darkness was there the Rope was there day time you see the Rope those who are awakened the seat is rope they don't get deluded as snake daylight but in the darkness tamaha where Thomas comes darkness comes then its effect snake comes and its fear as a consequence Thomas not only the snake comes out of imagination and not only that snake bites and it's really painful it is all mental foreign when one will be awakened in his real nature then this in his fullness of his understanding this Maya is not there not its effect is there neither is Thomas ignorance or its effect the anxieties worries is all this effect they are all non-existing sarvam but how well not this shity now you can see this world but not this you don't see that well what is that how can I understand that the sun rises no when Sun's Rays fall then all Darkness all fear all misconception vanish eradicate spontaneously Within that is there when it IT reveals it it expresses itself then there is no Maya neither is effects neither ignorance individual ignorance neither Cosmic ignorance bother them Maya is a cosmic ignorance no and again is individual ignorance so individual ignorance and its products what it creates it will not bother it will be out and the cosmic Maya play drama will not be able to deliver it anymore that is the three two two-sided effect of the knowledge of awareness or awakened knowledge about the self Maya and again which is though are the same in the same one is a individual another is a cosmic because all in in ignorance put together all drops of water is ocean the ocean is Maya and individual drop is a Ghana Organo creates God's creation is ocean that's okay big the sun moon stars and human being and all and there is no problem in that my ignorance creates the problem there I love someone I hate someone will be spontaneous I cannot tolerate that person as soon as I see but I I I get into it because he is like that he is like that he is like that why because individual ignorance is creating this trouble my likes and dislikes my mind is creating but God's mind has created the Sun Moon there's no problem for that but when I say I like this you say no I like the other thing no all the world religion are fighting for each other what what my religion my God is the only God say ego and I and your god of course your God is not true my God is only true your path is not true my path is only true this is the mistake and that comes and bothers people so here individual that's called institution has discussed this telling that individual ignorance is gone then you are free the cosmic play will go on God's play Will Go On but it will not bother because you see ramakrishna mother's play going on if you see mother is in the good mother is in the bad if you see the Divine in everywhere whom to hate whom to love because you don't see the outer costume you see the inner reality so that's the verse says that's called the that does not bother moderation comes in my ignorance my ego comes this world is not fearful frightening to a baby because his innocent his mind is not developed but if person of experience nor of Truth become like a baby the world will not bother baby has any anxiety have you heard any time a baby is suffering from mental anxiety this language is possible baby does not have any mentaline that his mind is not developed that way so probably does not feel any anxiety anywhere even in the trial situation in the if he's cut to pieces he knows it is the it is not me so that knowledge is established and deeply established so the last parts of this chapter for next time another 10 minutes any question come on okay last verse of this chapter what is the translation did we read it 44 the yogis who are the seers of Truth declare that state to be Liberation which is attained the moment one reaches the knowledge Capital knowledge of one's own self it is like that of regaining the Forgotten necklace with a Target and now 45 verse says darkness and its effect everything becomes totally unreal and invisible at the Grand manifestation of the at the can manifestation of the sun when the sun comes out then everything darkness and its effects are elaborated it everything goes away similarly when the enlightening truth is awakened in in its full awareness neither the cosmic ignorance Maya nor its effect are experienced as true that means you are free from Individual ignorance you are free from the cosmic ignorance it will be there but it will not affect s them should they foreign foreign [Music] therefore there is therefore tataha nasty in the Brahman there is not this and that therefore there is nothing such here here is it is here it is there in our which is well renowned in the world of reality and transactional world but in sudhi brahmani in my real divine nature which is Pari Brahman which is supreme Brahman there is no trace of this matram there is no trace of any here and there and these and that thereafter water water before that this type of conception is not there at all which is which is very much known in the relative World in which we live it is here it is there in the heaven is this in the heart is this in the hail is this here there in Brahman there is no such here there how can it be here and there in one is only one here and there may be in two pieces two objects are there it can be it is here it is there it is not there the car is there in the parking lot not here here and there may be possible parking lot one space this is another space but in Brahman being one what is here where is there where is God where is the devil where is Heaven what is hell the nasty there is no such thing should they in what we are talking about what foreign in that Supreme Brahman the Supreme consciousness there is night this this world-renowned experience of here and there or this and that is does not exist may even not a trace of it not a little fine existence is possible then then what is this it is all false mitta it is changing something they give the example of Allah or the fan example is good fairness three blades are four blades when is high speed you don't see the plate you see it is one something you see that something it does not really tell that there are three Blades of four blades so what you see is not the truth it appears so mishamayam that is Misha that is Mitha that is non-existing it is an imagined what is everything is complete it is all imagine in the consciousness see same reality that ramakrishna gives the example the wax museum wax house Garden we know of wax museum in Hollywood yet wax Garden is what the tree is made of wax but it looks like a banana tree or a grape tree Grapevine but it's all made of wax only the garden the persons are standing there he's also made of wax there is a bench bench is also made of the wax so a wax wax wax wax wax wax but we see ordinary ignorant people we see there is a chair there is a tree there is somebody sitting on the chair someone is eating something so whatever you see it is only name and Rule perform name and form name and form but there is no Ultimate Reality of that accepting wax so like foreign what is called bhujango the snake a traditional example you called a pot with nothing but clay in earlier days when civilization didn't come up so much in early days people used to even in our childhood we saw they they made a quick clip art clay Bowl they do even now they do Potters do things very nice things with the clay and clay made base and this and that so it may be shape and size and name and format different but it is made of clay only as there is nothing but clean different name and form as there is no snake in the row similarly this name and form Universe of name and form is utterly false it is non-existing and in that Brahman there is no Trace of here and there this and that which is known to the world of duality in that in that absolutely pure stainless nature of Brahman there is no trace of this ignorance or anything it is therefore in this yoga sastra in this description of Union with God Movida knowledge self-knowledge book of self-knowledge in the sanghbada discussion or meeting of vasudev bhagwan Krishna and Arjuna santikitayam abdishanti Gita sixth chapter here ends the sixth chapter so therefore the world which we well know which which is well known as real does not after after all exist in the pure Supreme Brahman to the least just as the snake is perceived on a rope a picture pot upon a clay so also names and forms are totally false and me and imaginations okay so we'll next day we'll recapitulate the entire 6th chapter of 46 verses once and then we'll go to the next book foreign [Applause] thank you so what is that in the morning evening so a question has come in our state of ignorance are we separate from God and we do Mars back in God through knowledge no actually it has not in our state this state of ignorance we are separated mentally mental separation has happened or I am thinking I am the body in that sense I am separate when the body idea misunderstanding just it balances this moment then you feel that you are one with the divine so no it has not happened in dualistic language we say I am separated from God but you cannot separate from God is Split Second [Music] who could have lived for a Split Second because [Music] even in this space there is not there who could have survived we are all living in God it is like we let us think that we are like and other books give us very good guidance to think that you think yourself that you are like infinite ocean and in that all the ripples I am wonderful you are another people so if that Ripple nothing has happened Ripple is not separate promotion as H2O so H2 is the content so we are all there is no change there but ignorance has said I am a wave I am separate from the ocean but it content wise ocean is made of the same element as the wave is made and therefore we are not simple but if you say God as a personal God yes personal God means you are making God as separate he has created us I am a created being there is separation as I talk just now but in a pedantic way there is no separation from me anytime I already don't know that's why today we read the Contour you have your eyeglass on your eyes you forget sometimes you don't gain anything new it's called Opera not operaptor but practice what was your already gained you regain it there is a story that there is a king and there is a prince and he got little out of brain and then he left the palace and was searching and going to do digging some little food and and someday somebody found him and gave him the wisdom and he didn't believe what the prince the whole kingdom is yours and you are begging like this come like the ramakrishna's example the Tiger and the Sheep and the baby tiger was bleeding like that what you call the goals sheep and then the proper Guru came and took him hey why are you bleeding you are alive look at me I am like that he said no sir I am a sheep I am a sheep I am this I am this whatever Guru says I am this you know come put him took him to the River or the pools and say see your face you see your face they see my face is the resemblance yeah that you are that and they know she is not convinced then you sit here and he got one of the goat no and then brought a fresh meat and say eat no no no no no try he's habituated in bleeding and eating grass mundane thing of the world not the spiritual Feast so he pushed him into it and then he tested he said wow and then he went back the experience is necessary talking will not do Guru didn't allow him to just giving advice and go then the practice he hold him that's the ideal Guru hold him give him the wisdom and feed him tested the giving a touch of joy to him and they say now see don't bleed like that say I am that so that is the problem so we are not separated from God dualistic God we are separated and therefore no question of margin comes but as we live in Duality then we can practice that way and I can feel the separation and can unite also okay thank you that's the schedule says that tomorrow I don't find 26 here oh Wednesday I do not know why it is given but anyhow if it is given given anyhow tomorrow will be the class I do not know but Gospel of ramakrishna children I do not know we these are all the player or putting they were so busy so which Edition which version has been sent I don't know Shanti peace peace peace
