[26. Shanti Gita - Class 26 - Chapter 3 , Verses 8-11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb2G1lly26c)

[Music] [Music] [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality an even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face own peace peace peace so some of peace and there we are on the third chapter you can find it on your screen the first first chapter as we here christian original put this very question that yogi you are talking about they're always free and if he is free free soul how he will behave in the world how will move in the world and you are saying they are egoless but how without ego you can work how one can move without ego how we can sit without ego so this is my question this is chapter started with this question and bhagavan said ok ok i will tell you all the secrets of this you please pay your total attention and then he said what has happened you know in this transactional universe third verse in this body everyone thinks it is this is me because he thinks this is me and does any action body does but he thinks i am doing so ahamkara yogata because of the association with the ego this transactional activity is going on and there foolishly one is thinking i am doing i am eating i am talking but not janati but he does not know swam atmanam and not only not know he has got deluded in thinking i am karta i am the doer i do i am the boss here that ego angkar mohito and that angkar actually what creates all these contradiction and confusion in life but atma which is self is sadashiv it's all the time pure all the time is ten less pure absolutely full of bliss all the time free not this this time bound and that time it is all the time free and [Music] sad it does not need any another association another friend sangahino it is cheat because of the nature of consciousness and it is it does not do anything it is there as the sun is there and makes everyone work whole day whole night everyone's routine is regulated by the sun is an example similarly the atman does not do anything but its presence only in the baboharika in the transactional world with the ignorance being in between wrong interpretation this body is functioning the car is working and i am saying i am driving you are not driving the car is moving and you are only sitting over there but you forgot no i am the driver that's why better example is there in indian style or or you can say the lift or uber driving where one person comes and sits in the back he does not do anything he's the boss i will go where okay and now the driver buddhi sticks that direction and drives it huh and foolishly the man says i came here by a car this time you didn't do anything the driver did and they maintained it and all this engine functioning that did you didn't do anything so atman does not do anything even now but my body my buddhi my intellect my buddhi they are functioning and they are working and i think i am working so this is bhimajito it is it is a misconception it is delusion by this delusion atma shadow and there is no connection at all with these activities when you know that you are saccidananda you were ever blessed absolute peace absolute joy absolute atman jana yanatya know that niskiyo you have no action you don't need any action you are the only reality action is done why because to achieve something you do some action to get something because if atman is the only reality what to get more because there is nothing to get there is no question of work if one person is fully satisfied with what he has and he's satisfied and he has sufficient thing so why you will work for that so this is atman is like that success if by your spiritual practice or your regular analysis you know yada when you know that you are niskiyo you have no action your body mind is acting not you the atman then at that point getting out of it of this body-mind complex and its activities such as you remain in your own eternal unchanging absolute self but then but but you know but the man after realization what will happen he'll die no we find them they are eating they are sleeping like us then how the function is going on you said that i'm screwing i don't know but the body is functioning [Music] the body is continuing because of the past impetus of karma is forcing it to run till it drops so the bullet has been triggered as i give the example and bullet is our life's journey it is a trajectory it is going like that in that day it will go after you trigger you can say bullet come this way it will not do or come that way no it will not do it will go on doing its own till it drops no now in between someone has realized that i am atman this my body mind is functioning then till the till the bullet goes on till the life goes on what about that well a prayer of that because of the prayer of the past life's actions and thoughts accumulated activity is by force by by the force of that it moves soil sachidan on the sun but you yourself is the saccidananda absolute existence consciousness bliss and always free from any attachment it happens what how they do it is like a person subtest suspension this activity what is going on now for a realized soul it will be like a person like us when you go to sleep and there you do so much activity you are doing so much activity in your dream but you are lying in the bed you don't do anything is it not a good example to understand how the body without doing anything remaining in the body fast asleep and there in the dream you are running you are making competition with somebody how fast you can run you are within fight with somebody you are in making some fun with somebody hurry all these activities are going on but you are not doing anything so think about that it is like a shop now it's like a dream this is a daydream that is a night dream only difference is this so there is no time they so there is no call of time there is no space there is no jagat this universe there is no individual soul we are saying and the dream where are all these dream people gone where is the sun in the dream where was the road paved road where the cars were a nice food a big party where did it go as soon as you were gone it's not there it was not there it is your mental hallucination your mind is created this is also mind created it's nothing happening this is daydream you are thinking all action of maya like a as what you call the magician it has so many tricks it is also trick of the maya so maya karjamidam salman baba hari kamivotu indrajala samang mitha it is myth titles false like that of indrajal magic and therefore gurudadi vivaksantam from the waking state till the you get out of the body consciousness that means you are awakened into your own self may come these are all mike created by maya as your dream is created by your mind this big dream is created by big mind god's mind so we can easily connect these ideas it is nothing it is nothing illogical no we can easily comprehend it because my simple mind which is so weak we think but it is so much tremendous power to create another world altogether and all the events all the actions sanghatta all the activities of buddhi acting physical body acting reacting all this and you are seeing whole night i draw dream you didn't see whole night but you think that you saw yesterday dream was so long i was frightened with the dream frightening is also your mind created you enjoyed something that's also your mind created your this poor mind can create such big thing so the cosmic mind god's mind has created this what is it wrong in it it created does not mean it is true you get awakened like when you act you see you you're lying in the bed only nothing has happened to your body all these things there may be some bullet and crazy guy with a bullet and rival were gone and this or you are having feast and past and all these things nothing is there it is all mental creation soft it's like that no no there is neither you neither aham i not pretty neither the earth there is no wife there is no children bhantosi you are totally bhanta means deluded you are confused you are a confused person not you we all yours you know arjuna says krsna says you you means we all we are very intelligent but we are all foolish in that we are making this that is dhantosi it is all delusional it is all confusion and in that delusion you are crying ah what has happened this is my friend this is something has happened it is for my body is my this happen nothing happened it is a dream in mental creation so it is satan so you are thinking it is true but it is false you thinking true you are suffering don't think your suffering will go away that's vedanta teaches that no how not to think this is true but to think i am the atman whole vedantic teaching nothing new will find every day we spend hours and hours only to say the same thing and to understand the same thing so this is the eleventh verse we read now twelve verse today so [Music] [Music] beautiful the same idea it says therefore you are lamenting oh my son or woman who died who was your son there is no son in a dream you imagine you have a son in dream you saw that yesterday's big war was happening in dream you are thinking that i am helpless now such a uh how shall i fight and i am depressed these are all your confusion in mind you conquer that you may say how can i conquer i am weak no maha maha you are a mighty armed that means all of us have the power giving force no you have the power you assert yourself wow gattwa knowing it's a maya bilas it is a fun it is a play of the maya of the cosmic ignorance it is the play of the cosmic ignorance little ignorance was your in your dream and cosmic ignorance is this world and this whole universe as we see so so it is maya bilaso ignorance was playing in the dream in your personal dream and now the cosmic ignorance is playing the drama and you are a part in it i am a part in it in in our dream does it not happen we create so many people everyone has taken a role who has co who has given the role to whom so one mind has given the role my mind has given the role to the person who is loving the the person who is killing the good guy bad guy the all the activities all the warning what they are saying all is my mind only no at the same time diversified so this is also the cosmic mind and this cosmic mind is maya the great delusional power and he is creating all this thing nothing has happened you are searching on the the same you are so so therefore you conquer your believement you tongue sada means all the time advancing you are the only reality there is no second to you guru posi and not only your nondual toito even the trace of duality is not there you are free from that you are atman you are brahman you are the absolute beyond all duality there is no one to say it is that's why you are no to you are you are only one that is your own divine form and there is no trace what is a little trace of duality is impossible before jitto borjita means it is spread from beiberjit means totally free from but we emphasize this word sask it has their words are so strong then what about doito this duality i am saying i am interacting with you i know whole life is interaction with some other person some other people some other object so doitam what you are seeing maya mayam it is only made of maya maya moi it is a uh integration what you call moi means totally saturated it is saturated with maya maya mayang sarvam you see whatever is here it is all created by maya nothing is real nothing is real he knew it does not touch even it can what to harm they can do it cannot touch you you are atman you are one without any two and there all is all the play of maya but it is not able to touch your divine self wow it's too high but this too height is the only vedanta that's in my vedanti is uncompromising with the world people say you give emphasis to the world the world becomes important if you see it is a play of the cosmic mind minds play but you are beyond mind you are really that atman and which is called brahman then whom to fear whom to adore whom to hate where the slayer and the slain are one whom to praise whom to blame you are claiming he's a good person bad person it is only one he's appearing as good and bad as honest and dishonest as holy and unholy to the ignorant mind to the mind who is engrossed in maya if you are good out of maya you see it is gone with that story they will one swami was one time in himalayas and he read vedanta and one day he was thinking is it so this world i see is all maya it's a rock mountain it's a river it is the sandy bed of holy ganga it was in rishikesh and really this thought took position of him is it real they say it is dream is it dream is it dream and he really got into this thought in such a deep level he forgot if he he forgot his food he forgot his drinks begging because then you have to go for begging begging to get a food and one day passed like that is it real is it hard wrong how can it be stopped now like dream and that dream is a dream or is it a reality that took position in such a way that one day he could not sleep all night he forgot his food he forgot his drinking anything and that like a ghost it took position so one day second day and the third day thought i am going to die if i continuously think like that i i'm not asleep for last two days and i'll die and really he has do not know what to do at the same time that thought has taken possession of him and he said suddenly in a flash something happened that he understood that was a perfectly peaceful state afterwards i find everything is meaningful everything is right everything is saturated with the divine it is possible it is not only ramana maharishi not only because it is possible for everyone only if we are serious about it think seriously key story no it is like a interesting thought to understand oh mighty arm conquer your grief knowing that all these are the play of maya the cosmic ignorance you are eternally of the form of non-dual reality totally free from any trace of duality why they are saying too much in english literature people get angry if you write one thing twice no but you see these people don't follow the english rule the same thing they are foolishly we are intelligent people why they should twice but they know twice hundred times they are saying in one sentence twice in one sin in one paragraph four times five times same thing because it is rock it does not penetrate here the thoughts don't penetrate here it just goes there and suck and goes out before entering into the brain it goes its way out how it will be accepted there this is too high an idea because we have attachment to the world and we think these are very real because of that mindset it is very difficult to come out of that mindset that's why it is said all this say you are eternally of the form of non-dual reality and once he said next word totally free from any trace of duality why to say trace of duality non-dual you are non-dual means it is no trace of duality no you are you are non-dual reality and free from all trace of duality all this duality you see is the is made of my cosmic mind right this is what you see it is it is created by the cosmic mind as as i said just now in my mental creation when i create somebody they are the person created he says something he talks something he moves he even hits me now i have created but they they hit me see you think about dream experience it's a very great idea to understand vedanta what we do my mind is creating my friend my enemy my beloved my mother my son my friend whatever and my mind creating created by mind my enemy is hitting me in the dream huh but what a fun mind has the power to create everything but you are non-dual you are the only person dreaming dreamer and the dream they get identified but forgot i am dreaming and then we get so much reaction in the dream we cry sometimes our heart beat becomes heavy sometimes even the reaction comes to the physical body after fear when you woke up then we perspire like that no so it is so real but it's all created by mind my mind has created my enemy my mind has created the person who is stabbing me in the dream see it's an impossible thing possible non-dual but playing as dual so the this duality is made of that same maya everything is created by maya ignorance cosmic ignorance or individual ignorance i am talking now two technical terms avida and maya is the individual ignorance creating my dream world as we do and cosmic ignorance is the god's play which i am a part there but when my ignorance will go away the veil of maya will also drop it will drop my ignorance and my are not different it is individual or cosmic but when individual drops cosmic will also drop because the same skin they have parallel connection geared together so the self in you is never touched by this truth and that is philosophy we are talking about vedanta philosophy philosophy is a incomplete philosophy on the foundation of sankhya vedanta stands they say two ideas they act they are dualists shankar is a dualist because there is jorah there is consciousness purusha and prakriti and they are eternal purusha is all the time there prakhiti is also all right when they come in contact they create all these things when that distance that's done but our point is that now duality is not the truth there is no duality it's imagination that's why it is dream it is like a magician's magic now 13 [Music] so we read the verse number 12 today now i'm waiting 13. [Music] [Music] you know this is saying that it is only one is there if i say one then what is the problem well no no you one you cannot say if you say one ramakrishna said you have the concept of two in your mind you cannot get out of it if you say one a come no not you cannot say one because some comma limited by the numerical figure whenever say one your mind talks about two three four five right or innumerable so you cannot say go brahman has one then you are saying so wrong it is one well i am telling that because this is krishna says you don't understand otherwise anything you only live in duality so i am giving you a concept that's why it is always saying it is one without a second the second word is important without a second why they use two words together it's the deep meaning is there because one is when you say one you are limited to union numerical figure numerical figure will always work in you say oh one as many plus two so it is neither one neither two so that's why it is not doing in in that absolute there is no two not bayong their duality does not remain there or it does not shine at all and sajathi in a one it cannot be here one is not limited to a numerical figure neither does there shine two it is one because it is free from distinction with its own kind three types of distinction is there no it's called technical term sajathi bhijati sajathi vijayatyu and sagata three types of swajati bijati means suppose we are all human being we are a human being that's jaati one jati so but there is different division between that no some are american some are indian some are these some language so sajati veda there is a ved difference among all human beings there are differences no shajati saugata sagato means in the same branch of tree same branch there are branches tweaks they are all different though the tree is only one one tree but it has so many leaves branches tweaks there's a separate difference in saw swa means only one but there are difference we see this type of difference now one is tree one tree that is with another tree so sawjatio means one is um tree another is palm tree one is a grape vine another is something different so so there are different so three types of different let me see veda and swajati bhijati among different totally different a cow and a human they're totally different bijatu it is ved distinction is there bijati swajati even in the cow group there are many red cow white cow this cow you can make a distinction there swagato in the body of the cow this is called the horn this is called the eyes this is called the leg this is called the tail so there are different so difference may be of three types sajati bhijati bijati means one category to another category bijati you understand that and the trees with the human being rocks with the ocean water etcetera no you can say totally different bijati swajati in the own clan say he is a human being there are different distinction and even in the same person there is it's called the hand it's the ear it's the eyes it's the nose that distinction no but in brahman there is no such distinction of the three types in the world if you want to analyze it can be categorized in three sense there is a veda distinction sajathiyu bijati bijatiyo di distinct distinctive difference from one group to another group broadly it can be separated then among the same group same trees no there are even you go to the uh garden and you find that there are uh pea countries i i i in tucson when you go you see that plenty of pecan plain trees are there big trees but all are pecan no but you can find out distinction from one pig country to the other country little difference is there even it is called the flex snowflakes one flag is different from another plate so it is one but it is difference in the same same flex having differences same person having nose here this is so much different then me and another cow another environment so totally different vijay and sajathi in the cows there are distinction so these are the three but in brahman there is neither vijayathiyo neither sagato and nor sajathi no distinction of duality can be found there so it is a technical thing but it can be easily understood in this way so he comes here it says that it is one it is one ekam because saw jaati he not trot because he is free from distinction with its own kind in brahman and nothing is there to compare with him no brahman is the only one so there is swajati as we say sahajathi in in the same cow group heart of cows there are you can separate out this is called the black cow this is called the jersey cows this is called according to the place name you can distinguish them but it is not there so there is no sahaja yogi veda it is non-dual because it is divided of distinction between different groups it is another group it is cow group it is a horse group it is different horse and cows are different no so it is bijatyou group and so it is the translation goes here one is not limited to a numerical figure neither does there shine two neither there is one neither you can say it is two because it is one because it is free from all distinction of its own kind swajati it is non-dual because it is devoid of distinction among different groups and 14 verses we have to read [Music] so [Music] [Music] as it is void of anything brahman there is nothing but brahman there is no another thing there no in this room we say the temple has so many things what are the things a floor is there carpet is there window is there chandelier is there we are there pews are there chair is there no but alone kevin brahman there is no such thing what you see i just said this is all just imagination maya cosmic ignorance shows this but there is nothing you cannot think of the distinction void of everything it is existence alone that means what is there then if there is nothing else then only what is there it is there courthouse also says about that you want to practice vedanta there he said wasting identify anyone can do this it does not need any spiritual grounding chair table is no table is name and form if you remove the table kali what remains is computer is remove the word computer computer only name and form of one object no name and form is false is it not do we agree name and form are false every name and form changes no form is changing every day so form is changing name is changing so name and form are not what is there is there is something which you call table what you call chandelier which you call clock so each table is there chair is there clock is there so wipe out the left side diverse names the world is nothing but name and form wipe out the name and from side he's he's is he is so everything is is when existence existence existence exists it's a very simple idea if you look at the ocean also you can find out you are giving the same ocean in a different ripples and movement no you say it is wave it is ripple it is bubble it is foam it is below it is a huge wave small wave tsunami you are giving names but you forget the names and don't look at the form is it not only water ocean water so can you not say it is ocean we our attention is only name and form that's why we see duality if one can see it is only water then it is absolute oneness so everywhere everyone can see brahman brahman brahman brahman atman atma it is and deputies will say it is krishna krishna krishna krishna christ christ christ christ no when they say they sing the only one they are not looking at the outer former name so that is the idea there if you can being up devoid of everything there is no other thing in brahman it is called existence alone being free from decay because it does not get destroyed existence is imperishable that existence is imperishable being related to the three states of consciousness it is called transcendental and being illuminating in nature it is the innermost self so he is talking about the brahman is described in two three ways and the one is called existence we call sachidan on the existence consciousness bliss we say so how it is so they are trying to teach us they being devoid of anything in the world it is called the what remains is the existence being free from decay this existence is imperishable it does not die brahman does not die atman does not die so it is not perishable everything is perishable name is perishable form is periscible how many john in the world so one john dies and in their family another jacob comes no so name argan form is also gone so name and form is not there in brahman so it is that's why it is called brahmani's existence and being free from decay because it does not have any decay brahman does not die have no change in it therefore this existence what is the existence this existence is imperisible existence this existence stable existence is perishable because it is one here after 100 years this table will not remain it will be lost because it is old it will break down to pieces so this is perishable existence but brahman is imperishable existence because like space it is already here and being related to the three states of consciousness what are the three states of consciousness the waking state dream state and sleep state look at that working state everything happening i say oh i did this at ten o'clock till i behind the ten o'clock time the time has changed change change behind the time i am standing someone i observed that all the activity is done i observed that so i am the witness of all the events going on from morning till time in daytime when you are dreaming you say i dreamt you are still there to observe the dream when you slept you say i slept i had a good sleep actually that there also you are there so this physically i is undying high behind that is the witness so related to the three states of consciousness this brahman and what brahman is transcendental why it is the witness consciousness means you are also witness witnessing something consciousness witnessing something drastic whenever you say i am the witness that means you are accepting duality when the i don't witness idea also goes then what remains brahman events understand point i am now saying that is 8 15 and i am talking to you okay so someone in me is observing that but that is the observer and observed two things are here now similarly in the dream observer and observed you are dreaming dream world and you so you are as a dreamer you are observer okay and then in the sleep there also something you are sleeping that is also observed by me as a dosta but when you are seeing that i am seeing the dream it is duality that's right now this verse says it is beyond that that's why it is transcendental a very fine area but if you can catch it it's a enjoyable area this is the way vedanta student lives his whole day thing that is attachment goes away for them because they think that is a witness i am the observer it is happening somewhere separating separating separating separating and then ultimate separation even i the observer is also separated there is no observer there is no observed that is transcendental that is the turiam or um oh this is transcendental so all starts here who rolls down and mo comes here and then beyond sound so transcendent fourth is called the transcendental or is the you can compare with the waking state who in the dream state sleep state and that is beyond transcendent so that is the atman one without a second so kevanam tell you we have read [Music] so that is the in innermost innermost self that is the atman and that is called brahman saksi saksham apekshayival sakshi [Music] [Music] [Music] so what does it say it says sakshi shakshma when you say sakshi witness then it depends on something to witness you cannot be witness unless there is something happening so it is called sakshi the the witness saksa affection with reference to the witness object no there should be some object then you can be i saw that you say i saw that so there will be something to see and someone will see them so sakshi with reference to the object of witness you can say you are the witness no sakshi shaksha mortal drosti with reference to the object seen this this show this show of akshaya you are the seer there are some objects to be seen that's why you are the seer you are seeing and sakshi allah [Music] sense of an implied object you are the undefinable one you have the knowledge as you rise above the mental modification so when there is no witness there is no object witness remains so long there is something to witness object there is some object that reference you are the observer so these two yes there is nothing but brahman then how can you it is all your mental modification all your seeing its mind is creating this so therefore here it says with reference to the object of witness you are the witness with reference to the object sin object seen you are the seer due to the absence of any implied object there is no implied object you are the undefinable one so who you are you cannot define why there is no object i cannot say the subject subject will be there when there is object there will be something to see then i am the seer so if there is no subject there is no nothing to look at then what is me i am that define well i know you cannot define i cannot be defined that's a brahman cannot be defined that's you cannot be spoken of that's why it is said beyond mind speech beyond all so that is very irrational thinking you have to pay more attention to feel this way that it is a subject so long subject so long there is a son there is a mother suppose there is no sun then who will be the mother then tell me so these are examples like that to understand you define somebody with reference to certain activity no there is a carpenter carpenter is there so long there is some carpentry work when the person is doing some carpentry work with the tools and things you can say is a carpenter but that carpentry no tool nothing and he is standing there how can you say he's a carpenter no so when this atman mixed with this observer observer is mixed with the observed you can say it is a witness it is witnessing something but when this activity is not there it's only broman you're undefinable you cannot define that anyway so that is the reading here brahman is undefinable because there is no witness first they said gradually took us step by step the sahaja yoga there is no distinction between your own group of people no even not even in your own personality there are so many different parts you are not separate in that way and different clan and different race difference that is not there so it is only one one bullet one cannot be said if you say one you have the concept of two see how they are taking us holding our hand by deeper and deeper then they come oh i am the witness i see the waking state i see the dream state i see the sleep state we thought oh now got something but then afterwards says no no no in that state there is no nothing to see nothing to observe then how can he be here how can he be observer and want to see so then whatever then i am undefined i have no name i cannot be defined that's why ramakrishna's birthday that wonderful words when sami was trying to write a few lines about ramakrishna's about ramakrishna on the 100th years of his celebration centenary celebration but swamiji was delaying delaying dealing and one day he wrote these few lines ramakrishna came and appeared before him and told him what is my centenary i am bartless deathless timeless spaceless and you are celebrating my birthday i who came in the form of rama i who came in the form of krishna who came my god you know she said you are celebrating my birthday i am worthless see this is the vedanta go step by step stay don't think sriracha is a simple guy sitting like this here and there he has disclosed himself in such a way okay so we end here 15 months next arjuna will put a question we'll start next day um [Music] stew [Music] yes peace here is the question does this ignorance go slowly or suddenly does this ignorance go slowly or suddenly if you talk about the ultimate experience ultimate experience happens in a moment but gradually the ignorance can be probably gradually ignorance goes away slowly as i think myself suppose there is a sun there's the sun and the sun is covered by the cloud thick cloud was their deep ignorance no by practicing spiritual discipline day and night thinking like this i am the witness and not with witness we thought witness consciousness thought is big big big idea you have to give up that idea also you are not witness so long you are witness you are in duality so what it does ignorance gradually goes away because our sadhana the mind becomes little clearer and more clear gradually gradually every day it becomes clearer as i give the example there is a deep cloud by spiritual practice it is like blowing away the cloud little by little fanning the cloud so the cloud disappears disappears but still cloud is there so as it thickness becomes lesser and lesser a deemed light of the sun which is above percolates through that people find more joy in meditation more in their prayers more inclined if one can continue vedantic path bhaktipat any path but we are talking about vedanta today so every day say we we have discussed about one hour what has happened do you think any change has come in us yes it has come a change you felt something better today while the discussion was going on it made some thought oh it is rational it seems it is it may be true not that i am convinced so little conviction is coming at least when you're discussing that moment it may go away just to finish the book and go out and all will go away but during this discussion our mind was accepting this decision that this whatever we are seeing it is my individual mind's affair it is cosmic mind's affair so it is cosmic mind is showing those things it is like a dream and it is not the truth the truth is here truth is only only with me so therefore this ignorance i will say our regular practice is very important that will give that's why it is said what is sign of your spirituality people may say sign of spirituality to see some light see some divine sin uh situation going to temple and this in dream or know how his character is being built up how your conviction is coming it's called conviction conviction that god is there it will grow every day outside expression some may have some may not have but we think only that is the only sign of our spirituality no i don't see any light i am meditating for someone it is dark i don't see any that is not important yes it may be those who are saying good but that is not the sign of spirituality is conviction god is here i feel yes that is the truth these are all not ah it is not real so that conviction as much conviction comes here that much unreal unreal and year will come so that is the gradual gradual gradual but the last part they say after long practice people sometimes feel i cannot do anything and it seems i am not seeing that experience yet and then by god's grace there is read in every scripture samiturian speaks very clearly on this point that god's grace comes and just in a moment in a flesh things open up as i gave the example of this sadhu today i told he was sincere and he was carrying on this intense thought and ultimately boom in one split second bump it appear so you can say that is the type of sudden that sudden has a precondition of the sudden experience to gradual gradual practice so to remove another question how to effectively imbibe the teachings of chapter 9 222 of the gita anandas now i think just thank you for quoting this gita and if you read the meaning of this then your answer is there gita says chintayan to manga when thinking of me me krishna who is saccidananda krishna even you don't think it's sachidanan it is their darling krishna incarnation krishna because there is nothing but god in him so honorable intent if if we can practice no no no other thought only krishna only krishna only krishna is a deep sound he is worshiping me from every aspect every breath every action every look in their mind it is only is worshipping me if one can do what is what remains tell me if you just think about that that one person that honest in tayanta is thinking of say rama krishna say christ or say buddha oh no no no no there is no gap of another thought in him one thought is rama krishna second thought is ramakrishna third thought is ramakrishna fourth thought is ramakrishna that is no chinta but what happens for our life one thought of brahma you know one thousand thought of other another one thought of may come another five thousand other thought and one thought again become so that is not but anandas intent i means one thought and the next thought both are rama krishna third thought wrong in the fourth thought drama you know five thought people and go on whatever comes that is called honorable so to reach that state with our whole life it takes no when really you one can do that you know then god will take care of everything he has no other personality but god krishna every split second if it is only charged with krishna consciousness ramakrishna consciousness christ consciousness buddha consciousness then what will remain only that consciousness will remain and you will die that's the death of the physical death of the ego and death of the ego is the success of spiritual life this pet ego awakening into a greater ego great ego [Music] you need not have to do office work sorry at that position your office work will be god will take care at that situation god will take care of your office god will supply your food god will bring food to you and unexpectedly you know you're in the deep forest someone will come to help you don't think about that that is the story read the life some great scents see their life how who supports them who feeds them in the deepest forest when there is all animal infested area who protects them who brings food to them is all god will take care that's a yoga what you have god will protect what is need he will supply so that honorable intent is a great state yes do you believe that the universe seeks to fulfill your like your desires um what to desire why to desire petty thing we are talking about desiring infinite are you desiring for ten dollar if they are talking about billion trillion dollar what you desire should be there why should he desire for petty thing let me desire for one million dollar job why shall i if i can why shall i pray for 20 per hour job why shall i do that we should crave but we should keep for the highest and worldly desire is nothing that one if one gets to that joy it is billion dollars joy and here is penny joy what penny joy we get by eating by seeing something by dancing going to party and all these things it is penny dollar penny penny penny it it like a flickering light it comes and goes away dark but when it comes infinite on ending it is never beginning never ending they are the fulfillment of all desires you don't desire anything more if you get that all desires are fulfilled there you know basically it's your job to be satisfied with what you have the universe you are talking from a very low level you are talking about what i need that means your body you are thinking of your body body needs this body fins finds pleasure my sense is find excited there is nothing it's only this petty and it has its follow-up reaction anything you do to the senses it has his reaction and this is transcending the senses so if one has not finished the experience let them go have those experiences and see the bitterness of it let them go for enjoying fun let them go day after day day after day and after some time you'll find what happens to them people go for drinking that's good go go try go on afterwards what happens the drink kills you you don't enjoy the drinking but drink enjoys you you are going to drug many people are going to drug drug is good good good good i said this drug and a better drug and this drug and that drug and made and other things and you go you're caught into that now you cannot come out of that but loving god meditating on god it is joy more joy more joy and more freedom and more freedom greater greater freedom it does not mind you it rather makes you free gives a new dimension of your you the same person you feel what fool i was i was exhausting my energy to get little excitement in this farm or miss this drug or this drinking and here is so much inside me just close and i don't go to anyone i don't spend money and all the joy is here with me can i get it and it has no reaction every sensual joy has reaction but this is the only joy where there is no reaction rather it inspires you you have a good meditation today after 10 days you think about that your mind will be lifted you go for some sense that experience after 10 days you think about that your mind will go depressed haha today is not that good meal aha today is not that good ice cream no so that is depressing one is lifting one is depressing we are open to do both the things what you want we want this way or that way so that if one has not finished this this way let them go and experience that and come with the experience that oh i tried it but it is not i don't get it i try this and i find a good result better result healthy result peaceful result joyful and no one can take away my joy every joy in the world can be taken away somebody he needs money to fund to joy but it does not need any painting you and your mind and absorbed in yourself no you have so big identity so this is the distinction so yes your question will when we get to this knowledge will our desires be fulfilled yes because it is the fulfillment of all desires because there is no more to ask for when one realizes god there is nothing more to achieve okay but everyone we are in different levels now no one is bad i don't think that i give the example of drug drinking i'm not saying anything good or bad i am saying it is it gives a very low level of experience of joy followed by infinite abyss of darkness putting it into our life into much dangerous and difficult and uh humiliating situation depressed situation i don't want to be like that but you those who have not let them go let them experience and and then let them tell themselves i tried if you don't believe the people who have actually moved into the path of joy and blessings all the saints of the world all religions they are if it is so easy with the drug then why people will lead a celibate life or in a household life a dedicated life to god why they will spend so much time they will get in the market and get it and get brahmacano so that makes us weaker that is the major point those fulfilling desires does not satisfy us but those need experience they will have to go through it but be intelligent whatever you experience understand and test it and then don't go further take your time which will take you to higher life all should be intelligent our time is important our youth is important our life does not come back the day is gone we will not come back again today is gone gone from our life forever is not coming back now if we have utilized it in proper way it's our gain if we have done wrong it is our loss gain and loss every second it is going on going on going on so it is our responsibility to find the greater joy greater peace everyone should be intelligent no you don't think the monks are very fools they have given up all this attachment or at least trying to give up attention and all these sense pleasures and things a hard life no they are not doing any mercy to anyone they are intelligent they thought that why to ask for hundred dollar i get one thousand dollars that commitment is there and we'll get it so it is not they are not actually renouncing anything they are rather enjoying more you go to good sadhus you will see their face always peaceful and joyful blossoming with joy materially physically they may be weak physical body may not be something but internally they are joyful okay thank you all good luck is there any question got to know truly i thought oh uh is there on english copy of santi gita
