[70. Shanti Gita - Class 70 - chapter 6 - verse 33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TPPbOk7T5IE)

foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign foreign lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and ever more shine in our hearts which you resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to our reading of the shanti-gita we are in the chapter 6 and we read about the creation of this universe that was the discussion going on and the the idea is that it is said that when we read that in this infinite consciousness to mahamaya is expressing our children manifesting this is so it is manifested in some places as a little part of it that means this creation is not the whole Brahman is much Beyond so only a little part of that is creation like you look at the ocean there was on the Ripples and waves there are only only a little there is nothing in comparison to the content of the ocean water if you compare the ocean water and you compare the waves and ripples on the surface how big and how turmoil it may be your how small together it is nothing in comparison to that that's why he says that is uh Maya has manifested in the infinite undivided consciousness which part of that Consciousness can she feel even a little with the names and forms a little bit of manifestation has come now 32 verse we have read also that says that no Maya autism Maya is not capable of doing anything Wonder in Brahman because you cannot change any make any change in the brahmana Maya is the power of Brahman but Maya cannot change that's the dualistic Theory the world has become like this you know it is not a transformation it is an appearance is the philosophy so he is bringing the idea of Beaverton that whatever Maya has done he Maya is never capable of doing any bikar or change or wonder in Brahman the Consciousness by its own inherent power that is called the what do you mean that Brahman has its own inherent power and what is that power simaya that is the power which is impossible to happen he makes it possible impossible this creation was not there but see so so it is so strong in our perception it is and we are so bothered about every tidbit things of this life no but it is actually Brahman is there what that how it is happening it is by the Maya Maya comes from where is another Power no it is the Shakti of the Brahman that's right it's like though not it is not talking about the Tantra idea that Brahman and Shakti are one and almost it is coming to that idea in the Brahman this change he cannot do anything Maya cannot do any change or wonder means picar or transformation that you have to say something how that absolute becomes many so there should be some power which makes him it transformed it appears to be transforming inherent power alone displays various forms so it is by his own magical power and there is nothing very much to say that extraordinary external power has forced Brahman to become like this that means this is appearance and not the ultimate truth that's easy that is 33rd verse gives a clear idea about this creation Theory he says we are reading 33 today is [Music] a beautiful verse which to be contemplated to understand the creation according to vedanta that's why she says this is all vivarto vivarta means without getting any transformation any change it looks like that without the least change they are in changeless appears like this changeful this is the very sankara's great then how it is it is like a sapna as you have here had the experience of soft no dream last night so you saw it but the infinity was lying in your bed and you have created something in your mind and can I hold it suppose you are seeing some dream there is Tiger is attacking you or you are running after a car or you are being hit by something or you are having some good feast and I can hold like that I can hold any there is no existence of that it is existence only in the mind mind has created that and mind itself is Maya that's why another important Point some people can understand this is mind is Maya what is Maya you try to understand Maya look at your mind mind is creating and recreating mind says it is real I say it is real my state is it is not I say it is not so it is the creation of the mind and so that be what everything illusary the universe what you see and where where is there any ground up is it is something about it is like a dream but is there any Dreamer sarbam udistani that udist and the substratum of this universe what you see like this it is like a snake created by your mind and the snake has never become rope has never become snake whether you are crying or you weeping or you are rejoicing it is snake has been in your mind only without changing the Rope you are crying because the snake has beaten your snake is changing you in the darkness no the in ignorance you are thinking that which is Brahman unchangeable thus row you are thinking as snake and that snake is creating all the types of anxieties worries and how how you are to go to doctor Hospital Etc and that all this channel is to nirmalade this is stainless that is the foundation sachidananda brahman's stainless at the background what is the example how can you understand that look at the akasa in the space there is smoke or the cloud it it is true it appears true but it is not it is only an app and it's just it is created in certain temperature it can with another temperature it will all be dropping like that of a rain or it will evaporate it has no permanent existence here is the point we have to understand that Maya Maya is like dhuma when you smoke I even forget about Cloud better example smoke they have given so if the smoke comes in the sky you see when fire goes we say oh there is smoke that's a smoke actually pollutes the entire place maybe you know but can smoke remain did pollute the space space remaining space smoke comes Muslim goes it does not touch at all the Sky the space Sky remaining pure stainless it appears it is like a smoke and fumes and all this system but it is not true truth is the space remaining untouched by the smoke or the fire or whatever is happening similarly the Atman the Brahman the consciousness that self witness whatever we name that remains untarnished untouched unadulterated even if we see as if it is polluted that's equal as if as if it looks as if so the Maya okay it is like a Duma the smoke in the space the smoke can expand in all Direction but this expansion or in contain space it is there is no Sangha sangami's Association or so no touch it is there but untouched our space is the best example if fire comes smoke comes to this peace remains they were pure you cannot touch this so fine it is so big money subtle so here Atman is so pure Brahman is so pure stainless It Is untarnished by this Maya as it appears even if it appears it cannot pollute it cannot touch that so there is no Touch of association with the smoke so Maya do it is sin like this it is untouched by the Consciousness Consciousness is Untouched by all these appearance or disappearance never becomes Molina and daddy so this is theory everything is illusionary like a dream Maya and its effect the visible Universe have sprayed upon the substratum of the pure Consciousness they give the example before then you drop a drop some oil on the surface of the river or any container it spreads you put it in one place but the oil spreads like that similarly Maya spreads they call the conscious entity that is sachidananda as if command by Maya that's why Maya pure Consciousness it is if spread upon the substratum and the substratum is the pure consciousness just like smoke spreads into space if you smoke one place it just expands in all Direction there is no association or contact between the smoke and the space so Consciousness and the Maya has no association in that way according to vedanta philosophy will we say that that is also Brahman brahman's power so it is also true Brahman is true brahma's power is also true let's say this invisible universe is nothing but the Divine mother mother everywhere foreign therefore the space is not sustained by stained by the Molino therefore the space umbara is not stained Molina but how do we know it is Maya uh I can have a little discussion here the what is that Purina there are different philosophies one philosophy says Purina Puri number means that God has transformed or Brahman has become the world if you say so it is it is vedanta will not accept that philosophy it is the philosophy of the dualism it is a milk as converted into yogurt if milk is converted with yogurt it cannot come back to milk again so this is the Bieber mean it has already converted into the other one thing converted into another it has become changed into something else so this world that Brahman has become this if you say so then Brahman is not Eternal Brahma is subject to change or milk is subject to change and the change transforms the milk into another type of object another type of item which is not exactly milk 's effect is one thing yogurt separate is different no yogurt you call is just probiotic milk has probiotic so everyone could have drunk milk huh I do not know science so yeah so milk cannot be either people cannot drink milk and say I am taking probiotic but people will say I am taking yogurt yogurt is providing that means you transform one thing to the another its characteristics and in other things also changes so this if you say Brahman has become this that's good but it has no way to go back to milk again no but go to Brahman but upanishad says Brahman is absolute Brahman is one without a second that will conflict that it has been transformed and it has taken a new step so this if you say accepted theory of Purina Sankara will say you can justify the nature of the Brahman then you are saying Brahman is sachidananda Brahman is absolute it is it cannot be converted into anything it is unchangeable absolute infinite beginningless endless reality if it is beginning less endless how it can be transformed into something which is limited and has its existence in a particular time and so many changes are happening in it unchanging then how how it is changing that's why vedanta simply says it is your relation nothing is changing you are only thinking that it is changing it is your misconception so get out of your misconception and think that you are stainless Atman or what you see it is only Brahman but now the question is that now the question is coming how to understand it is this universe then it is the effect of Maya so you can understand by scars effect Caron should be called should be there looking at this world we call it Maya because we see these things why did it come therefore we use it so this yeah foreign [Music] um [Music] now how can I know Maya is playing all this role you're seeing the effect what is their effect this universe as we see seeing this sun moon Stars human being where it come from so it is the cards of an effect of Brahman so karz of that Maya because the mayasakti which actually not there it creates certain things that's why he said Maya has two aspects it covers covers your knowledge Maya always or ignorance always does two things first of all it will Veil their knowledge and then it will create something which is not there that is the beauty of Maya let's say we give always the example of the movie when you go to the movie Hall you see everything yeah or your friends you are going and you are just sitting in a chair and having some popcorn and enjoying your stay and just for fun we want there now this knowledge will be off passed by ourana it covers our knowledge so see that the music goes on gradually and then slowly the light is off it is Darkness it covered the reality that we are all sitting side by side we come to fun and enjoy no and now slowly slowly our full attention it is the projection actually it's called projection movie is projected projected on the screen that projection when it starts pass our full attention goes from the reality what is this and goes into Suppose there is a horror movie immediately you get excited and entered into that horror mood are you tense there huh and you sometimes feeling what is it going to happen now probably and you identify with them this is not not only it happens there but our identification so much people sometimes Cry Sometimes shout sometimes all this reaction comes as if what is going on not only it is projection projection identification with the projection uh 3D movie so we went to see one time 3D movie and there a the jungle and the snake and and the snake was just biting and we are sitting in our own seat we jumped out and as if the there's bites and and also the the create such environment that a little glow of air comes here little sprinkle of water all scrubs if you feel that as if you are in between and you and the children were jumping and crying so it is not there is there anything really it is only projection and because of the glass Maya glass the 3D glass if you take out this then you see this is only distant but if you put it here you see it is happening on your head here so this is the Amaya glass Maya glass makes it so real it is covering the truth covering that we come here for enjoyment and fun and we are crying there why you cry entering into the Maya you cry you forget the reality you are in a safe movie Hall nothing is happening there is no jungle there is no snake there is no tiger nothing is there but we are feeling the presence of all these things so that's why it is called Maya so Maya has this two aspects of this Earth the power the person and his music Talent the person and his auditory skill you cannot separate out it is there when it manifests then you say oh he's a great auditor auditor oh he's a great musician so brahmania was chitamaya this Maya rest is in with the Brahman what is the Mayas to Magic Stick one is it covers and another thing is Project covering power and projecting power when it covers it occurred to The Unbroken unit that is broken by Auburn by covering aspect and then there is I am individual and this jagat is there the world is there I am there I am seeing this and I am a part of that movie and then I am all the actions and the actions are happening so this is the shankara's idea so there cannot be any Maya without Brahman that's the point major point is that there cannot be Maya without the substratum of Brahman Brahman must be there waves cannot be there without the ocean how much you can think about ocean is the reality waves are unreal why are there it is sometimes there sometimes not there sometimes it manifest sometimes does not so here the very Cosmic ignorance Maya can only be inter in inferred by the effects effect is what just like that means like a power of Fire as it's understood how do you understand that there is fire with the burning power so as you understand the power of fire what is the power of fire fire means burning power so when you find a burning power then you say it's the fire so similarly it can be Maya it is there is Brahman there can be Maya but Maya cannot exist independently ah that is the major point that that this whole world cannot be true without the substratum of Brahman that means we have to focus our mind in Brahman that's why it is said that the very Cosmic ignorance that Mr Maya can only be inferred by its effects just as the power of fire is understood by the burning foreign those who are your own experience observing the world or experienced by your own experience it causes Brahman observing the world we can understand his cause Brahman can be inferred we see the world therefore we have to understand its ground is Brahman without the background of Brahman without the background of the ocean you look at the we we go to this beach we look only on the waves but we don't see the untroubled calm Serene infinite expanse of the ocean water below so you only look at the world world we are looking in the name and form is transformation it's birth death Decay this that going on what is going on on the foundation of that unchanging absolute what is the ocean of Brahman so this is observing the word its cause can be inferred that's why those were intelligent people they can look this world not only a present existence but it goes to the foundation what is the ground of this appearance all the ground of disappearance is like in the ground of experience in the white screen or the ground up experience is coming because Maya but the ground this experience is going on through the glass but the ground is what ground is called the unchanging reality sachidananda so the 34th verse says that that perichosmic ignorance Maya can only be inferred if someone asks where is Maya how how can you see Maya well you see the world this world itself is a proof that there is Maya you know what is Maya Maya cannot be independent so if you see Maya there is Brahman also as the ground of it that's why I try to see Brahman through the Maya to the lens of Maya you can penetrate it that's the only few intelligent people they can see like this unintelligent people or ignorant people see the world only they don't see the play of Maya and Maya is playing on the ground of Brahman so they don't understand that okay so that is the 34th verse okay now 35 this is a big verse [Music] foreign Maya ah this is a big verse so what it says not Maya not this Maya it's Cosmic ignorance foreign it is not this Maya is not in caitanya means it is not finished with this in this Maya he's caitanya there is no Cosmic ignorance Maya in consciousness that means if it is if you say this Maya is the power of consciousness but it is not in the Maya in the Brahman then if it's Brahman no one will get a propaganda so Maya when you see the world to explain it you say it is the power of Brahman but when you cross the Maya's Veil and enter into the truth then it is Brahman alone so there is no Cosmic ignorance or Maya in in Consciousness just as entry of darkness in nassal foreign those that are blind those who are blind for them in the noon time even son has no sense of light there is no light there is no Cosmic ignorance or or Maya just as Darkness cannot enter the sun just not the Darkness may be there in the eyes of a person but that cannot enter into the sun so projection is here which is projected that is beyond so Sun like sun Atman Brahman is remains unchanged not affected by the because of the improper vision those who are blind during the day can only imagine Darkness even when the sun is shining bright then a blind person who has no way to see the light so blind during the day daytime the sun is there but blind person standing in the Sun only imagine Darkness house also have so they imagine they they see it is dark but that darkness is imagined due to the blindness similarly the Consciousness is everywhere like bright Sun but we don't see because you are blind in ignorance so they are comparing this idea as a blind person even in the full light bright light of the day sees Darkness only and cannot see the light self evolved in light similarly an ignorant person who is blinded by a Maya cannot see the Consciousness which is all around and everywhere the sunny day when you are out sun is everywhere are everywhere but he that owl or a blind man cannot see the light though it is standing in the light so ignorant person cannot see the Consciousness the Brahman the Atman the cell this witness Consciousness whatever so many technical terms we can give cannot look at that cannot feel that cannot see that that imagination is not true that imagination the blind man is imagining there is no sun as we see God is not there but to find God we are all searching day and night all spiritual Seekers that's why vedanta says whom whom to meditate where to meditate you are seeing this is Brahman but it does not make any sense to our brain because blinded by ignorance huh Maya ignorance these are the significance why you are talking about Maya why are you talking about significant ignorance that because standing in the when a full bright light of Brahman Consciousness around everywhere no like a blind in the daytime a blind person in the daytime it experienced the it means the experience of darkness is not a matter of one's own interpretation even to the slightest extent similarly fools continuously imagine Maya alone in their mind so the ignorant people aren't consciously every day thinking this world to be true and Consciousness or God simplistic language God is nowhere God you have to search for God and to find God but blindness to be removed if the blind person gets the eyesight back what will change outside will change the light was already there only the person's blindness gone then the entire world becomes bright and Light it is now itself if it is for us we are we don't see God but from beginning now now at this point Ibraham they are seeing the Divine everywhere ah he God is pulsating God is moving huh God is in everyone ramakrishna is to see no that latu is sitting like this I see that the Lord is sitting like that huh sir holy mother saying the ant is moving and the Qatar and radhi was trying to kill and holy mother said don't kill don't kill don't kill and what she said I see exactly it is Sri ramakrishna's feet srirama krishna's eyes personality in the tent my note and it is all but why we don't see anything that is because blindness that blindness is ignorance or with the or in the cosmic level called Maya I am not seeing that's true millions of people are not seeing why but millions are blinded by ignorance only few people who are have the eyesight to see those who have eyes they will see the eyes means not this eye with the eye of wisdom eye of wisdom knowledge so that's why ignorance exists in mind in the mind truth is now and here that's why all the vedanta students they say you are not to meditate but you are too you are not as such but to accept don't seek God that's a very commonly used word don't seek God but see God you are thinking that God is sitting somewhere at extraterrestrial and one day you are meditating and it will jump fall from the heaven in front of you with ten Arms Of course that may also be but but that is not when experience comes that is comes in a Flash but it happens that's why to remove the ignorance to remove this concept of Maya or be particularly individual experiences that or Avida removal that is the sadhana only to be done that is already it is here we are not to bring God here God is here only we have to recognize it understand I that's it people normally ordinary people called someone as a human being of the Lord in the in the form of this narrow in the human in the human form I see I am this I see that Lord not only I see that I serve at the feet of the that Lord who resides in that so their eyes are open that they can see that truth in everywhere so one was saying that uh yesterday we are reading night time and that's swamiji somebody said swamiji is very compassionate and does not understand judge understand the quality of a person good man bad man he does not understand he gives all great support and freedom then he has he has complained that you don't understand people and you give total Liberty to and they do wrong things then swamiji said what do you say I do not know anything I know they are past I know they're present I know their future I know everything so their eyes are so pretty clear but they see and they serve God in human personality to lead them whoever is there from wherever a bad guy he is not fit for monastic life or for something okay stay and then he is proven to be a troublemaker for others when the complaint goes to somebody then they said you know you don't judge people that's why how he can judge in his eyes it is all one they see the truth inside the Veil of Maya is not covering them so that's why from that standpoint and they cannot judge holy mother could not make a distinction between the burglar and the Vivekananda or brahmananda so that because you'll see a high Plateau hype high level of perception Maya's Veil has just been removed from there so that is the idea those who are done then they will be the only the ignorant people they are even standing in the middle of the bright Sunday we will see the darkness so ignorant people like us we see Darkness this world as real and every happening is so real and so involved we are all involved into it attached to it Action Reaction all the time going on when the person of wisdom they stand always above that not that by Magic but the seed because of their veil has been dropped so another 15 minutes any question okay so I can see it another one almost [Music] but giving so many reasons why you have to understand there is no Maya Maya is also non-existing but you are giving value to it because you are bound under that when you will realize then you'll understand in the way this statement is given here there is Maya due to lack of his own existence and form it is not self it is not self existing entity but it is dependent on some entity because of Brahman the Maya sukti is there because of the fire there is the heat because of that water there is the fluidity because the example there is milk there is the whiteness or fluidity of the milk so because of the fundamental element this characteristic is found so Maya but ignorance the cosmic ignorance even individual ignorance you know it is not it is not his own it's not standing in his own strength that's right due to lack of its own existence and form and almost two minutes it is in non-entity Maya there is no Maya non-entity appearing to be entity snake non-entity I Appian him to be entity in the in the room it says rope is Brahman snake is non-entity Maya is not entity Maya individually has no entity of Brahman if you take it then you can explain there is Maya because you are seeing the impact you may say why are you accepting Maya at all because I see this world and I'm crying weeping and rejoicing in this Maya so do you see Maya is there there's an effect looking at the effect this world and its creation is the effect seeing this effect we know there is Maya but Maya has no independent existence that's why you know because it has no satta its own entity it has known it has the it is same same idea uh um August it is Boost means which is a reality this object because of objectivity is no object it is not a solid object it is just an imagination in the mind creates this imagination because of the second reason first reason is because of the form that lacks its own existence addition is a known entity it has not entered no entity at all there is no trace of this existence of that and it is not it's not known self is capital Atman it is not the Atman it is not self and it is not a non-self nature and third is fourth is he that it is e naught it is not Consciousness Consciousness is behind that make this non-conscious entity to be acting like we give the example heat is behind the open human over the pots and pans below that heat is the cause of the jumping of the potatoes and rice inside the cooking pot cooking the jumping of the you know jumping this is the example another example though it is not a perfect example but looking at the jumping of the potatoes and rice in the cooking pot and the Heat of the cooked item we can consume that there is background heat that Consciousness is the heat here Consciousness is the background but you can see that the pots and pans and also the rice and thing it will not jump it will not have any expression until an unless the Consciousness percolates into it so similarly it is Jada Jada means inert it has no consciousness of its own it is borrowed Consciousness or the Consciousness reflected that's why it is appears to be so worldly appears to be so real it is so moving it is pulsating with energy yeah it's in the having him with mind with intellect people are working with this so Maya does not exist why giving this four argument because of the former lack of its own existence it is it has not existence like its own it is a borrowed existence Consciousness is there motion is there borrowed some water is borrowed and that makes a shape so this shape and the idea these are all borrowed so it is not that's it first ground lacks its own existence second point it is it is because it is not entity no entity it is no non-entity and then third point it is it is not the conscious self and fourth point it is matter it cannot have its existence or its power at all here the tree grows plant grows human personality is growing huh how everything is moving how everything is pulsating in energy what is energy behind the energy says this energy behind that is that Eternal energy so that Consciousness is the substratum of all and nasty mind like that because of this poor ground we can prove the nasty Maya it is nasty nothing is really there Maya and the Maya itself does not exist because without he said only Brahman in Brahman this projection is happening it is non-entity because vedanta will be absolute vedant will say this world is not there at all it is my eyes showing a magic show it is nothing happen therefore because of the form that lacks its own existence as it is also a known entity because of its non-self nature and due to see notness Maya does not exist and know it was certain that that is the truth that means what does it say that the world you see is illusory that is the vedantic term all the time we hear it is illusory it is non-existence it has no existence but how do you see the existence it is a borrowed light as the moon slide most light is a borrowed light but it is light people mistake it and it's soothing it pleases us when we see the beauty of the Moon we never think that it is a borrowed light of the Sun do anyone enjoy the moon like that I think everyone is pleased with the moon's own Beauty as it was as if it is Moon's Beauty but it is the Maya of the Sun similarly this world is so beautiful and also beautiful and good and bad both but whatever it is only Maya it has no existence you are seeing the Rays of light of the sun Eternal Sun that Atman that Brahman to [Music] [Music] known as as usual maybe one or two questions is the jivatman the mind which is in ignorance what is the jivatman actually is considered to be 20 money 24 Cosmic principle there is jivatman how the Consciousness reflected in individual self that is called the jivatman Consciousness reflected in individual mind our Dream body just imagine what is in our dream that is easy to remember what is in the dream you have five organs of perception in your dream your eyes ears nose hand feet five organs five material you have a body that body is made like this body this body is made up pipe gross food gross elements air water fire Etc and the dream also we have five such elements that say the dream body is created so five organs of perception five organs of action five what is called the object of the bhutas what are their fire extension subtle tan matter and what is left five five ten five organ of perception and organs of action type thing then five elements fundamental Elements which make the body and Kitty up this morning and the object that they put 25 into 420 plus you have your mind there there is your mind there is your under intellectual functioning in that dream you decide shall I go there or run this way shall I eat or not eat so there are also the mind is functioning intellect is functioning and your ego is also functioning and memory sometimes comes that's why it is called chitta otherwise you can say so so these are the call 24 principles foreign this and that is the jivatma means what how many items are there that I'm talking about and jivatman means that that is the transmitting immigratory soul that that moves from one body to the other body other body to the other body that's the jivatman so the question was that what the jivatman what jivatman the mind which is the ignorance which is in ignorance yes of course is so long the ignorance is the Atman only one Consciousness remains all these ego mind intellect and memory plus here is 20 20 principles all this made is called the jibachman and this department transmigers and you understand the birthman in the light of the Sun and Etc then you see it is a like a mind is a pot is a physical body and water in the pot is like the mind and the reflection of the Sun that makes the Sun as if bright Sun there one Sun here in it you keep 20 pots and with filled with water different colored water this 20 sun is reflected there so 20 these are jibatma but this jivatman are only in simply name you break the pot one by one by one way so then you are going to see there is no reflection if the 20 parts are all broken then only the sun remains but when there is a pot there is a body mind identity no and in that body that's in the mind and the reflection that's called chit chaitanya Consciousness is reflected there so here I am talking so whose Consciousness it is to say the original Consciousness reflected through the mind that's why I am talking to you through a mind to my understanding to my ego so when one can just drop all these things then the spot is broken the spot is broken means your identity with the physical body mental body emotional body everything is gone then you become that yeah the some of the aspects you're talking about the product sense of organs of the body are those those are also like effects of Maya ability is Maya so Miami accepting the knowledge of Brahman accepting that absolute truth that there is neither you neither me neither talking neither questioning neither answering in that state when really gets absorbed into the essential nature of ours so that is beyond Maya but even you see anything in dream you see you have a god Vision that's also Maya but at pure Maya that is good Maya and bad my eyes that which shows us this difficult world and this I I identity with the body and with the mind is the major cause see identity I did so long the port is there the water is there and water is there the reflection is coming over there if one I disidentify I am not the pot I am the light I am not the water I am the light I am not the mind I am the light so then you disidentify it is there reflection is people may see but you are tuned to the real sun in the sky so that is me I am that so that should be the way to move inward or everything is Maya unless we we reach that point we are in the realm of Maya all the time our waking state is in Maya dream state is in Maya sleep state is in Maya that's why we don't know that we are Atman if it is not Maya then I would have known it though I am analyzing it makes sense that is yes I am not devotee because there is somebody in me who is now seeing my waking State who is seeing my dream state who is observing my dream less sleep state so there is something behind but I never identify there I am always identifying with the visible Universe with this mind and emotion and other things in the world of reality okay so another question has come from where to draw inspiration to live a life of Purity that is dedicated for the pursuit of higher goals in life from where to Joy and from where to draw inspiration ramakrishna is our drawing drawing inspiration Vivekananda is to draw infinite inspiration direct disciples are there all the saints of the different religions are there their own inspiration because they lived in the world they underwent so much suffering and they understood this this Joys and suffering and understood that it is only appearance and the real it is the ultimate truth so we should get inspiration from holy people from the scriptures sastra and the holy people the scriptures like gospel like upanishad like Gita like dhammapad like Bible and get the inspiration from those and also the Saints the life of the saints that their life their message let alone having a higher purpose in life it is difficult nowadays to find someone as a role model who is living a clean life in the world also that is true it is always rare to find a person who is clean who is perfectly pure but even if they are there food is very difficult for us to recognize them true it is true you cannot get a holy person a role model ideal in the streets and billions in millions and billions only a few can be like that but they are here without them the world would not exist but to recognize them is also difficult genuine people never show them that they are big great people and also they'll hide theirs and themselves and there are people of course they are and role model is recently we saw ramakrishna was the historical incident their disciple brahmananda their disciples we saw their disciples are still there so it is a living example set before us so we should follow them and then even if I see you know person of knowledge we will doubt them we'll criticize them because his behavior will not be able to understand Brahman canis are very difficult to understand when he was here he was most criticized ramakrishna himself was induction he was criticized how do you know he's a pomegranate if he is criticized like that and he's thought and is criticized in a very vulgar way also things they all the Saints have their own but to understand him are a holy man we need some Holiness more but true you can say that who is the idol yes ideal is there we have to make Vivekananda the ideal you can make where our holy mother the ideal it depends on your nature but what temperament suits and see mother lived in a period say second world war no that time and also first world war so and so much trouble going on people are hungry people are dying day dying in the street no that that playing play came in Calcutta are these that person went through all these things you know so also people saw her how many people recognize that she should be their role model in our life how she kept the Peace of Mind how she is be an example among the people of that age nividita and others is to come to a mother to get the inspiration from her so I think true you are true that it is difficult nowadays to find someone as a role model but we need not have to look at the living role model if you don't find at least those who live the other day just the other day their presence can be felt so we can make them role model thank you okay Shanti peace peace peace tomorrow gospel class so at 7 30 pm we will be here [Applause]
