[74. Shanti Gita - Class 74 - chapter 6 - verse](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwgmKLu-0OQ)

foreign O Lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all so we have finished the chapter six of yeah chapter 6 of the book which is called Shanti Gita the peace song so here in this chapter Arjuna was a student an original is very much gripped because of his death of his son and he was despondent like bhagavad-gita this is also the teaching of the Lord Krishna to Arjuna to bring him out of his despondency and give him the courage and strength with the philosophical background of our life and meaning of life so there we are really reading this very vedantic chapter this is the sixth chapter I I finished the other day but today I will do a synopsis of the entire chapter in one place we will talk about all the philosophical discussion they have done quickly quickly Passover so the question came what is the truth to be realized and in this chapter one six the Lord said I'll tell you the essential truth is listen to me or you know my friend which is atigusham this is secret extremely secret why because God is everywhere but we don't see therefore this the science through which you understand or realize this truth is the subtlest of the subtle subtle thing will look to the microscope or distant telescope but no machine has come out to see God with the machine and they are putting so it is the subtlest of the subtle and finest of the finest truth so you I am I am addressing you those philosophical discussions addressing to those questions of life but you should listen very carefully why you can get out of the Troubles of birth and death life and death that what is the truth very simple vedant is essential teaching of vedanta is expressed in this verse second name you know only there is one reality it is absolute Consciousness when alone that Consciousness is perverted everywhere and there is nothing else rather than this truth the whole universe is pulsating and moving and active and inactive behind that is Cosmic Consciousness behind that is the only truth and all else is whatever you see that is not there no Maya even the Maya is created pedantic term there is no Maya there is no God there is no individual soul there is no land there is no time there is no space and there is no moving any moving non-moving objects of the world it's the highest truth of vedanta when one transcends the limitation of the body mind they reached into that state where all these dualities collapse as you go into deep sleep there there you find being in the Deep Sleep state you only just forget about the world there is no word there is no pain there is no suffering there is no joy there is an achievement there is no failure that's if you can feel in the Deep consciousness of this come here and sit in this line so that I can see the faces whatsoever foreign so this is the truth that there is this universe is apparent Universe when your mind is alert we see we are the senses are alert then you see the universe and you need different level of your mind when mind collapses in samadhi or it gets absorbed into the truth then what happens there it remains nothing but that absolute truth so no Maya there is no Maya there is no issue no one is created the universe and please remind it we are talking about the highest philosophy we are sitting here I am seeing you and this vedanta saying oh there is no creation there is no time there is no space we live in Click Click time we are here because the time is up 7 30 and we'll go away when the class will be over we leave in time we are in the space moving this is the whole Temple we are getting out coming in and they said no space no time it is craziness what are you talking about all these are so long we are living in the limitation of our time in our mind and the mind you transcend then this world disappears you may say disappear for me but not for others that is not the concern we are all concerned about our own experience no and then he continues [Music] there is neither you neither me you means you the Arjuna the student I the teacher Krishna and neither there is no Earth different planes of existence in the subtle levels of existence called Heavens heavens and Hells all this concept what you have there is nothing else listen even the trace of it nasty nasty International not this there is no nothing nothing then what is nothing everything is nothing re buddhistic idea there's nothing what is there is nothing because these are all changing how can I say something is there think what is the if something is there means it does not change but you cannot say what is here not changing every moment every Split Second everything is changing from sun moon stars galaxies down to the subatomic particle everything is moving and changing and changing so that is nothing but these are all changeful things means it is not true what is truth that which does not change so fourth verse says then what is this universe I see you see God you see the Divine only Brahman okay is permeated by the cosmic Consciousness Cosmic Bliss Cosmic peace Cosmic tranquility like the whole universe is filled with the motion just imagine of the ocean ocean is filled with water and water and water only Limitless but ocean is limited but brahmania is considering it is unlimited infinite and that is the only reality and sat now really there is nothing else than did think day and night because everything is changing but change is possible on the substratum of something changeless your car is moving 60 miles speed in reference to what the platform on all the road which is not moving the wheels are moving and that change is happening there and we are saying my car is moving 60 miles speed 70 mile speed so all these changes in the university all the changes in the look at the ocean all the ripples millions and billions and trillions of waves are rising falling where on the ground of the ocean if the ocean is not there waves cannot just jump in the bay in the background so this universe as you see it is only name and form jumping out of the ground of Consciousness so then what you see you are saying like as in the dream you see night dream when it happens don't you see the dream world and Dreamworld don't you see it is so real your hunger your thirst your failures your frustrations your fear everything is so real when you are in the dream but when you wake up from the dream what happens where did it go where did it come from has it in his permanent reality will you say dream is real yes there are dream studies people get very much involved into dream study whether it is here but from pedantic perspective dream is momentary as soon as you see it is there when you don't see it is gone so whatever you are seeing you are seeing like dream and it is all like not changed but looks like it's changed you look at the door in darkness and you see its neck rope has not become snake but you get frightened touching the Rope thinking it's snake so you are thinking this world in your mental level as this world of reality but in reality in truth it is only the sachidananda eternal life Bliss Eternal Consciousness and eternal reality that is called God absolute God Beyond name form that is the reality these sensory objects time they should call time space I'm enjoyed I'm enjoying all these activities they are all mitta they are all unreal why earlier changing it is not permanent it is not true and they are like it is like seeing the dream so it is dreamed object Like That Knocking okay they are not Truth at all that therefore you have to think about that absolute reality what is that this feasible Universe you see the way it is not real it is not eternal it is that truth is eternal the truth is beyond all blemish and and this flow of the sanction of the world is moving on that ground like the taranga like the waves like the ripples like the these are all rising in the uh all in the ground up ocean and this what you are seeing all the objects it is like your dream and by Maya this appears like this on the ground of caitan on the ground of Consciousness all these are manifesting therefore therefore this world this Earth this sun the moon the stars the galaxies whatever you see these are these are all the play of Mind of the Maya Cosmic mind you know our individual mind every night we create our Dream who creates the dream your dream who creates your mind my dream you don't come to my dream but I can see you in my dream that is my mind has the potential power to create myself and the entire dream world if it is happens now think the cosmic mind my mind your mind all added toward God's mind God's mind creates this universe of sun moon stars galaxies ocean Earth planets all types of jivas and therefore why it is appearing it is like a it is like a magic show magician's Magic God's magic show so it is called Art why it is happening Atmos because of the not knowing who I am I I think I am this body I think I am this mind not knowing who am I the ignorance about my own real nature this is appearing on Rhythm these are not true this changes see every day we saw if we see each other now and you have seen after 10 years then what will happen your face will not look the same today it will be older 10 years older no but if everything will be hold every clicking of the second everything is becoming old so therefore this Unwritten it is not truth it is the cause of all Abode of all delusion and confusion therefore you have to destroy this is to be by truth thinking I am Divine think always that that absolute truth is the reality this is the relative truth relative truth is so long our mind is there and in this relative truth also our mind acts differently in different time zones therefore think that this is not the way you see you are reading you you are reading misinterpreting the world the world is full of God the Divine the absolute birthless deathless absolute Joy but we are feeling we are suffering we are bound we are tortured we are happy we are unhappy because of the ignorant attitude of ours therefore that is as what happens how do you get out of the fear of your snake in a darkness when you are touching the Rope you bring a flashlight knowledge bring the knowledge what is the knowledge check everything in the world changing changing changing changing but you see changing I don't like it whatever I want I want permanent something and search for that permanent thing which is there which is called Brahman in vedantic term or it's called sachidananda absolute Consciousness absolute Bliss and absolute reality then Arjuna is putting this question a big question Hari if you see that this absolute truth is beyond all qualities and it is it does not it cannot be manipulated by action it cannot be changed by anything then wow this world is created how the creation of this world has happened it is created not only you see this world as created again the same answer comes from Sri Krishna sristi nasty there is no creation you are imagining because your night time you are seeing the dream the world is created there dream world is created there yes it is created but it has no permanent existence with the knowledge it disappears when you wake up so when you wake up from this Daydream into Consciousness who you are then this world will vanish it will vanish in void no it will vanish and it will appear in its real divine nature you'll feel I am that absolute Bliss I am nothing to lose nothing to gain and Lord I does not mean this body least limited body limited mind I the cosmic identity like a drop of water merges into the ocean what happens what becomes the identity of the drop when the drop is falling as I am a drunk I am little I am different from you another drop another drop another drop but when drop of water falls and touches the ocean what becomes the identity of the drop of water he said I am ocean is it not the drop identity goes away ocean identity comes so drop this is drop identity which is changing no and it must have to change because it is not in Eternal it is not absolute and when it touches the ocean he gets back to his home we call God realization till knowing yourself knowing yourself means the real eye not this drop eye I am constituted by H2O as the whole ocean is this too so I am that is too that will be the experience then I have nothing to die drop will die another blow up wind will come and splash it here and throw it here and there no but when it touches the ocean ocean who will take where ocean is all the time there it will be there so go back to the erosion identity that means go back to your Eternal identity that is the therefore sister nasty this creation is not there this world is jagat nasty the world is not there is no God personal God we have created this universe you are all observing it be to your Cosmic ignorance and it appears on the ground of Brahman this magic show is going on magician is true the magic is just to show magic has no existence but magician who you praise the magic he is true that absolute truth so therefore in the full consciousness the play of the Maya is being seen and you know you are like a wave I am like a wave all these waves are nothing but Jala nothing but water similarly every wave this individual soul as we are saying ourselves is nothing but that absolute truth in the name and form 12 verses that this caitanya exactly in the same way the consciousness is manifesting itself as in discreeted Universe like the infinite ocean is by their waves millions and billions and trillions and zillions of waves creates the evolution of waves of ocean so this ocean of name and form is created on the Consciousness on the background of consciousness as long you sleep as soon as you sleep and you see the dream you see that real we are all sleeping we are sleeping in our divine entity and we are awake in the false identity this first identity how much it is changing every day in the childhood this body mind was different when you are 10 years old our mind body was different adult body that's a different then now get to 40 50 60 every time it changes your emotions your Cravings your desires your perspective your knowledge about the universe everything is changing changing changing but I am saying I am the same guy you are not the same person so similarly as long as you sleep in the dream state tabat is this Rhythm this world appears to be true dream world sorry and you cry and weep with everything having going on similarly because of the ignorance this world is is it is it is appearing like that like indrajala like magicians magic and those were eyes are not clear because covered their eyes with ignorance they see this universe therefore in the why then upanishads and others talk about this creation well this is like a but to teach the children a higher philosophy so they create some ideal example we are children in the philosophical level of understanding about the spirituality we are babies there so to teach the babies certain things they create this type of illustration and that is in the upanishads have been mentioned and but you know for sure in that Consciousness which is in that Consciousness which is absolutely stainless and which is Ever full their kashmin they say little trace of ignorance cannot stay there in the world suppose you imagine the Sun in the sun can you find little Darkness anywhere no the Atman which is inside is like a sun self-ifulgent self-respondent so there is no trace of ignorance and therefore there is no suffering in life so that organum because of the ignorance this has appeared to be different manifestation some are powerful some are less powerful that is Maya is creating this Avida ignorant of this type of ignorance foreign God God in this monotheistic idea what is monotheistic God God when it is covered by Maya Cosmic Maya and he says I will create I will maintain I will sustain I will destroy the cosmic mind plans like that that is called Isha God and God we say he knows everything because he is only the absolute reality by his own magical power as we create our own dream world the cosmic mind similarly creates his own Cosmic mind creates a dream and that dream is this reality of the world so this is but he knows I do not know everything God knows everything I have little power God is all powerful he controls the desires of all and controls the activities of every person and being covered by the Maya and there comes desires Cosmic desires and by spontaneously he desires and things happen let there be light and light comes no these are the symbolic words in Bible and any other language God desired God simply said I'll be many and the whole universe has been created out of that Oneness only because of the cosmic desire and arising in the mind the whole universe appeared because of the Maya the time comes up according to Scientific analysis the creation is time space and position when there is no time space and causation idea there is no creation the world is not non-existing there to anything to exist it should be in a particular period of time in particular space and there should be some reason why it is so why it has come into being so the people of Maya or ignorance Cosmic ignorance is withdrawn then what happens Brahman Remains the absolute truth remains there is no two there is no many and when it covers then time comes and then is called that remains there mahakali there comes the idea that the power of that Brahman is called the mahakali surprising in the santikita we find this mahakali from that comes out the whole creation that's why in the symbolic way where our mother kalis worship no you see the Shiva sitting in the ground white complexion meaning stainless pure spotless Timeless spaceless in samadhi and the mother Kali standing in the chest I mean that desire comes up in the form of Shakti and that Shakti is the Divine mother and divine mother creates this whole universe maintains it destroys it so that's why this worship of the Shakti so in time she withdraws everything like that every day we go to sleep and come out what happens it is like involution and evolution so today what we have done up to till now so when you go back home and go to bed what will happen this whole world of your Consciousness as if going withdrawn withdrawn withdrawn go to the stream and dream to sleep and when you sleep well and wake up again from sleep it manifest to the settle to the manifested universe so this is called the evolution and involution it is not one time creation according the great time that means where there is no time that's the great time it is in that infinite time or Timeless time that's called the mahakalo it is no shape it is no limitation only in due to the addition of some limiting adjunct appears in diverse ways therefore we split the time in Split Second animation year 12 years we divide the time in different dimensions and we say the same time one time is divided into different names they say great time mahakalo is all pervading formless and pure due to its combination with attributes time science 14 various ways starting from half a second to an a aeon and kalpa everything is made in this great time from time comes for the great principle from the great principle comes the ego so gradually gradually they are showing how the creation comes our ego comes from that absolute and then they say this whole world is created because of the five fundamental elements earth water air fire and space no so that our body what is our body is a mixture of the all the consumption of the five elements now you are breathing no yeah drinking water it's absorbed in the body so five Elemental things of the earth we consume and that gives out this body's existence so body is nothing but the combination of the five Elemental object so this gross body subtle body has created those are critical discussion we have we cannot do justice going over there and how this world is created is difficult many of the permutation and combination of these five elements no we live in this body now when you dream which which body you live we call in a subtle body now it is gross body you see I can see I can hold I can feel the temperature now but in your dream body there is what you know you don't see your eyes in the dream body you see your hand feet you are the same type of person but how their how what is the elemental thing that creates those bodies now I think it is a dream body but when I am dreaming they are like this but that that's why it's called the subtle part of this Elemental things now is the working we drink gross water in your dream you will also drink water but that water is not this water Elemental water so that is the way they explain that in your this is the growth that is the subtle and that comes from the causal so these are the three types of and it is Maya the Isha Maya already when that that Cosmic reality takes the idea of cosmic oh I gnorance then we call him God and when he takes individual ignorance that is called the Jiva we are all jivas individual Souls we are individual we forget God why we forgot God because of our ignorance individual ignorance amongst us some money maybe with black spiritual practice can realize God so he is no more like us but we are because of our ignorance surgical Jiva individual and God is what Cosmic ignorance you ignorance my ignorance act together that is the with that veil of ignorance if we look the absolute will appear as Creator God Creator God actually is also a creation into the level of ignorance of not of your mind or my mind alone but the all the mind in the universe Cosmic mind foreign foreign therefore it says if you if you throw a little [Music] what you call oil into the water what happens it spreads all over the water no so similarly only the great mother the Divine mother it's mahamaya we call Maya we call mahamaya that she gets manifested and it spreads like infinite number of names and forms gods and goddesses and Angels demons Human animals right infinite number of Creations starts there so therefore Maya autism there is nothing but the play of the cosmic play of cosmic ignorance Maya but Maya cannot cover Brahman that Consciousness itself only by its own inherent power shows the different manifestation in the in this Cosmos so the cost of the universe we see it is nothing but the manifestation due to Maya that absolute sachidananda appearing in diverse ways that means this gives a great idea how to look at the world we look at the world that it's all miserable place a place for fear and anxieties and worries and death and disease yes that is true when you consider this little self I am this much five foot four inches 160 pounds 50 pounds they say you're talking about a body you are not the body the whole day how many moments you forget your body and particularly when you sleep you forget your body is not you though we live in the body but we have a different dimension and that is the Consciousness behind this so and this you see all these things it is called the Beaverton this world you see it is an appearance is a philosophy without changing the originality you see things differently that's called be worth the philosophy vedantic philosophy Sankara said so this changing Universe it is exactly like the dream we dream in the night but what is it is not you cannot have any appearance the movie is projected movies projected there should be a screen upon which the movie screen is same light falls and then you can get an illusion is it not so illusion is possible there should be some substrate amount which it will play but actually no one is being killed there no one is being bombed there but in the movie you can see bumping and cleaning killing participly of light and said no so similarly this universe unchanging Divine entities here only all these appears in the due to Cosmic ignorance Maya sarbo modest but the guess substitution of all of us is the infinite pure Consciousness and self suppose the clouds come in the sky huh and see we don't see the sun we seek the it is polluted the sky is polluted Sky never gets polluted pollution comes and goes what happens to the sky it appears that sky has become polluted but it is here the pollution goes away and pollution is not real pollution comes and goes but space Infinite Space is always there infinite apartment infinite cell that is all the time there the clouds of ignorance clouds of Doubt clouds of this all these relative Concepts come and go but the Eternal Sun light it is all the time there sun is here now in the sky or not we'll say no this is dark no Sky no it cannot be no sky and no sun sun is all the time there only sometimes it is visible and sometimes not visible the sun in US is in his bright Glory it is in his in his most evolvent form it is signing now itself as full of bliss and joy and grace but I do not know because there is the cloud of ignorance so like that the cloud or pollution that it is my eyes like that and sanghas for so there is no touch of pollution in the Atman that means you are that's why Swami Vivekananda said you are pure never say sinner it is a sin to call a man sinner Vivekananda said because you were defined by your nature assert I am Divine I am Divine I am Divine I do so many mistakes all right that is your body mind does don't mind and don't pay attention to that rather ignore and go up to God to your pure self don't see the sky when it is crowded I need to appears like a tiger sometimes or it is like a demon sometimes but there is no demon there is no tiger it appears only because of the cloud but you are the Eternal son because of the sun only you see it is Tiger if the Sun is not there you don't see the cloud to be tiger-like or demon like or Angel like nothing you can see therefore there is no touch of any ignorance it is and it is not ever polluted it is like the fire and its potential power to burn so in and you have to know that in that cause Cosmic Consciousness their Darkness cannot enter into it it is so whether you understand it not that there is no less there is a trace of any ignorance in your divine nature Divine self and why this world is not here why vedanta gives very it is very logical book it's just have four reasons this universe or the Maya what you see is not have his own entity it is a borrowed entity you see the reflected sun in the pots if you keep hundred parts and with water you see hundred Sun there these are depicted Sun it is contained in the body body is the container and water water is what our mind is the water and in that mind the cosmic Consciousness is reflected as a result we are according to the shape and size of the pot we look different and in us there is some Consciousness but it is reflected consciousness so when the ego is broken each pot is broken ego is gone what will happen each Ray will merge into the real Sun so this Maya has no existence of his own foreign it is not existing it appears and it changes its shape it is not self-effulgent it is matter and let us know Inner Light in it therefore these are all Maya ignorant again he is emphasizing my honestly again the same verse there is no Maya there is no world there is no individual soul there is no Creator God only what remains only Brahman alone the cosmic Consciousness is there and everything else is likely imagination in the dream so we cannot say that the Ultimate Reality is one what God talk about many therefore making it smell in Brahman that is not proper and therefore there is no duality and the upanishads also does not cannot tolerate this Duality because the truth is beyond it is beyond sound sound cannot reach there mono the mind the the greatest speediest object in the world is mine no there is no faster thing which can move in this world rather than mind mind can go to the distant star and come back with a split second light cannot move that fast but but this mind is incapable to measure the infinitude of our real self we cannot you can write tons of books thousands of scriptures you cannot express what is that Divine real entity ever stainless that nature and there is no parallel example you cannot say Brahman is like what if you say Brahman is like ocean what talking what you are talking ocean is how Limited you cannot understand this distance between the stars and stars galaxies and galaxies and how much is the material volume of his his stars and the distance between them these are only nothing it is called the only physical distance expand expand expand until you die but your time is your little eye dies into the cosmic reality of Brahman so therefore it is beyond sound Beyond mind Beyond speech it is ever pure there is no one thing in the world you can give a parallel example it is like this we say this tree is like that but there is no comparison here we can put forth Brahman therefore it is you cannot hear him with this little ear not sure this skin cannot feel that Infinity shoot of the reality this chakshu who eyes cannot see that the tongue cannot test it that knows cannot fragrance kind of take he cannot take that no back come back already your speech cannot do that therefore it is of the nature of reality abhinashi it is indestructible it is the self-luminous of the nature of Consciousness it is all Bliss it is all the we love everything because of that reality behind everyone everything we love in the world we know or not we are attracted because of the Divine which is within and that is the that is your own reality it spreads everywhere but this turn up the foundation of everything that's why it is called Atman and it's big bigger than the biggest that's why it is called Brahman no no this Atman when you will be successful in knowing in your own Divine self and can rest in that Divine self then you'll be really your life will be fulfilled your mission of life will be fulfilled you will be established in your absolute Eternal Blissful State and that will be free while living in the world your death will not be trouble troubling you even the worst situation you can smile at it you are the king who can conquer everything appear so you know that is called the Moksha that is called deliberation all the yogis who meditates and they know us of the truth that what is this what is this we are talking about are you to go somewhere to find God as you all know we come to Temple we go to the mosque we go to churches to see God find God no as if God is not here we are trying to find God everywhere that says he said no the spiritual knowledge is like that suppose you have some what you call necklace hey in your necklace is here but don't you forget sometimes and search for oh where is my necklace this is like that and the teacher the guru the scripture will say hey what are you searching for you are lamenting I lost my necklace I was going on to so some New York or somewhere in the early morning getting up and is with hurriedness everything is there and I started the car and then went went up to a certain distance I have forgotten and with this type and I am saying my eyeglasses for good then we came back I said I am not going back you go to my room find out on the desk he searched for 5-10 minutes again here already you are a fool you don't find it I will go and search it then I also went there and then I said my God my and then my hand touched it I said oh it is here all the time I am not to do anything it is here sitting but I am searching for that the Atman is here the Eternal Lord is sitting in the heart ever Blissful ever joyful but we are searching here and there not knocking my head here and there and bending my but never searching who am I and such and this is called you know your own self it is like that it is like then finding the necklace after searching everywhere the necklace is already here all the time and it was hanging on me when I was crying I lost the necklace when I got it that time also it is there all the time the Atman is all the time what a great message therefore when you are Awakening 's truth that in he who is the Divine and you are the Divine you forgot it but you got it that's and you understand that I am that divine I am birthless I am deathless you read about the vedantic text and so many saintly people these pictures were giving they live in that Consciousness they have been awakened in the truth napoor to purn their full awareness they will see Maya Maya is not their truth and also the effect of Maya what do you see this world it is not there therefore what remains it is these are all due to the ignorance and it is the effect of that ignorance and all this world is being seen now this as the darkness does not stay at all with the rise of the Sun so these Eternal Sun when it rises in your Consciousness this whole world of play will be lost gone dead therefore therefore therefore the Tunas therefore there is no world at all proceed them which is very well recognized by us when brahmani when you reach that Consciousness which is pure Consciousness pure Brahman there is no trace of ignorance and what you see is all false false perception and now we can see both possession I give the close example you go to the 3D movie okay and when you enter what happened they give you a 3D glass no and when you see the 3D glass with you and it's viewing the movie there may be one someone is throwing the sword on you and you will see that as if it is hitting you huh but no one is throwing sword and you may be frightened we have to do that when you go and get famous involved into the movie and anything happening there and I see that and I am in between them now it is a reality but is it real take out that glass you say hey it is happening in the big screen there at least you are not affected by that my eye is going on take out the 3D glass the Maya glass ignorant class of ignorance then you see it is all Divine everywhere that is the experience that's right this universe is all false it is like the snake appearing on the the Earth content in the pots and pans they may be pots and pans may be different size and shape but it's made of clay so it is made of sachidan and it is made of God the Divine the absolute you'll find that that is the ultimate achievement that's the end of this synopsis of this chapter sixth chapter we read 46 verses in a quick fix okay actually that is our evil when the cosmic Consciousness is reflected we think it is I I starts there real consciousness real Consciousness is all the time here reflected Consciousness is there so long the pot is here if the pot is broken the water goes that means you when we can destroy our mind reflection happens where there is need a pot need some water no so just imagine this physical body is the part and internally what is that reflected in the mind mind is philosophy it is called and then index it to the reflection of the sun Eternal Sun falls and as a result you see one reflected Sun there that is ego and that egos Sun's light falling reflected through the mind and that mind that's why mind has four faculties one is called ego one is called intelligence one is called memory and one is the mind which is pickle pickle mind same mind is named four ways so when I say it is the water is mine it means four are there so the first ego is the subtlest thing then comes my my intelligence then we call my memory my mind then down my body depart so okay so here is one which we end the class here um first important announcement please don't miss tomorrow if you can come one of our the senior none of sarada Mart do women's organization they are all renounced nuns who dedicated for the purpose of self-realization and she is coming from India and that's a big prestigious organization where educated ladies are only it is women's organization like the Catholic nuns so one of the senior nun will be speaking tomorrow her name is bhavani Prana bhavani Prana mataji and this topic will be some on bhakti how to develop bhakti or bhakti like that at 7 30 will be the class if you can please come don't miss that it will also live streamed that's also will be available online YouTube and Day After Tomorrow will be another talk by another nun she's a very popular nun you

realization what we are talking about and for self-realization and to serve others that idea so two days consecutive and Sunday also they will be speaking here at 11 o'clock so tomorrow mataji next day the other mataji she will be speaking and Sunday both of them will be speaking from this platform and so please come as much as you can now one question has come it seems that Maya and Brahman are so intertwined that we may never be able to peel them apart because it is beyond the capability of the mind that we need the grace of the Divine mother of course you are right you've got the right point it is Maya and the Brahman the ignorance and the truth has become so mingled up Sankara says truth which is not true false they have become jumbled up like the Rope is rope and snake idea has come over it and now I am touching the Rope but I am crying snake snake snake so it has become so intertwined very difficult to bring out so what can be done only light can remove the darkness and this light and darkness to remove the darkness is light it needs you try your best But ultimately you need the grace of the Divine so it is not contradictory you try your best and divine intervention will happen and that we call Mother the grace of divine mother the Hindus that say we worship mother God as mother God as father and it's so predominant in Hindu culture now today is auspicious day going on mother is worshiped in India Durga and this is the power Shakti and you will also learned today that the Brahman cannot do anything Shakti manifest that's the whole creation comes therefore you want to go beyond the domain of this world then you have to pray to mother do your best and then say Oh mother it is your hand help me I am your child no so you are correct that it is very difficult because it is so intertwined the truth and the untruth or the reality and his misconception has been so much we are never told from our childhood what he has told you are a man you are a boy you are a girl this is that identity no one touches did anyone teach of us anyone here Imam said yeah um you are you are the child of God you are God man you are the Consciousness you are that absolute undying self no one taught us but rather they thought you are this you are this you are the I am buddy I am body I am body I am mine I am mine I am mine my name is this my education is this my family member is this this has been taught to us and we are conversant with this idea now we are teaching reading this book no no no no this is your false identity you have a Divine identity and that catch that Divine entity and that identity will release you from all fears and anxieties and worries and doubts and confusions it is possible for you to get that so this is the point we are now learning to un unlearn what we have learned to say I am not the body I am the Atman we are learning this way the whole life is learned I am the body I am the body I am the body I am the mind I am the mind I am the man huh you know how he could look at me this way and I am done a person is looking up man looking at me with smile or not I I am I am a doll in the hand of others you have no freedom you are Divine hold on so no one has taught us so this is the thing that is intertwined so we should do our spiritual practice analyze day and night a dream condition the waking condition and analyze and the dream less con sleep condition every day think who am I and like this no you give out this identity when you dream you identify with the dream body dream goes there is no dream there is no this but I I and you say I slept well what is that I catch that eye it is no this vedanta is beautiful but rational mind don't say my theory My Philosophy says no what is your experience start from that point my paid system my belief system who don't care for your belief system belief system may be this might be the Precision what does it mean it will contradict with your will in my belief but you go to your experience will you doubt Hindu Muslim Christian with all the world religion people that you are in the waking State you say I I do you say I dream when this world Consciousness goes away no one will have any contradiction there forget about religion belief system that's vedant is called scientific for that reason you test on your own experiment experiences and say who Am I who Am I who am I judge judge judge find out and you find out yourself you need not have to believe in someone's statement anyhow another question if God does what is best for me then why should one pray for this or that if you have yes true God does everything what is for needed for me but have we have trust we don't have we want I want this and if I don't get it then God is not listening to me we all feel great no if you ask from God and you get that then God is there God is gracious but it is not it is a what you have said if God does what is best for me then why should one pray for this or that this is very true then you have same percent faith that God is the Doer yeah God does what is good for me not what I want the children many times many times Christ to Mommy Mommy give me this give me this give me this but if the mummy knows that this is not good for my baby mommy will not give how much you cry and we even love no that is a question of deep spiritual practice which gives conviction that mother is there for me what am I to do she will do everything for me so that until that conviction comes we need to pray we need to pray until that conviction comes another comment it feels as if or do it reminds us of the absolute truth lost in the Garden of Eden and we are meant to live in bikano as Jiva jivan mukti this makes the Leela makes sense yes our purpose of life is to see God everywhere to feel God here to feel God there and God's playing with God uh standpoint the example of the snake we see in the Rope versus waves in the ocean in one case you can explain it's just a name and form but it's truly there versus the in the ropes example snake never existed do they is it just an unnecessary extension of the analogy or is there actually you can main thing we have to convince ourselves that whatever I am seeing hearing testing touching the sensitive experiences they are changing changing changing they are not real so if you so it is not real why do you bother about that so much why not you hold on to what is reality so that is the call for our spiritual life you hold on which is eternal why are you holding on to that which is when a fraudulent which appears and not not exist at all so that is this by putting any example bringing any ideas to eradicate this idea these are not real you can take the Rope example you can take the ocean idea you can say name and form idea whatever helps we have to take and move on so you know [Music] is actually a power of government no no no my name is yes that's it that's the sakto philosophy in vedanta there is no manifestation this world is all false forget that that we say no word no Jiva no nothing even God is Not There the world has not been created that's the philosophy if you can reach that flight okay if you not come to the other level this world is created yes by how it is created by Shakti suppose you are sitting here you are a great musician you are not singing now I don't recognize your music but that does it mean that your music talent you have put it in the Box in the other room and you are sitting over here if I ask you to sing the song you can sing now that means manifestation or not manifestation Shakti is there if you take that philosophy then see everything is Brahman in different forms only Shakti whatever philosophy you take love God hold on to God realize God Om Shanti Shanti Shanti thank you peace peace peace
