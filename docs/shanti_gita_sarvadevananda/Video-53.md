[50. Shanti Gita - Class 50 - Chapter 5 - Verses 11-13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-o9bbciCtc)

[Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face on peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to reading our santi gita the song of peace and you are discussing about the nature of a person of realization arjuna put that question that how this realized people souls move around and behave how they eat how they sleep in the bhagavad-gita also he has said the same question here also and also says what is the responsibility king karthuba what is the duty of a realized soul we have duties in life but what about the duty of a realized soul so that was the question and then here bhagavan krishna said in the previous verses that they have no karma because they have done with the karma they are in a trace of karma even as a result you cannot put this question because they live in the state of inaction though their body functions but they think they are not working therefore their result of their action does not affect them and what the action you see that they are doing in the through the body sorry you are seeing that he is doing ramakrishna is walking going to calcutta vivekananda coming here uh stays in the stage of chicago lecturing and doing to new york this way that way question answer all these things that all this karma you see that he is doing that is due to ahamkara sabasa kartha booked out to karmarov it is reflected in that ego and that is the cut he is thinking i i and you also you you see the karma but they don't think they are doing any karma and even if they work bicharathy riha kharji last time we read march 8th rj if they are roaming around in their day-to-day engaged in their works in the household activities household work thak today hobi mano they have given up their uber identity sense of identity with their body biharati they may be traveling or they may be interacting with a big amount huge amount of people and behaving loku jatra nurukam they behave like that of us as the normal other people's behavior they are found to do like the same way [Applause] and they are like papanosama bihari they are like wind wind moves around it sometimes get bad foul smell good smell they carry but it does not attach get attached to the wind wind remains always unaffected but people know this is bad smell people say but the wind does not get bad our wind does not get pregnant always being there at the same time detached being there detaching bilateral rupee and they live in their own divine self they remain in their own self tata beat a that means there is no sign of anything anything sign of their external science there is nothing as such that means it is very difficult to understand from outside a person who is a realized soul because they behave like us they talk like us they move like us and they are found sometimes with this like the wind carrying the fragrant fragrance or the foul things sometimes they may appear like that but as ever never wind and never gets associated with the fragrance though it carries it similarly the holy people the people of realization they are found to be angry to be behaving on all types of behavior like like jonathan in the association with the masses people but they are ever detached from everything like the wind so manifesting in human form the knower of truth roams around in his own self renounces his body identity he carries out thousands who carries out household chores and enjoys himself in the company of the people they saw that they're talking to people interacting with the people and they're conforming to the social customs they also eat they also sleep they also behave they also interact like a gentleman behaving with a gentleman but being absorbed in his real nature he or she like the bridge spokes around being free from passion attachment and similar such defeats so like the bridge the sports around they just perform they live around uh but they have no inner attachment there is no inner passion such defects so this is the idea about brahma-garris that con discussion continues today we will read the verse number 11 11 verse says [Music] [Music] baba what sign what shall i talk about the sign what what sign to to to you bakshmi i shall say what what shall i say to you about the sign of the noah of truth sabha bilakshana he is beyond lakshan beyond any sign he who is beyond sign how can i describe you what sign he has who has no head how shall i describe how his head is beautiful or his head is very nice headless person how can it escape the head how is the head of that person so he has no sign how can i describe of him having any sign so there is no sign because he is beyond sign so don't think that we can describe any by any sign oh he will be specifically like this or specifically like that no you cannot say that so bhavati bhabha means attitude bhabha means moods he is beyond all moods how can i describe what mood he carries you are asking about a noir of truth what mood he lives on what mood he carries on or what is the sign of him he has no sign how can i describe his sign he is beyond all moods and attitudes so what how can i say he is in this mood he is in the mood of anger or he's in the mood of no he's in the mood of this moment he may be in one mood ramakrishna how many moods used to stay whole day morning maybe he's clapping his hand around the pictures of gods and goddesses in his room and saying kali kali kali kali and i know clock i find that he is absorbed in krishna krishna krishna and singing and dancing is a different mood next one pandit comes immediately talking about advaita vedanto the non-dual reality so what mood what mood shall i talk about him he has no specific mood he's beyond all moods but sometimes he lives in different mental attitudes those are the moods so you cannot put any question like that a holy man's behavior to be specifically specifically mentioned in other scriptures also that they say sometimes he looks ravaging said it looks like a child child mood sometimes he will be like a ghani mood sometimes like a bhakta mood sometimes like a mad person mood of a mad person no their behavior is so unusual sometimes he may be a dirty smearing dart and assays around and not clean so sometimes they may live like that jorah sometimes in that so you cannot just ask me about what is mood therefore this translation goes the 11 months that what shall i talk you talk to you or tell you about the signs of the person who is by nature by his own nature devoid of any specific characteristic or of the of the state of the person who has transcended all mental states he has gone beyond the mind and all the moods actually he is in sachidan on the self which is beyond all moods when he is in the mood she is in the level of the mind and even in the mind there are various types of moons some for us ordinary people maybe a devotional person someone may be a knowledgeable person somehow maybe meditative person these are called the moods of meditation modes of philosophical inquiry modes of bhakti moods karma this may be he is in the mood of doing karma now but a brahman he does karma but it is you cannot classify him in a particular mood he is beyond good he lives mostly in the state [Music] um many so he he he moves in various moods biharit means moving bibi means varied meaning means and he himself he is minus or he is beyond bhabha and abhava bhabha and means you cannot classify he's a moody person or you cannot say he's a non-moody person because he is beyond the moods and non-moody so bhava moods left of the intention on unknown intention bhabha means mood also intention he you look at him he is doing something we do with some intention but they don't do any intention so intention or non-intention you cannot classify in either of these things they are beyond intention and non-intention moods and variety types of though the monk he is beyond all this bhava bhava bhajbivojito he's beyond the bhavo and of havoc that's his mood and beyond mood or intention or non-intention intention means you do some work with intention when we twist i am doing this people will say good that you are good good or i am doing this to get praise from other people or to have some wisdom knowledge anything we do with some intention wish is behind it no intention normally we go from intention to non-intention we do with some desire and we learn no no no no desire i don't do it with any purpose any motive any motive intention the same thing so you do that but no no no even now non-intention is not i am beyond all neither intention i intend to do anything neither i nor intend to do anything i mean they cannot be described in any category be intention and onion that means they have no intention you cannot say can pull put them in that category these are the people have no intention they do only that's true well no they have no in non-intention also because intention if you say there is non-intention opposite word if you say i love you that means you hate also because there is the opposite one in duality maybe less zero but similarly you cannot say that it is viborjit or pirate of intention then you have a non-intention the brahman is beyond any intention or non-intention beyond bad or good good and bad bad is bad we want to do good but no brahmagani is not good brahma ghani is beyond good also we say i am pure this is impure but brahmagani is pure or impure subtly he is not impure he is pure well no no he is not being even pure beyond purity if we cannot say what is he as we cannot say what is brahman so brahman ghani also what is he we cannot say this is beyond all words he conducts all types of a all types of conduct cities does a tito but he's beyond all atheita saw nana charui in different diverse types of conducts charit jyoti monk jyoti means monk or a realized soul charat means moves around or behaves like that so the meaning is that that monk who is beyond all types of worldly customs and wanders around with various temperaments being believed sometimes sentiments or feelings of intention and non-intention they behave in various ways when they live in the body they behave various ways but they are beyond all worldly customs and intentions they are when roam around in the world with various moods and temperaments but being beyond all sentiments of all temperaments that means we cannot classify them with any any specific behavior pattern normally we ourselves can be categorically good we say oh he's a angry guy oh he is a very moody person that people talk about us no but but brahmagan is you cannot say like that this type of monk who is detached from everything whatever they do they just follow the norms of life other people are doing they follow that and they eat sleep to talk but they work they also work and like a child the example best example is the child child is doing big job no when he's busy with his tools how serious is that the whole world is there but actually is he any intention is he thinking that this house will be there i will leave here and i'll permanently two minutes mood comes and goes to the another throw away that structure what he has built up no with the tools so similarly brahmagani does something and the next moment they just give up without any motive or intelligence so therefore biharit they will roam around vivid in various types of attitudes being bibarichita being believed of intention and unintention sarvasara no tito they are beyond all achara and conduct but at the same time nanas are we charity but in the same time they are found to be active in different types of behavior different types of actions that is the juti so these are can be found in the life of ramakrishna very dominantly and also the lives of other vascular in the binaries and that swami was there trilango swami uh was in the binaries they are all realized souls but their behavior conduct you look at like that us but they are not there they are always in the state of consciousness so we cannot categorize them in any way how did leave them they leave 13 verse talks about how they leave it says [Music] is carried out by the impulse of prarabdha you know three types of karma one is prarabdha one is kriyaman prada is the impulse true is this body is now going you throw a stone when you throw the stone so you decide which angle how forcefully you throw it and how big is the stone no see if you one throw now after it is out of your hand the stone moves apparently there is no force no one is pushing him go go go go but there is a force given here and it carries till the stone drops someplace no this light is called prarabdha by the karma accumulated karma for past life the last thought came and one thought is now trying to manifest in this life that the trajectory is now taking me this way it is going on in our life you call proud you have no control over there you can adjust in the middle of the journey you can say stone hey don't don't hit that come this way no it will not do because it's already direction and force has been added to that so our karma past life's intention has already given a direction to this body so prayer of though you cannot do anything whether you are an ignorant person or you are a person of wisdom and knowledge you cannot do anything with but you can creoman to humans what you are doing now what was prabhupada was proud of the but in your journey you find some fire and put your finger in the fire your finger will burn cleoman what you are doing now it is also creating you suffering and joy pleasure or pain and also it is happening it is creating new momentum it is creating you a new momentum so what will be the future life and another is called sun cheetah so it means collected what is in my own stock infinite number of stock of my karma is there so three types of karma and these types of karma are all cause of our suffering so here he says this body as our we are ignorant people as we live in the life we are propelled by our by force that's why we say how much you tell somebody to change anything unless he wants he cannot change even he wants or she wants no when you say she someone you want to tell somebody good or bad no one will listen because his sanskar will force him he's proud of the his past life's impact will push him all schools colleges teaches us how to live a life of honesty purity truthfulness is it not all the religious teach but what is the net result in the world putin is less educated person or the big guys who are creating all the trouble of them all over the world they are less educated people they do not know what good bad no they are so ignorant but you cannot say that they can change that track door said the same way jaanami dharma i know what is righteousness what one should do i should do i know that nacho me prabhiti i have no interest in that to follow that path and janami or dharma i know what is bad what is not good conduct what is not righteous living i know that but nausea me nibriti i cannot stop that inclination i cannot withdraw my mind from that side so what can i do that is our condition that's why even we are who are struggling to do meditation do prayer how much time should we do but still why are you failing because prarabdha is so strong but we cannot conquer that of course otherwise how the brahmagan is come that is the internal struggle they change it but he said it needs rigorous sincere effort no lotu mana's life we are reading how intense how rigorous spiritual practice he did because of that he has changed the this internal attitude of everything the body goes on they carry the car but your intention will change your attitude will change so here he said we find that an war of truth a sage or a yogi whoever has attained the illumination their body is carried by prayer of them by their past life's actions weak body weak body true that will be an obstacle but with weak body they are doing so many things same weak body but they are doing so many things they will also do sadhana ramakrishna was a strong body but when he was sick he didn't give up sadhana so that is the point that is true it is an obstacle proud of though you cannot change that's a physical thing mental thing tendency but yes you can change mentally by changing the thought process that's the sudden other is what the spiritual life we we are all doing what or why we are studying this it is changing our thought process sickness of mind sickness of mind sick people cannot do be spiritual seek in body sick in body they can do something but seek in mind they should they are not very very difficult because to carry on spiritual practice they will disturb their brain and you find that's why they see hallucination they say i am seeing mahalia is coming this coming that coming if it may come but it is hallucinating that to be strong in mind spiritual practice can do that mind can be made strong which person physically premise anonymous was very weak physically but see a spirituality inside no so that is in our monastic order we have seen many shadows they are physically very sick but spiritually they have advanced much so it is a practice they can do that's the otherwise there is no no no no hope prada is taking us everywhere so we are helpless then they will go on with weak then your good fortune will come and then someone's someone will lift you up that's your also within the prayer of the karma is there he hidden but but but but god has given us that question comes again and again god has given us certain range of freedom sastra says kartum i can do this i can read this i can give up this and go and chit chat i can do some dancing singing or i cannot do this i cannot do that i can go meditate so we have our option little freedom is there not total freedom but you can eat now you say i will not eat ok you have this freedom i will eat next time you don't give and then don't eat okay no don't eat so these are the you within our range we can do certain thing up to certain limit so that we are talking about that can change our character but actually we are propelled by the past momentum we have are all helpless in most of the places that's why we holy mother didn't give much advice to anyone unless called for because she knew that nothing will change if you say if i say hey don't do that and if suppose you want to do that first politely will say okay okay and then do it not do it and then again if i say second time key the anger will come revolt will come so you cannot change the nature unless the person as i i should change my nation so they are proud guiding me in one direction but i am trying to reform myself say surrender is a good that's a that that's also a power surrendering the mind is not easy and that is mature mind can do that that is spiritual practice but my point is that saying somebody to change it does not happen unless that person understands it and wants to change himself or herself therefore their body is carried on by prayer of the sadhus those who have realized their body like us carried by prabhupada this piece of garment there's a piece of cloth or sometimes you call lao the the the snake snake when gives up the external skin the paw bone the wind comes and it blows away better example a piece of cloth you keep it the wind comes and it blows away exactly like that this life is being blown away by some force that is called the prague brahmagani also their life is blown away that's why it is said when once you realize god you become a jeevan mukhtar when your body you will die physical death that is the time you will never be born again prada is also destroyed proud of the karma the impact of the past life which is now going on the the trajectory is ending at that point it drops there is no more impetus sanchita karma yes accumulated our i have infinite number of karma in our store everyone's talk if some few karma's impact is this life one desire i shall go to new york i give the example and then comes all the troubles from purchasing ticket then going to the airport and um jam and then what you call the security we get block and plane has left the plane is cancelled all this trouble you take because one desired you didn't say i will be in the traffic jam that was not your target target was i'll go to new york similarly one desire has brought it and so many desires are there in my stock so when you realize god with the wisdom of knowledge it destroys all the past karma they give the example exactly hunter hunter is carrying so many arrows in her in his quiver and he has taken out one and he has now targeted it and this is out of his hand this is this present life going on it will heat it will die somewhere okay but what about this now the same hunter he says why i kill animals and birds no i should not and he says throw away detachment renunciation when the renunciation comes detachment comes then all the bag of arrows are thrown away so it has no effect on your life this is dropped and you realize already you have realized god and when it drops then you are perfectly established in your there's no impetus of any karma to push you that is the state of akarma that we are so proud you see their body is going on but it is like a in the wind blast of wind carrying a piece of cloth piece of cloth has no freedom the wind blows and it moves in that direction so life is like a inaud subject to them is carried by the physical nature and that body in time gets attached to the body why to eat something to talk something rama krishna is standing in his spiritual mood but when he comes down occasionally and then he sees this is lunch he had his suffer also you know so taking some prasad mahakali's prasad coming so he does all these things as if fastened suitably and the time comes the experience of suffering and pleasure they come in the light no they are seen to be performing those actions so he says what he said kali in time as suitable surrender come of the body the move the experience say engage sometimes in the body use the body for eating and sleeping for maintaining the body so that is the state of a brahmagani have you any question okay proud so the translation goes the subtle body is carried away by the actions of the past life just like a piece of cloth is blown away by the wind this body dies okay what will happen the subtle body will be carried away if not here one has not realized the truth but realizing the truth you will find that after brahma ghana they are in the body they are eating they are sleeping they are talking but their body is being carried by divine will that is called pravroptv here past life they they carried away by the actions of the past life just like a piece of cloth that is blown away by the wind that body in time is suitably fastened to experience suffering enjoyment based on the product uh the identity the subtle body gone the ego body gone so naturally that realization means what at the point of experience of the brahman at that point they are gone but because the power of the machine was going on they come back and add their connection into the body but when that that action of the prayer of though is zero then already other things have gone at the point of realization what happens your body identity goes away your you are not the mind you are not the ego you are not the intellect all these are have been experienced at that time so that knowledge is already there but still prarabdha the machine is going on so this person like a wind blowing they carries a piece of cloth the proud of those impetus is scanning the body like that and they eat they sleep they talk they say but as soon as it drops because of that knowledge already there it totally detaches from everything so it becomes totally free so again so i am reading again the body is carried out by the actions of the past life how just like a piece of cloth is blown away by the wind the body in time is suitably fastened to the experience suffering and enjoyment based on program though you have realized god in this life maybe at the age of 20 someone realizes some experience someone at the 50 but his life still continues because he is living in the world see brahma when ramakrishna was still alive no and after that experience he went to ramakrishna then ramakrishna said oh you are so long pestering on me for this you got it now now you do my mother's work and the key will be with me anyhow meaning what happened then he has to he has the full knowledge nirvikalpa samadhi means there is nothing lacking but how from that time onward till swamiji passed away did such tremendous activity all over the world how by god's will is proud of the like a wind blowing the piece of cloth flows in any direction he was an instrument that's why he has no ego he was in the body but all zeros little ego is necessary others how he will talk how he will interact but major part is called clean that's when occasionally in thousand island park he is going to samadhi in the main in maine there was swamiji was under a pine tree and he went lost his old consciousness thousand island park he was sitting under the oak tree and totally lost himself and the water came the rain came and drenched and he was oblivious of anything and he was jokingly saying i am enjoying my calcutta days rain when i was a boy in calcutta who used to like getting wet into the rain so but he's in samadhi so going to samadhi and again coming back and working like as is connected with the body that is god's will that is god's will and he they come for the good of the world that's a different mission so that's also they're accepting the ignorance coming back means you're entering into the maya not like we people we are bound by maya's power but they have cleared it but still for the good of the world positive shakti and they come back again to be born again and again he said i will be born again and again to remove the suffering of the people if i can do something 15 okay then we end here and tomorrow will be our gospel class [Music] too only one question only one question so we could have read something more only one question so ok ok so question is that you are saying that when we say someone to change they will not change unless they want to change themselves if someone dear to us smokes or drinks what should we do keep quiet true yes that's true we should say we should tell maybe that may work sometimes his awakening comes and he internally think no no it is not good i should not do it it is not bringing joy to me it is not bringing good to anyone so i should not do that if that awareness by your request by your words it changes then that will be good but we should say that as a duty duty our duty should be to tell what is good what is but don't expect that he will listen to it don't expect that because you tell him or her he or she will be just listening to you with much respect and love rather they may be angry and anger may get to stubbornness in every life stubbornness comes stubborn if you say no i am doing right thing and they will do more sometimes so these are the realities so we but but as a duty as a duty lovingly if we can say one time two times if it does not it will not work what can you do life teaches them and now not even sometimes they cannot give up no but anyhow god knows when his own awakening will come then he will understand that so but but as a person in a society in the life we have some responsibility we should say this is not good it is better if you can give up see what is the consequence and now suppose one is true as you have said the sum is someone is um [Music] smokes or drinks what happens smoking too much is injuring the lungs and it sometimes is a pathetic breathing trouble no but that should be someone should tell that is good and someone friendly way that works and my mind changes then i can change it but if i not then i will not rather if you say that it's like a teenage boys look at that mom and dad tells anything what happens reaction exceptional children will be one but most of these children will not like mom tells too much she wants to control me too much dictates me too much that's why when the college or days comes most of the teenage boys finishing the school they go want to be away far away from mom and dad and at least i am seeing it a regular experience as soon as the school is finished entering into college now adult so go the boys who are here go to the worst college in some other place in east coast and east coast boy coming not getting good chance in good ones but still comes over here yeah to avoid to be away you know parents are always they're dictating don't do do that do that do this why but when they see we mature many of the people in our age they say oh mom used to tell like that i didn't listen to that no now i understand how lovingly they all used to guide us no so maturity comes after life's experiences they think everything god's will after realizing god they know that is also under the real name of god and every action done thought yeah so everything is under the realm of maya everything is under the realm of sakthi so it is divine this power mother's power ramakrishna oh mother why the hand has broken mark cure it so he's not thinking is my problem to karma or it is my clioman karma they're not in that language but they know that every action whatever happiness misery pleasure pain whatever is coming that is all the will of god so they by that way they become egoless so body is blown away like a wind and the cloth is blown away that example then jordan they don't that intellectual discussion does not come into their mind they have established they see the play of god's hand everywhere hand of god so that's why someone is whatever he's doing even anyone is doing it is without god's will no everything is god's will that's why it is difficult for us your god is so his will what is going on in ukraine these people have done nothing we see very difficult to analyze and say passive remark but in the eyes of ramakrishna was here he will be saying my ma your will this is happening and the killer and the kill we are reading in the gita and the killer and the killed are the same tell who will hate whom who will love whom is one appearing as many so there is there are different inside cups the third eye opens up so they see the gods hand in everywhere it is in a fun suppose you mean so many war pictures in the movie so how much all documentaries some documentary things are there but many things are created and in that some gets wounded some gets hot also in this play but you know it is a fun it's a play for that part where hundreds of people were needed to complete that film so they are a little fun because no they know that it is for money it is for name it's not a fame actor will be praised how he acted well no so that is god's will they understand it is the play of the lord lord's will huh why you see nothing more another two three minutes are there today everyone is satisfied no question so if someone dear to us smokes or drinks what should we do keep quiet no we should say and you can say that your smoking is good but secondhand smoking is killing me so to give argument to convince to and also your health is not good and drinking yes if you drink you cannot keep your own sanity you forget yourself and it creates disturbance in the whole environment in the family why to do that but nothing happens so what what what will be the rescue there what will be the step i don't know what will be the step god's name but god's name that means your simple language you have to endure what can you do if you are trapped into a situation where you have no means to get out of it very difficult talking about atman is one thing but in life's real situation if someone in the family is after that misbehaves or creates trouble for the children for the wife and for the family or for the husband or father so it is a painful episode and that gives us surrender to god that gives us to find out some other means so difficult it's difficult but prayer as a spiritual people if there is no other way only prayer prayer prayer and prayer for the person who is addicted for him to pray also so that oh lord please change his mind you can change his mind that's all it'll be as simple as that okay so tomorrow we'll be again in the gospel class at 7 30 evening [Music] sri ramakrishna panama you
