[14. Shanti Gita - Class 14 - Chapter 1, Verse 42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I49YAL6EQkY)

[Music] [Music] [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face om peace peace peace be unto us all welcome all you all we are now the song of peace and we are reading chapter 1 we have finished verse number 41. so what we have read probably all remember but forgotten maybe so i will try to link together where we ended the first there we ended here see arjuna and verse number 35 said that you say all this philosophical thing i understand but my heart cannot forget the believement and it cannot stand all this separation etc so please help me to get out of my pain and believement then bhagavan said and what he said your mind is tormented by sorrow and distress that is why you are in if you are feeling the flame of burning in your heart you are the seer just understand you are not what is going on in your mind you are the observer of your mind and you are really not the mind so because you think that your mind anything happening to the mind you are feeling that i am affected next verse says from the logic very logic that is here because the seer and scene are two different things one is the object one is the subject because they are so you are separate because you are observing your mind you say my mind is in believement so you are not the mind your mind you are saying your mind then observer and observed these are the things to be understood separate due to lack why this did they got jumbled up because due to lack of discrimination you are not able to discriminate separate out therefore you are putting one thing with the other thing your mind is disturbed you say i am disturbed why do you say i am disturbed your mind is not you you say your mind my pain my table my room is not eye room it's not an eye table it's not eye pin so this is wrong interpretation try to analyze that because you don't do you are lacking in discrimination you have become the mind and you are thinking i am tormented when the mind is actually experiencing that pain then last 38 and 39 verse there shri krishna said that your inner organ is one and that is endowed with four functions the same antakarana inner corona means organ instrument the inner instrument what is the inner instrument it has four functions mano buddhi tong that mind takes the form of resolution intelligence does act of decision making memory stuff does the inquiry what is the old what is new they inquire and match and ego gives you identity so these four functions of the mind one is called mind which is actually the making resolution i shall do this shall i do this shall i do shall i go salah eat salah sleep salive all this non-decisional thing is mind when it makes a resolution or decision this is called the intellect buddhi the mind intellect mind is here in our indian mind american mind is here so terminological difference please understand this distinction mind is the emotional aspect which is resolved cannot resolve anything intellect that we call mind in the western world this is called mind mind is decisive i will do this and then memory memory is the in inquiry side i inquire i saw some somebody and then my memory i go back and recollect oh what is what what is what matching messing matching and you say oh this is called john and lastly ego i consciousness so these are the function of the one mind and the ego gives identity in this inner organ is made of five elements and they how the mind intellect etcetera are made five elements have created this thing what air water fire space and air kitty art so the five elements this has constituted your physical body subtle part of that is making your mind that's why it is we are we emphasize so much in the vegetarianism and others come here because what food you take that has two aspect one aspect it means the physical body this this body flesh bone your muscles etc but the subtle part of it makes your mind so if the subtle part is mine so you take such food which is innocent and not harming anyone with the less trouble then that creates your better mind so that's why there comes also who have touched your food the subtle part of the food is going in to create your mind so there is the science behind of behind this mind become how to make the mind pure that's why i say i am fasting that's why i say i am taking i don't take fish i don't take these meaning i am not hurting anyone less possible least for disturbance i want to create so therefore my mind will be subtle mind will be pure mind pure are mine that's why we take prasad whatever we eat we offer it to god thinking that this world this food will be purified so that is the idea now 40th parts now so now 48 verse says now today we have read the 48 verse also 40th birth said that as a man knows the part of the body that is burned by fire similarly you also know your mind is caused by grief is it not suppose you put your hand in the fire you know what you know i know the part of the body that is burned by fire not you one part of your whole body is burnt similarly you know that your mind is getting scorched but you have lost your analytical mind you are thinking you are getting scorched where your mind is a part of you that part is about getting in pain or environment you are interpreting as it is you are yourself suffering so this is separation how you understand it that it is mind is suffering not you to to emphasize that idea then 41 vars we have read also [Music] see last we read it this is the 41 verse as one things i am burnt where in reality his hand is only burned similarly due to lack of discernment due to lack of analytical faculty or dismantled discrimination you also thinking i am getting scorched by grief while your mind is getting deep stricken got it point we are always making this mistake actually it is happening in a part of my whole personality no you get i i got puzzled i know the answer but i could not respond that time that means your intellect is not functioning perfectly but you think i lost it no always we are making this mistake where our mind is suffering i say i am suffering when my body is in pain i am in pain normal statement oh i am in pain i am in not pain my feet is in pain my hand is in pain my stomach is in pain so these are only a part of us is pain whereas i am using the term as i am as if i am involved into it so this is the mistake now let us start now today from 42 verse this book entirely is a vedantic book is all the books talking about the same thing we we always sometimes think that he will internet is going up and down don't give up hold on we are we are trying to watch that change okay mother does not want sometimes instead of all effort okay so now we are reading the 42nd verse the same as i was saying how yeah that's true if you find any of our problem in one youtube channel which is we have we are working on two youtube channel now one is voice of vedanta another vedanto orc so if you miss one try the other jaggratian material in your hand [Music] means the waking state in this state jayamanam is born that which is born in deep sleep when you go to deep sleep what happens now everything is happening when you go to deep sleep what happens in this sleep as if everything dissolves where does it go the very important point when we are awake just now we are awake this whole world is here and everything is serious it is heat it is cold it is it is something is good happening bad happening everything is real but just in the suppose when i go to sleep what does this vanish it dissolves so again tom you you are not mind when you will be awakened in your knowledge then you will find that you are not the mind you are just imagining a misconception about yourself and it was happening this this world is mind which is the cause and source of all afflictions abode of all afflictions so this is very important point to think about that every day to meditate on this realistic point that when we are awake now everything is so real and we are really affected by it we are happy we are unhappy we are frustrated we are angry so all this emotional thing is going on and actually it is so serious that we feel its pain and suffering but now if i go to deep sleep immediately everything vanish so what a miracle what does it go where this universe of sorrows suffering happiness joy dissolved into it similarly you know now you are seeing this world to be true when you are awakened in your consciousness when you know yourself then you see that all these duality have banished your mind has vanished if the mind is vanished then where if the mind so long mind is there you are feeling all this if the mind is not there you don't feel anything therefore the world does not exist and therefore your suffering is also imaginary this is a very big thing to understand that everything your happiness is also imaginary your mind is imagining your sorrows are also imaginary because mind is not you your mind like a tool like a pain like a car like your shot like your dress like your shoes like your eyeglass you are not the eyeglass your eyeglass so similarly this world that is separation is there but this juxtaposition that's why vedanta says mean once one thing is juxtaposed on the other the gross example there is a piece of rope and we juxtapose we imagine there is a snake sometimes we see that the example is given that when you find that there is a bucket of water and take a stick and put into the water you see it is broken and in certain part it is broken you see that but it has not broken really it's the illusion similarly this world is broken it is united this is happy this is unhappy they are all your imposition superimposition so if you understand then what is happening in your mind it is just an imagination you are not that you are unaffected don't think at all that anything has happened to you it has happened to your mind which is unreal which comes and goes so 44 next verse when you go to your mind gets totally dissolved no shoko there is no trace of any bereavement even the least there is no shoka a person who has really sometimes doctors do that that when they find that the some person because of biryani men is so severe that they cannot withstand so doctors sometimes put them to sleep to forget that extreme condition that means when they are putting the mind to sleep when the mind is put to sleep then what happens when the mind is put to sleep then your experience of happiness misery which was happening in the mind also goes away so therefore susuto manoshi line in when the mind is dissolved in deep sleep no shoko opi there is no trace of grief at all similarly jagrati in their waking state now when the mind is aroused when mind comes up suppose i am sleeping i wake up wake up in the morning then jagrati when you wake up then so could you carry the same happiness misery bereavement loss gain all the emotions just spring as if it was pressurized spring and the way it is lifted it springs up so this is the it is happening where in your mind only it is happening that means all this is happening in your mind it is coming out of the mind it is entering into the mind it is dissolving into the mind so take care of the mind and that's a whole spiritual life is only dealing with the mind yeah so whole that's why you see meditation meditation what do you do do train the mind that that god is real or all other son you analyze with the help of mind this is true this is untrue all prayer we say remove the dust and dart of your mind by praying and crying and weeping for god so mind becomes clean so all are dealing with the mind mind shows this universe mind feels that i am in believement mind feels that i am happy unhappy that's why we also feel that we are unhappy happy so it is in the time of deep sleep when mind gets dissolved then the person show ko matra even the so comments believe bent not even a trace little bit of that can be found and jagrati sukudukkadi when you wake up again all this happiness and suffering it is springs up how managing in your mind it comes up 43. now 44 you are you are seeing everything is it not i am seeing this table i am seeing the spews i'm seeing the microphone i'm seeing the chandelier i'm seeing the photos i'm seeing the temple i am seeing only sarmam sarbang persuasy you you see everything because you see everything you call you are the witness so you are the witness tabo sukha then how can be your sokka your bereavement kathang tell me how and where your believement comes in the picture so sokomanamaya koshi you're all the suffering you're having it is in your mental sheath it is called mental  mental we have five sheets on my own the physical body manu in the mind began in the intellect in the energy body and ego body so these are the five coverings over the atman so therefore but you are the success you are the witness of all these things so it says sarvang pashi you are seeing because you see everything therefore you are the seer you see then you are the seer so you see the physical body physical everything then your share of your physical objects you see your mind is restless when you meditate you see your mind is going everywhere you see that you observe that's a mindfulness meditation what is mindfulness maintenance they only just see and observe let mind go here and there and there that means mind is running not you you are you are observing it sheer so that's the idea sarvangpasi everything is you are seeing succeed then you are the witness your shoka your believement your suffering gotham how tell me bada tell me oh arjuna where is your suffering where is your believement it is impossible to have it because you are the witness consciousness but then when i am feeling the sukkah i am feeling the birmingham i am feeling the pain agony agony of separation but that is happening in your monomial in your the covering the in your mental pain it is happening in your mental plane not your spiritual plan not your conscious plan so you understand which plane it is working you are mixing up two things as if the conscious plane is your own plane no conscious plane remains witness always it does not do anything his mind is affected and mind is getting the pain you are putting it on the atman it is like blaming somebody for something where the blame should go to the other person so it should go to the mind and it is now transferred to the atman and as a result you weep and cry and as a result what is happening you are having dukkha suffering udbego anxiety bhayo fear my sun is gone what will happen tomorrow's war with such a warrior gun your root big and anxiety suffering anxiety and fear etc etc all come because of the effect of the mind both of the channels are not working because it's a problem oh so you cannot do anything i turned the recording on that was we should immediately put in how it's being recorded here oh the rest of the class can be uploaded or we can do it redo it again and then because if it is known neither side is working so yeah okay sally so 44th verse then says that you are the witness of everything you see tell me where is your believement believement is in the mental that generates suffering anxiety fear and similar sustain so you are not you're not in this physical plane it is having you are in the mental training so think that if it is happening in the mental plane you solve the in the mental plane someone has done something and you go to kill somebody else will that solve the problem here all this duality all this suffering all these believement all our regular lives things are happening where it is not happening in the atman but it is happening in our mind so we should be very clear that whatever is happening in our life mostly it is in mental level that's why you call manus the awareness is not in the real nature but it's a is in the physical level or mental level or emotional level or intellectual level that is our world what can we do so what shall i do now next we'll do yeah no one will get it so i'm sorry what to do hi let me finish and then we will start again next day again we'll repeat this next verse says that 45 [Music] [Music] so what has happened you forgot
