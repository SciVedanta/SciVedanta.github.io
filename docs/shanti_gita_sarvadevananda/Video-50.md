[47. Shanti Gita - Class 47 - Chapter 5 - Verses 5-7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1oHiC-t70FE)

what are the do's and don'ts of a person of experience we all have some duty it is to be done and we also have some forbidden thing i should not do uh what what about the brahmagani's those bidaan bidang means those who have bit known but what is forbidden what is they should not do bisho and what are these special signs mr reyno prakasha please let me know elaborately please tell me and in response in one word the first response is given this way opi or kartab the duties do's and don'ts responsibilities and non-responsibilities nasty there is no such thing for whom those people who are the knower of tattoo the truth why why they will not simple formula they occur taro they are not kortha what means they do are i we are we have i ego sense naturally we do our things we have our understanding i am doing but these brahmaganis have known this little eye they don't identify with this little lie therefore they occur taro but their brahmarupa they feel i am brahman that is their understanding therefore they are niseida and bidhi compulsory you are to ordain you are ordained to do that they you cannot put them into the category of those people who have body identity like you and me so we have our duties we have our do's and don'ts for spiritual growth and development no but when you reach the culmination what is your duty what is your responsibility is there any such thing when no there is no such thing that's why sudden that's why you say keep your mind in noble thoughts no do good exercise do pranayama do concentration these are do's do's do do do's any negative thought comes try to drive away try to see god everywhere all these are for us don't do that will distract your mind that will digress your attention to worldly things more so rather these are do's and don'ts but brahmagan is have no such compulsion no such rules why even the vedas be the prabhu nobody sam veda you say our scriptures is our guideline better guide us in vedic culture in india in those days they are guided by the vedic injunctions injunctions but veda is not prabhu is not master for these people who have the truth in in in the inclination it's the vedas do not control them neither engage them in or nor prohibit them from actions that means they are because they are like child they are egoless those vedas have no injunction on them the ruling of the court court ruling there is laws these laws are made for general people but there is no law for a baby two years one years three years is there any law they they did something wrong they did something good they should be punished and that should not punish all these things they don't belong to them so a brahmagani become like a child they are so innocent so pure so for them these rules don't apply why shayang brahmo sadhana they feel that i am so i am brahman and they live in sadhananda sada means all the time ananda in the blissful state bistranta that rest in that constant blessed condition in the paramountment in the supreme self we live in the jivatman individual soul delivery supreme atman and therefore no prabhupti nivitiruva shuveta therefore there is no inclination towards the pleasant thing for them they don't find oh i like this or i dislike this so there is no probity inclination in the auspicious thing we have we should have because we as a student of spirituality we have to inclination for good things disinclination for things that drag us to the worldliness no for us but for them no there is no such thing so no [Music] body or they hope they don't think i am the body or they are that type of people never ever bhuga tata karma they don't enjoy the result of karma or they do perform any karma bhoga palang bhoga you did some good karma people will praise you that bhoga they don't enjoy like that as also new karma i did i will be achieving something greater that also is not with them so these are the two things happen that there that means they're free sold as we have read in the other areas in the bhagavad-gita and other places now today we read the fifth verse which says [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so you can find in the computer these verses so you can chant together also so karma sambhavit karma becomes possible karma somehow this body prana the spiritual and physical energy prana mano in the mind and buddhi and also ego ahumkaram and indriyam the senses eyes ears etc and in that they are connected and we do work for them this de homo prana mano buddhichi tohong karam and evan those who have by their previous birth they are connected with this and they have their past inclination vasana desire is there chester effort is there ta yoga because of that the karma is possible karma is possible for a person who have the body who have the pranic energy living alive no those mind is functioning in the mind whose intellect is working who has a ego sense so and the sense organs are active karma is possible for that because you need hand feet eyes here no you need a mind to think you have some ego sense i will do this work so because of this combination a karma is possible only for that person who have identification with these things the children also do work but we don't consider that work and the child also don't feel it himself i did some work because they have no ego sense much developed as the ego develops the same child say i did this i went to school i talked to me i did so all i i i comes and i work sense develops but what sense cannot come to a person who is deha body prana all these is it yogut association with them and association with this plus bashala basuna means the desire something which prompts from our inner personality and pushes us and chester not only desire some people have a desire i like to have this nice house but no chester no effort sorry where is the house can be available how much is the price let us go and check it whether it suits my purpose that effort the effort is necessary so effort is necessary desire is necessary and then doiba means ultimately you should be successful god should provide you with some success god's grace do you mean significant means god's grace so these are all necessary for performing karma how similar is with the bhagavad-gita what it says that uh pancha uh i have not quoted it for a long time panchamam panchamam uh udhistanam now is that it has come now it runs away this channel tata we should remember memorize gita that's why and to also repeat that if you don't repeat them which i'll do that is exactly the same so this gita says bhagavad-gita as his popular bhagavad-gita it says for accomplishment of some work you need this five what are udhistano means i sense now but astronomy is a body you should have a body a disembodied person cannot build a house huh he cannot write a letter so first of all you should have a body the udisthanam there should be somebody ego the sense organs should be the eyes should be their hand their all the sense organs should be there and if someone hand organ everything is there and have a desire to do but don't do anything so you have to make effort bibidha means diverse babies chester means effort i let me do this way i fail okay let me do the other way it felt okay let me do the other way baby that's just and last is the ebook god's grace you do everything but success ultimately depends on what god wills if god's will is there he may be successful many people trying trying trying it does not happen that's why we say give it to god after doing all this effort you just surrender to god so the same idea is being given here more details deja you should have a body and he has elaborated more prana vital energy manu buddhi chittong karu hong karmas means you should different instrument and do ibo means god's guess and you should have bhasana and chester desire and effort yoga karma if you have all these things then only karma is possible is it okay do you agree otherwise you cannot perform any work no first of all you should have some desire then to desire means you need a body otherwise where you will desire in this body you desire that means you should have that desire and behind the desire there is ego i desire this so there will be ego and then desire and then sense organs should be there eyes here hand pete etc to perform the action and then effort bibi is a sister according to bhagavad-gita five and according to here prana mano buddhism that means 10 the same thing elaborated here in number 10 and that is synoptically in the original bhagavad-gita 5 so it is same if we understand so so karma-sambhavit karma is possible because of all these things but it is not possible that foreign has no body identity so he gets disconnected there i there is no i it is god i am servant of god or whatever so they are like a child they have a body they have the senses they do something but they don't think they have done anything huh okay that story that our ramakrishna says in the gospel that the gopis and the bayasa they were on the bank of the yamuna river and they wanted to cross the yamuna river so basso they they requested oh basil we want to cross the river please some make something for us no boat is available so he said i'm very hungry please feed me something so the gopis have their in their stock some yogurt sweets all the time milk me they're all milk cow um grazing people and their milk centered life so all everything is milk products so he ate to his heart's content and after eating he stood on the bank of the jamuna and said oh mother yamuna if i have not eaten anything please make a way for us and mother jonah parted and all of them walked through it no so how it is possible because he has no body identity the body paid but not him he is a brahmanagani that's why he says god karma-samba though they do something it is not their karma karma is when you have the ego sense you have the desire you have the willful effort for completion of the work if you fail this way you try that way that way that way that way that way and also depend on god no for karma but brahma ghani has no karma because they think i am not the body at all the fundamental point is disconnected i am not this stable so if the table gets burned what is that to me okay it is polished and it looks science better what is that to me it is a temple i am not similarly the brahman genesis this is this is not me it's the body so they separate out so you cannot put them any duties any karthub what is responsibility do's and don'ts don't belong to them so this is the fifth verse so translation goes like this action is possible only due to the association of the body vital energy mind intellect and chitta means the remembering faculty you should remember what you did yesterday you want to complete the work today so you must have a memory of the past and you have to start again no a person of alzheimer's person and you give him to cook some food so what he does or she does she does not know what he has given or what is already given or not given and sometimes but totally he cannot remember so remembering faculty is the cheetah yeah true so this is the remembering we were reading books supposedly we have read yesterday which page how many things now how many people remember even if we asked yesterday's reading as what we read yesterday how many people will remember that so you need a remembering factor there and that makes you really efficient person in the world but for this spiritual person they don't want to remember this is me at all they think i am atman they only remember one thing and they identify with that spiritual truth so the action is possible only due to the association of the body vital energy mind intellect remembering faculty ego the sense organs faith or god's grace desire and effort this is karma is possible for that no no six verse ganny servum bicharina [Music] [Music] russia [Music] now now the fifth part says that only karma is possible for such people who have this identity he feels that i am a body you have a chronic energy you have a buddhi you have an intellect he has a memory he has this ego sense no senses sense organs and desire and effort all these all these associated with all these only work is possible and also they depend on god after doing something they say it is god's hand no now ganny but what happens for the ghani the noir of truth gyani servam everything bicharano by analysis by this discernment neerasa they give up everything nirasa means what is the neerosu means they let me see what they have done russia nirakri turkey which are in need of so many having rejected that means they reject they reject what neera show why they reject hatha these are matter these are not conscious entity so they give up identification with them thinking both intellectually no they realize they have understood the core of their depth that it is all matter it is not the consciousness it is matter so i what shall i do in the matter body is a matter mind is matter because they only work when the consciousness is there a robot works only when the supply of energy is there behind battery is there or whatever electrical energy or whatever energy is given so that consciousness without consciousness everything is jala so gyani sharbam vicharyana sarva means everything in the universe and we have talked about all the ten points in the verse number five all these bichar in uni russia they throw away that the desi they renounce nirusha means renounce renounce what all these dhata understanding it is jorah matter and what they do not only this will not do it is not jorah is not the point but what i am bistrant they take rest their mind rests when saccidananda in the sahaja cheetah i am sachida see two thing goes on side by side they experience the diesel jara what shall i do in jannah matter totapuri this world is even after having this nervy called samadhi when he's coming down he's saying this is jada this is matter what shall i do with it the body is jonah the body stomach pain excruciating what shall i do with the body i will kill this body destroy this body so you enter into the ganges water so that means it is jaura they want to give away have no interest in keeping them associating with it jaragudi and the butter live in the sachida they say bistranto they rest they fully become peaceful as we rest after our whole day's work when we rest they also rest in satchida and tata that is the advaita no too that truth which is saccidana and which is swarupay which is my real nature this is my real nature thinking this they stay they hold they take rest in that sachida within and renounce everything so if there is no connection at all and you renounce everything jorah then when it comes comes the question of desire what it comes where you will become the question of your effort why are you really be praying to god oh please fulfill my desire if there is no desire what is the question of fulfillment of desire so that is the reason the candies don't fall into the category of karma what a beautiful state that we have to understand that this gyani state the state of a devotee state what a beautiful state that they are not dragged down by anything nothing can disturb their peace because they think this is unimportant it is no meme no there is no interest in it they don't find any interest in that only what is interesting is sachi dhara on them and they think success essential non-dual truth because of that they rest in this and not in the jar of matter that which is all momentary all changeful all in decaying that is the verse number six so the sixth verse translation goes a person of wisdom because of the knowledge of the inertness of the object because they know any object we see it is enough it is jorah gives up everything through discernment through everything that's called the sannasana the monk the sanskrit what of the monk is called sunnyasu so naso means one who can throw away everything everything in the material world they throw away why they throw away because it is jala it is matter it is not consciousness and by the knowledge of non-duality of existence rests in his own essential nature which is the existence knowledge and peace success so because of the knowledge this is very important because of their wisdom or knowledge that everything is jala jara means not conscious everything is dependent on the consciousness of brahman therefore this appeared to be conscious so it is meaningless for me so if it is like this is akbar the the beggar the pakis pakir means a wandering monk sufi mystic they are called pakit sufi monk he went to the king akbar he was a very generous king asking for some paper maybe some money or something material something and when he went there he asked he was going to ask but he saw that the akbar is himself praying o allah oh lord give me money give me more land more kingdom more browse and strength so that ryan can extend and then listening to that prayer the the monk he turned his back and going away without asking anything then the akbar asked you came you need something why are you going away then he said i came to ask something but i see that you i am a beggar in that way no but you are also a beggar you are asking god give me this give me this give me this why i shall ask you i'll ask god so because it is jada why shall i engage myself in this jara and not get any joy ultimate joy so i detach i did that that's right um there it is said i am not this not this not this but who am i yes so i am chidananda rupa and i am not this and not this and not this say same thing so everything he with deep analysis renouncing everything why renouncing because they are not conscious they are dependent on the consciousness of saccidan on the consciousness therefore it is worthless to find joy through that so they give up and they remain in sachidan on the swarupa yeah remain mister every beautiful one they take full rest they find full blissful mood by resting in that sachida whenever they think i am saccidana wow they go back to their own self and in this world they don't find any pleasure that's why you go to ramana mercy you go to rama krishna you go to buddha krishna they are living they live in the world but they don't find any much interest as ordinary people ignorant people find in the material world so five and six we have read now therefore because of this then how can we expect seven verse that they will be doing any karma there again they say because your question was karma so how they will do any karma there therefore seven verse says kriya [Music] les means even the trace even the trace of karma karma not karma even there is no trace of karma bhavit is possible now or this person who is the person the ghani they know of truth now also niskiyo atma because they don't do any karma they live in their state of inaction inaction means they remain in brahmagarro in action externally they remain in action but their mind is totally steeped into the cosmic consciousness because they are jyoti jyotim is sannyasi monk okay i told that the renouncer your team is renouncer so they have already said that brahmagan is the renounce renounce the matter material aspect that's also full stuff yeah jyoti has a different meaning but yoti also means sannyasi so karma lesho the trace of karma bhavat no cannot be there question for this person because the essential nature is total actionlessness in brahma ghana there is no action so this is the state of actionlessness for the monk a monk a renouncer she gives us the material part of it like the swan gives us the water part but drinks the milk part water and milk mix together the world is a mixture of jorah and chaitanya that's why it is called chitchara granthi there is a knot of consciousness and matter and this cause man this knot you have to save other knot by knowledge so karma show babin and if you think that this enjoyment due to this karma where it will come from there is no desire there is a rejection of this world itself so why do you think that he'll be involved into the result of it karma lesho follow seth maybe you know by whom karma kritam you perform some karma then they can expect some result this person has no karma because he does not desire anything and he leaves rest in the sachida so how that that person will have any karma and if there is no karma how the result will come if there is no head the what the headache will happen if you say there is a headless person and he's suffering from headache it is impossible so similarly this imagination he has no karma so why there will be karmaphala that's why the question is called vicarious detone atonement no what is called vicarious this god christ suffered these sins of others that's why he suffered why he suffered this question will come if he's a god why he suffers because he has no karma you are saying all these things the rest in the sachida but you see he has been crucified he has been given so much trouble for carrying the cross and these and that all these things no it is because it is vicarious atonement he not suffering for himself he has no karma but he has invited the karma of others rama krishna it is said why he suffered cancer because he took the sin of girish and other devotees so when you take the karma your body will suffer but they don't suffer that's why remember when ramakrishna was there and hari maharaja said no he said that sriracha said there's so much suffering this going on there and then he bluntly said no sir you don't suffer yeah you are but the day in ramakrishna praised him you say rascal good god caught me in the right point yeah yeah you are immersed in bliss next what you are not suffering you are immersed in bliss so that is the point but their body suffers because you are taking something in the body somebody will be suffering so but they don't suffer because they are separate from the body trustworthy so the translation goes since his essential nature essential nature of a brahman ghani is what actionlessness they have nothing to do that's why gita said i have nothing to do in the world or you know still see i am engaged for the good of the world that is their weak point the weak point of buddha krishna christ rama is that they have no need for themselves but they suffer for our suffering how to show some direction to the people of the world who will follow their path for thousands and thousands of years say krishna said at least how many years it will be pre christ pre buddha so pre buddha say 2500 years at least westerner western scholars and eastern scholar will fight on this point who gets more yeah less here but at least it is five thousand year ten thousand year whatever but this is so important eternally true even today but so they suffer for our cause we are reading the bhagavata there you see they come to give the energy to the good people and people remember that and still now people are thinking of krishna rama buddha sankarana and getting the direction of life so therefore the result of action in the form of enjoyment can belong only to the person by whom the action has been done beforehand i have done some good karma i can reap the result no but because they are actionless there is no question of their enjoying something in the world or suffering because of something so karma follow does not touch them so i think now we have uh we have no question session we can end here 15 minutes are there we can have the question and let me end this reading so we have read the up to verse number seven we'll start verse number eight next day om shanti shanti shanti hari yum [Music] us too uh you have some question jonah also at the same time everything is nothing but consciousness yeah that is another stand after yeah that that's why first you reject first you reject and go to the actionless state and then you are talking about when they come down then they see everything is brahman first you reject because there is difference mind says is jorah matter this is consciousness because we one is transcending to that level and now he rests in that consciousness aspect and now he when he's resting his jar of sense is gone totally in sachidan on the self when they come down again they see they don't see the jawa anymore they see this is all his brahman god everywhere only two state that is the point two state of existence okay so we'll now let us see the question any further [Applause] okay so later how do we identify a ganny can he see be identified how can we identify agani chapter 2 but it is very difficult first of all it is difficult i will say it is difficult to identify ganny from outside behavior i may pose that i am a brahman i have no action but that will not do i may pose somewhere but i mean many people become in samadhi but actually if it is samadhi what will be the sign the sign is that you will radiate some spiritual energy around you brahman he cannot hide themselves for to the people who are devoted people a raw person coming who have no spirituality at all they will not understand the roman mercy they will not understand krishna vivekananda too dull but you have little sensitivity you love god and you be with them for some time you feel your energy level is high you feel even in their presence you find joy some peace where did it come from you may not have to find any another source even brahmagan is they call in the yoga system we heard that even they talk minor materialistic talk but being in their presence you feel uplifted so that is one side identified in this way if we are sincere if we go we feel some sort of peace our samis so many people used to come and maybe he's talking something many things he's making jokes and things but when they go away they used to feel some sort of peace he asked one of the mother's disciple holy mother's disciple sami sharo deshananda he said maharaja i he was the head of our delhi center as a big center and many devotees come from the high officials in the in the federal government secretary deputy secretary finance secretary education secretary top people who have ruled the whole india so and they sometimes somebody coming in such people of some such stature and they come and they lost their son their daughter believe me it happens no and they come what shall i do i do not know what to talk to them how to console them then maharaj told him you have done your spiritual practice from your childhood right when you are even going to the grade school the the inclination was there for god he used to meditate even in the school days 10th grade 9th grade going to the astrum nearby astro and there is a temp temple he used to help in the temple and sometimes spend whole night in the temple didn't go back home so that was his background we came to know later on but he said whatever you have done people come to you they will feel that peace you need not have to do anything only pray for them and be yourself be yourself that will help them so that is the point to see a holy man only what is the external he may not be nice looking he don't be very cultured he may be using words may not be very sophisticated or not that highly intellectual but you go and stay sometime and listen to them or don't talk even if you have some element you can feel some uplifted mood where did it come from his association i can tell you one story when we are brahmacaris joined the we had the opportunity of one swamiji one monk was very highly spiritual person so when he was their eyes i was very much drawn to him so i used to spend instead of studying and doing where i used to always try to follow how much i can be with him and others used to be jealous about me for that but anyhow so and also i used to think i am spending and i could not get time for meditation i get tired no suppose you are working in your we have heavy work seven eight hours nine years hours work and then the college in this that that and then when he has some time either running and maybe 1991 o'clock i say night 11 o'clock i'll have to get up in the early morning because i'll have to open the shrine the school the teachers will come for their morning prayer and i have to lead the music and so many things and and then night 11 o'clock and he may be in his mood and he's speaking something maybe goes on midnight and then and then i thought woof i am really spending my time i could have meditated more i am not getting time for meditation i was really not feeling good because of that not doing meditation not doing meditation now it happened after some time the swami had to go in another center to be take responsibility of another center so when he went i thought i might my time i don't go night 11 o'clock there or even in the morning time i can spend that time for my meditation and i got really good stage of time but i started meditation what is meditation mind is so distracted mind goes everywhere get frustrated and that time i didn't do meditation but we associated with him be with him walk with him talk with him and he of course will be talking about rama krishna holy mother vivekananda which are not very much popular then he was a researcher also so all these things new information new thing and uplifted spiritual things he used to say and not only intellectual but spiritual so i didn't understand then i said it was much better to walk with him my mind was more peaceful more uplifted and now i am trying to meditate my mind goes in mundane things so that's the point to understand the holy man these are the signs that their presence will give us some sort of peace comfort feeling of fullness like that and absence you can test yourself difference between that then you will give the holiness if you are holier than him then that question does not come then we will go to you if someone is holier naturally others will go to him and they will feel uplifted but our two holy man may be helping each other that may also be but you know that there will be two scientists are talking to each other they will release their company more they understand yes somebody brahmana passed away and said samir shivanandas we read that shivan on the memoirs then she said that oh i don't know whom to talk today nowadays about all these spiritual insights no there is nobody to talk nobody to understand if i tell somebody you don't understand my experiences so that is the thing so if spiritual two spiritual people meet together that's why it is thing to see when swami that swami holy mother's disciple who is very go forward book you should read that go forward book that's the letters of that swami it's a brahman ghani and then can be sudden he become the president bishop holy mother's disciple when they go and sitting side by side maybe they are talking they are not talking maybe both are silent for half an hour but they are enjoying their company it's a different level i hear also some stories like that our motherhood and the sami such a spiritual person and uh shantan nandusami they're sitting side by side not talking to each other bharat maharaja this type of type of very highly evolved swamis when they are sitting not that they will have to chit chat all the time but they both are sitting there silently and our space in mayabati i have heard mayabath is a beautiful place suppose today is full moon night no or tomorrow will be the full moon so that full moon and snow peaks high himalayas oh wonderful scene and it's very cold also but there is a glass window and both the swamis are sitting there hours and hours and then about midnight across midnight then one of the swami bharat maharaja went to his room and other swami is sitting over there but they so enjoy their company that means they're they understand internally that joy and bliss they share anyhow the second point can you discuss meaning of the word moha mohammed is what delusion mahou is infatuation also probably so maya mohammed's i i got attached to something i know it is not good but i cannot come out it is like a deep what you call addiction example is it is like velcro is easy velcro you can bring out but it can you can do it makes noise no no no no no no but you come out but but this moho will be it is like glue and our mind on has glue crazy glue once you touch bomb god it is that means delusion is such that it is very difficult to come out of that it has stuck together so that's why this more spiritual practice and detachment can you comment on the value of meditating on one's guru or the guru's form you know guru or earthly guru is the representative of our the god who is the gold that's why probably you will find that in your meditation your guru might have told you think of your guru and then merge your guru in your ideal if it is whatever may be when you think of christ merge yourself in the christ you first think of your guru and that guru is merging into god that means that way guru and god are same but you can think of guru and meditate on them but better to do guru's guru guru's guru guru guru rin the god is the eternal guru so when you merge your guru into the eternal guru or your chosen ideal christ buddha rama krishna makali durga shiva whatever aspect you think think of that more then your guru is also included there but some tradition are there they pay more attention to guru the person but in our tradition we give attention to not to guru of course guru is guru we respect and revere and that's why because he has given me mantra and showed me the path i am eternally indebted to him but that guru is a representative of god otherwise what happens guru cult comes my guru your guru your guru is also representing god my guru is defending god so why not think of god and if first you there is a process you all all know that you remember your guru you offer your salutation you do something like that that's a guru puja after that merge the guru into god and then think of god so not to think too much of guru rather than guru the ideal is eternal guru we call god that you know see if we read the mantras [Music] dot mind the sound om and kala is parts column is part and so beyond that beyond this bindu beyond these this that means you're talking about brahman that brahman i salute tasmania that guru not the guru the man [Music] uh that reality which is pervaded all over the world all over the creation a condo economy is unbroken is occur in the form of infinite no permeated everywhere character this matter and moving that padam darshitam he has shown me that is your ultimate reality i salute that guru that means who is she is showing me god the absolute i salute that guru that means here guru it is said if you have must have to have guru and you must have your tremendous devotion to your guru otherwise this spiritual life no progress will happen otherwise you'll have no trust in the words of the guru if you don't have a tremendous faith and love and reverence so what he says it will not make any dent in your mind so therefore think of guru representing god is reprinted in the form of guru that guru is better but in some tradition guru sheva guru puja is emphasized but in our tradition we say think of more of your wisdom anything more no more question good we are all done then many people even in the same tradition say ramakrishna tradition people may get confused my guru your guru my guru is higher do you know when i got mantra i get long back my guru was that are you okay you are recent you are that day you are not that guru now people really sometimes get into the confusion of that but it is not so we have to think that guru is that think of guru who when you he gave you the mantra he was not in ordinary consciousness he is talking about god and only showing you the path and direct that is the guru shakti the power is working through that person during that time think of that murthy of her pranam and then what he said follow rather than fighting with my guru greater than your guru for my personal life yes my guru is great because he has helped me to remove me my darkness my ignorance so i am ever grateful but i need not have to compare with others for me in my personal life personal sense yes my guru is my guru because he is the representative of brahman to me but need not have to say others guru is great or low because you are making a mistake all guru shakti it is the power example is given suppose the holy ganga its root is in high himalayas go mukha gomukh is the verb here only glacier and there is a shape of cow's face go means cow face is the mouth you see from a distance it will a big cow's face as it were and the water is streaming from that like the tongue coming out no that's called oh poor glacier everywhere that is so pure that's the say that is the powerful mother ganga who is purifying ganga we consider no now it comes down next step to different levels from the high himalayas to gangotri a little lower than that altitude no and then comes down comes down to uttarkashi then comes to rishikesh rishikesh then it comes to benaras then goes to calcutta as it goes down because it mixes with so much dust and that people throw things and this and that ganga water looks little dirty and in calcutta in sun certain period you cannot touch that ganga but people go there in deep and thinking they are getting pure scientific standpoint people will say well my god what they are doing but mind it whoever wherever they take the ganga and sprinkle they feel i am becoming pure the potential power of purification of ganga remains the same whether you touch in the ganga tree the source stainless pure like grass no so distilled clean distilled water like that coming down to bananas with dirt and this it looks little dirty but the water has its potential power to take care of our sin so god is a powerful god powerful illumined soul and wherever in our life we get our guru that purifying agent the purifying power is the same redemption power is the same in your mantra so think of that it does not pollute the ganga the strength of ganga for purifying power is the same so gurus are of that but before you select your guru you can think hundred times whether it is fit guru or not guru whether his character is questionable or he's really a good permanent practicing person and honesty is there and he does not demand anything he is not a money making business so all these things you can consider before but after you once accept ramakrishna said don't judge anymore what he has said just follow why no one is questioning again question here because if you keep sitting in people okay is samadhi necessary for the knowledge of brahman if not then how yes the samadhi state is the brahmaganu state a two language yogic language called samadhi and brahm vedanta will say brahman atman identification the same when your total ego dis dissolves that dissolves in this samadhi state and that also happens perfect annihilation of our ego sense goes in when i will be able to i am that aham brahmas me thou are that when that comes that is the highest state and there is the same so rather when one is attaining nirvikalpa he is becoming brahmagani is not too different okay thank you all jaima we'll see you tomorrow in the gospel class [Music] [Music] too you
