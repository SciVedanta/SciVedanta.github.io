[52. Shanti Gita - Class 52 - Chapter 5 - Verses 18-22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4WBd9rbi9c)

[Music] um shanti shanti o lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and ever more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face home peace peace peace be unto us all so we are reading santi gita the song of peace the advice of bhagavan krishna at the quest of the question raised by arjuna arjuna said this question that how a knower of truth behaves how him roams around how he eats like bhagavad-gita how he sees how he eats so the response is coming that you cannot categorize the brahmaganis by their behavior their body goes on according to the momentum of the past life's action which is called prarabdha karma because in this life when one realizes god at that point of time all his karma what he has done in this life will be nullified and also the karma which i have accumulated in previous life and previous life and stored in my mind which may fractify later on that is also discarded so what remains now the remaining momentum in which the buddhist body was going till it drops that much karma will remain therefore they move according to their past impressions of samaskaras momentum we are the bundle of our momentums no but we are in this life thinking it is our character we call the tendency tendency is grown because of that momentum so now that that's why some or some person may be very intelligent persons he will be talking intelligently and speaking like that some may be devotional type after attaining brahma gano they will be very very devotional nature some may behave like not like a very elegant person like some sometimes disabled here ramakrishna saw many people come to dakshinisha one day he saw one person has come and he is eating himself some thrown away leftover bread in the dustbin and eating himself and feeding the dog also that and feeding himself so ramakrishna saw that he says he's a paramahamsa so see that the outward behavior is so different someone like janaka we read that other day that he will be like a royal king and he will be dressed like a as a king dresses no and will be having luxurious um things around him all the elements of enjoyment of the things in life no it will it all will have there but they are internally they detach totally and their mind is so pure is not affected by these worldly things so therefore we cannot define them so we are reading like that so last we have read up to 6 17 6 17 verse which run runs like this the yogi who is free from all transactional behaviors take up various types of appearances sometimes he takes on the form of a beggar and at times the form of a naked person and some other time he seems to be engrossed in worldly fun and enjoyment like an actor they behave like an actor that this book says that like an actor who takes bare right forms by putting on different apparel some yogi is always engaged in beggar like behavior some other behaves magnificently like a king someone being desirous is engaged in enjoyment someone is endowed with renunciation detachment someone wears gorgeous dress someone is covered with tattered cloth someone is without any clothing someone is clothed with a waist and waistband or cuddle so you cannot just define say that looking at a person you cannot say that he is a realized soul or really he may be not so that continues verse number 18 18 18 it says drunk person drunk or is intoxicated so you can see that some person is so someone is found like drunk or intoxicated or insane because you don't much motivation and some appears like an insane person and some be like a pisha or pisha means like a ghoul ghoul so that means disabled hair eating whatever they can get filthy things is red when the whole body is smeared with clay and so very it is like not at all acceptable in the society so it says behaves like a ghoul and in a forest it lives in a isolated place question moni sometimes you will find that he does not speak to anybody silent observing silence that type of person and also sometimes you find someone is constantly talking giving talks lectures arguing with people this that so this is the all different types of behaviors we find among the knowers of brahman so it is said open operator some appears like an insane person or drunk or intoxicated some behaves like a ghoul in a forest some may be silent and someone else may be an orator and very argumentative uh you go and that in our you know ramakrishna order you will find people of this type means arguing means further like in the scripture study you study the scripture and and there you argument is there uh cross argument and so that you arrive at the conclusion that brahman is the real so they are like that summer orator great orators so but apparently you'll see that oh he's an intelligent person he's a knowledgeable person but not he is realized soul his expression is all different according to their own nature next 19 verses kashi [Music] shubo [Music] [Music] so what does it mean question some people i'll talk very sweet ones some sadhus if you go very soft and sweet and your heart will touch now and santa they are very well behaved well mannered and other way kashi that burjito and you find some people some sadhus or some realized people maybe householder maybe a monk matters little some may be little what you call shower tongue whatever he speaks in such a way people run away from that there is a story of a khatta there is a story of the brahma ghani and the chandragupta or that the king heard that there is a realized soul and who lives under the bullock cart and then so the king was very respectful for brahma ghanis so he sent his ministers to search out where is that holy man can be and they went there and they saw a person and he is not dirty really lying under a bullock cart the bullock is not there the cart is there broken cart maybe dirty ground and like there and he went and the minister went and bowed down and said sir we wish that you should come to our parish and our king wants to have a visitation of yours he became so angry and behaved like a get out here like that that type of expression but you know so and but he's a brahman but why he behaves like that and he also said no tell your king to come to me i am not going to go there so and that the uh king the minister reported and the king was interested he came and he said sir please come we'll keep you with much respect in our palace etc no no no i don't care for it get out then he said again okay i'll give you marriage to with my daughter and give you half of my kingdom oh is it so as if he's a greedy person getting married and these are all all just the outward expression but their heart is so pure so this story goes that that is a realized soul they behave like this so we cannot judge from external appearance but as i said there is a sign of a holy man that if you be around them your mind you can feel that bearing becomes peaceful mind becomes little uplifted normally what we get the peace in meditation by our own effort being in their presence our mind gets uplifted so that's why it says that kashi tsubasi some become some are very sweet tongue satpatra well-behaved well-mannered kashid tadbhabo murjitu some are believed of this type of good be good attitudes kashjit grahi some you can find totally engrossed in household work as if they're so much attached to the world even doing something which in the eyes of a holy people is unholy in india meat or the butcher they are not good because all mahingsha is the principle even we eat ramakrishna mission it's peace so it is very much criticized in the society sadhus they would like that no and that is the culture of the country so we know that story of that man who was sitting under a tree and doing yoga practice and suddenly one day crow was sitting in the branch and the crow had some dropping pill on his head or something and he got angrily looked at the crow at his anger the crew get burnt and then yogi thought see i have generated so much power of my austerity so i have become somebody no ego pops up and then then but he has to go for begging she went to go for begging to a house the householder lady he said mother give me some food and the lady from in in her courtyard in her in her apartment which is told that okay um please wait for some time i am coming after doing my service to my husband and he is waiting and he waited for few minutes and his anger is going i am such a yogi they do not know my power no and he make me wait for such a long time and so this anger and this frustration came in the mind then the lady from inside again started saying my child it is not like you're burning the crow i am doing service shiva to my husband it is my legitimate duty you please wait after finishing that i will come to give you and serve you and that created a sensation in his mind he said huh i in a forest i was sitting under a tree and i burned a crow and i was so much proud of it and how she knows she's a householder lady ordinary lady who serving the wife husband and wife and i am a yogi how he could do so his ego got little good money pounding and then he waited and and when she came with some offering to give it to the yogi then the yogi said ma please first tell me how could you know that i have burnt a crow then the lady said baba i do not know anything i do my duties of life very honestly as much as i can and i take the name of the lord as much as i can but it has come i don't know how it came i have i cannot analyze it i cannot tell you anything that means spontaneously the truth comes up your mind that means she's a she's a great advanced spiritual personality and that's why then to break the ego of the yogi more she said no i am i am a woman what shall i teach you so you go there is a butcher go to a butcher who is in that particular area he is a shop and you go and he will teach you actual spiritual lessons he then went walked walked walked walked and went and saw a butcher and he is very busy he was doing the business shelling it cutting to pieces chopping the place weighing blood is here cleaning like that and just and he said he's my he will teach me brahmacano i will talk about spirituality oh my god he has doubting inside then he said that sir i want to i have some spiritual questions so but internally he was very disturbed that a person doing this type of mean work of cutting the meat and selling these it's not a very good job for a sadhu-like person or a austere person or a god-loving person awhiling but anyhow but then he got great respect for the lady so he waited waited waited and this gentleman finished his job of shelling cleaning and then closing the shop then he said come with me in my home so he came back to his home and then first he took care of his father who is ailing father and nursed and served him and then after that he came to this yogi and said tell me what is your question and then that question is a big spiritual text and not being in volume but very highly spiritual uh vedanta text it is called baadhu gita the gita or the like bhagavad-gita it is narrated by beathard the butcher gita narrated by butcher and that's very substantial text in the medanta literature no it is like prokaryotes as you read [Music] that it is like apraxia type of book so see the apparently he this this bada this butcher is a brahmagani he is an owner of truth but his external behavior externally is a householder he's doing his ordinary but he's doing his duty without detachment that ideal those these are the so very difficult to understand a spiritual person from outside behavior outside their talk or activities they don't perform so some we find that they remain in the household life some are bonus though bonus means they go to the forest forest life is the third life third phase of life indian spiritual tradition first stage is brahmacari they who is not married yet second stage is karosta and that 25 25 50 years after 51 years they go to the forest line that means isolated away from the duties and responsibilities mostly engaging their time we call retired life so they go to that retired life and engage them so bonasta means some may live in that third stage of life some may live in the first stage of life monk renouncing monk behaving this way that way some may be in the household life someone may be in the third stage of household life when they leave a spiritual life more and even they go into the forest or isolated place and they question mura sometimes you find they like latu maharaja because as if they are illiterate or mura means fool as if they behave in like that way and for opera some are dull and others may be soothing very intelligent very sharp so these are the variety types of the behavior of the yogis some yogis speaks loving words and is well behaved some else someone else is bereft of those manners some are householders some are forest dwellers some are dull whereas others are very intelligent so all types of italy therefore 20th verse it yeah [Music] [Music] etc etc we have given some examples similarly these types of vivida means variant or variety variety ways charanti charanti means moves around who these guys move around charanti janna ganinoi knowers of truth they move around the world like this to be in the world so in these different varieties of behaviors these holy people this knowers of truth truth they move around of bhakta imperceptible with the apparent sign brahman they move around brahmavir free from all delusion their delusion is gone they are free from all what you call the negativities all their ignorance being gone so they live in that delusion-free way so the imperceptible yogis they are devoid of delusion they roam around by taking apparent identities of these variety types of identities of themselves so true through these various ways the knowers of truth move about in this world these imperceptible yogis devoid of delusion roam around by taking apparent identities upon themselves so that is the way in in our turn in our order also you will find all varieties types of sahajas no each one is coming from one background and la tu manage as we see and stuck with disciples his ways are very different from that than that of swami vivekananda each one we find they are all brahmagani's babura manas premananda if we look at these these examples and also we look at the ramakrishna's disciples great devotee of holy mother so we find that external behavior is totally different but internally they live in that highest realm of knowledge so nana now therefore conclusion he's also dr krishna is giving next verse saying that they nara bhavenu in in variety ways and in variety dress and costumes they charanty they move around so na na [Music] variety types of costumes and dresses charanty they roam around but got a song their doubts are they're freed from doubts or upon research says that when one reaches that state they arrive this state of doubt free they become free from all doubt is doubt and they get freed from all types of doubts and dante diagram they are not of the heart the heart mind heart means mind corrected or attached or tied to the world and worldliness they cut asunder so the ignorance is removed and doubt is their god no question they see god they feel god they move in god as ramakrishna said i have seen god i see more tangibly than i see you so that is the gotta sangsaya however in our everyday evening prayer where we will pray swami vivekananda has given this word got to say you become what is the sign of a person who thinks of ramakrishna he becomes nearby or you are nearby you are free from all bio fear ever free from fearless from fear nearby and gotta sanctify the same word the song the doubts totally go away you know is there god even in life those who are devotees they may have certain point falling in some difficult situation sometimes doubt comes is it god is there why it is going on so much atrocities in the world why people innocent people are getting hot is there really a kind god this doubt comes but it is from the perspective of god is something different as swami vivekananda is saying in one place you know when someone sees the two puppies they are playing and they are biting each other the people who owns these puppies they think they are playing little biting little crying and little attacking so in the eyes of god what we are doing someone is good someone is bad but is all puppies play in the eyes of god so this is one it's a good idea we wanted to explain what is going on in the world and why god is not doing anything that that that question solves here not perfectly but at least give some explanation little explanation but this doubt will go doubt will go only on god realization then before that doubt will remain so there is a story that one sadhu came sad you got a devotee who said i say that to somebody shivananda and he said i had one experience of that absolute knowledge of oneness with brahman then mahaprabhu's said oh is it but is it not a little little doubt comes in some other time is it really i saw this real experience or really something they say no it was good it is so convincing i felt it and all my body thrilled with joy and this no no no do you feel it something okay but do your mind sometimes doubt is it the absolute experience or is it something so ultimately two three times he poked him in this way and then he agreed he said yes occasionally little doubt comes then mahaprabhu said nothing has happened you have not realized dinner need to be called if it happens it will be perfectly got to some science the doubts will be totally free swamiji said if the whole world comes it is so to kill you then you will say yes that is the only truth you will not save her from that and experience so that is the god of samsara need a song the mind will be so firmly established in that experience so that is the uh by seeing them by looking at them no it cannot be seeing a little and this it cannot be they cannot be known or recognized even a little even a little of their spirituality by observing only their external characteristics as you see from outside so therefore the yogis being totally free from doubts and hesitations wander around with different moods and in diverse external appearances they cannot be known even a little by observing their external characteristics from outside in some sadhus to avoid the disturbance from uh crowd they really behave in such a way people will think that he's the mad guy so they they will not move sometimes he was a great spiritual giant thakur rava krishna had went there and they had a conversation he was not speaking that time by by sign they talked brahman is one or two like that and ramakrishna talked with him and he was a par excellent brahman ghani he is called the living shiva of belarus and now he used to sometimes smear dirty things around in his body bad smell comes and no one approaches him runs away from distance so their behavior is really really not as accessible to us so now bringing the some philosophy why it happens now we ordinary people we do whatever we do because i have the body identity they have i have the body identity therefore i behave as my mind dictates me i behave but their body behave because of the impulse of the past life's action but mind is detached from the all these things it he remains internally charged into the consciousness of the bliss and externally they do behave whatever they behave because their body mind functioning and the person who is he has detached himself as in a car accident someone comes out on dust the car gets totaled it happens many times no so car is total but he is detached he is not it does not have nothing happened to him so this is the brahmanagani people they their body-mind functions like as in the past but their internal detachment and this renunciation gives them the identity in their self and not in the external so this verse explains that idea 22nd verse if you have any question please be sending this question so that we can end little early [Music] due to body identity they ho is utman that is the misconception so because of that misconception this body is i see external behavior because i am an embodied being i identify myself with my body and emotions and senses so i judge other person from the body level from the expression of the body level your anger your frustration what is expressed through or your body language so this is our normal way of understanding each other we say oh that person is very sweet because you see the expression of the body that person is so angry oh he's so bad how do you judge because you have your body identity from that body identity you judge another body's identity either you are not connected with the body you don't so anyway when you sleep and someone comes and he's a bad guy or good guy does it create any impression on me no my body mind is not recognizing that but when you recognize that and not look at your own self separate naturally from this our level we judge people it is natural because body mind identity so this is the idea due to the atma buddhi the id the feeling i am the body this is there lokaha ordinary people but jalaksanam external science iksati he beholds or sees the external behavior brahmagani does not if the mind is engaged there he does not see the external behavior he sees the eye what is inside ramakrishna anyone going he will not look at the external he looking through his eyes he sees what is inside so that is different but we are not therefore we our understanding about anything is the external whatever we find to our senses and our intellect or our mind we understand the object to be that but in reality it is all brahman no so antar bhava nawaii beda antar internal what is internally going on in someone that internal attitude no boy not to be one cannot understand from the science of the external not in a way how much of what we do so long we are body bound so long i think that i am this body-mind and complex so i will see other person in that level but the brahma-ganis because they are internally detached so they see externally but they see more of the internal nature rather than the external that's why they see god everywhere they see the in every religion this this sages of every sense they have their vision they see something more than the physical they see something spiritual embedded in them so ordinary people due to body identity see only the external science certainly the internal spirit is never to be understood from external science that's why he says that you have asked us the question that what is the nature of a brahmagani but by nature they are all different so what definitely i can tell you about is signs those who has given up their all superimposition and they have experienced the brahman nature then they are beyond all this distinction therefore you cannot see that atman who is the internal nature of the person by judging from the external nature that's why it is said no no no these eyes good chatter cannot be if you will not be able to understand through seeing the object by someone's statement what he's saying you cannot judge that person if he's a realized soul what is his internal attitude so this is that means they are not in the category of our understanding they are beyond so that is the major idea some question is coming okay we can end here this today after the verse number 22 and we'll start next time but in between next tuesday there will be sami chit brahmanando or mahadeva they will give the substitute by class i will be back here but only i'll be missing one class in between okay some questions now question is have all the ways and means of attaining enlightenment been discovered or there are still that are left to be discovered god is infinite to reach god paths are infinite yes there may be new path also you can if someone asks this question you want to reach the top of a mountain so all the tracks have been found out there may be another track but it is you can do but for our sake we need to follow the track which has been traded by others before don't experiment new tracks because you do not know the dangers in that journey but in known track in which through which the many people have traveled that's the path of the upanishads the path of the sages path of the patanjali meditation ideas so they have been followed from time immemorial and millions have traveled in this path those are genuine path and it is if it is followed perfectly it will really lead us to destination because it is tested and verified any again and again and again but we may find another path but you do not know how much hazardous is that journey what obstacle will come you do not know and if the obstacle can how you handle you do not know but you go to the patanjali you say i am meditating here is my problem they say okay this problem is inevitable you don't get discouraged badly stan these are the also laziness the health disease stano is just not non-focusing into the truth all these things are the obstacles in spiritual journey and patanjali describes oh you have this problem okay go this way i am atman i am i am the witness i am how many people have practiced that and if this is practice surely we will be able to reach the destination of course before practice we should also be very careful that we need the prerequisites everything has his preliminary basic qualifications without that qualification no one can move further without qualification someone goes into and takes a you can get suppose someone by cheating on this and that get a degree or certificate of a doctor a medical professional in some countries it happen you can bribe and get a certificate but what will happen to the patients he is not trained into the science and he has got a degree or superficially something so this that's a spiritual life should be followed in a tested and verified path but yes there may be new path you can decide ramakrishna said in calcutta there came a movement which is called the uh new dispensation by keshav saint and others there's a new what ramakrishna said these are good people are trying to mix little bit of the eastern idea western idea this that but ultimately what will remain ramakrishna's own word the path shown by the sages rishi their production of their path because that has been tested and verified in this journey you can go up to certain length and there comes a big obstacle who will guide you there i can create a new path no many people reading this book that book and that idea this idea yes you can do that but there is no guide who can help us if any problem comes to overcome so this is the way so yes it can be discovered but and maybe i made a new path but it is best to follow the path already there another question can the brahma gyanis also be considered siddhas yes siddha means it's in the two types of siddhas are there sydneys who are successful who have attained attainment siddhas yes final attainment is the knowledge of the brahmana you can say that brahmagan is the noah subbrahman knowers of the truth abraham they are siddhas because they are succeeded in attaining what is the highest but siddha also can give yoga siddha miraculous power you can attend to that by yogic practice also they also call siddhas but in which sense we are using the term that is the point here siddha means success the end of all success that is the knowing the brahman that can be taken as the idea ah so siddha and brahma gano you can say yes or if it is not that absolute knowledge is gained then we can that siddhi or success success of attending to any intermediary goal may also be termed as siddha but absolute siddhi absolute attainment is the propaganda that's the another question do all confusions rise from body mind identity yes all confusion so long i think of myself a body and so long i think of my body i am body bound and that is a bondage the who is birthday is mukta uh that is in uh some places they have discussed sankhara says but though he is body bound and mukhtar who is free from all identity the body but body here means we have three bodies this is the gross body our subtle body is our mind our emotions intellect that one and last causal body that is the ego body the last so so we live either now we are leading in the three bodies together here causal body ego is here and other subtle part as also physical god now when you go to sleep you discard this body you forget about the physical body which is this flesh and bone and this you live in the mental world so that is the subtle body and when you stop dreaming you don't die you remain there that is the body another body is called the causal body so three bodies so so long we have identification with this body of course i am bound soul when i am attached to my mind emotion understanding and intellectual understanding they are also i'm bound when that goes and when my ego is the last trace which separates us from our divine self is the ego so that's also body so three body binds us so spirituality is means getting out of the body consciousness getting out of the body consciousness body will remain but you are the worst witness of the body that is the witness analysis of the sakshi sakshi bichara that called saxi means the witness like a witness is who who only observes the situations he does not take part into anything in the courthouse we call witness and witness takes oath then i will not say anything which i have not experienced i only experienced what i saw as truthful statement i'll i am not involved into good or bad i am not going to judge anything but i will be the only so witness is that here i am the witness what my body is doing i have witness what my mind is doing i witness in meditation but my understanding right and wrong does afterwards i recognize and then say i did it i did it i did it i so these are the three levels and this is the level of range of maya or ignorance and going beyond one step down bus you are you are in the cell one question again one cannot identify a gany from external actions but it seems that there are certain things that one cannot do when there is no vasana so are there certain things again he won't and cannot ever do if you say he's a ganny he is a knower of truth ramakrishna said if you are a perfect dancer expert in dancing brahmagan means you have reached the culmination so you will not make a false step for a brahmagani there is nothing as such the persona the desire does not come question of desire is still there then you are not abraham organi but you see ramakrishna said i shall drink water i shall have some little dessert sweets i'll have jilabi i will have rasagulla but it is there that is his time to come into the world down with this desire but that is not their vasana we are trying to get out of our desires he is creating a desire to come pull the mind and enter into the realm of our ignorance so vasana if the desire is there if you find that there is some desire in someone's mind then you see there is not yet reached the goal holy mother said no even the the eye of the needle if you pass a thread but if it is if the thread is not tight it will not enter it so little will stop the knowledge therefore bashana is to be totally gone so that ganny won't and cannot it does not it does not apply for the gang is real garnish but if you have not reached so it may be it may be okay the identification with the body is so deep that it escapes awareness awareness and i thought i thought i miss ego thought identifies with it again and again other than being aware can one move above body consciousness yes one can move by constant practice sometimes suppose we are now thinking i'm i identify with the body really am i the body so with this analysis i can intellectually understand no no i cannot be the body because i remain the whole day and when i go to sleep i forget about this body and the world so i cannot be this body if i am the body i will be remaining in that consciousness 24 hours truth is eternal so i cannot beat the body and body goes then all the arguments come body changes every moment body can be killed it it has been born it can be in someone can come and stab and kill someone or it can with a gun shot this body can be destroyed so how can i be the body so when we get heavy injury i say my body is injured i go to hospital i say oh i didn't know they did the surgery to the body but i i was not in pain i was not there at all in the identified with the body so i cannot be the body so when the body identity goes away then you are you reach the goal but how can it come practice practice practice every day every moment i we have to say uh [Music] so this is to be repeated again and again i'm right the body manu i'm not the mind buddhi i'm not the intellect emotion or i'm the memory i'm not that donkaro ego i'm not that i'm not the five elements made which makes this body i'm not not bhumi not the art not the sky not the fire i am not all this i am i am of the nature of chit consciousness and ananda bliss so it is to be hammered and hammered and hammered day and night hari maharaja turiyan used to spend days and night all the time this analysis i am not the body i am in the body i am not the one i am in this temple but i am not the temple i believe in my room but i am not the room i live in the car but i am not the car so car is an engine and outside people see the car is driving the car this car is running fast the car does not run fast but someone is inside so he is not the car separate from car but identifies my car so this is the point is my body i am identifying but that a body is not me okay very good thank you all for such questions and we'll see you again tomorrow with the gospel class uh shivaprana our seva prana will give the class tomorrow at 7 30. okay thank you om shanti shanti shanti peace peace peace you
