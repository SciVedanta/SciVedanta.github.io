[57. Shanti Gita - Class 57 - Verse 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBcjJR5mngc)

[Music] [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face om peace peace peace be unto us all so we are on the chapter towards the end of the fifth chapter we have studied we are studying that part what happens to brahma ghani the dwarf of truth what happens so what happens to a person of illumination and how he walks moves etc that we know that is a question many times asked in all the scriptures bhagavad-gita says second chapter bhakti yoga how the bhakta perfected devotee how one lives like that so it is said that by grace of guru that in the param the supreme knowledge and then they become free from all bondage and being free from all mondays they don't come back into the world of birth and death that is the greatness of the knower of truth but they believe when they live in the world you cannot make a specific norm of their behavior pattern sometimes they may be having seen the tremendously renunciate their batty attitude their movement everything so sometimes we find that they are very much absorbed in the mood of the question means detached tremendous renunciation swami's found probability bishop he's engaged in summer in ghazdin apparently with the world they're eating sleeping like that tucked the booger some give up all enjoyment experience nira so they don't have any desire expectation in the world and some found even just contradictory his liberated soul sometimes engages himself into luxury and external wrong behaviors external apparently external is sadhu why he will go and enjoy good food good good good house good day so but they are not affected by that but that happens when they uh become realized but why it happens then why is hadoo or in realized soul who has fulfilled all his mission of life and enjoy the bliss of god why they will be engaged in again in the world eating sleeping luxuria sometimes they make a faint taco sometimes he's relenting on some bolster huh and one leg above the leg and somebody says what's up what talk why what are you doing why not like a child no but they apparently show that they're totally as if engrossed into the worldliness uh we find different types of behavior pattern for a brahmagani that's where the question came why it happens that is very important not for the brahmagani it happens for all of us brahmagan is after realization they are not touched by it their mind does not get touched their body functions but they are because they have identified themselves with the atman so their acknowledge burns away all other activities but the body runs in the previous pattern because it was in the momentum of that journey so that's why their behavior but main cause is their prayer of the karma very important point to understand that is the focus here so proud karma yoga because of karma association with the karma vivid vasana diverse types of wishes and desires and cravings he too journality it generates in the heart of a person though they are realized but proud of the momentum it's a very important thing to understand today is a bad news about 19 boys children in texas one eighteen years boy came and shoot at random and three their grade school went four uh 19 children or 17 children two adults to teacher and somebody died so so why why that child 18 years boy come with a gun and at random there's and what craziness it is what it is a prayer of the impulse of their why that tendency is coming to in chil this innocent children of that age group unbelievable in the history of america but probably this great event today so that and some people are crying some people are sympathizing some people are totally lost at seeing this situation no and some are happy and how this child can be 18 years old boy suddenly got this inspiration to do like that it is the prayer of the impulse what is the impulse behind impulse is his prada his karma which has given a direction in this life you have to understand the prayer of the karma again three types of karma one is kriyaman what i am doing now this khan what you do it has this instant impact and the boy is also killed interaction with the police to stop that and that that 18 years boy who was carrying the gun he is also killed anyhow so this interaction what is happening in the life kriyama know what i am doing now it has its immediate impact now and also it is creating a impression in my mind one impression that is the clear one but why i am doing this because i have passed karma's down and the resultant effect of the momentum resulting effect of all the karmas created a momentum and that momentum is this present life and this when it is going on in this journey the past push of the karmic effect is impacting this journey and there is a accumulated work which is in the minds layers and layers and layers of the substratum of the mind so many karmic impressions are there that's called sanchita sancho sense of accumulation accumulated karma that is the present action going on karma kriya mana and most importantly all our life's propensities are coming from the prayer of the karma last life or suppose someone is this life his whole life whatever karma he has done good bad we all mixture but the impact last thought coming out of that so many types of thoughts and ideas and last desire when you before die one thought comes to fulfill that thought this present life and this life is going on we do all these things and when you die the last thought what is predominant thought will give birth to the trajectory of the next life so this is the life and life goes on so we are bound by proud of the brahma-ganis also are directed by prarabdha because they have no other new impetus their karma bandhan has been cut asunder their old stock of karma has been destroyed by the knowledge itself power of knowledge so that's why this impression is given here karma yoga because of the karma association with the the karma of the the momentum of the past life is hetw is the cause which creates more desires in this life i am going again i say oh it is good it is it is good it that is nice all these connections are happening there is because of the prada though so one is trying to live in grandeur and luxury and enjoyment and another bogo hino another is totally detached there are many types of sadhus you see many types of bhaktas also the same those who are highly elevated but their natures are so different so this is very important point to understand we are also driven by our prayer but what to do all three are of course before knowledge we will have all three products of course and qiyoman we are doing some karma and that is generating some impression in my mind again and old stock already there old stock of infinite number of impressions uh hindus believe in 840 crores 840 million 840 millions of births you and me have gone through already my god look at the vast creation starting from microbe bacterias cells and they come to the animals plants and in the sea in the ground in the air and then human and human how many types of human being tribal people those who have no culture have not developed the modern culture etcetera education lack of education brutal people to that is all we are evolving evolving evolving evolving so all these impressions are hidden there that's why you find that sometimes people do so so beastly activity where that come from their parents are good they are culturally they are raised in a good family but it is the prayer of the karma which forces them and that's why we are to this is not for frustration to know but this is for inspiration to know that i can create my new direction what is going on i cannot just stop no the boy was randomly shooting what bullet is coming it is going and hitting someone you cannot stop that one triggered it goes like that so this life is going on we cannot do anything but i can do this is the potential uh a power in us that we can think now new that's why i say i am not the body not the mind the highest thought or i have any devotee of god or i am meditating on the divine so that i don't think of myself low so we can change that course strong thinking this this life will go on its suffering will come its joy will come its pain will come even for brahmagani but he or she will not be attached to that it will think the body is going to it that is the only benefit of it and that can be done here and now that is the most important inspiration behind this prayer to karma theory but it is not only people sometimes feel that it is fatalistic idea petal my fate what can i do i cannot change anything yes but i have created my fate if it is fetal who have created my fate we may blame half thousand people but no one does anything it is i have created my karma and my karma has brought me dear and i can change my karma by simply thinking it's brainwashing you go when people are using uh good people and giving into wrong direction so brainwash and vedanta also brainwashing in a positive direction because you are thinking i am the body i am the body they say this superstition can be removed by another counter thought the desire come and the tendency comes in the heart of people prohibit only with you whether you are involved into anything attached or you are detached nibrity withdrawn is the powerful thing behind so we read 32 this is the last verse [Music] experiences will be appear in your life as your life goes you don't expect that good praise from someone today you certainly don't expect someone will be blaming you unnecessarily so in your track of life you are going things will come they because they are of the karma because of the past karma impact but bhogo ganong both it will give the voga and also it will give the knowledge both enjoyment and knowledge they will be experienced in the body by some action that has started to effectively that's proud of the karma people that's why he will say oh yeah he's such a good man he has praise no no no he has praised because it is your karma and that person comes into the light and sees something same person will be hating you or doing something that means in life whatever coming don't pay attention you are traveling in a train and train is making a journey and on the both side of the your journey you will find that sometimes good trees good flowering garden or the ocean view or the mountain view is coming sometimes dry desert is going on you are passing to that sometimes you see good scenery bad scenery all these are because you cannot have any control over that because your trajectory is that so cause is prada therefore in the life it will be bhooga gyanam in this body bhugo will come experience of joy or suffering bogo means both both organum the knowledge knowledge of the things etc i will say oh i didn't know this for so many years i am chanting this i am reading i didn't know this that means why you are knowing now why not you know before you are chanting it it is proud to karma experienced by some actions proud of the defining the product some actions which started is that it started to practify to give the result in this plane of existence locate in this plane of existence the result of the actions from the past lives proud of them is the giver of experience of pleasure and pain so only proud of this because of your suffering and all your pain that's why vedante again and again says i have done it that's why i am passing through difficulties no with the speed how how strongly you throw or less you throw and the direction you are throwing so when it is out of your hand you have no control before that you have control that's why it is said that this light do meditate pray and so once someone is dying it is said please talk about god in his ears please chant some mantra so that the mind of the person will get boosting to think of god because he's done all life may be proud of the is last time he may forget so that is called the best help best help to a friend is that when one is passing away to give some boosting because mind becomes weak then mind cannot have a new hours to do now you can do i will do this now i will think this way you can force your mind but when the point of death whatever the impetus goes on so you can give a direction then help some friend at the point of death giving some direction as it were towards god so and prabhupada will end when mass into velocity will be zero then what will happen it will drop the stone will drop or the bullet will stop suppose someone shoot a bullet and there is no body they target it somewhere and there is nobody so the bullet will go when its momentum will be zero it will drop there so this body is the momentum of the past thoughts and actions it is going on it will just drop at the point in between it gives you the experiences all these gamut of experiences from birth till the death so that is the factor working behind not for ghani's no worse of truth but for you and me also and knowing this we should be work we should be careful how to utilize our actions and thoughts to create a new change in our thinking process because i will have to feel the consequence as i am feeling now the consequence of my past actions but i will have to feel the same for future can be changed by yeah you can change now you cannot change the course as you say the bullet is going in the middle you can say bullet don't go this side go little right side because it is not because already momentum is i cannot do what is happening in this life but i can detach from the incident i can keep my mental peace and dignity it is happening of because of the body and mind is working because of the past life momentum i can i will be detached from it that you can do we can do and there you your suffering goes away of course we are all here today because in our lives track so you are here i am here maybe you know yesterday it was not i was with somebody we think that we are meeting this way that trajectory is taking you to that point your how your mind is moving towards the uh spiritual truth or it is going towards it so it's our effort if what effort so it is happening because of the past that is if you believe the karma theory there may be other theory not that it is the everyone will have to accept this theory but swamiji said perhaps this is the best idea logical logically it satisfied our mind that is karma but you may if you find some other explanation that's also okay vedanta says okay but so far so it is logical most uh logical explanation every action has equal and opposite reaction no yeah so newton's third law of motion so these are scientific yeah so in in in this in the spiritual realm or in our journey of life it is also the same you hit the table that much force you get the heat back so you do this and you get this you go you have you avoid this then you this uh you have this experience so now now 33 verse letters chant ganata [Music] he's giving an example in the potters early days the potters used to create some pots clay pots so they even now some places you can find in in india we can find in some villages potters are making pots so there is a wheel and they take a chunk of very well smashed clay and then it gives a turn to the wheel and it rotates and then the potter starts working on the clay and putting like hand like that and this that or even suppose after that you don't do anything but the rotation continues so long they start they give a rotation and after taking away the hand is no impetus but the it is rotation is continuing similarly proud of though though impetus is no more after knowledge the ghani their actions and reactions are seen almost like as it was before that means he sleeps he eats he talks maybe his inner inner eye we call the third eye that gives a different view of the world as we see they see but they see something more and so that's why it says prarabdham the proud the result of the past lives action laksha sampani when the goal is reached got over when the goal is dismissed when the power of the it reaches its end no ghotobat like arden picture gano the knowledge janmata the remaining distance you have attained the knowledge in between but the rotation continues yes so the what is done um the the plate is done or the jar is done and then they cut it took out a jar is done and then they cut it took out of that but the rotation continues till it becomes zero so similarly the body will continue till they get it some panni when the picture is created chakra of the wheel begawa as the speed so it says even after a picture is made picture is made purpose of the thing is done so you are in a important wheel picture is made that he has done this picture and and he has even sometimes when that they take out the pit that picture and poem and put it some place to bake it but but the wheel continues till it becomes zero so similarly even after a picture is made the speed of the wheel continues for a while until the force that has started the wheel is exhausted likewise until the residue of past life's action sesha like their residue the past lives action are fully exhausted the activities of life continues after the goal is reached due to the dawn of knowledge due to dawn of knowledge a brahmagani a noaa of truth a jeevan mukhtar their habit of eating sleeping interacting sometimes they become angry sometimes they are pleased we find even you look at the ramakrishna's disciples their day-to-day dealing with the world swamiji sometimes vivekananda is getting sometimes angry yeah actually they don't get angry for perfection of something they scold somebody any why sadhu will be scolding while she'll be angry normally that is our question he should be controlled he should have control no it is a prarabdha and action and reaction will continue but internally they have no impression in the mind but we have our impression if if you do something to someone you will remember it whole life and take revenge if possible if they cannot forget that's why many people say are i forget and forgive people cannot forget and forgive but a brahman they call it is like a the anger of a holy man sadhu rag is jolly dog is like a mark you make with a water take dip your finger in the water and make a mark you see the water but it is no water because it will dry up immediately but ours is ink or it's a paint heavy paint uh you have to rub and then it will go so that's why the difference between what is the difference between a brahmagani and an ordinary person is this they will also be angry they also will sleep they also will say good food there is one swami he is very fond of perfect things anyone does something which is not perfect he will scold he will do some and but but he's internally he's free that's the point brahma ghana has given him yes but why is angry proud of them because the body functioning with the senses senses functioning with the object sense object suppose simple formula suppose someone throws some paper what you call the chili in the eyes because it is a brambhargani his eyes will not burn every eye is eyes eye it's a physical thing it's physical thing no and mind also he may be shouting and angry and simi those will be mental actions no but but he has internally known i am neither the body neither the mind but these reactions are happening because of the prague this is the only main theme of this understanding so even after a picture is made with the example of the wheel the speed of the wheel continues for a while until the force that had started the wheel is exhausted likewise until the residue of the past life sections are fully exhausted like the residue of the past life's action the action which is taken in the last moment of leaving the body that is exhausted fully exhausted the activities of life will continue even after the goal is reached due to the dawn of knowledge okay got it so this is 33rd verse we have 34 now get ready for your questions we are 36th verse we'll make this chapter end fifth chapter of course six and seven are there another two chapters [Music] [Music] means the result of the past life's actions huh be to some not for us but in no worse of truth those who are attained the wisdom for this type of people oh part or you know he's talking krishna is talking to arjuna saying oh arjuna for the man of wisdom for the men or women of wisdom proud proud the result of the past life's actions ganotharam after the knowledge has been done afterwards before knowledge as we are that's also driven by prague but after knowledge gano uttaram after the attainment of knowledge bishop is totally false or vain or useless kartung to do not utisyam oh it is nothing it is nothing one that can cheat a little that proud of them result of the past life's actions ganynam for the truth they can endure they are competent they are adequate that means what happens oh to the wise person after they attain the knowledge the result of past life's action are useless for them it is happening suppose it is like that it's my house another house there is some fire i can sympathize oh ho the house is in fire no but i am not involved into it so mentally they i disidentify and actions going on they see and observe and past numbers sometimes become very upset sometimes you become very happy so to the wise person when after they attain the knowledge of the self the result of the past life's actions appear to be vain meaningless worthless is that okay happening happening sriracha is having to be severe throat cancer and syria i'm going to say oh it is so much pain and harimana said no sir you have no pain and shira i'm going to know who the rascal has caught me that means the young person really has the pain but when his body keeps to the body naturally your body pain but he has the power to just lift the mind from here body is pain but he is not feeling the pain because he can shift the mind from there with the example many times we gave it here hori mara savitudian having his carbuncle on the back and so to operate on that doctor said that is serious operation long pure long time it will take so they need to put anesthesia but hariman is sweeney turiyan on the swami yeah this is the power of the karma bringing carb carbuncle in the body of horimone no and proud of the karma the doctors will have to operate and when the doctors are approached dr said then what to do well oh you did not have to do any use any chloroform anaesthesia sorry anastasia so you need not have to do anything you go on opportunity only tell me when you want to do so the doctors in schedule their operation and came and did the operation it took long time five or four carbuncles were in the back no and afterwards they finished their job and went away and he came back and it's done yes and he didn't say any single word he didn't express a little pain or little expression of anything the doctors thought that it is yogis they are yogis they can do miracle it is a miracle it is neither miracle it is neither anything it is the withdrawing the mind they have the capacity to keep the mind in god keep the mind in the atmosphere so withdrawing from the body so even we ordinary people what happens when you go to austin doctors and in the hospital and when they do a big surgery what they do they put anesthesia and sociologists stand there all the time no to adjust this amount quantity no do anyone feel any pain when the operation rigorous operation is going on why because their mind has been made not to be awake if that can medically be done a spiritual person with full control over the mind he can do that so the bodily pain body will understand that's why huri marriage is better statement was beautiful statement to me you live in joy oh my mind they ho this body and is suffering let them manage it you can enjoy and he enjoyed harimanas in the entire experience he was not here but he was peaceful because he was his mind was totally he could shift the mind to god consciousness no and vedantic understanding about the truth and then next year another day when the doctors came and they wanted to really cut the stitch or do something like that without telling him they are touching and then started probably doing something little knife has been touched only and he cried out see is it ready the doctors got puzzled the other day we did rigorous operation and he withstood everything without any murmur without any reaction without anything and now we didn't do anything but just to touch a tremendous operation versus cutting a stitch what is that that but he said then harimura said that oh what has happened you know that day you gave me the time to withdraw the mind but today my mind was in the body so when you test it that is this natural reaction so this is the point that prarabdha will have is aj and the wise after attainment of the knowledge when they attain the knowledge only this internal transformation happens and the result of the past life's actions are then meaningless to them it's vain are totally false for them it is it is no i am not identified with it it is just happening somewhere else actions of the past lives are not sufficient to do any wonder for the knowers of truth our all our life is always we are wondering why in my life this happened why i was a good mom and i never did anything wrong to anyone see how i am getting ostracized but why they the universe of truth for the past lifetime is sufficient to do any wonder whatever happiness it brings or suffering it brings the noir of truth does not feel astonished how why it is body mind action body is interacting with the body mind is interacting with the mind what is my business i am not the body not the mind knowledge [Music] you can have it suppose people need children you will find that really the child has had a very great he fell down and have a very bad pain no and mom and others what they do they divert the attention of the baby with a something look at and suddenly for a second and some thoughts they confusing they [Music] and forget their cry pain is there it is a science where is our mind there is our pain say not even your body the mom will feel much bad if the baby suppose indeed this to this story how many mothers are crying and weeping would be able to eat today because of the seeing the son or the daughter of that four five six years boy and boys or girls no so for us we are eating we got the message our mind is not that much affected it's just for the news i know it is somebody's i am someone separate but brahman is will feel it is mine that's why the the shed tears in sympathy or or the withdrawal it is it is the world's affair it is a it is nothing happening in the reality ultimately no one kills anyone no one dies anything that means they either to stand they live in either of these stands so tell you to the wise after attainment of knowledge the results of the past life's actions are totally false or meaningless actions of the past life are not sufficient to do any wonder for the noise of truth because it does not create any astonishing impact on the mind of when it is the body mind will do it will function in its own way so i have nothing to do with it [Music] s the power which has started this body the impetus of this body giving all the bhoga experience of pleasure and pain to this life is dehynam the des gano tarambhugum they will give the bhuga the suffering or pleasure and pain after the knowledge also because they who are awesome they have no real identity with the body but as if they have a body they have abhasa avast means as if it is a reflection real eye reflected eye real sun reflect itself they see as if i have a body so that trace of ignorance remains when they work in the field when they are in samadhi there is nothing but when they come down they will have to leave with a little ego so the 35 verse says that initiating power which initiates this prayer of the which constitutes the body suppose my body your body has been started there is an initiate initiating force power that we are all already we are talking that's named as prarabdha so the body for giving worldly experiences to embodied beings no that impetus that the primary force which gave birth to this body is the is bringing all the worldly experiences in this life now after attainment of knowledge and after granting the semblance of a body it initiating power gives him the experience of the pleasurable pain again after even then realize that they have a semblance of this body they think it's not me totally like us it says yes sometimes they feel i am suffering i am hungry ramakrishna also said i am hungry huh christ said oh lord what we have why have you forsaken me in the point of pain in the when the body identified with the body that type of statement comes but they are internally next they are saying god forbid forgive them but they do not know what they are doing no so he's standing with a blessing for them so this is the prayer of the karma and its impact 36 so this bhuga this experience of pleasure or pain suffering or joy what is happening in this body but this body is not real it is a reflected body abhasal like you see in the mirror your reflection real person is here but reflection so this is a reflection in maya it appears that you are a human body or you are a man or woman so ava in the body in the worldly experience happens only the body that appears in semblance body that means in the semblance of the body this body which is true for us for again it is just an appearance so all these worldly experiences of happiness or pleasure or pain or praise or blame what is happening we are connected with this body which is not real it is a reflected body reflected light reflected self that's a small self big self reflected becomes small self fabricated by the actions of the past life how it is fabricated in this life again again they're bringing the idea it is the past life's action that prayer of the but the knower of truth in the state of knowledge becomes liberated and remains free from worldly experiences experiences that means but the knower of truth it is when they know the truth or brahmaganis the state of knowledge becomes liberated when they get into the state of that knowledge who am i when that knowledge comes they becomes liberated from this body identity and remains free from all worldly experiences that's why in the samadhi state nothing happens to that person or because that person is gone only what remains that is the truth supreme truth remains so uh then the worldly experience will be happen in the abhas that means this body that is only an appearance fabricated how it has been fabricated how it is created by the past life's impetus action but if you know the truth knower of the truth mukhto ganu dasayan to those who have liberated in the when you are liberated in a gyanodosa that is in a state of knowledge when one is established in that knowledge tattago the knower of truth that truth will have no touch of any enjoyment or suffering or pleasure or pain because he is not in the body body is like a dead body remains and he is dwelling identified with the divine consciousness so therefore it here ends the fourth chapter or fifth chapter of shanti gita a conversation between vasudeva krishna and arjuna in the scripture of yoga of spiritual science so here ends the chapter 5. so you can next day please come ready with your questions so we can do one thing we can recapitulate the entire chapter that may be one way so that our reading will be much deeper because we will go to the next chapter sixth chapter next but before that we can just recapitulate what we have read the entire fifth chapter of course if you have any question we'll be also addressing that so even in the lives of avatars it is in play the circle of brahma circle it is in play the circle of prayer of the butcher and gets exhausted finally will the circle begin for them ever again [Music] he's talking about not for ordinary people but the incarnations like christ buddha rama krishna it's play in the circle of prayer don't know they have no problem though we have to understand we are have some desires and for fulfilling those desires we do work and we do work we gain some result then we add an work we gain some result then we add another karma and another desire but god when comes down he's called abu tara he's already here he does not need anything so he is not subject to praarabh though we cannot use the term prarabdha for god he out of his own volition he comes down okay [Music] by his own maya controlling his own maya so by his own will force he comes down to serve the humanity so we cannot put the category of avatars in the same category oh i have not finished that in my class let me finish the class otherwise it will be a question answer will be mixed with you so tomorrow will be gospel class by shiva prana prabradhika seva pranam okay now let us go to the question so what is saying the avatars though they are seen to live in the flesh and bone like us they are not in the category of prayer because he has no karma god has no karma gita says that i have no karma but still i engage in karma to show to the world then that you are to do karma by karma only you can cut your bad cornrows you can give a direction to your new life so that's why so we cannot put but they come for the good of humanity they they by their own volition take one desire i shall do good to the world that's why they come or just read in the other book bhagavat but for the compassion seeing the suffering of everyone they feel oh my god my children are suffering so much so he comes down out of compassion another question is it necessary to bear insult and injury to progress in spiritual life i would say you need not have to bear with insult and injury if it should not be weak point because you are spiritual you should not be doormat because that is also lack of self-esteem but if you cannot do anything higher attitude will be there right yes you can you can ignore as a injury progress indeed beer beer is a very strong one no it is not bearing i have the power to fight out but i am not doing it that is called power real power someone does something ramakrishna even said that the hiss don't bite because otherwise people will take so long you live we live in the body good people they are subject to such vulnerable to such situations when they get insulted they get [Music] something test himself he just went to the market he that's why you don't pay attention to that even beating you know they're fools they're not right again it is who is feeding me milk the same person so they are attained to experience only tortured cannot be spiritual that that is not spiritual it's just strength actually it is the strength of detachment so these two what people and then someone with much personal care when he came back to the senses someone is asking has beaten you this way and the sadhu responded who is feeding milk now to bring like our constant awareness he has beaten me then we seen his knowledge [Music] in this spirit of knowledge anything other than the same reality so i said no there is one brahmani was going and they're in their trains and he's bleeding here and the brahman ghani he's smiling as if some pound is a such a serious the children are throwing stone and he's hit here and there and blood oozing and he got hurt but he's singing what the children are doing as if it's a fun how that can be done that is called the saharan sarbada karna that's a state it is to be practiced though but practice that you are to know that i can give a fight but i won't do i will tolerate but tolerate no i'll accept it okay god's doing but it's a sometimes weakness is comes yeah so those are mentally developed spiritually developed people that is that is they can someone can do harm to them but they do the good things to them but for ordinary people this you should not allow that so that then the world will crush you down you will do that that's why in english we say a doormat no they want to push you you are working in your workplace and someone is mistreating you unnecessarily you should have to protest no this is not right internally you can think okay i am peaceful there but externally you will have to shout howl or take action so that is the swami people cannot teach us that way spirituality is for the stronger people so these two questions so we are done with the questions then so thank you all jaima jaima mother bless us all um peace
