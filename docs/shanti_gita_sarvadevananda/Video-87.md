[82. Shanti Gita - Class 82 - chapter 7- verse 33 -38 - Swami Sarvadevananda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNZllY0x1nk)

it's in the description section of the past class with us um foreign [Music] oh Lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and never shine in our hearts with your resplendent face oh peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to the study of santigita and we have read that to verse number 33 of the seventh chapter last chapter 32 33 anyhow and now we will start from 34 today but anyway we go back a little bit to recapitulate so we are reading that what happens after one have the experience of the self so it says and verse number 31 we have read that at that point of time they don't see anything of the material world as we see this objects of the name and form and this changing nature of the thing they don't see anything as such their shines sakshi next next match their shine sport the witness consciousness that who is observing everything that only shines all the objective Universe of name and form which we are seeing now it dissolves it disappears sakshi shayam and that sakshi um I am that witness Consciousness I am no more this no more this and all this has disappeared vanished what remains that Consciousness has witnessed Consciousness and then that way I am that in this way it's science forth in the army balam in the inner core of the heart that realizes shine sport and next 32 we read that as soon as Association there is no more association with the world of Duality world of this Maya so it has been renounced totally then what remains ayam that Kevin herself loneliness allliness nature of me and that is I am that That Was Then you think God is there Brahman is there Brahman not there these are the all the Dharma the nature characteristic of our intellect Buddhism in the Atman dissolve everything give up everything or dissolve everything in the Buddha Dharma and also he read this 33rd verse me so 33 verses totally renouncing having totally renounced the condition of aham I I um this gross eye turn to the witness consciousness even say witness Consciousness you say it is witness Consciousness that means there is somebody witnessing something else the tree is completely who may remain there that ego also can give up in all possible ways and all possible mood I am that then that way it will be revealing or it will be existing giving up a hung idea I idea be only you be that cable means only means be only Who You Are be only that you are that means lower stage of reality is this this is not true God is true objective universities change food it is not permanent it is not Brahman Brahman is something else this is The Duality we are working in The Duality and if everything converge into that everything is I am the witness Consciousness these are all objective universe and after ultimately meditating on that and contemplating on that day and day and day in and day out the concept will come a point of revelation will come when this whole name and formed a duality will dissolve then we may say that I am even I I am that weakness concentrace of the sense of highness remains and when the tooth highness is totally dissolved then remains that that which is your own self-cable onlyness only that you cannot say what is it or that having totally announced the ego identity forever completely in all possible modes and having let go of the idea that I am and I Manifest this idea I am I Manifest this even those concepts are all denounced B then kevala means everything in this world is compounded no except be uncompounded everything is a mixture of this no panchavuta gross from subtle form whatever but do you go to that uncompounded form this is how to describe Brahman keval of his onlyness and in another language you can say cable or uncompounded that means who are you only if that is the only thing last remain now today we go to reverse number 34. foreign foreign [Music] foreign you are in there with your eyes open at that State of experience eyes is open or you are having as deep as you are awake but as if a person in the state of deep sleep you will be remaining in that mood as if your eyes are open you are saying the universe but not you are not seeing the universe like in the Deep Sleep what remains Joy remains or every day when you go to deep sleep everyone finds joy why that is the place Joy you are almost going to touch but there is a layer of ignorance that does not allow us to see the truth and one when practices spiritual discipline and moves in this direction with mind fully awake they penetrate this very last Veil and they see the light face to face so every day we go to deep sleep and come back the same old guy but if you consciously move by meditation or identification or analytical path and reach that point of susupti then that Veil which was coming because you are consciously moving here successful in moving that one then what will happen you will see that fail is not there and you see the light face to face that is called the samadhi state or absorption state of absorption or cable or state so he is he says when you are you are being in the waking State this weekend as if you're waking your ramakrishna walking with eyes open jagrat most of the time they're in wrong brahmananda you see the photograph like that he's looking but he's pulled in ramakrishna said to him a master oh could you bring could you bring some money picture or painting for me what is that I want to see that the bird is sitting on a an egg and to hashtag you know he's looking outside but his whose mind is always on the egg this is the condition eyes open but they don't see the way we see their own mind is withdrawn into that Consciousness so jagrati as if you are in that deep sleep state of consciousness foreign there is no Dharma there is no characteristics of the waking state we interact now this world is so real but in that state of realization what will happen he will be in the world ramakrishna in the world but he didn't live in this world with ours he lived in the in another level of Consciousness all the time foreign he is acting behaving living as it were with us in the jagrut in the waking State experiences he's talking about something but his whole mind is set withdrawn it is the Dharma the characteristics in our jagrat place in a waking State what our body mind emotion functions his body mind is there but he's not functioning in that level it is in another level says very important Point Dharma means our anger our thirst our hunger or all these things are we are so much burdened with them but in that state he'll be there in the jagrat and he will be like us eating sleeping as it were the only the body eats they know it is not he is not eating it's fully separated hunger as your Dharma of thirst they may appear to be like that but it is only connected with the body body is doing bodies function but they are totally off from that is this best example is the hatching the bird and then hatching the egg you know that bird and actually you must almost say brought one and that will find in the Bengali gospel cover this to give them in the gospel inside you can find that photograph foreign and he was doing like that and hable dropped and his hand no and he he was in the world he was Hubble bubble if you smoke the rod you are holding and puffing but one puff Pro one understand he said he will be one path and how long it goes and he's here he's not here we sometimes say he is absent-minded we are absent-minded that is that that idea if we know absent minded it is possible they live in that Consciousness absent-minded means what is happening here you are not connected your mind is somewhere else you are corrected at that side so here for this type of realized Soul their mind is in the cable on the home Moon self-evalent ex reality no and that is full of bliss that's why they are sometimes that says continuously staying in that Iran he got the message from mother you stay in bhaba mukha in that state where you will be in the world almost merging into samadhi but not dropped it so that's a very only great Souls can live at that point other ordinary Souls we sucked into that Joy is such a tremendous way a black hole as it went and sucking foreign [Music] state is also get destroyed Dharma that the Dharma of the sushupti state gets destroyed that is also wiped out to to rment to organize it that that's the trace of last race of organic chaitanya sayam then after that when I also get lost in the state of last race of ego very difficult for us to understand that final state of and uh ego gone then they go into the witness Consciousness and that weakness consciousness two absolute margin into nirvikalpa they are final layers they are talking about those last stress and then that gets totally destroyed to to again a having fallen into a deep sleep like State even while awake one is completely free from characteristics of the waking state when ignorance which is the characteristics of state of Deep Sleep decays one remains in one's own Consciousness alone so when we fall asleep in a sleep-like state even while awake one is completely free from the characteristics of the waking State waking state things are happening but that person is not involved into it so when the ignorance such you reach that level of perfection and go back to that susukti state ignite where the ignorance is the only last barrier which is the characteristic of the Deep Sleep state every day we can go up to Deep Sleep state but yogis can penetrate that and go to the samadhi state so the decays one remains in one's own Consciousness alone that is the goal of human life to reach that state Dharma means actions associated with the sense organs Our Eyes Ears Nose hand feet while functioning through the gross body and susupti Dharma what is the nature of the deep sleep that is the ignorance understand that every day when you go to sleep deep sleep nose dream in which state what is there you see I do not know anything see that is that is the expression we all give oh what happened I did not know last night it rained I didn't know I was fast asleep so the Sleep condition what remains with you sachidananda remains all the time now is there Universal dream is also there sleep is also there Beyond sleep is there that cannot go anywhere no but what happens here the susukti avasta and that state of deep sleep what remains is only your ignorance how do you say yeah I know that I have ignorance everyone says what you say I was I had to go to sleep last night you know and but I do not know when you called me the phone rang but I could not receive it I was fast asleep deepest see our own expression gives the validity of the thing what is happening I was there as Consciousness but I was not knowing anything so I was not aware of so only the ignorance is the last very good this very Clarity of Mind should be there here what is in that deep sleep state there we say ignorance or the last stress of ego I well [Music] and now we are at five we are five clothings over the cell one t-shirt one jacket one one shot one jacket one blanket one cloth and one blanket pipe no just to fight this is this is the big blanket where everyone can see it they attaches that now go subtle this is the annamaya and now next in US case is another this Charter that is the pranama then then is the goes inside one another layer that's mind Mano Mayo then goes another internal that is called buddhi intellect covering then goes another that is called the anandamayam does this last layer and you can take out that then what remains you remain you nothing else that is the analytical path in waking State we have all these five coverings we are a bundle of that's why we cannot we cannot enjoy anything uh it's called can one run with some easy blanket covering in the body with layers and layers of things and then calling another blanket so in that's why we are slow in the material world for having Joy having fun having anything you know now throw away the blanket outside blanket so we throw away this outside blanket only one blanket blanket of physical identity I am this place Moon Etc but in the dream you remain four other clothings you are wearing foreign and of course the subtle five elements also function that's why not the gross gross is gone gross blanket to throw away we throw away every day one blanket or the other blanket but in meditation if we can practice throwing the blanket every day consciously that's called spiritual sadhana I am not devoting first blanket throwing is very difficult because we are in this level of blanket and we see this it is nice so it is good it is old it is Young it is this it is that and a Pity to itself policy it and sign it how much we try to keep them and then only you shed one hmm then you go into the dream state so the in dream state you see all the four are there pranamaya because and now in sleep you go into deep sleep you give up another blanket all the three blankets you don't know that you are breathing your energy body you do not know you have your mind you do not know you have any intellect you remain in the moral cover last covering that is called the ignorance is actually ignorance because that is the starting point of this entire universe absolute coming into the real reality of this so there is only ego that's why swamiji sang the song [Music] [Music] foreign [Laughter] [Music] last race in the ego body or in a deep sleep state and comparing with deep sleep state I am there and that equal is the veil covering that this side with the infinite side last stress very thin layer and I I that flow of ego idea also dissolve then what remains everything boy it went into fight here is the buddhistic idea because next step it is not should know there is something which should only be experienced which is beyond mind Beyond intellect [Music] speech cannot reach there my mind cannot reach there mind is already gone how my mind mind is dropped in the body in the subtle body it is beyond the cane of this mind to perfume or the intellectual fathom that's why here is the uniqueness of vedanta that it is not void who says is this void there should be somebody you see there is nothing but are you not there to say there is nothing that that is the truth you know if the experience you know by which Consciousness you experience who can destroy that with that Consciousness everything is realized so you cannot do have anything to say that is the night one who can experience they can only understand nothing remains there but we can understand that there is something because these are the experience when they come down they say oh what a joy what a joy no ramakrishna's story three or four friends who are going and then found that there is a big fun and laughter is coming out from the other side with the wall then he said one four friends they said okay why not you go one of my friend and they made what is called that one over the world over foreign so they went there and the friend saw that laughter and joy and dropped on the other side and then nobody can come back from that experience but does not mean there is no joy so much joy one cannot contain and that ego entire personality dropped to the other side of the consciousness and now second also in third and one turned back and they thought wow what a joy going on see experience and then come back and tell us on the other side of the world you should have to be standing on this side of the world if you just drop on the other side who will say what but ordinary jivan muktas they drop on the side and come back whether those who are they get to touch get a touch of that and then come back but ramakrishna can stay there for six months and then come back again you never never hear in the history that someone has done that but God can do everything no it's to stay that right so we may major thing is state in the susupti nature if you want to clarify yourself what remains in your deep sleep state only ignorance and Beyond is the infinite Joy and you cannot know anything because that ignorance is barring that because mind is already slept if the mind was awake here mind was conscious that's why we meditate we go to sleep but instead of going to sleep if one can keep the Mind awake and focus to a go go go go go then they will be seeing that light and more light and more light no and that will drag them to their light Eternal Light so this is not Darkness there is no Darkness right foreign State decays he lives in the consciousness of Brahman alone though his physical and mental activities continue with the chakra Dharma very beautiful this point is very beautiful some people will think what is the use of this so much sadhana to reach that state of Brahman Consciousness no I'll be like dead most of the people say what is the use I'll be dead I'll not be there yes you will be dead but your physical activity will continue and you will be merged into you know 90 percent of the mind is sucked in there with the 10 percent of mind this day-to-day function eating sleeping talking to people huh embodied State like in terms of these are the uh deeply dreaming holidays but what is the state after death death after death in the subtle body we go to the sexual body foreign causal body also is there as I said now we have three bodies all together plus Brahman now we go to dream then one body the external vote combo The Itchy blanket you drop I disidentify then remains Manu Mayo began in the dream when body One Trust migration these two body goes out of the because physical body remains here a subtle body and the causal body those two subtle body means without causal body subtle body can stay everywhere but one drop two will go in the subtle body and then enter into another physical body and then I start again New Journey from there and but when one realization comes they live in the last layer of a Consciousness that's the ego body and that ego body or Ananda why it is foreign immense immense Joy so that's why it is but in that covering is little touch of that that's a ramugan is it I don't want to be sugar I have to taste the sugar so it's don't make me unconsciousness says I will live in this rush and boss boss means control because self-control but I will go and come swamiji ramakrishna one day asked nurem Suppose there is a bowl full of funny and you are a bee one one of the bees one bee so how shall we eat them honey he said I'll be sitting on the edge and sucking the mom honey then he said why not you go and in the middle then he said I'll die then ramadhana said no no it is the ocean of consciousness no one dies there that is the eternal life but still if it is relatively if you want to understand to enjoy the honey and then you are true sit on the edge and push your mouth and enjoy it so this realization in the susruti state is the state of enjoyment is it that's why it is called the greatest place of joy and that is is the ignorance is the state characteristic of the Deep Sleep state when State decays then when that deep sleep State also goes away then a person lives in the consciousness of Brahman alone because that b merges into the ocean going to got caught into the Trap of the honey and then it becomes a part of the honey sometimes honey sellers sell that they be together is it not the bee is embedded into the honey so the soul gets merged into their own nature do his physical and mental activities continue we think that it is death it is not death it is a state of joy no one can experience that much joy in any phase of light but after samadhi that's why Swami brahmananda said the doctor needs the spiritual Life Starts after nearby huh I know we don't understand these things but you after nirviki your spiritual Life Starts whatever what are you doing now because that is the real spiritual life means you really enjoy what is spiritual life we don't enjoy we are struggling with our mind and fighting and every day complaining I see it my mind does not cooperate oh my God I am so miserable but after that experience of that last veil of ignorance that is the consciously moving every day into that ground of reality Consciousness then if the lip bail is lifted our God then that is the state of Blissful ever Blissful state and it no one can ever once they got it it will never go that's why he said in the bhagavad-gita 11 chapter then the in the sky if thousands and millions of sun Devi surjo uh says if at a time in the sky the thousands of sons come at a time and you have the capacity to see that brightness and brilliance will you forget in your whole life that brilliance so he's giving an example that type of experience come which Unforgettable when you come back into the body mind again mind the trace remains so tangible it supersedes all other experiences what is my time 24 hours it goes away you don't do meditation and prayer no if you do meditation and prayer then what is huh it will be one part of the mind if you apply one part of the Mind in the work there will be no such work to be finished it can be done in tries so anyhow so they live in the body but at the same time their mental physical activities continue but they remain the consciousness of Brahman alone the Beautiful these are called Eternal message of our vedanta okay now 35 foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] beautiful now again in the susuthi state if you go to the Deep Sleep State and they Organo the veil which was just the last separation point if if you can organ if you can give away you can drive away with that ignorance or ignorance you can get out of the ignorance foreign there is one existence which is beyond all existence existence it is not like this existence this table exists on this Earth huh having disregarding the ignorant state of Deep Sleep attending the nature that is bereft of early characteristics you cannot characterize there anymore beyond all characterization it's very difficult to translate the word bhava that's why Bengali translation is easy they say Baba English is Baba he says it is Bengali is also bhava in Hindi or superb wow so but in English the power as it if you penetrated in the meaning of the Bible it is very in a vast dimension of meaning is there so you remain in a Bible which is you remain in a Bible in a mental state or in a state which is bereft of any characterization you cannot characterize characterization is possible for limited thing you can you can Define it you can characterize it but for infinite what characterization you will give there so so therefore What You Do by your own wisdom analytical path this book already taught us how to do that by your own wisdom pragma program is wisdom knowledge knowing your own nature what is the honor of nature beyond the ignorance that which Remains the witness which you are saying witness Consciousness is what witness Consciousness is the infinite Brahman added with the witness idea of I it is mixed with if your eye drops what remains That Remains wa by your wisdom you know this swarupa your own divine nature and what is that nature program even very wise man even you have known you are in order of Truth get out those ideas of knowing and know art and all this thing you become Who You Are so having disregarded the ignorant state of deep sleep attaining the nature that is bereaved of any characteristics and having known your own Nature by spiritual wisdom be the one beyond the wisdom thereafter even wisdom wisdom is a word wisdom means you are a knowledgeable person you go beyond that means there is no word can describe that go to that state go to that state where you will be identifying with that real nature and this understanding who is understanding with what tool he is understanding all will dissolve there 36. foreign [Music] [Music] there is no sound we say this is the creation level but when you go beyond the creation to your Divine self what is the sound of no hearing no hear is there to hear the sound neither the sound is there neither the organ of hearing is there foreign there's no name and form no darshano I see that seeing there is no form there is nobody to see now the object neither the subject nothing is there narupam darshanam Tata [Music] it is there oh it is not there no weak into this type of idea is not there then what is there you are talking about Brahman Atman and at the same time it is there is no object to see neither the eyes are there no object of sound and no year is there what is that foreign it is there I cannot say anything it is there that's why it's called sachidan sachidananda they say to just we people don't understand anything just to give an idea that's why they talk but there cannot be you cannot use any word any word will disturb if anyone will defile the characteristic what Brahman is therefore there is nothing else so 36 verse says there is neither hearing of sound nor seeing of any form there is certainly neither existence nor non-existence there is nothing else but the true reality or existence only now how can he do all this again the last conclusive verse two verses 37 verse [Music] [Music] [Music] he can understand this not by this brain which understands money subject of the world all these this the materialistic thing this would they will not go there yeah you cannot take a a what you call Chopper to have not what you call nerve surgery neurosurgeons you've given neurosurgeon one Chopper but you cut and do that do the surgery to me ah that that weapon does not work there fine finest things are necessary that buddhi is not this buddhi it's a Buddha should be very pure buddhi thakur said pure buddhi and that for for spiritual life is for getting pure buddhi only spiritual life is forgetting only pure mind all sadhana is only to get my mind buddhi which is dark unclear to be clear and bright so susma is fine and yet they are using the word finer than the finest that type of extraordinary Buddha buddhya sarupam sastra caitanam yes to alternate reading are there your own nature and swasta you be established in that that consciousness and Buddha by your intelligence pure intelligence let your buddhi dissolve into that Ganon in that knowledge itself the tool which was trying to understand the truth in the pure State the truth ultimately should get dissolved and takus example the salt doll was trying to measure the ocean and it's all normal and think now SAR doll is trying to measure the ocean and as it measures suppose it is dipped into the ocean as much is dipped molten God what it becomes it becomes the ocean so the measuring instrument is the buddhi buddhi purified buddhi and with that buddhi you try to measure the Brahman Atman these that all this big thing no and could a point will come that enter tool gets dissolved into it remains who will say what buddhi what month but when they come back we can talk about by the knowledge it is the Buddhist video how it is not like a salt I put into the bowl of water you cannot like physically do wisdom wisdom will take this buddhi into Lina I am and buddhi will lose its all identity of recognizing recognizing means recognizer recognizing object and recognizing tool this tree will collapse that's why all the time scripture says triputi lawyer foreign [Music] that which is extremely pure foreign that remains that which is should the ever pure that sarupa your own nature that means therefore 37 says that know it to be the pure State when intellect dissolves in knowledge which comes after understanding to extremely subtle intellect the nature of the indwelling Consciousness so you have come back to your indwelling consciousness now 38 bars ends as are now the 38 bars the end in verse of this chapter then we'll of course it is not the end end but the teaching of krsna's major teaching is done here then Santa brutal will come that other further discussion but this is the end of the book really the end of the book it is [Music] [Music] now he's saying Krishna is saying I have sundas I have told you the truth which is essence of all knowledge ham which is about of all auspiciousness if you think of this day and night then all auspiciousness will come in life and then you will understand sukha bereavement or lamentation what we do believe me clingingness or what is called delusion it is not yours your posi you are of the nature of extreme pure nature niskala you have no color means don't partless so this truth narrated to you or you know a punctuous disposition is the most essential one there is there is no grief and delusion for you you are undivided pure and conscious in nature so you are that pure Consciousness so here is the chapter and we will have next day it is not end and as I said there are more verses how many verses 15 I will have to 56 verses so we are here on the 39 onward we'll read next time okay who is [Music] okay now a few questions and the end what to read many books if we take one or two such bars and everyday contemplate we we like to read many books we want to know this book that we can our new book has greater excitement but nothing nothing new but in different way just expressing the same idea in different ways we had to hold on to that or somebody is saying he is this Earth the only place where Karma gets worked out yes I have heard that and the scripture says so one also adds to Karma here on this Earth so wondering other Lucas with a similar rules exist I think that it is said this way as we understand that you this is karma bhumi this is the plane where you do work and accumulate your good bad bank balance you go to heaven with the bad bang balance you go to suffer in The Help and he'll several health If Heaven several heavens first class seven second class seven third class seven or you can five star hotels like that these are only they say so but you have to come back from there again in the dark that is the pain that is that is the scripture say after this is your enjoyment period or a suffering period you go to hell hell is experience you don't do anything there your karma ads I do not know scripture does not say that you add this is the wasting or or exhausting the result of your karma if you don't give it to God where it will go if you keep some money and don't deposit in the bank where it will happen in your pocket so in your pocket that pocket money you spend when you exhausted then you go and work again so you come back into that and do work again and again that is the idea normally as as is the I know must this much that other planes you don't acrylic good or bad but you do what you only exhaust your punnam or opponam what is auspicious or inauspicious you have experienced earned you spend it there Bad Karma okay you suffer something there in hell and then release from there come back and become a human personality but again start your work that's why it is called this life is precious how to utilize our everyday and we can go towards realization another question is it our inclination to designate names and forms to our environment that traps us more deeply in Maya why must we name things you know that's the true point is you are correct it's our inclination to designate names and forms to our environment and not only that environment everything should be name and and given some name if you don't give scientists today saw some star in a Hubble bubble they will be excited immediately they'll give the name so this is real devastating rain the immediately there will be some name otherwise we cannot separate out in this world of division this is The Duality and multiplicity in this world of Multiplicity there will be always this Division and name and form should be otherwise that's why you go beyond even from there is that one so if you are here you have to divide them and form see nose eyes ear wires given all super name name I say suppose it is called here so have we been learned that that is called the eyes use the word eyes here whatever you have given them and people have followed followed followed that become a tradition so I think we must rename things and we must name things if we want to live in the world otherwise we cannot separate out one thing from the other two people are standing how will you say if you don't know who what is the name of the people you can say oh tall the eyes like that and how many things you have to describe to whether you say John or say Mary the things will be easy so that's why name is necessary with the form in this world but if we want to forget name and form then see the artwork everywhere there's no name no form you can see the name and form and see the Atman there two but we have no knowledge of sensory input when enlightened when enlightened at the point of Enlightenment no that is not enlightenment you have Enlightenment at the same time this Duality no after Enlightenment when you come back your Enlightenment remains in your memory so strong you cannot forget that at the same time you see the duality because you are working through the mind because any knowledge should indicate separation yes that is true so no knowledge we would have no knowledge sensory knowledge in that state of experience that is beyond all sensory experience okay thank you tomorrow will be gospel class at 7 30. thank you all Om Shanti Shanti Shanti
