[86. Shanti Gita - Class 86 - chapter 7- verse 50 -55 - Swami Sarvadevananda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JGDf2-Wml44)

foreign [Music] [Music] oh Lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your respondent face home peace peace peace be unto us all so we are the the end of this Shanti Gita then seventh chapter bhagavan krishna's last advice was given and then Arjuna Got Back to his awareness that he is not the not much involved into the world but he is something else and then conclusion is this is narrating this story and he said verse number 50 onward today we are reading 7 chapter 50 verse verse 50 51 52 to 55. and that is then 56 is the end of this chapter it's nothing much more to so discuss much but it's a conclusive statement of the Shanta britishi said it took 12 bhagavan Krishna badanas I am original foreign in the previous verses mainly shall receive no just to say what Shri Krishna advised he said that oh my friend Arjuna therefore be silent this Cosmic poem seen by you before is really my Maya merely Cosmic ignorance alone oh son of kunti you are confused by Maya now reflect upon your own essential nature be ignorant are bewildered by The Cosmic Maya and in words of truth or get free from delusion that means when original saw the cosmic form in the beginning of the war he's saying you have seen that but that is only my Maya this everything you see as you know a pedantic term everything we see that is an appearance but reality is Brahman so therefore all your Atman so he says that you go portal in you are the number of Truth now you know the truth and because of that be silent don't Lament don't don't feel that you are lost but what you saw in the cosmic Pond it is only an illusion therefore reflect upon what is the duty you reflect upon upon your own essential nature try to think who are you all that constantly and the ignorant people in the world they are bewildered by the Maya as we are all but the people of wisdom Noah subtruth they are always free from all delusion they see the Oneness therefore nothing to feel bereaved bereavement suffering pain does not trust them so you are a wise person be like that therefore whatever whoever listens this message of me santikita song of peace it gives peace to that it will give peace to that person and also even who listens and who recites and who reads out so it crosses the bondage of Maya therefore that he he whoever listens this Gita is that last person shall never be deluded by my Maya by the grace of this Gita with attainment of knowledge of the self there shall be perfect peace due to destruction of greed so you are great stricken not only or you know following original the whole world we are all grips taken we are we feel so much lost when something little of our Earthly things gets out of our grip our health our money our wealth our name our Fame anything goes and we feel we are lost so therefore Gita is a deluded by Cosmic Maya or ignorance this happens by the grace of this study of this Gita and attaining that ultimately the result innate result of attaining the knowledge there shall be perfect peace you want peace as holy mother said you want peace don't find fault with others try to make the whole world your own here Krishna ends if you want peace then try to know who you are and try to see the world as all himaya play of Maya even the cosmic form what narayana is krsna sown in the 11th chapter of the bhagavad-gita that is also an appearance just a delusion so when the delusion will go you will be established in your real self and that real self is changeless absolute and there is no grip who will grip for whom you will grip what is the loss where it will be lost pedantic ultimate vedantic knowledge who are used to lose anything who will lose the person who will lose is not there because his Atman where to lose in the world there is no world it is all myself how to lose there is no other agency to lose there's the question of loss or gain attainment or or or failure is this terminology has no meaning in that so therefore this is the conclusion so conclusion then that's why that's why saying so bhagavan Krishna the Lord Krishna he's always his face becomes very cheerful joyful one with a face beaming with joy so in the krsna's life that is the story that it is prophetam he is always cheerful always joyful you have seen that movie there is one movie ramayana by ramananda Sagar Series so many series probably used to watch it in this Temple at all some hours and there is see the Rama the face of the Rama is always come all is peaceful always joyful so that is that bhagavan Krishna whose full of cheerfulness and joy meaning with joy his face shayam he himself Arjuna Shah karang dhitwa holding the hand Kara of Arjuna judist he moved he walked close to his elder brother originally elder brother young Gita foreign foreign [Music] I have told this out of my love and affection for you is I am not bound to speak out all this the Gita named which is the song of peace he is Young Gita this Gita which is santaka which has been turned as Shanti Gita that means Song of Peace which is a secret it is a secret deepest secret secret all the secret of this it is much secret more secretive than any other Secret why there are many things in the world we do not know that is secret the knowledge science has developed so much but we don't know many things yet so there are many things which can be kept hiding but it is such a deep secret only by constant meditation prayer when the Mind becomes pure they can understand that so that secret I have told you you know so foreign it is superior Gujarat Gujarat para para means Superior highest that is highest as alsoara there are many secret things the Atma Ghana is the most secret knowledge of yourself because you cannot catch it by hand you cannot find with any instrument by putting into the microscope or in the telescope or in a finest machine you cannot find the Atman so to get peace to know your Atman so it has been described here therefore this Gita is very secret and then you can say what is this you have said all this Secret in all the verses already secret thing has been exposed well why because I love you that's why tabos Maya by me prakta means has been stated by me by by affectionately I love you for seeing your condition of grief and suffering so I have told this out of compassion to you but and what did I say I did not say anything that's the humility of the scriptures I did not say anything by myself but it has been said by what Guru namah which has been given by Guru my Guru what my Guru gave it to me that secret of the secret that Essential Knowledge you know books that are written in the books that is one thing but when it comes on the mouth of a person who have experienced and he got from his Guru so that carries much deeper meaning uh in any in in our uttarakhand there is a statement it's called means I am my master I have taken my lineage is very important are just 10 divisions at their monastics so any sadhu they ask what is your name when they refer their name and differ to say either a false within the 10 categories if it is not then they don't recognize you because you are up until you are thinking you are a monk you do not know the tradition and tradition gives validity tradition means that is the path followed by many people before so it has its own value so that's why it is Guru parampara that's why the importance that is very important that I learned it from my Guru I practiced it in my life and I am now out of my love and affection for you I have related to you foreign [Music] because you heard that's why it is said uh even Guru gives us Mantra but don't tell anybody it is not to be given never even by delusion to whom shorth Ohio who is very deceitful don't give this knowledge and wisdom to a deceitful person nasty guy those who have no faith and believe in it are atheist and those who do only bad logic whatever logician but his understanding all his goals to justify what is wrong logic can be used for understanding the truth but logic these logicians just only to prove something which is unreal they exercise their energy in that that type of person don't say need bad logicians to one who makes false arguments only argument for argument's sake they go on fighting and fighting and fighting so don't give it to them because you will have no value to them so three people it is like bhagavad-gita no bhagavad-gita last but he done to no Auto Sky not uh that person who is not a bhakta devotee don't give this Gita teachings what is the normal Gita foreign there are those who don't learn with susha means Seva learn from guru's Grace he is no Tendencies he goes okay teach me like that no it is not like that to that person uh so who hates me who does not like me he would you should not tell about me to a person who hates me unnecessarily it will be insulting and your mind you will feeling bad suppose if you love someone and respect someone and then you go to some person he criticizes your respectful respected loving some Guru or your friend you won't like it so similarly here don't go to those type of people don't give this message to them because they are not fit for it so here also similarly idea it never should be given kachit ever never ever through delusion or ignorance even just ignorantly don't even give to anyone this message of bigita that is the problem in other words what happened no in what is the people who are not fit to understand this you know they create wrong impression and create a in their life and their life of others that's why vedanta is very good the highest message is there in the vedanta but it is to be understood that if one is not fit for those the mind is not ready to accept it then you make a Mis misunderstanding of the spiritual truth no they will um Gita 12 chapter says no being body identity those who try to think of the I am absolute I am infinite they are in much trouble those who are attached to object means Brahman is everywhere but he doesn't manifest he died no I don't see it so therefore it is place it when they practice their trouble may come more unless they are purified by your their mind is purified they can always understand I I does not mean body I does not mean mine but whatever we say I am this immediately our awareness comes I am the body in underground under this statement under this expression there is always something playing underground that I am this I am this I am this so those who have body Consciousness less they should study debedanta and they will be they sprout you know the the seeds Sprouts when when there is a fertile ground it is all wheat-free and it has got fertilizer and others and sunshine so that place if the seat Falls it sprouts immediately and then it becomes a plant and becomes a tree spiritual seedling it should be like that so we have to prepare ourselves not that it is wrong so that's why he says that know that true delusion or ignorance to a person deceitful person deceitful person means he is not honest he is not sincere what he says it says something does something think something there is no Harmony in the tree Mana mind the speech and the action should corroborate deceitful they don't do that they cheat themselves see themselves and cheat others so therefore no benefit telling them they will make a distorted meaning of it they will do wrong things and justify in the name of vedanta that I have I didn't do and that story of the cow and the ramakrishna's gospel I didn't kill who killed my hand killed my hand and my hand I am not in control of my hand intro controls my hand so go to him right so see that problem huh so totally thinking I am the body and not taking the responsibility good and bad action foreign you have to have that understanding clearly and you see you can say body has done that's why the Hindu then appeared and all these stories we know and Punishment should go to the person who has done action and reaction with that another story that one person did something wrong to students so we do we do like that we do the other way and think that we are vedanta that's a ramakrishna is to use some slang use language that that type of vedanta I don't like I Spit on that vedanta I that means you are saying vedanta I am Atman I am not devotee not the mind and in in your behavior you are just using the opposite and doing all unjustified actions immoral action and or which is very abusive action and at the same time say I am at no that is the I this is the deceitful people and nasty who don't believe in any other higher values philosophy nastic different from charba but chadwak philosophy is like that what is to think about see sleep eat and drink and just be merry Reena foreign they bring this argument array this body when you die you know it will be ashes so you do bad karma you will go to hell don't listen all these nonsense things costly thing now many costly things in Modern Age we can name many other things so you have no money so borrow money have a credit card and go on spending and don't pay up what is the need after death nothing will remain so what is the need of being fearful about righteousness going to hell punishment don't believe so this type of people for them they are not fit yet to listen to this vedantic message so it's it is a God talking with another devotee but not to the people who don't understand to atheist and that's very important you are gaining in some rational understanding of the Atman and Brahman if strong personality comes and this good logic behind him he can smash you right in thinking process so don't talk to them rather get out of them it's a wastage of time also those who are not fit to hear about and think about the spiritual issues so it is and more Kyle don't talk to the dull-headed or fools whose mind is not developed yet so to so these are then these are the gods where to need thy own malgov to a person who is wicked that means the road means not following the road following the rules and regulations of life or his ashtray is the lifestyle is not moral so no um nirur foreign [Music] [Music] can handle that other people going they will be trapped into the drinking because when he he's a great auditor no when he gives some argument or say something so powerful he will be convinced with that and his lifestyle is not immutable so therefore one should not try that because then he will get drowned which is ramakrishna give the example and that's under water in the river two types of firewood may be floating one is so light that even a bird sits and it sings down and there are other like a boat you can lift there but if you are not strong that's why he said even someone is drowning in the uh yeah to water if he's if you are not sufficiently strong if you try to help that person you may be dragged down that means we should have spiritual spirituality more spirituality to handle and mix with them rather until you get it you should be away and not necessary to turn them into the right path that gives you that is also true but but but didn't like that all the young child children should go and meet with him very closely but when he transformed that's a different thing but when his first condition that is so but one condition is that he's a devotee as he loves mother Kali you know that's why he said okay you won't drink ramakrina said think a mother first and then drink so she has great devotion for her mother and whenever devotion is there for divine mother So Divine mother's name you do then your emotions and outgoing Tendencies will have a break there so that is the SRI ramakrishna's advice for Girish but others he will not listen to others instruction that's also point rather he can bring them to his fold so even by mistake this Shanti Gita should not be given at any point of time they are very restrictive that's why previously all these books now it is written for other it was in the in the form of what you call the uh equivalent character and the leaf previously people used to eat in burjapatra or something and before that it was only in the mind of the teacher hepatitis papaya sleep they used to write down the verses and people used to copy some on the on the paper so that people used to read but mostly that was preserved within the within the teacher's mind so that's why so much Guru bhakti and aru bhakti and others to earn guru's attention was necessary because everything was secret and it was kept with the guru when he finds this student fit for that he will give it memorizing The Vedic scriptures they remember memorize the whole Vedas so then when they explain then they it is reserved with them because there is no such writing now Google can find out whatever you want because everything has been put there but it was very so you should not give it and that's it defect has come because all the message is available now many young person should want to know about God they don't go to a teacher but they go to Google and find out all the quotation this and jumbled up together and all different ideas so the brain gets sent to a confusion Buddhism little bit of Buddhism little bit of Hinduism little bit of Islam a little bit like this and but but assimilation is not possible there therefore it should be so these are the guard so by mistake event should not be given to any point of time to anyone who is deceitful one atheist palacias musician and dull headed he's not fit to listen to this so nothing interesting there it is said that buddhi is of different types they say dull headed they have sinned what is the name Stone like what is that you take a nail and try to hit and make a penetrate into the stone what will happen it will not go inside Stone it will do but it turns back so whatever you give it turns back so Stone head no written spiritual ideal can enter into it it goes and turns back there are then is the the wildlife while life is the best while like you put a little drop of oil what happens on the surface it spreads he assimilates absorbs uh King robberly see he put a pin in a rubber then you stretch it may hold on sometime but the PIN will fall down so a little detention but with the little detention before that it falls down another skin skin ah skinny penetrate it goes at as much you have penetrated it that much it retains there so the yoga sisters beautifully analyze these four types of buddhi stone like buddhi foreign [Music] cup you put that water and you see that oil spreads all over the surface and that is good good buddhi there's a stone buddhi it turns back you stick there you this rubber goes little extended it fall down and the skin you do skin it will half an inch it goes it will stay on there after that was nothing more so these are the different and Dal is the lowest one so it is just this is this type of buddhi those dull headed don't talk to them and hard-hearted they have no purity of their mind hard-hearted means towards your money little brutal that they don't feel the sympathy for others suffering for others they feel okay being fun they can give more trouble to that person so that he feels more suffering now this that is the what type of Buddha is that hard-hearted hard-hearted one person is crying even I have someone is suffering and some devotees I have seen they really they are feeling so bad and they cannot sleep whole night sensitivity and some people are there suffering okay little more is better so hard at it so don't talk to them and weigh what those who are just um yesterday lifestyle is totally against morality and others okay but again you should not give them this knowledge but whom to give positive that's the beauty of the scriptures don't do this do this so what did they do do 50 third verse [Music] foreign [Music] you can give this message to greatly you can give it very with intensity with much seriousness promise procristiano with utmost attention it should be given to whom to whom is vexed means this gun this attached he has no attachment Detachment person or sannyasiya those who don't really see this outside world who has renunciation in their heart huh he not irritated people means another running translation irritated not irritated but he does not release the world of this outside world he has Detachment he has renunciation that is very humble uh who's who is really respectful because Guru Guru how important you just Guru you go to Guru don't say hey tell me brahmagana or give me knowledge is not like that first is that we go to salute and humble propana pronipating and then ask so oh guy t-shirt please tell me I am suffering in the bondage of worldliness how can I get out of it and why he will tell you unless he had feel little affection for you so say Vaya my help help what helps him to ease his burden little with physical world burden so early days that's why Guru Shiva was so important now modern days gurus you do gurus I don't think that serve your Guru day and night no guru Shiva is you do what Guru has instructed do Japan do meditation do prayer the process that is Guru Seva easy thing we sometimes joke or not touching his massage then guru's leg will go that what he has so Guru Shiva is here also he says to be given or merely just is one who has taken shelter I want to get table to Bucktail that means he's very devoted to Guru bhakti what then you have trust in the word of Guru said I believe it no The Chosen ideal for your chosen idea bhakti for your good if not um to the one who is devoted to Guru and sometime a person who is straightforward truthful honest straight there is no when a what you call complication in the head says what that is good for me and I'll follow that part it will remain is given uh [Music] oh my Guru troubled in life I am lost into the life and the ocean of sanction I am totally so that urge when it comes that of Liberation and his spirit this is holy people and Santa who is very and straightforward santosha they have made this it's very simple ah so therefore this translation will be the it is to be given to one who is exasperated that's the beautiful word exasperated he needs to know supplement a seeker of Liberation devoted to Guru and God very serene so straightforward now another some qualities are also mentioned 54. if these qualities are considered we are we do not even get a chance to to listen to these things but in Kuli yoga in this iron is this the grace of God will get to read all these things all the qualities they are saying to the one who has the faith and reverence faith and difference very humble uh [Music] he his heart is to the person who compassionate by his very nature he is a practitioner to a righteous person he's a holy man or holy living her life his life or her life is a righteous life foreign he does not carry any hatred or anger for anyone Baba well well he gets such quality without this quality we are reading vedanta that's why it is not manifesting in our life so pay attention to this this can be a good subject to think and discuss about the what are the requisite according to santikita these are the people who cannot grasp the truth and these are the people when those qualities come rather pay attention to grow these qualities or that's that is understood when you are reading this book it is also understood you know vedanta sorry you read who is too at the very beginning [Music] at least goes on foreign needed one by one you have read all the and go to this meaning apparent meaning you have captured mastered up in general in this no pure lastly my God come on you want this I want this are you pleasure this you don't do anything you've never looked at the foreign action s where language is pure to the extreme um foreign foreign quality so I think it is there now that the Gita should be given with utmost care the Faith with humility compassionate his sin that person and who is free from hatred free kotita Rajan who Gopi protected foreign [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] foreign foreign said by Said by Krishna who has killed the madhu a two demons for the pacification of business shook Arjuna was sun or women who is killed or you know that the afflictions a multitude of sins as one reads this this all the top all the the destroys the demon and to passify the birimenda study of this next Institutes of Affliction all types of applications all the pain and agonies of demand it is study of potential and extreme will do it will remove attitudes all impurities in the form of there Theta Serene by its nature it bestows peace it removes the darkness there is practice in the form of the bundle of verses and dances in The Shining Siri and mind of the reader by the grace of one's own good dance in the heart and make oneself free all types of pyramid suffering all those things here it is spiritual self but in this conversation between vasudeva Krishna and Arjuna Shanti Gita I am awesome foreign typing is wrong it says they are here ends this seventh chapter of The Shanti Gita present this scripture of what is Union with God and it is kinds of sufficient here it is ending here
