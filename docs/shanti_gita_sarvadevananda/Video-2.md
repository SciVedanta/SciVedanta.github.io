[2. Shanti Gita - Class 2 - Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ghpmhlHLrw)

so today we are entering into the book or the message of sri krishna which has been named as shanti gita the gita the song gita it came from song gita and shanti peace what piece that we have discussed little bit on the other day the beginning today is the second day we are entering into the verses with this very uh introduction introductory verses so it has been mentioned here that this gita santigita there is no available book present but this script is available but you all can access to the verses among allah when you start you have to go to vedanta.org slash shanti hyphen gita then you will be able to reach that text which has been given there for easy reading or keeping a book in hand santi gita is a unique text where the lord krishna while in the battlefield of his son died killed was killed inappropriately by the big warriors breaking all the protocols and then arjuna was totally lost into believement and pain overwhelmed with that and that time shri krishna the lord came and advised arjuna to overcome those grief and to have peace and actually see arjuna attain that peace after listening to sri krishna what he has in this book contains that this this world in which we live this is built out of maya it is non-eternal and sokka the bereavement and delusion mohawk they are all the nature of the nature of mind it happens in the mind and in waking state dream these are also happens when the mind is awake and all these believement and delusion that happening at the point of time when we are awake it does not happen when we go to sleep or we go to faint that time mind is not functional so there is no question of any believement or suffering or attainment of anything and it is to understand that you know by our nature the jiva their by their nature is undying is between beyond birth death believement delusion all this beyond that this type of wonderful advice has been given through the text of this shanti gita and it has become a wonderful text of adrita vedanta and also a good and important guideline for us who live in the world with so much of believement and suffering as it gave peace to arjuna so we hope that it will create the same peace in others who are in believement and pain and all this delusion which created by our mind gives a concept of suffering so that is the way we found it and we are very much interested to go through this therefore let us start at the very mangalacharam mangala shalom mangolacharan means auspices a beginning auspicious prayers we start with what is that any book started the scriptures always brings what brings that guru into their picture they show their respect and by their grace to understand the meaning and purpose of life so the very first verse this there was a this book was written by a one time in long back in 1897 this book in bengali it was translated and elaborated by one wonderful scholar shoshi bhushan and it was in 1897 but that was too old and not not available and no english translation therefore there we find that this book when he composed this book's first auspices prayers are beginning with this this type of mantra shanta ayo shantayo means to that who who is tranquil a bike to rupaya who is of the nature of unmanifested form maya who to support the maya who holds the maya support of jimaya vishnave to that vishnu all-pervading sapraka that who is effulgent everywhere the witness of the world this the witness of the whole world i salute so salutation the meaning is first part starts salutation to that all pervading visnu with the witness of the universe the basis or substratum of the elusive force which is called maya and that is serene and truth alone is self-effulgent and unmanifested in its real nature so this is the way every book starts with is showing on the deep regard and salutation to the brahmana the atman which is of the nature of peace and who is that visnu the all-pervading visnu who perverts everywhere that means the author is offering the salutation to lord vishnu you all pervading and who is vishnu is the abduct rupayah his real nature is unmanifest brahman is the unmanifest and he is manifested as visnu so their vishnu also have two meaning the absolute aspect is which is unchanging ajay all this quality if our self-effacing the witness of the universe the basis of this maya comes out of that that's why it is called the basis of the maya and it is the serene pure stainless that is the truth and truth alone and self-effulgent you don't need atman or brahman to have another flashlight to illumine it is selfish like sun sun does not need a sun ilu means everything but if you ask who will you miss the son of course you can say god brahman that forget that but in literally sense if you want to say you will have to say no no no sun itself is self-effulgent it illuminates by its own nature so the brahman the atman who is the witness of all who we worship as vishnu the lord vishnu we salute that visnu who is the witness of the whole universe who is the substrata of maya santiago who is peaceful calm who does not manifest in the in its real nation but it holds the maya through which power the universe comes out which is suppresso of the own nature of prakash manifestation satya which is only truth and truth alone say namos namaste i salute that bistro the eternal witness of the whole universe god is considered to be cosmic witness the cosmic witness allows everything to see watch so this is the beginning first verse so this is mangala charon it is called the salutation to brahman now the second verse it it is the it it is said yes [Music] bani the word just so who's who's bani who speaks whose words procrasti reveals it reveals the param supreme brahman the truth of brahman that one he knew words as you know words are the manifestation of brahman the word in the beginning there was word word was with god as in the bible it is written and what was god so in vedanta also shabta brahma this word just so that word actually we express everything through our words and we explain that supreme brahman the brahma tattoo by word only this supreme truth is not revealed openly like this it is sugura it is the extremely concealed or profound mukti chuna those who are desiring to get liberation gamayati leads badam to that state that purnam on them that fool that on the blissful reality viva the braham the deluded people who are somebody regulates their motive their mind this verse means it says i offer my salutation now the guru any book starts as i said that this starts with these two things one will be brahman and next is guru god and guru so this is salutation to guru he's saying i offer my salutation to that supreme guru whose words reveal the extremely profound and supreme truth of the absolute lead the seekers of liberation to that blissful state regulated regulate the deluded person's mind which is restless and the very source of doubts and proclaim the oneness of the absolute self so this is all glory to a guru in different ways in it is offering that i offer my salutation to that supreme guru whose words reveal the extremely profound secret supreme truth of the absolute you know all our knowledge that's why in scripture it is said you can read the books but that does not give liberation you know you have to listen from a teacher and who is he knows what he is talking and who has experienced something in his life so if this uh book is heard from this guru that so he who has heard from his guru in this book was not as i said the other day it is not available in the mahabharata but it was a probably a oral tradition when krishna said this it's hard by arjuna and somebody re remembered and we will find that this book we get it will coming to that introduction part there will find we go to the little history of it they will find that the the holy man who came to see this king his guru has told him and his guru has heard somewhere so it is oral tradition there are many oral traditions probabilities from the oral tradition so he's talking about that supreme guru means guru's guru guru we got guru namo group group venomous t group we do every time in the puja we do that different gurus in different level so he's talking about the parama guru para para guru so he's a supreme guru for a promised guru so he's referring that our salutation goes to him from whom these words this bonnie flowed from his heart he had heard it from his guru but it has come to us to this channel so therefore we are respectful for this channel of gurus we also say we are respectful for not for your guru but guru's guru guru is guru no where is the source go to that source so here they offering salutation to that supreme guru and that guru's words reveal the extremely profound and supreme truth of truth of what of absolute of the absolute and listening to that if one follows this guru's words which has generalized and came as shanti gita we will be reading it will lead the seekers of liberation to that blissful state if one listens reads and meditates and tries to live the life in that light that will surely gave them their liberation and they will attend to a blissful state a state of perfect peace and joy and and regulate the deluded person's mind when we hear the deluded people like us who our mind this message what will you do the mind which is restless and mind is always doubtful we are hearing so many times god is everywhere so what is the impact we hear but doubt remains where is god this is stable this is human being this is our friend this is our enemy this is our good bad all so we always live in this duality so our doubt remains and that is if that is the characteristic of the mind mind's characteristics are being mentioned which is restless we all know mind is always restless does it need to be explained for anyone we all experience every day when you close our eyes for meditation you know what is the mind and how mind is running where so restlessness is the mind one characteristic and doubt is another of the characteristic of mind so this this will be gone if one follows this message which is coming from the guru's guru this message down to us it will just lead the seeker to liberation blissful state how by regulating the deluded person's mind which is restless and is the very source of all doubts how much you teach the mind mind will still put the question but every day we do that i have any scripture you read such inspirational text then we come out but we are we are here so bus all this reading is gone into void so that is the characteristic of the mind but that will be straightened how straighten if this guru who has kindly conferred this wisdom to their disciple to that disciple to that disciple and came and handed over to us in this age it is possible to searching in the computer and google and this and that we got this it was not possible before unless you find a guru who knows this suppose in previous time before this technology and now people whatever they get they are putting and it is making available for others but think about that you have to find a guru who knows this santigita and not only knows memorize that time there is no book either it will be handwritten manuscript or they they will not give you the handwritten manuscript it is the teachers are very strong they will ask them to memorize okay two verses memorize then come tomorrow it is a big struggle but this it is available to us and if one is sincere then their mind will be crookedness of the mind out of the mind restlessness of the mind will be wiped out and real peace will dawn that's why and oneness of the absolute self will be experienced there so these are the two verses one verse is dedicated to the lord vishnu you all pervaded that is the brahman the witness consciousness witness consciousness and is the source of maya maya the whole creation has come out of that brahman maya so this universe of manifestation he himself becoming unmanifest manifested himself through maya and seeing everywhere we salute that visnu who pervades everywhere and second verse is i am offering our my salutation to that parama guru supreme guru whose words reveal his words are revealing the expanded the extremely secret and profound teachings about what about the supreme truth brahman and by listening this the seekers like us our mind whose mind is always restless and which is always full of doubts and confusions those will be wiped out and it will help us to reach that blissful state and they feeling our oneness with the absolute truth which we have forgotten actually vedanta says what we are that whether we know it or not if you don't know that also we are that whether you know or not rama krishna said whether you know or not you are rama he said january whether you know or you do not know you are rama but when you january when you know then it's great joy when you don't know then you cry as we are crying we do not know that in us is the divine and we looking at the world this book will analyze how this fictitious relationship is created in this world when i came along who knows who i was with whom i have my relationship where were my friends where were my enemies who are who was my intimate friend who were all these things came and in the middle it came and as we move in our life something coming something going something coming something going and like one day i gone and all the relationship boom gone and in this maya and we are spending our whole life and never thinking this going and coming is happening in your mind but you are not mind but you are the atman all believe men suffering depression or your height of ecstatic joy all are happening in your mind when that day that's why it said when one goes to deep sleep where is this suffering or joy duality collapses there that is our nature so this book will gradually guide us to that direction if we can contemplate if we can take the language is very simple this these words are very given very simply but it has got deep and profound teachings everywhere and will be benefited by that so now these are the called the mangala charanam mangal auspicious uh beginning after this we enter into the book which has introduction the introduction what let me see introduction now introduction says that where did it come from it says because here starts our introduction to this santi gita what does it say big cattle very famous pandave say in the dynasty of the pandava kings pandava kurava there are dynasties different dynasties so in the pandava dynasty which is very famous and there was a king nippo nipple mr king and his name was jonah jaya now who is the jana major now we'll have to go back again who is jonah major jamun name is the grand daughter and grandson of whom father was parikshit pariksi's father was obvious whose father was fortunate got it here they are all dead now jonathan is ruling the country he became the king and jonatha's son now ruling when this episode is happening he is named satanic the king's name is satanic remember it who is satanica satanica is the son of jana mayjaya janome is the son of pariksit and puriks is the son of himanu obiman was killed obi-wan who's father was arjuna got it this that means in the lineage of obi-wan news tradition so this was jonathan's kingdom and this jana mayjaya in that kingdom janome is son whose name is satanica you remember satanic only that will do but it is good to know the lineage where from it comes uh arjuna i don't need to go further later arjuna arjuna and his friend was krishna no krsna's sister was suhadra shubhadra was married with arjuna and arjuna's son was obi-wan he was killed in the 13th on the 13th day of the big one of 18 days war and then with the guru kuru's or the door jodhana to sasama with them they fight so with the fight on the 13th day it happened that women was killed and and as he was killed and that news came to arjuna so he was he could not contain himself anymore he thought that what is this fight and what am i doing as naturally we can understand we don't understand actually those who have their father or they know their children and when the children die what is the sort of pain and agony and believement and frustration it goes to so that was the state overwhelming state overwhelmed with misery overwhelmed with believement that was the arjuna's condition and that time arjuna then krishna came and he approached krishna and then krishna then gave him the advice and that advice is contained here but now how we get we will go to that history now so you remember satanica satanico is the king of india then that time satanic king but a very virtuous king born in the lineage of arjuna and also you can say krishna's relationship is also there his own sister's lineage and then when they are very spiritual people religious people honest people so satanic was a very reputed honorable king he remembered that story of his father's grandfather was okay that story is very famous for executive story is that what gives us bhagavata pariksi's story gives us the bhagavata great great spiritual treasure of indian ancent india no bhagavat which is composed by basil but what does so this pariksit was dying being cursed by a brahmin boy that he will die within seven days by snake bite i told that story the other day in my introductory talk that that when this he's listening that curse instead of being angry or being reactionary he designed everything give up everything and to his son that is the january and giving the charge of the management of the whole kingdom he retired and he went into the forest and they are going into the forest he started doing thinking of god and god and that time the basal sun sukadeva gave her free soul he appeared there suddenly and this parikshita then said sir my my salutation to you i have only seven days to survive so please tell me about him krishna who is protecting me from my childhood before my birth till now so i want to hear about him more and more and then shukuri was so kind he heard it from his father basso and he recapitulated that what you call the reproduce that and the discussion went on and parikshit the king was questioning and sukadeva was replying to the question and that created the wonderful bhagavata text and now pariksit's son jana mayjayo and his son is now satanic here shatnik was ruling the country and during his ruling time then one great sage appeared there in the courthouse so we will read that that when superstar in the says in the in the lineage of the pandu which is very famous nipisha that the isha means the lord of all other god all other kings many there's the maharaja you can say repetition and his name jonathan jonah's son maharaja he is also maharaja whose name is satanica his name is satanica he's mahamati he has a great heart he's a great wisdom person of great knowledge and what is happening as in those days when the kings come to the court there are quote musicians quote people there are all who will praise the glory of the king he'll be surrounded by his ministers and administrators around no so second verse says ekoda one day ministers and others friends and he's surrounded by the friends and admirers the kings were always surrounded by their fans no and and there will be some chanters who will praise the glory of the king no so ekoda success it is all surrounded by them raja raja mandirei in the courthouse of the king tupa vishat was sitting there then that means this this satanic king was encircled by his friends you can imagine a courthouse with his ministers he was sitting and the musicians are praising his glories and this and that that was the style so he was surrounded by that stu yamana margot supervisor he was seated studio will be praised by the bhagavad gita by the people of magadha and that's demagogue mother is the space name of the place he is king shuta shoot a type of chanters and the bundivi means this those who sings they can know how to he should know the history of the family he should stay talk about the glories of their family how they fought for justice how they rule the country with all patience and love for their subjects so those glories they are chanting and the king was seated just imagine a position like that then then what happens third verse [Music] now he is sitting over there supervised while sitting stu yomano being praised by and he looks mahindra sandra his glory yeah his his glow of the body is like mahi mahindra mahindra indra a great indra like mounted on the great king of gods he's called in the god of gods so satanic looks like a god of gods like indra so much powerful and dignified and serene like that singh hassan is sitting in the throne it is it is like that of god indra he's shining he's like that then nana bakkyo rasalapui nana means meaning various discussing many topics and rasala also some spirit spirited discourses was going on the scholars scholars they discuss spiritual topics that was on the oldest uh not today's secular government that a indian tradition was that every king in their courthouse there will be some great scholars who knows the scriptures so that they will a lot all the time by that discussion the human life its purpose what is the duty of the king what is the duty of the subjects how to love them how to protect their interest all these values to be awakened in the mind of the king there are pundits and also they discuss vedanta philosophy on different spiritual texts they used to continue so this with this type of discussion topics and satanico was surrounded again by pandita the scholars and he was very delighted he was listening there is no fight with other kings or anything their focus was how to do good to the uh the countrymen that means their subjects that was the situation satanico was surrounded by all his friends and followers and their ministers the pundits are discussing some spiritual topics and he is participating into that sometime with d life delightful mind spending the time in get rasa allah the sweet discussion was going on so this very big beautiful atmosphere is described here it just means now in this time when it is going on at this time sriman chantab great austere sage whose name is shanta brato samagata he appeared a great sage who at the ethos means in this time most venerable chanter brother maha tapa the great austrian spiritual personality suddenly appeared there that was a tradition sadhus holy people will come from to the king's court to give them spiritual wisdom also if they need sometimes that because they have their schools their stories they used to run schools where there's to teach the vedic literature to the students nurturing name all the children will come at certain age and stay with the guru and they will teach the students all their expenses are maintained by that astronaut who will support they used to go to the good kings we'll support them for some needs also or even for spiritual discussion not that they are always going for seeking for some money but they used to go to spread the knowledge spread the wisdom of vedic wisdom knowledge so it has been samaya at this very time sriman santa the semen most venerable he looks like a prison atma his face is very serene tranquil his mind you can look at the sage and you can feel he's a holy person his mind is full of peace and tranquility and tijurasi he as if the whole body is effulgent coming out of his body as between and tapunity tapunity means he is the embodiment of austerity as it were in spiritual life austerity is necessary but he was austere one side but at the same time he is growing with beaming with joy and and face face is flushing with joy his personality is so dignified so grand and at the same time austria so that holy man that is the venerable santa bruto so we have to remember two names santo bruto is the sage who came to the king and the name of the king is satya nika can you remember these two name swataniko is the king and shanta is there yeah the holy man who came the rishi the sage who we'll let her see he will say that being asked for some spiritual discourse he said i have heard from my guru this gita which sung by krishna i will relate you that science so we'll find that so here is the chant of brutal guru here who has come to give this wisdom to us but primarily to satanic and then here okay so raja darshan matri you know fifth first raja the king darshan matrenum as soon as he saw saw omato mitra vandavi with all his means his vertical all the ministers noble men [Music] uh raja the king at the very sight of this holy man's coming but at the very side so much the the court officers with all the court officers mitra with their friends because he just he got the idea he was surrounded by the friends surrounded by the ministers and administrators of the country now different departments so all of them see the respect of a naked fukil comes to a king's court the king will stand up with reverence and bow down this is the speciality of india incent india then the naked pakist this penniless person gets the highest respect from the kings and ancient tradition because they are the guideline that's why they guide the kings so that kings become moral idealistic and this and that so that their impact goes to the society king being good noble truthful honest serving helping others that percolates down it is gita said a characterista that which is being observed and practiced by the sister great people of the society lukas the ordinary human masses they only follow that we follow the path of great people and king minister president countries president they should be ideal ideal people will impact so many people masses follow masses have not much judgment should guide them that's why he is rajya that's why he is the president of the country it is his abundant responsibility to be honest be sincere be loving be god-centered full of man of character that is the ideal king and that this all this i named these people are like that they are dedicated to god they love the idealism they are moral they are ethical all these principles and as a result the as is of the country so that's why here we find that he had appeared and raja as soon as he saw this as soon as you saw this santa brotherishi with all the court officers with all his friends and associates out of respect stood up with great honor if anyone comes you are sitting and you give stood up and then it is much honor know when when our musicians perform their music and the ends the whole audience clapped the hand and stood up they say honor no they are honoring the musician so similarly as soon as the sage entered all the court officers friends and all the dignitaries with the king himself all stood up and bhakti bhavena with a very devotional mood with very humility with deep love bhaktiv you know with delight not today why he has come now we are making our own business and this naked fuki has entered it no it is with great delight ah what a fortune a holy man has come into our courthouse today with truthful lovefulna means it is elated being very cheerful with that cheerful mind and they all stood up in reverence okay so let us end here today so the story will go on and then how we'll read that next part so we have done enough we have read 5 verses we will read next day so the point is this what we have done today is simply that guru pranam and before that we did the pranam for brahman or the atman or vishnu who pervades everywhere who is the source of all manifestation brahman is unmanifest but through the maya everything is manifested and that whole universe we salute that visnu and then salute our the guru through whose grace we get this spiritual treasure and then the story about how it happened that how the king was seated in his own place and with a great joy he was entertained by his musicians by his pundits and scholars and also his friends at the same time he is so much delighted and participating and holy man came and his discussion he will be started soon and he will see how they respectfully accept adore and welcome the holy sage okay so again to remind you you find what i am reading these verses you can go to [Music] vedanto.org shanti hyphen gita only type this both of the chat you have given and also for everyone ah good good that's great yeah okay wonderful so now nothing to have so much question because it is a story today but i think no question is necessary but question will come when we go to deeper study and then we'll say that they will talk about panchik and all this what you read in virantesaro what you read in the other the viveka ramone structure like that all philosophies has been incorporated and talking about the ultimate truth of freedom so go beyond mind but ultimately address advice will be there your mind is creating all these diverse experiences so go beyond mind and you are not mind it is happening in the mind why are you bothering what is happening in the mind mind is not permanent mind is this moment like a baby this moment he is happy this moment he's disgruntled this moment he is moros this man is up so don't pay attention to the mind you are not the mind your mind you are the boss of the mind you say my mind my mind is restless your mind so why you know really handling it as your mind you you become a minds you who it has become more mind is the boss you have become a slave of mine so that's why our problem so it says no master that and you be yourself is beyond mind and if you stay there at the very beginning he has said that as one goes into deep sleep or into painting condition he has no misery he has no suffering he has no joy neither neither experience is there only you can say they can feel little comfort where this feasible universe this dualistic world always is collapsing there so go beyond mine go beyond mine that will be the message and everything here is a composite of five elements it is happening because the sense organs connected with the sense object what we have read in different scriptures this also will say the same and in its own special unique way okay so we can end here om shanti shanti shantihi hari hum thatsat too
