[49. Shanti Gita - Class 49 - Chapter 5 - Verse 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=73F-OU5fb5o)

[Music] [Music] [Music] lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and never more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face om peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to our reading on the shanti gita that song of peace because arjuna got peace listening to this great message from lord krishna when his son was killed on the 13th day of the war of maha mahabharata and shri krishna gave this message what he gave before that eternal message of the birthless deathless nature of the soul and that helped arjuna to get rid of his believement and suffering so that's why he's called it brought peace in the heart of arjuna and he came back and next day again could fight for the right reason so we are we have read up to the fourth chapter and we are in the fifth chapter we'll start reading to the fifth chapter 10th verse so in brit just going back a little bit in the fifth chapter where it started arjuna was putting a question that i have a question to know if you know arab brahman he knows who am i what is his duties what is the do's and don'ts of that person when one realizes that i am that infinite okay and they come down so that was the question and there is in response to krsna says the duty and do's and don'ts does not have any relevance with a noah of truth tattoo does you know the truth for them it does not matter what they do what they don't do because they don't do anything wrong first of all ramakrishna said expert dancer never makes a false step even they mig they make a false step that is considered to be a artwork special art rubin if he writes anywhere anything which is not rhythmic or anything it i'm not saying it has but if it is then it is considered arso it is the application of the rishis it is not a fault it is a glory so that means they know our truth have no responsibility and there is no do this is to be done no this is to be forbidden as for us we are spiritual seekers this is the morality this is right this is wrong you should do we should don't do these are applicable for us who are involved in our karma we are prompted into our action and action is good or bad so there is no such do's and don'ts for a person like who have realized the truth they have no ego they are not the doer we have sense of dual i'll have to do it this result is good this is bad people praise me i did this good people don't praise me because i have my ego but they these type of people are akarta and they are brahmaripa they are almost like brahman who is beyond all do's and don'ts and we are all controlled by the rules and regulations of the scriptures so for us what is to be done what is not to be done we should have to follow what scripture say vedas say but for this realized soul vedas have no control over them because he has gone above the vedas above the vedas means vedas are the expression of brahman and they have gone to a state they are established in that brahmana consciousness so they have gone beyond vedas therefore there is no implication upon them but is do's and don'ts and they are saying brahma they they are brahman themselves they are satchida under themselves and sadananda they live in that absolute bliss all the time vishwanta paramatmani resting in the supreme self they are perfectly joyful eternally joyful therefore they have no inclination to do what is good or auspicious there is no disinclination to avoid which is bad because in for in their eyes everything is god everything is divine so for them these rules don't apply and therefore if there is no such im impetus of inclination and disinclination for auspicious and inauspicious activities there cannot be any result a child does everything sometimes it may be good it may be bad but the result of good and bad does not go to them because they have no ego so the brahma-ganis they know ours of truth they remain in that egoless state therefore what their body does because they don't identify with the body it does not affect them because mind is not connected with that therefore the deho prana mano bhutti chitto hong kar indium is a big philosophy how does one perform action that is in the fifth verse we have read already that you need a body and that body known to be dead body it should have a prana prana the vital energy should be there manu it should be mind connected with the mind see a person who lost his mind so he has no karma but karma to perform you must have a mind not only mind you will have some determinative faculty or intellect your intellect also should guide right or wrong doing these and going down even our driving we took resolution no my buddhi intellect drives me go to the second lane go to the third lane or the fastest lane no how do you go there unless there is some force acting behind your mind that's the buddhi and i i am driving i am cooking i am cleaning i am talking so that should be i so you know to have any activity we must have this body one body should be there the pranic energy should be in the body not dead body and that panic energy with the mind in it active and also their intellect is also active and ego is also behind them these are the things but alone this cannot function there you need to even chavashana means desire i will do that that bhasana the prompting force would be there should be some desire i shall do this you may have everything but you say i will have to go to the trader joe's so there is a desire and desires makes you to go out and take a key and have a car and then drive and come back or walk whatever so impetus is the desire and effort comes after that and the evo means but all you may plan but if there is no master plan the god does not approve that you start your journey there will be heavy traffic you cannot move one step suddenly some big thing will happen where all your plan is massage so by the grace of god is also necessary so these are the to do any work we need this it's a very very scientific thing to understand all our actions are prompted by desire and desire prompts us to work we need a body a body with prana or energy breathing and that should have a mind action acting behind behind that will be their intellect should be functioning and the ego i should be functioning all these put together then you start with the bash on a desire prompting us to go to the right go to the left i will sleep now i will wake up now i will do this i don't do this all these activities are possible with that and then you need god's grace god's favor we plan so many things in our life how many plants gets successful how many fail why you made your own effort there is the grace of god according to gita there is a need what god wills that will happen a good or bad whatever you think apparently so these are the things for with this association of this how many thing body the prana the life force two mana three buddhi intellect for ego five but these are not all bashana desires should be there behind to push this engine and even if push the engine do all these things there is a cosmic plan that's called god's will it should associate then you'll be successful or not successful or if it's god's will it will not happen it will not happen but it will happen it will happen so these are the five things necessary for doing any karma so how scientific right this is the universality of hindu religion it is not dogmatic thing you believe is that you know life we can match with this and we can justify ourselves yes this is happening you cannot ignore all these arguments so better to surrender god to god that comes the escape from this will of birth and death and this is will of birth and death comes because of my karma because my desire because of my another thing this way positive negative good bad all karmas are done five factors plus the eba means god's grace and your own vasuna desire and attempt attempt to do something but guyani he lives like a jorah like an inaudible analysis separates out everything i am neither the body not the mind not the intellect not the ego these are all physical things i am not that i am the conscious entity i am the conscious entity behind everything this type of analysis they make separate themselves i is not this i this petty little lie my that's why i fight with your eye why we fight all the time of you my eye your eye my saying i my mind is telling neither your mind is saying like that my understanding is that your understanding is there and there is the fight going on in hartman where is the fight you don't go to the background of all things the consciousness there is no fight all meanness unkindness stupidity happens in this body mind emotion ego of the desire i desire this way you desire that way and fight with each other we don't know what peace will come peace will never come in this when a pool is attempt you have to disidentify but you hang on to that level and bring back again and again and again and again and again and again and you want to be free we want to be happy so because ganny then know ganny does not mean intellectual knowledge we have intellectual knowledge we give big dog talk talks lectures advice but not that that will not do by proper analysis nirusha discarding jaraba this body is not functional by themselves dead body and this body no difference only prana is here working mind is working and in there there is no prana there is no mana there is no buddhi there is no ego so sarupe and what is that you have to analyze this that everything is matter only one thing is consciousness and that consciousness is brahman in hinduism we call brahman that conscious entity is the only thing reality and its nature is eternal bliss absolute peace absolute happiness absolute reality that is called sachidananda a knower of truth rests in that sachidondo and we live here either in the body or in the mind or my understanding your understanding why is it always i am the boss my understanding will be the best understanding yours are nothing not lost my ego is the best ego your ego is idiotic ego so there is the conflict comes karma comes there but these holy people they have raised their consciousness into that state of we call god simply in dualistic language we call god in vedantic language we call the in the paramatman in the supreme self which is all absolute bliss and joy miss santo you rest there that actually non-dual state they live therefore this body is karma body what is doing it has no connection with them they are resting in their absolute bliss that's why the story is there the this what is that story alexander the great he went to see a sadhu holy man in himalayas and the holy man was having nothing a naked no dress nothing smearing asses just in this rock in a rock lying down and the sun beam of sun sunbathing and alexander went and said hey sir with respect i am pleased with you how can you live like that so we want you to adore and respect come to my palace i will keep you with honor and dignity and he said what get out of my way i am sunbathing he's like a child he does not care and alexander got a little ego hit i am there i am the emperor alexander he is speaking like that then he took out his sword do you know i am this i can kill you and that penniless beggar no position nothing not even a cloth to wear his body and he burst into laughter in front of the sword you kill me you are a liar you told so many lies in life this is the greatest lie you are telling i am atman the fire cannot burn me water cannot soak me air cannot drive me i am atman i am pure sword cannot cut me it is good to say in this hall i am between good people and no one is with a sword in hand here when he face any danger ayam atman kill me how water is all intellectual genes boom and goes into their void so this is the therefore that they have no identification there and therefore they know this is java it is like the same like a piece of wood this body is the same is it not why you go to the doctor what they do they treat it words what they're making put into anesthesia and then do whatever they like they caught the heart and these beaming out the heart and or stitch somewhere add some to you here and screw here something and return you like a car your car workshop so it is jonah it is matter only the consciousness is that that is the reality so they live in that consciousness therefore they don't care what happens to the body so they have no karma they have nothing to gain nothing to lose they have attained but understand if you take this stand and you start become not doing anything you cannot reach that state of non-dual state where it's beyond karma you have to do karma and reach their state plateau where there is no karma therefore just so you follow you know karma so that karma is to be performed by us to go to the state of nourish karma a state where there is no karma and what you find in the brahmaganis like ramakrishna vivekananda christ buddhas rama's krishnas sri chaitanya what you see suriri sutijat karma in their body you see that they are working they are going he was born in jerusalem he is going to the sun on the mount he is giving advice here he is preaching this philosophy of love everywhere you see that karma that person these are not they it is not they are not doing any work they are reflected consciousness on the mind and body that is working and then you see his body is working but he is remaining in the conscious cell gyani is always in his own glory in his own divine light stands there and sanghas persona and there is no touch of this world and worldliness they are bhanubat loku karmabi they like the sun sun does the major work no but does sun and do anything a sunny sun in the sky but the whole world runs on the sun clock you get a what time son says you sleep for what time son says but son does not tell anything to you so similarly brahma ghanis they live in the world they dictate the world their message is speculated to the heart of us and we get the spiritual benefit of it but they are not affected by it at all now let us start the verse number 10. you can chant with me [Music] [Music] promoter [Music] [Music] his bitchurati grihokarji in the household work he is doing some household work but how they do not like us we do in my house i am doing this it is clean it is unclean but they do takto de ho vimano they do work there but there is no ego sense in them they give up the actual means give up what they give up the identification with the body they hold iman ego sense i am not doing my body mind is doing okay i am not the body not the mind i am holding i am not the car but i am the driving the i am the car in the sitting in the car the car is doing this the body is doing functioning exactly like the car moves that the the you taking example of uber example is good right you go you are the boss you say i like to go to santa monica just you enter into the uber car and say you don't do anything you just sit there the driver is driving the engine is moving the headlight is on left side right side signal is blinking on this time that time but you are doing nothing but you are the boss without doing anything you are moving from one place to another as it seems so in though you people see that this rama krishna is working vivekananda is in the chicago parliament of religion he's giving speech he is going to new york and starting this vedanta society there he is lecturing in pasadena and in blanchard hall and people are appreciating news men are coming you see all these things but he knows this body is working mind is working i am saccidananda that's why his powerful words influence the whole world because he's what he said he's not like us we are saying from our intellect that we are whatever we are expressing to our mind and he's speaking from deeper depth of consciousness that is coming out that's why that has so much impact do punish what are the upanishads what are the bhagavad-gita there are only some sayings but they become so strong and impact our life why because it is coming from sachidan on the consciousness the eternal self and it's coming straight to a channel where there is no cloud so that's why picharati grihokharje when they move around in the household duties or gotham they eat they sleep they take a shower they go to different places as i said some ebay can on the move even ramakrishna is going to dakshinesha to calcutta to meet the devotees talking to them isn't it body is moving giving up renouncing the idea that i am the body biharti or he's mixing with hundreds of people vivekananda how many hundreds of people will throng around him whenever he goes anywhere in the chicago parliament you forget there are seven thousand people they assemble for their lecture but that time also all are running over the benches and spews no to touch the gown of vivekananda and when he's speaking in outside in in the streets of new york and here and where people used to rush and look at him but he is living in his consciousness there is a story you know swami vivekananda used to go in san francisco he has to go to give a talk but you have to catch the steamer or some whatever communication so swamiji is working in his own rail and he thought that his shoes should be shining shoe shining should be done so he started for shining his attendants and other guests who were the devotees are saying swami will be late we'll be late in lecture then he said you live in time i live in eternity huh we'll say most impractical person but they live in eternity that's why they don't hurried like that there is no anxiety like that and he jokingly said if i don't go nothing will start because he is he's the speaker but such a sensible person talking like not very naturals talk but you can understand where is their mind you live in time yours is eight o'clock eight or eight five minutes to eight for me i live in eternity that that word is very important so biharity jana sange when it mixes in the community of people gathers gathering people loku chatra nurukam and they behave and talk like as we talk no but they are like the wind wind passes through and it carries what good fragrance flower just means it carries or it goes goes to a foul area it fouls male but the air does not get polluted it appears that the air has been polluted air cannot be polluted air is here but the fragrance or these bad smell it appears that he is gathering and he is bringing good progress bad fragrance but as air a air is unpolluted all the time so pavana sama bihari and how raga means attachment ours is i attach and sango is the association we associate with the world we get attached to it and there comes the reaction in other way we intellectualize that we are intellectual people the lawyers what they do intellectual people they can argue this way they can argue the other way the same case two people are fighting both are in intellectual level this interpretation means desire this service are your highness are sarsarsa and you said yes sir yes sir yes and good intellect will be winning who has a higher intellect no but two these are all intellectual things so he says and this holy people are like pure wind unattached by the fragrance like a pure wind carries the fragrance or the foul smell but air remains perfectly separate similarly this holy people raga sangha pramukhta they live in the raga human attachment and shanga means association they don't associate the leave appear to be associated like a wind is associated with as if it has become foul it is neither foul it is neither sweet it is that is it is always the same pure remaining their purity inside it appears to be as associated and appears to be attached but they are neither attached neither associated they remain free that's the beauty of the freedom freedom for all entanglement means and what did they leave how they live bella satin is playfully stay in their own divine self they rejoice in their inner self no as the holy man in the himalayas says don't disturb me i am sunbathing why are you talking to come to my palace and then and you are yes money you are standing in between the sun and me and here making me stopping my sun bath sand bath is much important than that of going to palace he has no attachment so this is the point below it those are the bit miss knower of the tattoo the supreme reality noah of the supreme object means unmanifest they don't manifest any sign of their brahmagana and there is no sign of brahmagani that holy mother said suppose you are a brahmanagani you realize god what will happen how shall i know oh he is brahman you are spiritual how are spiritual salicy a little horn is coming out one inch and then two inch and three inch then we know you are a brahmagani and no so a book the lingo you cannot see from outside a holy man and understand unless you have such inner potentiality inner purity in your heart or you will pollute every time and you will and this disbelieve that person or misunderstand about him and create all the trouble for yourself and himself so christ was crucified misunderstood so many honest people in the society they always get the brunt of all these idiots huh suffering comes but they don't feel that they are suffering because they live in their inner consciousness see the what a great grand philosophy and that what brahmagan why we study this book if you want to do you have to follow the footsteps of the brahman ghanis isn't that a beautiful verse 10th verse be charity we find that he is that brahmagani he or she whether she is engaged in the household chores they have given up their identity from their body identity biharity jana sange they leave in the community of people huge number of people are around his ramahani in the huge number of association singing dancing going to samadhi coming down in between talking this that that biharity they have no ego identity they think it is not i rama krishna's twisted mother mother i do not know anything mother is speaking you see we are reading advocating he has he didn't go to any school even don't write cannot write his own name and only by spiritual practice and meditation become a brahmagani like that and when he's giving the answers to this greatest scholars we have to deeply know the philosophy of it but he is spontaneously coming from his heart his mouth is speaking all those things and they are talking about nirvikalpa samadhi why this why that what a critical questions they are putting and what spontaneously swami uh bhutan and the lotu maharaj is responding to that because they are lokojatranurupum they live in the world like our masses as they live in the world but they are like they roam around in the world like a wind free from all entanglements entanglements of fragrance or foul smell they they leave but they never get attached we get associated with that because ramakrishna said if you live in the world of suit your your body will get little shoot here and there yeah how much you are careful but these are the people outwardly they appear to be affected but totally inwardly they are totally detached villa satin they enjoy they leave they play in their own form what is their own fun own divine form sachidan underground they always think i am unborn i am infinite i am that consciousness on which this body mind is floating and it is having its function i am not i am not the driver i am not the what you call this steering i am not the wheel i am not the headlight i am not the tail light i am not the mirror i am not the body of the engine i am nothing i am separate from the engine i am separate from the car so they always live in that awareness therefore they don't do any work and the work what is done that is done by the body-mind so its translation runs like that manifesting in human form body the knower of truth roams around in his own self renouncing his body identity he carries out household chores and enjoys himself in the company of the people conforming to the social customs when they go in a community they behave they eat with us a brahmagani will not eat with us if you want to have a lunch brahma ghani will eat with us apparently he is eating you are eating we are also eating but our consciousness is in one place and that holy people's consciousness remains in another level they may be chit-chatting also outside but they live in our inner consciousness ramakrishna said it is like a toothache when our tooth starts we do other things but no one needs to remind you we have to take truth remains all the time so the consciousness of god remains in their mind all the time though they behave do they act like us so conforming to social customs himself in the company of the people they live being absorbed in his real nature like the breeds sports around being free from passion attachment and similar such defects so they get free from rago chango promoto that means it is free from sprouts around being free from passion and attachment raga means passion and attachment so these are the two things which takes us to the worldly way but they become passionate for god so their internal awareness is always that consciousness what a beautiful life no even to hear about them gives us joy okay they never even in mistake make identity with the body it has been said in the upanishad so living in the society whether he eats whether he makes fun or with his friend with his relatives and seniors or juniors and enjoy the worldly thing happy and india outside on the outside well but he never even by mistake make his identity with a body that means making all external behaviors his consciousness remains identified with the atman shankaracharya have said those who have got initiated by their gurus and by that their ignorance have been removed that means following the guru's instruction they have understood that they are the atman and they are the mercy that i am that that knowledge which has driven out their ignorance and this leave in that consciousness of uncovered blemishes of the eternal brahmana that sage whether he is garlanded with golden items or she's playing with the young girls remain in the one place and does all activities thus he lives in that state of that witness and doing all works remains the unattached untainted by the idea of i am the doer i am the enjoyer all those things and another punishment another scripture also supports the same idea but [Music] as pure water how much you pour water on a lotus leaf the lotus leaf does not get wet it only holds and little water wind comes and the water rolls down no attachment have you seen lotus leaf and if you put in water it will appear that is as if it is standing there but it is so detached that little wind comes and it rolls water drop rolls down it becomes free so they live in the world they are in the all this worldly thing as we are living but they are totally free from that in the similar way that this it is like the sound test touch this type of objects it is like a water and is knower of truth is like a leaf so they are not yet attached to these things therefore those who are naivastic in chit carbon those who are enjoying the place of the atman they are fully satisfied these yogis have no duty and if there is any duty then you know he is not in war of truth if he feels i am doing this it is my duty a brahman has no duty but it does to demonstrate the world other you will be all will we all what you call escapist even bhagavan gita also said you see i am the lord of the world but still i am engaged in work all the moment why because i have no duty i have no responsibility to do because i am the lord of the world what is my duty but still i do to show that this world will have to work to go beyond work in this world or in the other world there is no duty either in this world or after death anywhere they have no karma and he is fully economic in their vision he sees everywhere the brahman everywhere we see man woman good bad and this brahman ganesh ganesha's this all the divine sitting in different costume they can understand the costume also we see the costume only we do not know what is inside inside is all god whatever i am saying it is nothing but god only different costume and shape and size therefore they have denounced that and this tie of the world and worldliness they have cut those ties and had attained to a state of non-action therefore there is no duty no responsibility for one who is a no arab truth and they are always unattached beyond all action and they have remain perfectly satisfied in the fullest non-dualistic experience and they say what they say king karumi kagachami king beautiful he says what shall i do where shall i go king nami what shall i grab or collect majami king whom shall i pray because everything is permeated by my own divine self my divine self that is this conscious self the self which is full of bliss is here and is permeated everywhere so where shall i go wherever i go it is i am there whatever i see it is i only myself not this small eye but this big i which identifies with the infinite i am that i so i have no duty i have no okay so we in here only one verse we have read that's also good it is the tenth verse we have read today if any question anyone have any question you people have any question so no problem there is no sign external sign that you can recognize that he is a brahmana that's the problem because there is an external sign we think any idiot can be fool us he can beat a drum i am ibrahim come to me ah if you come one thousand dollar then i can give you brahma gano within five minutes or 21 days huh that's a sign of course there is a sign the sign is that we are here that those people because of their egoless mental state they like pure people those who love god they find their association ramakrishna was crying and weeping come come me boys i cannot live without you who are pure in heart i am tired of talking to people of world and worldliness i cannot bear that talking about money all the day and night money wealth these that every day goes that way what you gain where when will you gain your divine nature which is free from all danger of duality of suffering of pain or agonies why did you get when will you get it and so he's crying crying crying for them so bihur tijuana sange even in the mix midst of the people in a group of gathering they live back to the home giving up their identity that i am the body this identity papanasama they will move in the world like a pure wind blowing rago sangha pramukhtar free from mukta means pre pramukhta means totally free totally free or free from every aspect of life of what free defense i am the body i am the body is the cause of all suffering you know all suffering starts there if i say i could have been we then how much change will happen i will eat if i say we will eat what makes a difference you see i expanded there and you feel i cannot be without you they are called the holy people no those who make it i to we and evil people in the world we to i only i only i only i i i i i that's why somebody can understand selflessness here we are taking the right example we want to be we means we for good purpose we can make a gang gang members we so that need not be taught in the spiritual class that people do all by their own way so there that that's a different way all the negative people and they gather together all the durham and all the india so that's we yeah and that is not our concern that is taking them to where to more negativity more ignorance and that will uplift if this for we means expands at least there also some development is happening he is not only thinking of himself he is thinking we as a group we will fight that you identification see when you think you are alone and you think of your friend also with you then your strength increases because you expand yourself that is the part you have to take positive or negative negative side is of course it will have a negative effect but the broadness of the heart is there among them not only thinking i but when they say we the philosophically it is true they also gain some benefit everywhere any spiritual organization there we and not only that we means you think of others i will eat we will eat i will be happy we will be happy and as you said true it can be used in a negative sense but there is also expansion there is also expansion but that expansion is a misdirected expansion you know car will move front gear or back gear if you keep it frontier car moves this way and give the same back gear it moves that way but the expansion happens the energy comes the spirit comes but is applied in wrong direction and that is applied in the right direction we say we will sing song we will do bhajan we will pray together we will do japan we do 24 hours we will do japan that we need we we identify with our a positive way and then we will gather together to destroy that house today to vomit that's also we but there is that force is there energy is there totality groupie group is total there rather than i single that is the expansion side but the force generated is applied for positive direction or negative direction the main thing we are reading here karma karma for whom that is the point and karma is for those people who are bound by their highness meanness samkaras are just message there that it is i and mine this is me this is mine and associating these me and mine the whole world runs if it is dee and thine the what will ukraine what is going on what is russia what is ukraine me mine or the thine same thing as it happens in small home why we fight together i you when you say we then love then affection that where fight is coming when i am separating from we when you are saying we are in this small example in your home husband and wife they can be totally united and blissful and joyful and peaceful but they can eye and eye we becomes i then fight similarly in a community go in it in a county go one county to the other county neighboring county go to one state to the other state expand the same way the same way one one state to the other state russia to this to us to this india whatever happening there is highness with the holy of india ines with the whole of russia ines with whole of u.s those people who identify themselves and they are what they are saying as if the whole u.s is saying are you saying what u.s president says why all the russian people are talking what the putin is saying no but that is the way i and we the whole world will be in peace if it is only we what comes in our life and we can see why the world is so so bad because always we have we have been forgotten i i i and if there is no peace in the home with two people how can we expect peace in thousands of people so this improvement of character is necessary not talking big things every moment fighting with each other and trying to be spiritual it is a nonsense rather make it ooey and as a result let the little ego abolish gradually and that we should expand expand in a positive way our our path is very simple vedanta path is there it's a one absolute consciousness and bliss everywhere we are only different ripples in the ocean of consciousness think that and dissolve all duality and find the unity unity in diversity some is beautiful lectures are there unity in diversity so we end here because you have no question today wonderful so i am thankful to you for no question huh only one question is it necessary that one must experience samadhi before attaining moksha moksha and samadhi are the same we use the term in the same way moksha means liberation samadhi means state when our little petty ego will be totally merged into the cosmic consciousness so their question stands the before attending mokshana it will be parallely as much as we move towards moksha liberation that means we get absorbed in god and when you are perfectly absorbed in god in samadhi then you are totally free from all duality so they go parallelly mokshaward and sama samadhi world they go parallelly as you move towards the moksha liberation means spread from all entanglements and moves towards the truth and samadhi your mind moves into that absolute merging into the truth when they too parallelly move that means when you attain moksha in vedantic term you attend samadhi and they need to be called pasamadi there are some of the variety types of samadhi as they give the variety types of samadhi sabikaro nirvikaro swabicharo nirvicharo like you may say i give it i went under the sea you can go under the sea ten cubic 10 feet down you take a scooper dive you can go down and down and down each experience is different but overall we can say you are under the sea so when you reach the ultimate level of diving deep into the bottom of the ocean that is the samadhi then you're all world going on on the surface of the ocean how many ripples how many waves how many things everything calm and still there in the bottom of the ocean think of that perfect stillness there's no sound no disturbance in the top of these ocean surface storm billows waves ripples one wave hitting the other way it going on but in that depth nirvikalpa there is nothing absolute stillness this is a good way of meditating on the concept of samadhi we are all fighting every moment one wave giving another brain and all these day life is dive deep go down that infinite calmness infinite serenity infinite peace that's why ramakrishna is to that thing dive deep type deep type deep oh my mother mind okay he wanted to say any question so that is that is that is my idea that samadhi in the ultimate samadhi experience is equal to moksha means you have attained the liberation there is nothing to bind you you are free from all entanglements all doubts all confusions attaining this perfect state of peacefulness and absolute joy and ending joy okay tell it thank you [Music] tomorrow we will be having gospel class at 7 30 to 8 30 like today
