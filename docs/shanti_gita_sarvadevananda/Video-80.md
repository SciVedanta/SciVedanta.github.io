[75. Shanti Gita - Class 75 - chapter 7- verse 4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v12yEYdcqbo)

mail Thomas [Music] [Music] oh Lord lead us from the unreal to the real read us from Darkness to light did ask from Death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face oh peace peace peace so we are in the seventh chapter last time we read verse number the question was that what is the sign of a person who has identified himself with the Atman please tell me that and then SRI bhagavan said in the verse through two that the Consciousness is in the heart like that with thumb and that reality is to be understood by a very sharp intellect and concentrated in mind and and all the scriptures talk about that consciousness as residing in the heart of all in the form of like the size of a tongue and now we start our reading today verse number four five and all onward so what does it say fourth verse says [Music] foreign [Music] unobstructed space in that unobstructed great space he put one picture um then you say this picture is occupying the space you call the space occupied by the picture his space occupied by outside and inside it divides this wall has divided say a border of an U.S border Mexico border the space there is no line there is no but we say hey your plane has crossed our borderline so how is borderline it is a space is the space there is no such division but you have me prepared a line of demarcation and we imagine vertically that goes up to this sky and your military troops should not come to my military to because you are crossing our space so similarly though there is no division so we create division similarly if you put a picture there is no picture you put the picture you can the space teacher space and space outside so we did we said these two ways foreign but you can say this is our house this is my rule that is your room all this relative thing you are creating in the Infinite Space so as you can create separation in this way there comes a opportunities occasion to think about this space Gautama in the middle of the ghata what is remaining in the suppose ocean water oh water is everywhere now you put your bucket then you say water bucket water bucket water has no real meaning because it's a watered inside water outside and if it is made of perforated material like clay then water penetrates into that also so there is no division the space is like that but we make a division this is the abutorial so that will be the idea people foreign by the scholars of the world they say that akasho is divided into two segment space occupied by the Akash whatever means the picture and space outside we make a distinction in early quarters [Music] foreign [Music] and be beautiful with this example being carried out this body think body is a picture if the body is there that says we have inside we have outside so one consciousness which is inside and the same Consciousness is outside no but we make a distinction I here thinking by Body Mind picture is making a distinction in the Infinite Space so that's why it is said that means unchanging glutamins which is not money changing his position or changing his side safe good it is the example is given like a in traditional example you go to the blacksmith shop nowadays you don't see them they used to make all types of a speed Rings iron Rings iron chain and will Anvil is calcutters to Advil does not change but upon it things get changed means are changing Consciousness unchanging Consciousness in the similar manner or buddhi or intellect imagines our intellect imagines I am this this Consciousness In Me Is Here and this is or the space occupied mind my body you see a man dies what happened the space occupied by the man goes away I am now holding a body I am occupying certain space but when someone dies his body is burnt the word space go do space walk out or get him space human space in your imagination you are thinking you have occupied some space similarly Consciousness is one consciousness in your buddhi in your understanding your thought I am this body I am this mind so you are making a separation in your understanding intellectual understanding that might go beyond mind so long mind is there buddhi is there so this this distinction and discrimination happens so he says in a similar manner but the intellect in the intellect kulpita it is imagine what is called when it's called when some imagination comes in the Buddhism that Consciousness which is [Music] immutable consciousness foreign that means it is the consciousness limited by the intellect in your mind you are thinking that there is no division in Space the main purpose of this verse to say there is no division in consciousness as there is no division in the space only you make a space that I have purchased a land oh how big is your land oh my land is 1.3 acre huh is there any Infinite Space like 1.3 acre it is all this space you have mentally thought I possess this land no you say I have entered in a new home everyone has how many square feet oh 400 square feet he one thousand square feet where is 1000 square feet in the species space you break the wall then it is the same space and even if you don't break the wall the space inside and outside you cannot separate out it's so fine it penetrates the wall it penetrates the rocks and mountains everywhere you cannot make a simple the whole globe is rotating in the space so wherever the globe is there it is occupying that space but it really space is divided into this and that it's just a mental imagination similarly Dakota the unchangeable consciousness is remaining the same we were thinking in your buddhi that I am our children I am Limited so this is the great idea for vedanta student to think that I am that pure Brahman how to think I am that pure woman this is the way to think that I as a space Infinite Space and the space within the picture is the same there is no difference similarly Consciousness which is apparent here and the cosmic Consciousness there is no separation but who makes the separation is your buddhi your intellect creating this distinction intellect function is to say this is this this is that this is not this this is this so buddhi or intellect that means all spiritual life remains in Buddhism purification of the intellect understanding in the whole society lives on purification of understanding when misunderstanding comes what is that then the big countries all raising their atomic a what you call there so all the missiles and anti-missiles and all fighting misunderstanding and one word good word comes in it okay we withdraw everything no it's happening where in the mind so the all the distinction is happening in the mind impure mind I impure mind in in impure intellect is the same but here pure mind will all distinction vanishes pure mind is clear glass you see through the clear glass impure mind is is seeing to the clouded lens so this is the point to understand the distinction between individual Consciousness and the cosmic Consciousness that is the subject here foreign as the pandits normally call that as Qatar was got in the space occupied by the picture when you put a picture in in the middle of a space big space similarly that means unchangeable consciousness that imagines that I am this it is the expression of Consciousness then that this is called individual Consciousness so individual Consciousness and Cosmic Consciousness have no distinction accepting it is distinction is done by our intellect so when a Potter creates a picture in the Great Space learn it people of the world refer to the space inside the picture to be space limited by the picture understand is the old traditional example picture example is good because picture is made of the clay and Clay the space can penetrate easily it is to be understood space penetrates into the thickness of the picture wall inside is space outside his face and even the thickness that's why this body what you see if you imagine that this is a picture placed in the infinitution of consciousness so what is inside is the same Consciousness outside is the same Consciousness and when the understanding goes to that one they feel that entire body is permitted with that consciousness Bliss and peace that's why thrill experience Joy absolute articulation comes in the whole body because it penetrates into the every poor of the personality so that is the very easy and easy easy example to understand this Cosmic principle when the intellect is imagined in the immutable Consciousness then the unchangeable Consciousness and changing Consciousness shines forth as if it is blessed within the intellect you verily are that consciousness which is limited by intellect and regarded as individual soul so what you are you are only that consciousness infinite Consciousness only limited by the intellect that is regarded as individual so individual all individual soul is nothing but an intellectual concept that infinite Consciousness is divided into two and feeling that I am an individual soul so aham and Brahma this distinction happens um that's why is it clear this is this is though very example is old example but this is to understood that this distinction whatever is done that's why syrama businesses again again knowing one is called knowledge began knowing many is called again is ignorance but opposite in the society if you know many things then you are a gani if you ask some question you know all your replies of the question so what do you say my God he knows everything what again but that is again because buddhi your intellect is split into so many things and you know the object in his apparent value but when the Mind becomes pure no one sees Multiplicity yeah what they see they see the Oneness what is Brahma Brahma Ghana means that knowledge when it Dawns that person sees only God everywhere nothing but God so how then we see one seeing one comes when the buddhi becomes purified but if person baby in this material world very intelligent person but he is intelligent but he is not in War of Brahman that is a different intelligence necessary when it is free from all attachment anger acts money feeling of Duality or gone from that intellect then that intellect gives us the wisdom I that type of cleverness is the real cleverness people are clever in the world and do so many things and get a good credit but real cleverness is to know that there is no many it is only one that solute one so so when a Potter creates a picture they Suppose there is there is empty space no you go to the Potter shop did you see how they do there is a will and put the clay very they prepare the clay in a very ideal way and they have their hand finger touch is such they create the shape and size of the Future No when it is not created space is the only space but as soon as a picture is created that we call space within the picture space outside the picture so when the body was not here we didn't have any we didn't occupy any space now body has come into being and as I am growing I am becoming bigger and bigger I'm occurring bigger and bigger space but really are in in encroaching into space this way or that way it is the same space so similarly the Consciousness which is individually here which is everywhere it is all the same only distinction is our misunderstanding intellectual misunderstanding the Potter creates efficient in the Great Space learned people of the world refer to the space inside the picture to be space limited by teacher called similarly when the intellect is imagined in the immutable Consciousness your buddhi I am something this conviction is Imagine in the infinite Consciousness then the unchangeable consciousness that there is no change in the Consciousness no no change in the space you say oh the the sky has become polluted sky does not get polluted anytime no bomb say bomb busting or a fire or sword can cut the space can do any change in the space the space is space all the time pure sometimes pollution comes somebody pollution goes but space does not change for that so thus artman never changes pollution comes negativity comes positivity comes it goes comes Atman is ever pure that's why vedanta's philosophies Atman is pure all the time Untouched by any malice it may appear that's evidences what is this this is apparent it appears like that You Are a Human Being you are doing good you are a good man bad man you're a spiritual you are non-spiritual these are all clouds which has come in between the pure space it will come it will go the pot will be here pot will break one day and the pot is created God does not remain in the world no body no structure remains in the world forever it breaks one time it goes back to space again so this is very important idea for meditation in vedantic way that the same Consciousness which is in me still fine this example is given think of you like a picture ramakrishna gave that one meditation formula that you think that you are like a pitcher made of clay your body is made of such a thing and you are just dipped inside the ocean ocean water water water water water water inside also in the picture who is nothing but water only the thickness of the wall of the picture maybe 100 times different types thousand times different we differ there but even that difference is interpenetrated by the water so water is inside water is outside our water is even the imaginary buddhi Etc which makes me different from you they are also the same Consciousness same so think of that think is closing your eyes sitting in the shine or you are walking around or even thinking them if you have the power to do do that first do it here so that it comes to the working time if you are a matured person yeah mature person can with eyes open keep the conscious mind into that level of thought but it does not come so easily I will talk about even Mulo potato rice and garvanjal and I'll see Brahman that will not show easy so that's why to make the Mind free from garbanjal and potato and rice you know and then put when it's saturated with the thought of God or that thought of this consciousness if one can think of course it is possible why not walking in the street looking at the trees your mind should be there but how the mind will be there if you keep the Mind knowledge in the garbage of the world so that is the point problem so if you want to remove the garbage from the world we need to sit in the isolated meditation and then taking that advantage while walking while seeing things we can do that that's why vedanta is your your brother Brahman is there when you close your eyes and you open your eyes Brahman is gone vanished should not be it should be here it should be there that's the practical application it's a good Joy if one can think in this way about the Consciousness if one can think a really great achievement similarly when the intellect is imagined in the immutable Consciousness that suppose immutable Consciousness is there and then it's unending Consciousness everywhere ocean of Consciousness and there you put one concept of intellect I my understanding I understand I am this I am that you put that concept there's a concept and there is when people get into the samadhi their concept godavi therefore they do in the body but they are beyond the limitation of the body mind emotions and ego so imagine immutable Consciousness then the unchangeable Consciousness shines forth as he respects to it in the intellect then that unchangeable Consciousness shines forth to the intellect intellect was covered so the light was not coming now intellect is this my intellect has covered this this body I am the body and that covering is so dark the inner light is not shining forth when that intellect will be purified Moon ramakrishna said [Music] when your mind will be purified when your buddhi will be understanding or intellect will be clean so there is no distinction only depends on the purification of the intellected Divine is a very beautiful term and that is practical thing everyone should practice so that that should the purity of the Soul comes in without that no spiritual experience possible Buddhism that's why people take satta food even food starting from physical food to your everyday movement of life every thought you think you you are the creator of your thoughts to the intellect and the thought is god-centered thought or worldly centered thought when you think of worldly thoughts you are polluting the mind and your Cloud you are putting another layer of cloud on it and when you want to think of God one layer of cloud is you're trying to wipe out so when that wiping out continues day and night then this clear glass will give the idea what is inside what is outside same Consciousness permeate same Joy ocean of Joy here and here that's why Shakur is to say that there came one sadhu one holy man in dakshineswar and he used to gate up in the early morning and with the rising of the sun he will come out of his meditation place and used to clap his hand and dance and sing what a beautiful God everywhere seeing that God's presence everywhere singing the glories of God seeing the presence of the Divine you really are the Consciousness therefore you are merely the Consciousness but limited by the intellect and then you say I am a Jiva you are the same consciousness sachidananda limited by the intellect ego buddhi Buddhism our channel is limited money limited only putting in limitation of buddhi you say individual I am individual so you are something different from all this distinction comes I now eat everything comes so it is only the consciousness but when you are putting some veil of ignorance and ignorance in the form of your intellect that is the cause of all suffering now sixth verse them [Music] [Music] foreign the scripture like Vedas the sastras those who are bisharada bisharadm means experts the experts of The Vedas the bed of scriptures Jesus you see this is called This is called the knowledge Supreme knowledge that as gayanti so you do that Scholars of The Vedic scriptures seeing the glory of that Supreme knowledge all the scriptures are talking about the glory of the Atman glory of the Brahman so this is the Brahman which is immutable Consciousness all pervaded Consciousness where there is no limitation created by your buddhi or my buddhi that buddhi is gone buddhi then that is that that is called Brahman that is called the praganum that's ideal the highest knowledge and the only Anand Brahma visheshita they only Define it how what is Brahman the two words what is that means it is defined or characterized by the adjective or attribute what is that it is called the Bliss two adjectives Bliss and Brahma Brahma and Ananda these two words they use for this reality so the erudite Scholars the scholars the vedanta pandits they always say sing the glory of this Atman the glory of this Brahman the glory of this Cosmic principle which is called this is called the program and that's why they say one great victim Brahma is the knowledge knowledge is Brahman not this material knowledge that Supreme knowledge the absolute knowledge knowledge of the kakutasta the undefinable unchangeable reality so the experts are in the scriptural knowledge of The Vedas they say they call it is another one they express this normally in their scriptures always Brahman Ananda you know Ananda Ananda is the brahmana no Brahman what is the Brahman how do you understand what is Brahman there is so two words are used Ananda and Brahma these are the two words the scholars this Adept in scriptures they use these two adjectives therefore Sankara just says oh that's more to go inside the same idea yeah our children and now he's dividing I said no I need not go to that details huh it is if you have any question then you can discuss otherwise he's going into detail that's good to know let's say this is individual says foreign foreign okay hello what is the what is the conclusion do we get the conclusion they started with this discussion that there is one space Infinite Space an infinite space we create Division and in that space we say my body your body my my body is my Kata my spotter my support that is a part this is a part that is a part and you are occupying certain space similarly infinite Consciousness infinite Bliss is occupying little in this spot in this body my body I am understanding I see I know because of the Consciousness behind this body mind reflected to that expression is coming but there is no separation Consciousness is the same whether here or there and that example has been carried out that it is all the scriptural experts experts in the scriptures those Vedas they are they sing the glories of that program that knowledge that Cosmic knowledge and they term it in two languages with this adjective of pragana and Brahma that the Anand and Brahma they use these two to indicate that that is unchanging you cannot divide anything [Music] Ananda and Brahma they are the same their glory of the program is there many many expressed they are expressed in their society as Brahman and on Brahma that's it we are talking about the program program is the absolute knowledge and that is everywhere that is the fundamental top and they are they are expressed in two languages one is Ananda and it is [Music] so seven verses what is this programming or to say that it is to the knowledge you only know everything 7 verses srinathi srinoti you know music [Music] you know exactly like that huh you hear by by what by whose power you will share what is the behind the ear this year does not here the nervous system does not hear your carriers brain does not hear it is only an instrument it and neurons are agitated this way that way it carries to the Mind mind does not do mind is Jodha matter buddhi does not do it is also matter ego does not do it is also matter tell you what is that there is that Consciousness so that Consciousness which you talked about praganam that program is everywhere but how do you understand in you in the island and Brahma two words and use that but when you look at your personal life every experience you are having by whom you know by whom by what consciousness you know janati you know thing I know something how do you know I did what he does not know when you are sleeping you do not know so what what is your we know I almost don't know in the deep sleep you know but you don't know so you know see let us take the experience the gross experience in the waking State experience you know when you smell something how do you feel oh it is good smell oh it is bad smell S no what what is the Consciousness conscious entity behind that allows you to say this you see how do you see eyes don't see you know you can see like this your mind is somewhere you don't see anything a big thing may happen before your eyes but your mind is absorbed in somewhere you don't see it all you don't hear that that means eyes don't see you can say step by step eyes don't see but eyes are instrument but it sees see seeing Cassidy is the consciousness I am how we say I am conscious of it what is that Consciousness that is the program that is called the Ananda that is expressed in Anand and Brahman and srinotija by which you know by which you hear see how you can smell the test of Assad and good test you know by what power cheetah you understand it's cold usna is warm today is a hot day how do you know what is that you know music etc etc these are all known how do you know [Music] [Music] Consciousness awareness the feeling comes because that Brahman but caitanya is a substance feeling is the pain what is an experience all our feelings of emotions and anger and trustition joys and suffering even those first they say seeing hearing etc etc now going one step down all the feeling of emotions love hatred anger frustration this is called the vedana the feeling inside that is the ground up that is the caitanya Consciousness is the ground of that that Consciousness is the ashrae or the substratum of all your feelings and emotions so you see you're seeing in a gross object but you're feeling I like it I dislike it I hate it that feeling also that is reflected by that Consciousness you can hear something see something eat something if eating something you may feel some irritation or you can be extremely happy but that feeling also it's a ground of that feeling is the same consciousness foreign it indicates what it indicates all aksham you cannot point out something it is it is beyond your pointing to any goal that means it is infinite pure Consciousness and it is unchangeable so that is the ground of all perception a ground of all feeling emotions or feeling of Joys and suffering heat and cold and everything that has been defined by it is not Shri Krishna says I am not saying do upanishads the sages the riches they have declared this that all aksham that is the caitanya pure Consciousness is unchangeable that is all aksham you cannot Define it you cannot just describe it or can indicate it it is like this you cannot say anything so it says then erudite scholarship Vedic scriptures sing the glory of that Supreme knowledge to ghanam and Define it by two adjectives Bliss and Ananda and Brahman and now seven and eight but we did just now that by which one hears knows Seas smells and recognizes the experiences of test cold heat Etc that is the awareness in the form of Sensations and is very little source of all Sensations this is indicated by the upanishads as invisible immutable pure consciousness no that is the verse 7 and that is the end of eight foreign feeling is expressed that way okay so we can we can end here if you have any questions [Music] just meditate what we read is enough think of the khatta think that you are a pitcher your body is a picture thing that is dipped into the ocean of space so we are seeing individual soul I am individual so there is no individual soul there is nothing it is all Consciousness but how we are doing that because we are thinking buddhi in our understanding impure intellect thinking I am this physical structure and but everywhere the Consciousness new even doctors will say your Consciousness is from you see I am paralytic what paralysis that you are not feeling the awareness but yeah everywhere it is all permitted into that that Consciousness from the toe to hey that's the hair is growing every day here is no less Consciousness is there in the bad sense of consciousness but it's going to different layers of our personality but the think about that but I am that Consciousness again and again makes it our spiritual life in the verse number seven the meaning when SRI ramakrina describes himself as a machine that his mother Kali acts through he is verse 7 the meaning seven verses meaning uh does it say so oh if you say that this Consciousness is Mother yeah okay the music We Sing amazantri that is the song no so the yes that can be taken in that way it says Consciousness or he says mother is the force by which my hand is raised my feeling is happening I have a pain I am feeling good food a good taste everything feeling emotion understanding everything is coming by mother you call Mother and someone said foreign if you equate that only terminology is not the important the Consciousness is permits the Consciousness I am the instrument but you are the machine Machinist he knew is the power so you as Consciousness oh mother you remain in me as Consciousness and as you drive I I only run so this is the language of the devotion but ideology philosophy is the same it is the Consciousness we are indicating mother is not a simple limited person standing over there is not that like that he she is permeated everywhere and she's at the base and ground of every existence every action every reaction so yes we can take it as mother Kali acts to us if you are a mother devotee but you have to understand mother is sachidananda she is the source of all in reality apparent reality everything is permit energy you know which you know the I am hearing because of you I'm seeing people because of you you are the conscious entity giving the strength and power behind everything another question is there such a thing as pot space of course Sports space is there so long the pot is there you talk you don't you say that in my room and this this I have kept this big jar in early days you don't even put nowadays in early these people used to made ardinjar to keep rice and other things you know in India at least so it takes oh this room is small and my jar has taken so much space no your box and why not think they would forget jar you say your box yeah your your travel box or big bag traveling book bag carry-on bag not carry on what do you call it suitcase okay just press is taking too much space in your room if it's a small room I have no room for the suitcase all right the suitcase taking some space so similarly the jar is taking space you put 10 jars in this room then you will not be able to move so freely because it has taken some space so actually does space exist in the port or does the pot exist in the space you are correct pot exists in the space in a pot you put that pot here so space is there and you say it's it is taking the space so pot is actually placed in the space you're right this is a Sunday question Sunday lecture question okay so what we are reading whether the ghosts which made SRI ramakrishna at golgo gulapmas gulab Nana gopalesma it should be corrected why did not they request him to liberate them instead of requesting him to leave them alone that's the question even God comes before us shall we ask give me Liberation give me darshan will say oh Lord you have come give me one hundred thousand let me have a lottery I can gain one million so so it depends upon even if God comes who is asking for highest experience the ghosts they are in the day those ghosts they are not so pure that they will be their mind will ask for God realization so they think that we are happy as the as the people are happy with mundane things no so they are happy in their life and freedom from all bondage is a real yearning but it does not come whether you are in a gross body or in a subtle body your mind is the same mind no here I am here I am here with the physical body plus my inner body is the mind and intellect the mind is that when I die what will happen the same mind will go into the subtle body mind remaining the same so my tendency my desire My Level of spirituality all will be there [Music] let us remember you know one old lady poor lady Widow and she has no other means no one no no one is there in the world to support her so she is to go into the forest and collect some firewood and carry them and sell them and maintain herself like that so every day she was calling upon God oh God why not come and just let me die what is this line every day to carry this load and earn little money and so much toiling and little for food God is gracious with everybody she he is not gracious on me I don't want to carry on this type of life so one day God become very pleased and he appeared okay okay come so come with me I didn't ask you to go take me there but I cannot lift this bundle so put it on my head so he is she's asking God to help and when God came actually she was not ready for that she said oh I am happy with it put the loan on my head so that I can carry it I cannot lift myself alone so you help me to so we want more load to carry on our head who now wants God ramakrishna said people sit at a Jar full of tears foreign who cries for God so this those ghosts even we look at us how much we want God who is feeling that today is gone in West I have not realized God who Rama used to cry every day seeing the sun setting another day is gone oh mother I have not seen you you have not come in my life now so so I think these ghosts are also like that they are not in that level so that they want liberation so they want to have their own area to live in their own thought level okay so I think done actually peace peace peace so tomorrow will be tomorrow will be the Swami medha no no no no foreign [Music] giving the talk in the evening 7 30. please come message
