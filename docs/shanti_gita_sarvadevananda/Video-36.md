[33. Shanti Gita - Class 33 - Chapter 4 - Verses 5-7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrm_xqq4DMo)

[Music] lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all we are on the shanti gita and on the chapter 4 we were reading they started the question started arjuna put this question because arjuna was grieved because of the death of his son it is very difficult for father to lose a bright son who was a great warrior and in the war he was killed not following the decorum of the principles of what is called of the uh reward principles and they they and seven seven great warriors unethically killed one young boy of sixteen or 17 like that so you know this father was so grieved when he came he totally got lost and despondent and then he put this question i will not fight what is the use of this my son is gone and as it happens so once gita was given which gita we know bhagavad-gita and this is gita called shanti gita then krishna advised arjuna and listening to this advice his grief he could come conquer he got peace of mind so that is this book for and we are on the fourth chapter and before that she is not told that that is all misha this is all mitha this is not real here that is the vedantic teaching this is all mitta it is not at all the the way you see it is all brahmana it is all reality you are seeing because of your identification attachment you are feeling that you are lost your son no one is dead like that same so fourth chapter started with then then why do we see all these things then arjuna said yeah maya you say maya the chapter one start fourth started with that i'm just connecting the old verses four verses the maya you said my eye is misha it's all the form of mitta it's non-existent no karjan and if maya is not real its effect is also impossible if there is no head where will be the headache like that example if someone says a baron mother has given a birth to a child and their child was a king of the country and then he ruled the world and they had a big big fight all these future words are useless redundant because you are mistaken at the very beginning you said a barren mother so there cannot be any child so if there is no child why are you talking about all these stories about that so if maya is mitha if it is not there then why this universe why where from this come that was the question so sri bhagavan says verse number three this is [Music] you are seeing this manifold multiple activities with rupa show it is the it is not true but it appears something else that false form appearing to you in so many ways asato example like also bhujago rajum ashat means not it is not true that bhujago the snake snake is not truly there rajum but you are creating snake idea on the raju the rogue and janaet bay potung bhayam and that snake imagined snake on the rope creates the terror and fear and your heart starts biting palpitation heart palpitation you run you cry you eat so it is happening that is the thing happens they that is the way we see this universe that is the third verse which we read the last time and then he says example is another example he has gay given someone sees a piece of say um in the in the in the ocean you go you will find that there are some oyster cells so many oyster cells and somatic oh that is a what is called silver because it shines on the sun sun rays falls on a oyster cell it sometimes shines and people thinking that oh this is not he's not thinking of the oyster cell at all he's thinking it is silver imagining silver on the oyster cell what people do love it it creates some types of mohan means mesmerizing impulse to grab it and to find joy in that it happens people do that mistake but when you go close to that what you find there is nothing it is only a oyster cell get frustrated but here if you take the lower the greed the tendency to have it all these feelings meaningless when you go and see it but beforehand you are attracted to it you are attached to it you feel joy in seeing that so these are the impulses created in our mind so similarly this maya has created some which is not there some attraction for that and when you go to grab it and it vanishes is it not look at our lives all the things oh that is that will give me joy and bring that joy whatever subject you like light that will give me joy and keep it with you and then after one day two days three days you see oh it is not that joyful as i thought of it someone thinks if i had a what car bmw now now more sports car so i will be happy you have the car then what happiness afterwards it's a car you may give you some pride i am riding a costly car but you are yourself thinking no one thinks one is like you are doing a great job so but it is the mental creation we create our joy we create our frustration we create our anger these are all based on false things which is non-existing it's not there had it been there it would give joy all the time or it will be fearful all the time no it does not sometimes it is creating joy the same thing brings so much misery in that's untested affair any sunset object which gives joy to me today becomes a cause of suffering tomorrow you have a beautiful bokeh flower you purchased and you are very happy happy happy okay bring it and put it in your room and decorate nicely and then afterwards few days it withers out it drops off then what do you do then the water in the in the in the face water becomes dirty it's male bad then what do you do that which you thought it is joy is same thing becoming the opposite so this is not real that in that sense [Laughter] yes babies when they're born they're really joy and then when the baby grows in the adult and does not listen to mom and dad and then behave then he said oh my god and then and and when the child or the young girl or boy does something totally against the opinion of the mom and dad they get so angry frustrated i don't want to see the face of that boy or they currently really you love that boy and girl and he learned it with so much love and affection that which was the cause and that is becoming like that this is the play this is the thing going on it is not in one case these are rude facts of life no but we don't understand that's why we get attached to it and we think they are real they hear the question is it real or unreal the you said how this mitha arjuna's question how this mytha which is unreal can create so much of varieties yes it can vary create variety but mithta is mitta all drama is also false all the all the scenery which is going on this is also false this is not real it is a movie it's a drama it's called nataka then there is there's a chapter in the pancho doshi it's a vedanta text which says that it is not a deeper there is a deeper means a light lamp that is constant but all the scenes which are coming in the stage sometimes lobstering going on some sort of hatred sometimes killing sometimes beating to death no the lamp remains the same lamb does not get illu means both whether good or bad momentary things coming and going these are mitha but the lamp is true because lamp shines all the time so atman is the lamp it shines all the time this mitta play this drama is going on in one way or the other way and other way or we cannot believe that is a drama yes when you realize god the scripture said then you know it is all drama it has no reality all the activities it is all created as our movie big movie budget is 1 billion even no so what is that it's a creation fantasy of someone's mind some screenwriter they have written something edited by something producer has taken up then he selected the who will play in what role these people are all good people they don't have any hatred they don't have any love they have no vengeance or anything but someone take a part of villain and someone is taken for the part of this so all have selected play we have all been selected you play on this role i am playing on this role these are all roles going on and the producer god he has a screenplay and he has given you know i see here i used to see the boys and girls who come to be actors and actresses they come here sometimes and they come to the temple and i have seen that they are memorizing their script to give auditions so where we are we are same way we have some audition yeah we memorize certain things and we are i am to say anger i am the angry guy being angered on somebody so this drama is going on according to the plan or the master will of the great producer god [Music] this drama not okay said like a play and she is the player she's asking hey the director director says hey it is not the right fall fall rightly it is not a real killing it does not mean real killing it it is wrong so the post should be little strong i know yes i see sometimes you know how many directions they get cut go back cut unless you perfect so we have been perfected in this place and forgot ourselves all together and that's why but this is all changing this does not remain this is only for few hours novel and and acting and other things goes for few hours and this is going on for one lifetime another lifetime another slide one dream after another dream that's why somebody says you are coming never lost losing this coming and going i am tired of it oh mother open thy get thy tired son i want to come back home no so that is the so misha so that was the verse we read up to 4. so this what i said this 15 minutes it is i recapitulated what we read the other day okay now we go to the fifth verse which is our subject today the same idea will be explained further if you remain any question keep the questions in your mind then after half an hour then you can put this question then you can stop our reading so fifth verse says [Music] you will find this text on your screen those who are watching so what does it mean marisha maya maya is misha brisham means false non-existent it appears appearance we take it to be real and this is our life we live on appearance only no appearance the stars are little dots of light appearance but in truth it's far from that what we see appearance in the desert you find plenty of water even you see the reflection of the trees underwater that's why like a lake but you go there you find only sand appearance is not true that is misha maya is like that is misha it is mitha it is not eternal it is not permanent it appears only misha maya tat karjang and its effect see this one the world we live in so hard hunger is hunger thirst is thirst i hit my head yes it bled it bled no huh this is a reality but where goes reality when you go to deep sleep if they're real they should be all the time with your consciousness what does it go where goes you are so much worried and full of anxiety and then you slept and you see a good dream suddenly what is true this is true or that is true that means what you see is not true what we see that point of time we think that it is true and we go to another mood what we see that is true so what is true then what is the definition of truth truth is unchanging but your experience is changing every time then how can it be true so this universe what we see where we walk what we talk what we perceive these are all misha matram tatkarjam and this jiva this individual soul is me you prapashati you are seeing this we are seeing this maya is misha and this karjo is misha maya itself is non-existent because when knowledge comes maya disappears and when so long knowledge is not there maya is there and maya's effect this universe gross universe subtle universe causal universe all are there and who is observing you me the jiva individual soul propagati we are seeing this maya and its effect but what do you see then sarvantath all these things all serbum thought means that that you see as jiva i see i am a jiva i am seeing you i am seeing this table i am seeing this activities of the center or i am observing the world news so what is that it is also karja effect effect of that maya this world in which we live in the waking state the world in which we live in our dream state the world initially in our sleep state these are misha mitha so jiva the individual soul is also he who observes he is also non-existent sarvang that it is all like as you every day in the dream time you remain in another world realm totally forgetful about this realm only we come back to this that's why we said this is more real than that but when you are in the experience you cannot say this is more real that is less real if there something happens the same pain this excruciating pain of this dream is no less than here is it not when you find in the dream something has happened very serious and i am in difficulty you feel the pain you feel the agonies that is different thing but my point is that whether dream is true or not dream is true at the time of when you are dreaming now you say it is dream no but when you see that do you think that it is it is it is it is false everything is real car crash is real or you are having a good party that's also real everyone smiling joining friends things that so it's not unreal it is real but when dream breaks huh gun these become real or you go to deep sleep then this also becomes unreal dream also become unreal and you who is observing he also disappears in the dreamless sleep so how can you say jiva individual i am real you are real so long there is an object i am there because this is there in relation to two i am the observer you are observed but when there is neither of observable universe is gone then where are you we make a back calculation that in sleep we have our ego but really during your deep sleep you can't feel that you are there it's a just a very subtle thing we analyze and think yes it should be otherwise how can i remember when i come back i had a good sleep remembering faculty needs someone to see no why never what is our memory what is our memory memory means you went to that situation and your mind caught it in your repository stock and then you see it and say confirm yes that is so so that way we think that in our ego body or the dream body a sleep body is also jiva so this jivo is also false so see now he's saying maya is false maya karjo the effect of this maya this world three worlds gross world subtle world causal world this true one they are they are not non-existing and third one is this jiva he is observing i i am also not there so chaitanya then how it appears sarvanta everything is swapnavadvanam it it reveals or it reflects or he manifests by the cosmic consciousness cosmic consciousness reflected on the gross in the physical level in the dream level and in the sleep level because he shining everything shines if that shining nature is not there the sun is shining sun shining everything shines right the moon shining moonshining you not moves light sun shining moon's light similarly everything in this world is the he shining everything shines so that is the verse number five that misha maya cosmic ignorance and its effect this universe they are all false misha jiva the individual soul me you as you think this is also not true i am paramatma i am not this so jiva is not true but i am that is true that means what you think about you you are not that and then the individual soul is false the false individual soul perceives that we as a false individual soul perceiving false things all those appearances are like a dream which is illumine by the consciousness without consciousness nothing can be revealed no they remember the pedantic analysis the utmon is inside no a bulb you can imagine covered by different layers of coverings we call the sheaths and this body sheet the prana energy then mind then ego and internal is the last is the ego and behind that ego is the bright light shining there bright light everywhere in each one that's why you say god is in your heart shining in its own glory all the time it does not need any other energy to boost it that is everywhere but we say more so it is in the heart so wi-fi and another example i give occasionally wi-fi is everywhere is it not but if there is a computer and it has a heart and computer can access that password then it manifests there not in the table in the table you cannot see the manifestation of wi-fi connection but you need the machine so heart is the machine where the wi-fi connection god's presence is palpably felt when you need a password that is initiation mantra and other things if you repeat that mantra then this connection comes instantly instantly sometimes it takes little time to get the password what is the password and i mispronounced the password you see that that happens no you write little mistake in your password more small letter capital letter one one or one dot bus it does not work and then we say hey i am trying i am doing meditation so long but no connection nothing happening or a somewhere gap is there some dot is missing something when a stop is missing or exclamation is there in between so this is the point that means with this intense practice what can jiva that disconnected nature with our divine self will be wiped out but before that these are all true this is all true that's why this material world appears to be so true because we live in the outer consciousness so then cosmic ignorance and its effect all this universe are all false the individual soul is also false the false individual soul perceives all that false sin no all those appearances are like there then what what are all these it's like a dream night dream it is daydream arupanishad says this is a long dream that's a short dream that's why it says this great dream let this great dream disappear from me let it go away from me like the night dream night dream when it is very frightening dream huh what do you think to get out of it no similarly this is a long dream sometimes sweet sometimes sour but it's a dream it has no permanent reality really look at that we pass to so many dreams of our life from childhood till now or not they like movie scene now just you see sometimes do you think your past from childhood till today if you think about that what is this is it not a dream is it not something has happened you are the witness those are gone those are gone but they are true one time like now it is true it is very true now but tomorrow it will be the same you will think that at 7 30 we set for the santiago class and we um thinking we chit chatted like this is it not so it is if it is every day every moment going on like that how can you say it is true as a memory now so this is the point misha maya chattath karjam then bisha jiva jiva is misha false shati he sees all these false things and serban thought something about everything understand to be like that swapna like a dream but it is revealing what by chaitanyno vivarshati but conscious light there is an eternal conscious light which percolates and falls on first the light falls on the ego ego becomes brighter that light is reflected see sun's light fall on the moon moon surface becomes lighted when it falls on the earth it comes to the earth earth is enlightened tree is lighted the human the road is visible this ocean can be seen in the moonlit night every so many things are lighted what is the light light is not the moon's light light is not this reflected light right is the sun so all here in our heart of heart there is a light that's we call ishta that we call ramakrishna in devotion in vedanta we call atman brahman saccidananda that is the state called allah or you call kali makali shiva your name whatever that is the entity that light is reflected and reflected and re-reflected on the ego that reflection goes to the intellect buddhi and then with this light goes on falls on the mind mind becomes shining mind's light falls on the prana i am now active no prana prana's light falls on the body that's your body shines it's a jorda it will get you keep it dead body for few days then see what happens if that source light goes away then it will be hard it is a dead body and keep this dead body for a few days what happens you cannot keep it so how this is becoming so vibrant shining he said oh he looks good she looks good he looks good feeling nothing only the shining light inside is the light if that light is stopped hey everything we'll have to run away even about our dearest dearest people if the body is not bombed after death in bombing it was not done [Music] anyhow that's bad thing we need not to think much but vedanta always wants to make it clear it is a it is a strong place then don't make any hide and seek it's better to know that means to prove it is the shining light of the atman which makes this dull incense in moon and mass of flesh and this and that active vibrant all the cells are vibrant he shining the light within shining so gross to subtle to the micro to your what you call this bacterial level everything is shining with the light of that and in a bacterial movement look at that how kobe one bacteria fungus or whatever i don't know by this okay so the whole world is being shaken by that what is the power behind that the same consciousness that's why we cannot do anything it transforms into another let's say he's always changing change how can he change if it is like you piece of boot how can it change if there is no consciousness in it so the knowledgeable people see the play of god everywhere and we people cry and we because of ignorance so next verses but your connection is missed yeah that does not mean that it is space is not here it is not that space is here but it is not manifesting the energy because but the primary requirement is gone now next verse is very important [Music] [Music] is false suppose one who knows the doctor who knows the truth that's why you say the realized people for them misha maya maya is false they know it is a drama going on no they don't pay much attention things happen they don't get affected and there is a maya if anything happening in the movie on the screen ignorant people will get emotionally attached no and i give the example those who judge the movie the judge is sitting over there what will be their way of looking at it's all fun but this is not proper acting you will not get the oscar because it is not done perfectly like that no and he one is getting oscar because appreciated he stands so perfectly you know so so he's a tattoo he had the person who is the judge they are taught they know they talk the truth it is not real it is a play acting they know very and these others say if it is a play why did you miss to play exactly like that you miss that therefore this maya they know as false we have said it before krishna says foreign ignorant people knows this same universe as true for us it is true anything happens in the world is true anything happens in my life very true and we cannot forget we suffer whole life thinking of something has happened psychologically emotionally intellectually or physically if we are get some experience we cannot forget that because we are all gone our government is ignorant of people like us they know this is true and as a result you know being bewildered be mohito overwhelmed by the activity seeing the activity of maya the impo impulse of the maya the force of the maya and this beautiful trickery makes us delivered so so same thing to a knower of truth first line tattagasa maya is non-existing it is false and i have told you before also and agaha for agaha that person who is ignorant they know this is true and so true we weep and cry and smile whatever we do thinking it is true it is true it is true if we know it is not true who will be so serious about it there are certain people who are not serious or they are happy people those who have some problem in the here they live in a different world altogether so the worries and anxieties of this world does not bother them so augusta the ignorant people satyam bijanathi knows is to be true be say no janati send person true not one percent false this world is true you said that that day and you can do that to me how can you do that it's so true and they go to court to settle that to go to police should be very true not even a trace of untruth there because we are ignorant why it is happening that's the line is beautiful mayas the karma maya's effort or expression we are deluded we are bewildered we are mesmerized by this being deluded mesmerized by the action of this okay [Applause] but arjuna is not a man to give up he again no no seventh he didn't know but what we did six we do i said seven is there okay i'll have to read the seven verse [Music] [Music] that person who is prabhu to be awakened one who is awakened in his full knowledge we are all sleeping in our knowledge no our real knowledge you know we are all sleeping about that but who is awakened that's why brahman is that means god realized people prabhu is also its affect the world and in its three worlds of gross world subtle world causal world the world of awakening world of dream the world of sleep all all these no satyam these are neither the maya nor its effect the universe nothing is real to whom not to us but to prabhu data so who's who is awakened we have got into the awareness with the full knowledge thomas tama and thomas it appears that is to be true it says just as darkness and effects of darkness darkness in darkness you see something frightening darkness is also ignorance and what you see in ignorance that is also ignorance when you go to a very strange place and in the dark night you go there even little sound comes you get terrified and frightened nothing maybe because of your entering and opening the door something was making little noise you get fighting make something maybe some bad element is there so all these are unreal and but not visible no this but cannot be seen bhanu prakashi when the sun rises all darkness go most of our fear goes in darkness so when the sun rises where does he go all this fear that's why in a dark room you are there but if you have a flashlight then your fear will come there is nothing in the empty room i am i am the only person but if you hear oh my god this big dark room huh and what is there is a cracking noise oh something ghost something all this conception misconception will bother us no that because of the ignorance it is coming to us when we are awakened everything gone shall we end here if there is any question so this is the part we'll read then or you know again put some questions yeah so we can have some question answer session now so i end this officially oms [Music] okay now any question you have okay and we are talking about ultimate perspective from the ultimate perspective that is everything is maya even gods and goddesses are maya because in the ultimate experience when you only one there is no god no goddess but if you come down from that level then it becomes ishara god the creator god then you come down creation comes gods and goddesses come swami vivekananda remember that word of ramakrishna you are quoting ramakrishna swami vivekananda and ramakrishna when this ramakrishna is leaving the body almost close to that and one day naren was sitting in the room and he was saying this ramakrishna says that he is atman he is abutara if he can say now that he is an incarnation of god then i will be able to believe as soon as his mind was talking that way ramananda caught that question and he spontaneously responded what is spontaneous i am speaking and you are responding ramakrishna instantly said hello noren still doubt he who was rama he who was krishna is rama krishna then he added one word but not according to your vedanta in vedanta god is not there goddess is not there abu taro is not there absolute satchida nothing else if you take that stand then rama is not there krishna is not there i am also not there but if you accept one step down with the maya shakti god becomes avatar incarnation god becomes kali god becomes durga if you accept that yes in that respect i am rama i am krishna and ganesha is there all these planes are it is a different journey as you go up you see the higher planes of existence like that huh that's why you will find that ramakrishna said one day his mind was showing high up and his plane going into different levels where even material plane was gone and gods and goddesses he saw in his mystic vision gods and goddesses on the both sides of his journey no that's a plane of gods and goddesses they are real if you if you or me can just raise my mind there i will see it now it is here itself only the mind being stepped in ignorance we don't see that like the higher truth reveals to a scientific mind as the mind moves in a higher and finer and finer plane but when you go reach the absolute and merge there then he said even gods and goddesses there is a plane i saw where seven sages are meditating but the gods and goddess cannot enter there they're so pure so full of pronunciation that this goddess have no entrance there and then and there he found vivekananda so these are all true no contradiction many two stand we are totally ignorant we don't see god we don't know one god we don't know kali mother kali rama and nothing it is our own words because we live in the lower and lower plain of this range of duality but if we move from this and go into our spiritual realm then this experiences will come asha let me one respond here and then i'll let into your question here is a question bhagavad-gita bhagavan sri krishna says that one who withdraws himself from sense objects and not engages in them like a tortoise withdraws itself into itself is a yogi but for an ordinary person sense objects are appealing so if such an ordinary person enjoys sense objects within the bounds of dharma or in moderation and not in indiscriminately would not he over time feel this passion i think yes that is the way the sangsaru is made that is the way the bhagavan has given this karma to fulfill in the legitimate way hindu religion says dharma kama maksha so these are all legitimate and these are for our experience unless you finish this experience how will you go to that other pendulum if i don't finish the experience in the lower plane how can i go to the higher plane if i have no idea about a job of thirty thousand forty thousand how well you know there is a higher job sixty thousand i know it is it is rewards only oh five figure oh that's a word only in my life i have no idea i cannot get three figure four figure huh so get something then you know there is something higher then there is something here so yes you are right because ordinary god has created this universe for taking everyone to the path of extreme realization but through these experiences but step by step and one step you know you know i have seen that that does not please me let me see for another job what is a higher job high paying job okay you get that job you would take the stress and strain and then enjoy that and then he said oh i have that let me have something higher no and you go on on on and the point comes what is the use why am i doing all these things what we are right that you can say only you have the experience if some fool says oh what is there the grapes are sour there is a issue story is written that the jackal could not reach their grave but he will not [Music] accept a defeat to other animals he's a he's a very cunning guy so he said you know i don't like it because it is great these grapes are sour he cannot reach it so not spiritual life is not for the failure people but spiritual people spirituality is for the accomplished people that people make a mistake and there is a joke some people say oh you cannot do it you cannot get any job oh you cannot do anything in life to become a sadhu sadhu isa then become a monk as if monk's life is a worthless guy's life no who is failure in every aspect there will be the monk no monk's life will be the most exalted life who has the capability of doing everything he will give up that for higher cause it is not a frustration frustration and topmost satisfaction sometimes look alike the frustrated people give us up all attempt to do any job search for job going for anything he says i am spiritual you are spiritual that's a frustration that's a negativity he should have to be treated mentally and this real person who experienced everything and understand this is all we are reading that it is temporary it does not satisfy me i want some permanent type of joy and where shall i get that ours leads him to thinking of meditation of god and prayer that is the real renunciation so what you said is correct in a dharmic way if one follows the path of householder life and lead that goes to the experience surely he will be much better and that's rajani will be much stronger he will not make a mistake again because you knew that if i know what is the effect of having veggie burger or macdonald some private prior things and after days after days eating and then getting too much high cholesterol then i said what shall i say i'll try to get again but every time eric cholesterol cholesterol cholesterol so it will give me the experience no no no let me have something else good better so that is the point and second question once you said that whether one enjoys the things of the world in moderation or indiscriminately anyway what time he will get bored of it but i have seen old men who are still stuck at last and money that's true that means she needs more and one thing ex as ramakrishna taught us you experience what is the fun in life but also analyze did you get what you wanted are you satisfied ask the mind yourself you ask your own mind and the mind says ok ok ok then go for it second time third time fourth time but we foolishly go again and again and again and don't analyze that's how you come back to the same rat so it should be vivek should be put there the discrimination should be also carried out out with it not only experience experiences sense objects okay but along with ramakrishna said we are reading now in this morning reading that ravagina said after testing something and analyzed oh this is called rasugulla we read in the morning morning ready uh suppose there is a beautiful gold round rasagulla made of sweets you don't understand rasulullah is so good so rasulullah then what he said rasagulla is good okay you take a bite and put it in your mouth and test it and then he said mind this is called rasgulla did we talk to mind anytime we only eat and then i see again and again i eat again i say again i eat but if you teach every time mind this is called rasagulla are you happy with it okay take another bite are you happy with it so talk to mind and afterwards mind will be bored it will be monotony if i like one item suppose many of our sadhus do that dark chocolate so some sharpie and they came and everyone likes the dark chocolate or hot chocolate all this and then people started bringing chocolate and chocolate and chocolate then what happens your chocolate taste is gone forever you will not be involved into it see the monotony comes that is the nature of uh worldly experience no anything in the world will bring monitoring but your meditation will not bring monotony unless we we do not know do real meditation that's we feel monotonous otherwise it should be monotony meditation will give joy and greater joy and greater joy and purer and purer cats it is you are not looking at that side we have read it parallelly partici there's no it is all it's all divine maya does not exist means what what exists then but in war of truth this mayan does not exist and its karjo does not exist means what exists is brahman no no no that maya is not mahm no no that's not the thing yeah you worship means we all worship maya unknowingly and he'll worship knowingly that is not the point point is that when you worship my that you say maya is a name ma is a name but what he sees he sees he is in the trees plants everywhere in the grass he is feeling that oneness that that is ma one one blade of grass is ma one mature one or it is a consciousness you have to go back to the vedantic india when he speaks its intention is that he sees the brahman everywhere and that there is a gun in music people who call his brahman i mean i call him saktima the same thing it's not too different my we are thinking all is saguna but for ramakrishnam is not sagun only my need also and with eyes open he sees everything you know this example is very simple look at the ocean go to the beach and all the ripples and waves you see and you can say it is ripple bubble etc but you can see it is ocean ocean ocean ocean it is h2h2h2h2 ramagina sister what is called the cookies animal cookies bring a box of animal cookies and children you throw among the children i'll take that horse i'll take that dog you may take dog but the the mom who is distributing it is all the same cookie you are only talking about name i like this i like that i like that but for the wise person you know is made of the same content everyone will bite the same thing whether you take a horse horse bite is also same and dog bite is also same so the gun is they they person look at that perspective and organize they see the horse the dog the cat the rat whatever okay okay here is a question can a person attend the cell and overcome maya to study of the scriptures study of the scriptures is preliminary is it it gives we are studying this scripture did it give us knowledge now no but it gave knowledge it clarified our misconception little bit it is thick cloud after discussion of one hour it seems no no no what they're saying is true maybe no so so that much that much is the development so that's why but you cannot by reading books you cannot realize god but it can point out to the truth that's why shankaracharya says that you may be a rooted scholar you may have knowledge of expressing the truth in so many beautiful ways but experience will not come unless you really delve so this is reading of the scriptures are what you know it is like that of sravana three steps in vedantana srabana manana nidhidharasana listening this is listening what we are doing we listen to the shanti listening does not end now you go delve into it analyze it mentally is it so why it is so why it is not so analyze clarify little of the clarity will come and that go on and thinking really i am saccidananda not i am the body why i am not the body analyze analyze and dive deep into the consciousness again obstacle will come so stravana so this books helps us to shrabana listening then we have to do reflect without the book let the book be here and then i what is this universe see it and think either you say it is nothing but it is it is it is everything so it is it is as i see as i see it is not that but it is something i see a snake it is not snake but it is something as rope that's the idea it is brahman it's all brahman but i am seeing as human personalities like the different names and forms made of the same material so that to analyze day and night will come so your question in brief will say reading of scriptures are no less important it is important but one cannot just go on reading and finish and cover the book and become a brahmagani and that make people make mistake they read so many books and they think that they know everything and they make a jungle of bundle of confusion in the brain because they don't know do the manana reflection and deep contemplation so we have to listen again we have to argue and do and all do sadhanas our spiritual practice is very important unless the mind is pure it will not catch this finer analysis and that will not truth will not be revealed in a dirty mind in a dirty mirror the face will never be reflected if at all reflected it will be distorted image so the mind is to be clean and that is chitty shuddhi purification of the mind constantly analyzing doing selfless work meditation prayer all the four yogas we can take help but we are reading more emphasis on the gyan yoga aspect analytical aspect yeah that may be but that why to wait for that why why not if there are other methods are available why you should go to that method if you don't know that's okay you go on reading reading and you become pandit and pundits are pundits ramakrishna says what listen to ramakrishna's statement pundits are like vultures soaring too high by their eyes are focused on the cardinal so here they can find analyze analyze but yes that has clarified their buddhi has become sharpened yes tool is ready but tool is to be applied so there is a necessity of not reading the books of frustration will come and then they will go to guru so i have a guru maybe and then guru in they are so ready at that time guru may say one thought to osi and they will be they will get the illumination for high soul like that aye i tell as you reminded there is a story one swami he was not swami before he became the swami his name is chid ghananda puri chit ghananda is the name given by guru viraja ananda sami who is he sam sridharan and the service was a great scholar of that time rajendra nada ghost he has written such book and such books my card is such a intricate philosophical book treaties even scholars today they actually appreciate that as scholastic or accomplishment he came to one of our swami he was in doing austerities in the rishikesh himalayas at the foothill of himalayas that's swamiji as premier sananda whose letters let us say what is called the letter go forward sami used to promote that book really wonderful book so he was meditating this swami information on the one of her great swami his brahman ghani noah of truth so he went and he was a great scholar and met him and the scholar asked this swami that you are all shadows of ramakrishna mission we appreciate you your integrity and other things but why you people giving up the studies of the scriptures and intricate analysis of the vedanta you go for curing diseased people school running the school and college university why do you do engage in all these nonsense things huh is it not the duty of a monk they are nothing i am that i am that i am that then he said yeah oh yes yes why you do that then oh then he philosophically made him understand his mind was so ready you know philosophically he understood just this statement yeah you will think that this statement is so easy we all understand he said you believe in vedanta well yes that is that is the ultimate truth do you believe i am that well yes i not the body not the mind not it is that consciousness is that which is the cosmic consciousness no this consciousness and that cosmic consciousness as one yes i do believe oh okay do you believe thought tom or she thought that reality is tao that's another great victim you not the body not the mind not the soul in you the consciousness you as consciousness is the same as cosmic consciousness do you believe yes now where is the problem if you saying i am not the body not the mind you have your hunger and you eat food if you don't get food someone brings little food after two days you will be thanking him you need that service no do you need don't need suppose you are sick do you need to be taken to hospital or not if someone takes will you think good or not well yes then why not that person who is sick if you serve him take him to hospital why not it is the same god realization because toward that if i being that i need this bodily help doubling that why not your needs are being satisfied he got this click in a split second and that was a i have heard that that was a he was about his 70s in our order we have a very strict rule they don't take anyone above certain age limit and he started dancing and enjoy he said wow swami you have cleared my doubt i was studying and i was really searching for this answer and i am clear of that and then he recommended him to go to belmont and the virajananda mars then gave him sannas boom and he became a great swami of our order so you know ultimately it is true to knowledge of the scripture is great development but people get sometimes in scholastic analysis they get stuck there so that is the bad thing okay so thank you all now it is will be tomorrow will be gospel reading by prabradhika shiva prana ok thank you all jaima you
