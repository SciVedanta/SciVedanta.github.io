[77. Shanti Gita - Class 77 - chapter 7- verse 12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7FAN27HAWE)

foreign [Music] oh Lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and never more shine in our hearts which you resplendent face oh peace peace peace be unto us all so we are on the last chapter of santigita chapter 7 and we have read up to verse number 12 is a very complicated area of understanding is talking about how we perceive I will see the objects the object is this there is an object outside according to Western science the Rays of light falling and then comes to my eyeball and creates a reverse image and from that reverse image that is carried by the nervous system to the brain and brain neurons work somewhere and then behind is that mind and intellect so they perceive and we have our perception of inner some something a message is carried inside but what is that you cannot recognize until the light of the Consciousness falls on it I am mixing two vedanta and science but vedant to talk something little different that it is not that outside you are seeing anything they say that from your mind a a wave comes and just falls on some object and takes the size of the say shape and size of the object and then goes inside so that is the difference this Western science will say external light following up on that bringing that reverse image but patanjali another philosophy will say your British the mental modification the mind it falls on an object and catches the safe hand side and brings it back in the same process and goes on internally internally internally but the mind is being dull and in unintelligent that intellect also dull and intelli they cannot function by themselves so ego also cannot function it's a material object so behind that really go the conscious ego of Consciousness is there that light flashes on that object then suppose here is so many objectives all the lights are on off then we don't see anything in pitch dark things are there but we don't see when it is visible when this light falls upon it so what is the light in our in us that is the light of consciousness that light of bliss and Consciousness called Brahman Atman that light is eternal and that's called witness Consciousness in another term somewhere we call the Eternal subject whatever terminology that is the internal reality and that should fall on to illumine it is The Illuminating Factor it is everything is Jada that is the conscious entity from body to mine intellectivo etcetera these are all Jara because it is made of five elements but behind that all these when the senses sense is now acting because that Consciousness is inside that Consciousness reflected on ego that ego's light falls on buddhi intellect Buddhist light falls on the Mind mind's light falls on the sense perceptions which is under modern Scientology in the brain which is happening actually what is there no one knows we are we are perceiving our universe according to modern science also you do not know what is outside what your brain is telling you an image you are thinking the world about that so so the perception how the perception happens that is the point of discussion and it was going on so in a nutshell I have expressed that idea now so this is called britti and when this knowledge comes it is consciousness and then British creates an object which is matter that matter gets lighted and then when it gets lighted then you say I know you know when something is there outside unless the light of the Consciousness falls upon that you cannot say I know knowledge is impossible so for every perception in our life every not to the eyes to the ear to the touch to the smell to the tongue every perception the process is the same it is going through all this machine and this all this robotic correction but it is connected with some HiFi wife no not Wi-Fi it will be energy let Eternal energy be I know if some it is not that the robot will not function robot may be standing like that with all features ready the body may be there but it will not perceive anything unless that light of Consciousness is behind and it is set up for every site we see every sound we hear every test we have in our tongue every touch we get heat cold soft hard all this perception are possible because of that light falling upon and then we say I know I do not know anything unless the light falls up that that's why in the sleeping when you sleep deep sleep external objects still there he was sleeping that does not mean that the chair is not there in your room the ceiling light is there the fan is there air conditioning machine is there but you don't have any conception when you are in deep sleep but you are there but the external senses are shut down so in this channel of this connection anywhere any break then you don't perceive the object suppose my eyesight is defective so thing will be there I will not see some say I don't see the distant things I cannot read the it is so close but I cannot read so if you need defect in the eye defect in the nervous system the carrier defecting the brain then go to the Mind mind is absent I'm looking like you but I'm thinking something else that you are not seeing me because mind is not connected mind is connected but your understanding is also your thought is deep thinking is somewhere else your ego is not even I am seeing I is not connected then he will so any layer of disconnection your knowledge will be not good but even suppose all are there if the Consciousness not there you cannot understand you will not be able to experience anything that's why in the Deep sleeps look at that deep sleep neither this visible universe is there it is because it is covered with withdrawn from the growth to the subtle and this dream world that's also gone when there you go back to the Deep Sleep State then what remains there only one thing Universe are ignorance remains it is blocking ignorance is blocking that's why when we and but the light is inside light is falling on that ignorance that's why we say coming out I slept well I do not know do not know is the black covering but I know that I do not know do not know I know that is the Consciousness aspect that is the continuous subject of our witness consciousness so this is very important point to understand that all these physical things even if it is present but without that Consciousness we do not know but Consciousness in deep Sleep is also there that's why our utterance proves that they I do not know by this statement we are proving that knowing is there of what your subject is not known the object is there but what object I do not know that that is the ignorance ignorance is the subject here now when a Brahma again comes what happens this ignorance delay that is not there all the connections are coming to the pure mind pure Intelligence coming there and you tune with the cosmic Consciousness that means then you see the transformation that is called the revelation but that is blocked for us because of our Thomas rajasan Etc so that was the subject we read then that's a 12th verse last verse we said that srinosi mikshasi biksha says so what happened shinosi whatever we are hearing whatever I am seeing observing foreign whatever object whatever sound I am hearing whatever object I am seeing their submit the awareness I am aware of share I am aware of the watch I'm aware of the clock that awareness is there everywhere and it is that permeates everywhere this Consciousness permeates everywhere and that's why it is revealed because that that sarva prakashika that Consciousness is revealer of anything and everything observable and visible or experience so in whatever you hear and see there is this unsurpassed consciousness with uninterrupted continuity the table is not the pews are not continued but there is a gap but knowledge has no separation knowledge see I am looking in this room this set to that side my one perception will window next is the wall next that the Consciousness is permitted everywhere the space is here empty space but I am aware of the empty space I am aware of the glass I am aware of the door I am aware of the wall whatever that means it is consciousness is permeated everywhere and that experience comes that is the Consciousness is revealing all this that's why 13 verse today's reading you know [Music] Tata beautiful that Consciousness is awareness this you have to analyze in a gross way I am seeing I'm experiencing but how the experience is happening we never question that did you ever question that I am seeing this picture why am I seeing the picture how it is happening we never questioned that but it is it you have to understand it is because of the consciousness you are perceiving every object that you cannot get it unless you have very strong discriminative faculty analytical faculty our eyes get stuck into the external only and don't understand the Consciousness permeating there and Consciousness permitting here and behind every perception that Consciousness is just flashing out as it were there you see whatever object or janami you you say I know I know I saw you so I saw you at seven o'clock how do you know because I saw I saw you miss I have the experience the Jannah may I know him because that of the Consciousness knowing or perceiving is my because of the consciousness huh because of the impact of that submit and begin and the same process you apply to know your own swarupa go analyze here he'll find the realist Consciousness so the Consciousness there Consciousness here is to be perceived by Deep analysis the bedanta book is always to always teaches us how to analyze how to look at the object and see the truth behind that apparent the apparent thing is covering our vision and understanding this apparent name and form apparent all these limiting objects they are just blocking our vision of the truth so therefore you are to be Char over so you know so you have to know realize that Sunday this awareness of perception that somebody analysis you understand that it is only consciousness all your perception is nothing but the you are feeling your Consciousness to name and form means you understand that there you see yet whatever you see burst to any object wherever you see any object it illumines me for you I know there are so many objects when you see them and the Consciousness actually reflects there then you say I know nothing that is very Lee it is happening because of the Consciousness itself the house May full up objects but if there is no light you will see nothing but whatever you are saying whatever you are feeling that is because of the Consciousness behind to Assad this is called vedanta knowledge will come automatically we see that oh the sound oh it is because of the consciousness you see two times it happened because of the Consciousness you are too a lot about Consciousness that is the Consciousness concept I am seeing you I am smelling something gas leak gas leaked oh because of the Consciousness see this is called seeing God everywhere in one language but vedanta student will Analyze This Way uh that is in in the puncture she also this emphasizes the same idea that whatever perception you are having it is you are it is happening because of consciousness behind seeing hearing you're imagining something that's also possible because of the consciousness with eyes open you are feeling anything is it hot cold how do you feel because of the consciousness so everything is because of the background I didn't remember that experience but I just explained at the very beginning that there may be some object Suppose there is an object and that object I take the picture of that object and it goes to the nervous system to the brain and the neurons act in one way or but it cannot find out what is this object it transfers to the Mind mind the boss mind is the eleventh sense organ 10 sensor cancer five eyes ear nose throat etcetera hand feet at Center five five ten but who controls them among them mind is the controller of all the senses your mind disconnect your eyes will look like that you don't see anything your ears will be open but you do not hear anything I suppose you are not mindfully eating something I say what did you eat hello how did it taste you cannot say any can you say if the mind is just you are unmindfully eating even some people may say what did you eat we're reading in this morning Sami Vivekananda is given to eat some food and he was eating something then he said did I eat I eat at all when he is not aware that he is eating his body his mind is so high in some a discussion began to discussion that she is not in the mind mind is not there that means mind factor is to be corrected there so mind is the eleven so and then mind mind is a undecisive person he cannot decide is this or that this and that then it sends to Google engine inside Google engine is there buddhi buddhi immediately has all their post or own old photographs images all collected images how much he can remember she calls all those and matches this photo with that they say oh it is John how do you know it is John yet the whole album is inside and Google Indian says that and brought that picture and matches with the present picture it has so fast it works we don't know how it works so fast in Google if you know see it fast you click and this is seven thousand seventy nine thousand results are coming right so if the engine can do that from when I followed this principle here what is happening inside so then buddhi this deception is not finished it is only matching one photo with the whole photo is matching but how it will be accepted as this person and I will say this is this I am the person talking about that then the light of the Consciousness should fall upon it to justify yes I see the light sorting is done but if the light is not there perception will not happen so all this talk all this time whatever we are talking about it is the Consciousness so the vital factor is the Consciousness we eat through Consciousness we sleep to Consciousness we die to Consciousness we become depressed through Consciousness we become high and excited in Consciousness but we do not know it is consciousness playing all this role so what is vedanta to acknowledge that and live in that Consciousness actually we are living in consciousness all experiences from morning till now every Split Second all the experiences because of the consciousness but I never know Consciousness be being the effect of Consciousness my all perception of sadness Joy anger frustration whatever experience is coming experience sector of experience but we do not know that's important our the famous person they say foreign Mass month how many times January passed in your life how many times have February passed November October Marshall month and month to interview 1999 has gone 2000 2001 now 2022. it's going so many years have passed Master of the government is there also just I am just to understand little bit of time and one 12 years so my life has passed foreign [Music] they come and go they come they go time comes time goes mom comes mom goes wig comes week goes here comes the air goes 12 years of my life how many times it happened you are not that much but I am how many times six seven eight times eight times I can see anyhow so so many long period have passed it is coming and going but uh but the Consciousness in me know that it does not come up oh now the sun has risen today and the night it is gone no night time it is there waking time is there dream time it is there I'm sleeping that time also there again waking up that time there it took years after years days after this month after a month and it is continuous some with Asia sayam prabha it is shining by its own light it is like the sun apparent example of the sun everything to light self illumined entity that is the Consciousness and that is all the time and all my perception I do not know the same part does the devotees use this down very beautifully for Lord I didn't know that it is you in my heart all the time doing everything in a devotional language you are doing everything the Consciousness is driving everything in your life when you become sad how can you be sad did what he cannot be said it cannot be happy it cannot be angry it cannot be sad when it troubled anxiety will not be in the dead body but to feel your anxiety you need Consciousness you feel your joy you need Consciousness because all perception in this final light flashes on that so this is the idea if one can think see what do you need God meditation and call realization what God realization think this way every second that is called realization what is realization realization that that Consciousness is permeated here they are everywhere and with that Consciousness my all experiences are happening to the eyes to the air to the nose to tongue to his touch every organ every perception all my whole life is nothing but consistent that's what I call Touch of consciousness and when we can really penetrate by your meditation and analytical process and go and in the in internal reality of ourselves that Consciousness and stabilize we call a c is a brahmagenic when he comes out of that he sees Brahma that that Consciousness everywhere that Consciousness here that Consciousness outside this is the Consciousness study it does not need much learning is a question of just focusing on this truth every day how we can be aware of that consciousness is a funny thing yeah that the being being I am talking because of that consciousness my speech will not be there if the Consciousness is not there your car is moving 60 ml or 80 mile or whatever or it is moving forward or going back all remains on the energy now that conscious and consciousness of the car meaning I am giving the example that your forward movement or backup movement of the car we can see outside but the supply energy is the same behind the car whether it moves this direction or backward front gear back gear so good bad all these are happening in the level of Consciousness only so this is a very great study way getting some inspiration from here now how will you reach that point he says put in bars oh I said did we read the English translation ah understand through critical analysis that awareness which is called samvid to be the consciousness consciousness objects that you see there becomes revealed to you as I know object that is there that you see there become revealed to you as I know within code due to the influence of that awareness that awareness is here because of that awareness you say I know I saw I felt I experienced all expression not because of that eye consciousness therefore that awareness should be recognized truly as your own self what is you then don't think you are the body you under the mind you are not the intelligent because those are Jara matter Consciousness is that that gives validity of all these things if the Consciousness is not there is no experience therefore what you have to do put inverse sarvam Niraj saravanatma about [Music] now what you to do I don't see God anywhere I don't understand awareness I'm intellectually talking no it makes sense logically it makes sense that much we can accept but I have no perception I don't feel I feel this table is stable it is limited because of the table the light is coming I am seeing the simple formula I don't go much deeper here he says now you have to eliminate everything which is external why is an object of where I am seeing means it is a drisha an object of vision it is never the object is the subject so this shortcut and what this is this is not Consciousness it is Jada matter past you start ramakrishna taught us that you want to the man is climbing the steps and saying this is not the roof this is not the roof this is not the roof this is the path of vedanta not this not this not this and then you reach the roof see the Consciousness only and then come down you see everything is made of the same stone and brick as the building is made up so here also when you go back say not this because you'll get stuck here if you say this is Brahman and everyone says this is my I like this thing you like because it is that much you think that is the real yeah but that's not real anything you see in the material world cannot be real why today it is there tomorrow it is not there today is one ship tomorrow another you bring a beautiful bouquet of flowers very shining and very beautiful colorful and fresh wow wow and keep it two days then what happens you know more so its beauty is transitory that because it is Jada matter matter is subject subject to Creation existence and destruction because it is Jada because it is drisha always vedanta analysis keep this in your mind when you want to do the vedantic analysis you tell your mind because it is the Atman you cannot see who will see whom when you see something that is separate from you because it is separate from me that's an object I see it I hear about it I hear from that sound outside so at one point second point distr it is not continuously conscious everything is in and no this food is insincent it cannot move it cannot do anything even people are moving that is obviously in a final level because it it becomes when it becomes dead it does not move anymore so three arguments we have to keep in our brain every day one the swatwata anything you see here test touch that is not the consciousness it is nonsense scene it is it is non it is not sentient and third is Jada it is matter so because of anything you see whole day you can put in the dissection table and put these three arguments does it corroborate that is a drisha object to see it is an object a subject I am my subject I am the Atman the Consciousness is here first I am here then I see you is it not first you are awake that you see the world when you are sleeping you don't see the world so first Consciousness is here and then the world exists I exist that's the world world exists the sun exists swamiji said in one place the sun exists because of my two tiny eyes I exist first I exist then Sun exists the world exist because I ex and what is that I of course that is the point not the limited the frame of body and mind but that is the Consciousness because of that eye the whole world exists so this are very three Cardinal Point of analysis it is one is it will fall in that category means is Atma is there that is unchanging it will be all the time on asthma will be Smita which is not Atman that is not that is appearing now this way it will appear another way now you understand that what is my Atman where it is our children it has been limited by this body mind suppose the space is here no you bring a picture or a glass who said the glass space glass space space of the glass there is no such space of the glass it is the same space I am making it limited it will limit our children is limiting it is limiting the infinite space into two division this is called the glass occupied by the glass and not occupied by the glass see this is the space this this entire space was open so before the walls were raised when the world says it is we say it is a temple space it is a shrine space yeah it's a space taken by this what you call it is the space taken by this pews are taken by this table or taken by this uh musical instrument like that but it is only space similarly this what is called The Limited Atman this is not the limited it's a unlimited is the behind you can you make a separation from the limit unlimited you are making a false division into it there is no real division huh it's better example also it is to understand this suppose you think you take a bowl or a pitcher made up clay porous clay and you put it into the into the ocean the ocean water divides into two one is the pitcher water in the picture inside and water picture outside the outside and inside is the space divided that way picture water is divided no water is percolated into the thickness of the picture also and inside also outside also so if you see Consciousness is here this is the body permeates the body itself and expires everywhere that is the total Consciousness absolute consciousness you understand that Atma is our chin has been limited by this jar this the body jar this this jar looks like that your jar looks like that everyone having one jar different Design By The Cosmic designer I know but the thing is that it is the Consciousness here so buddhi you have to understand this [Music] foreign intellect not by the gross intellect which people look in the world and only money and all this money outside objects no it needs to serpent mind pure mind pure mind which will be by developed by practice by Prayer by meditation purifying the mind that fine mind will give this Clarity of this gross mind worldly mind they will not at all grab it at all and it will not penetrate in their heart at all they will think that is a wastage of time by one hour time you are wasting in talking about these are Consciousness what jar and table cues pews what are you talking about so because it needs to Sharp mentally not the sharpening there are many maybe very intelligent people in the world we are not talking about scripture is not talking about that them their mind they may be very expert in analyzing the material science but spiritual size you need a very finer mind pure mind it's a pure mind it's a better to say suksma here means pure mind pure mind and in pure mind impure mind it's like a fly and pure man is like a b right flat plot fly does it sits in the honey everything sits under in the field as they impure mind and pure mind be be only whatever he will hungry but only he will suck them honey from the flowers so sucking the sweetness of God that type of mind will have a new eye to penetrate the external and enter into that Consciousness whatever in the world there is nothing but the expression of consciousness so that should be so this 14 verse with the help of your extremely subtle intellect after expelling every single thing because of their quality of being an object their non-self Nation and their inertness no know that self know that cell capital which is separated from everything else this this body is saying I am separate from everyone know that cell which is uninterrupted is not limited by time space or condition know that self has Consciousness if everyone from morning till night as many times we remember that it is the consciousness which is giving me a perception every perception every feeling every emotions it is consciousness Consciousness Consciousness if one can do that then he will be he will be established in that knowledge of him continuous awareness of the Divine so first in another shall I read another swatma brahmanisha you're talking about the awareness whatever is our awareness it is this Consciousness itself we have heard that here that is clarifying that idea again that which is consciousness or awareness but that's the shambit that is your SWA Atma your own Atman your own self own Capital self this is the small self changeable self this self changes no every day every moment whether you like it or dislike it you cannot hold anything it is a changing changing changing thing we may think it is not changing I am the same only when people get into fight you have changed so much what a nonsense talk you change me say every moment everyone is changing but will not change you register the maturity today's maturity same you registered his body is today's body as everything is seen and you have changed so much a change in the nature in the world but what does not change God the Consciousness the absolute awareness of the Divine no so that does not change so here he said yes that which is called the awareness that is verily your own big self Capital self swatma and that is caitanya that is consciousness that is Brahma that is the Brahman the absolute no distinction there in the ocean can you distinguish that this water versus that water it is one homogeneous water so that is the cosmic Consciousness it is the same Cosmic Consciousness Brahma means Cosmic Consciousness now if you would try to understand the Consciousness in the pot and Consciousness outside the space in the pot and space outside you may make a distinction but in space there is no distinction in Consciousness there is no division division is in your mind but in reality Cosmic Consciousness and individual Consciousness there is no division [Music] such a lakshan and you have to understand this Brahman is the indicator of when it says that's the great Vedic victim that thou art that thou the small thou this person limited by this body and mind and Etc that God lord who created how can this small be that here it is called you spill up what is really you I'm not the body not the mind not the intellect go on peeling or peeling or peeling up who's stopping the day I saw peeling up the onion who gave that topic somewhere anyhow so peel off what I am what I am what I am and then I the Consciousness will remain all other covering needs to be taken away and you see God God sitting in the heaven who is God is creator that responsibility of creation he is kind fill up that all these qualities of which he adore or which he has given to God peel up that what will remain Consciousness so this Consciousness and that Consciousness they are one that's called the mahabhaka Bichara the analysis of the great dictum I am that thou art that you think you are a body mind person no you the Consciousness in you is the same Consciousness in the cosmos there's one only one consciousness you have divided the Consciousness into two by your wrong understanding by a cloud in mind between your mind will be purified analyzing this way I am not the body not demand not this God is also not the ruler not the Creator not the sustainer nothing it is the Consciousness only so Cosmic Consciousness the ocean and the Consciousness in the one drop the same H2 same H2 how do you know this you can read books it will not happen you have to go get a bomb you have to understand that you indicated by you when I say you indicated my indicative word you is the target is that that same Brahman you have to know does you have to know that he is you should go to a teacher not seeing their YouTube yeah you can get inspiration but for your spiritual life you will have to go to a guru because it is not the words but it is the energy it is the experience what they have done they can transmit to us at least we may understand or not but they do it some first unit people are there they can understand immediately when misfortunate people we may not understand whole life that means Guru who is Guru who has analyze this again and again and again and again and it intellectually convinced and internally more flashes of light up because Cosmic Consciousness they can feel inside that means ideal teacher will be who have realized it but those who are done again and again and again they stand in conviction we have seen some service he used to live in this Consciousness day and night uh but he apparently will not understand anything if you watch him unless you go very close and ask him some questions and then conviction not the same reason there is one vedantic Swami he I met him when he was almost in his health condition dying condition Baba what a fire when a he said that if one does not do this every day he's a fallen sadhu day and night to think oh I am that tomasi analyze this peel up all these coverings so there are people who have experienced if we hear from the conviction comes into our mind they can transmit some conviction in US so it is to be followed like that and next they will read a very simple formula to make it understand this mahakash is the Great Space and ghataka is the space of a pot for space and Infinite Space there is no distinction it is the same space you divide with a pot imaginary part break it space is gone so this apparent division what is being created by the mind can be dissolved by it only through the light of Consciousness understanding about that talking about so put in so 15 verses a certain that that which is awareness that which is awareness is merely your own self and that is the Consciousness and is called Brahman it is also the implied meaning of the word you thou art that this is to be known from the teachings of the guru or by guru's presence so so here we end foreign [Applause] and here is one question do biculpers have their basis or origin in consciousness you know Consciousness is consciousness but when Consciousness is covered with ignorance all because that means in that sense you can say everything comes out of Brahman the whole creation has come out of Brahman but Brahman does he create anything no so all these changes what you see is it Brahman is doing Brahman does not do that's why in the shakter philosophy they bring the idea of Shakti otherwise you cannot explain this visible universe oh you are seeing this oh it is Mother Brahma mother is alone separate from Brahman ramaphina said whom you call as Brahman I call him my mother Brahman and Shakti are the same one and same so if you say everything has come out yes there is no other source about Brahman but this Brahman sin as the bhikara or bikalpa that is because we are in ignorance and through our lens of ignorance we are seeing the same Brahman through the lens of ignorance we see this whole world so when the mind is there in pure mind naturally that shows us so it is you can say in one sense Brahman then you have to say Brahman is this source of everything but in reality you cannot say that Brahman is not active Brahman activical mother because Shakti okay another question why are scriptures so mystical that they require so much commentary I mean why we are not the written straight forward like a user manual will not understand that if you say why the big scientists don't make it easy all his researches research material easy for us suppose technically you go to any any scientist they are mathematical deduction if we ask why they have done this mathematical Direction so complicated would he not do easy for us foreign no we cannot say that because this subject is so complicated and our doubtful mind is so much questioning therefore commentary is necessary to understand what is the real meaning every word has a meaning and we always misunderstand through our level of mental condition through that because we see through that therefore we need the help of the commentators like Sankara they can guide us if in a point where our mind will not be able to catch it my mind will take another Direction but you say no no that is not the interpretation meaning is this so because it is a subtle subject so he needs some guidance from them and straightforward they try that's why you want to understand straightforward user manual you read Gospel of ramakrishna you want much easier manual see the whole Gospel of holy mother Devi she does not speak in any High language he said um that that same reality is in the in the outcast one person to the highest person in the knowledge my mother said and don't mind oh who is in me she is also same in the outcast low-caste Ordinary People no a person of highest intelligence to the lowest one the same Consciousness is there ramakrishna speaking like that and their behavior is that so read those these are the straightforward user manual you know as you have used the word but that's why it is said no uh I have quoted it many times baby no one gets scholar one one sadhu newly joined our own Pandit has come to our question about Brahman probably so he came to Swami shivananda ramakrishna's disciple and ramakrishna's disciple his name is Tarak so that's shivananda Maharaja not rishikesh it is second president so what he says the pundit has come he said that and maharas asked him the question do you want to hear in one word your question the response in one word come to me and if you want to hear in so many ways go to the southern so that is the that's the important point who wants to understand unless the mind is is simple mind will not accept this philosophy one word how much is needed toward that Guru will say you are not the body mind Etc God is also don't cover god with other qualities God is beyond all quality name quality and other things you also Beyond quality Beyond name everything the Consciousness here and there but it should be instant your mind is simple and within a short period boom he got it [Music] right right when your mind will be so pure that means that is that Purity is necessary and for us we need we need little intellectual conviction because we live in the level of mind and intellect no a convincing Intel understanding is necessary mind otherwise hallucination will happen something wrong idea wrong thing will carry I said yes you are asking some question hi um how does love become a tool to understand how how does love become a tool become a tool yeah see love means what they Define love love means what two things are there become close human love one loves other they come close you hate I will not see your face you will not see my face so love is uniting so if you love God that unites you the other factors will go away love between you and your lover that will remove all the clouds of doubts and other things understand love is the best thing if one can really genuinely love all distinctions go you don't see any fault when you love some boy or a girl you don't see the fault of the girl or if God does not see the fault in you you are a perfect man she is a perfect heart and then what happens when you real genuine love that is the point when you come down from that level and just judge a person as a person hey you did this you did that and you did that and she did that huh but when love generates you don't consider any any defect in anyone so when you grow in love for God it drops off all this rubbish and genuine United God and when you unite I unite with my Consciousness God is I am saying God word it is the same as consciousness sachidananda now here is a question this the sin one commits helplessly an involuntarily due to presence of strong tendencies in the mind one which she has no control to what extent does he accrue Papa or sin for such actions helplessly and involuntarily I am a holy mother we have to go to get rescue from this problem holy mother said the sin of your mind is no sin in this in this Iron Age if you commit something in your mind unconsciously or consciously that is no sin but but point is that helplessly you are doing if it is my it is the intention is the question no it mostly its impact will be less if we willfully do intention is there and that creates bondage more but helplessly unconsciously inadvertently something happens its impact is less that I can say I cannot say it is sin no sin or sin God will understand that but from our perspective I will say if it is done unconsciously the impact in your mind will not be that strong and you can easily brush out [Music] it's for the pure soul in the in the dark which is that you was much pure only 25 percent evil has entered into the society and now 75 percent renewable has entered into the society God is gracious God gives compassion when the self supports you go to a very competiting students who everyone is a high grade student no say you go to the Harvard you get a degree from Harvard and you can go to some school in Korea and it is unrecognized any how they got a recognition that's good this category of the student will be he may say I also got my graduate degree you will say I also got my graduate degree but there will be difference in that depth so anyhow I think that we can and if we if anything happens like that we can say oh Lord it has happened I will not do it again that's all uh how can we say God is compassionate but also we should peel off the qualities of God that is to understand when you are praying to God is your dualistic practice and I am talking about non-dualistic practice there is no God vedanta does not believe in God vedanta does not believe in God God is also your imagination in a higher imagination lower imagination higher imagination God is sitting in our he is kind he is compassionate who knows he's compassionate you are imposing some qualities in God the absolute unchanging no so when you disqualify yourself from this Gods all the other adjuncts limiting answer they also drop up it automatically happens so then from that perspective here is another question what is scriptures advice to an aspirant to Trump over such strong Tendencies to which he has already accepted defeat it is called sastrosis constant effort and Analysis success depends on constant practice constant failure see here is a musician now how many hours he has to make practice I don't practice anything so my voice is this if people practice for long hours so your voice is different so anything it will go to the mother called the acrobats huh oh my god did you see the Ted Ted show and some are having accurate how they are doing you cannot imagine you will be frightened to think we're all thinking am I here going to fall and break everything they can head and everything but it's practice practice so we will get strained by regular practice and success will come failure is where failure in your mind when mind becomes stronger you will succeed because our past illness is in the mind pulling me another Direction I am generating a new tendency which will be powerful then it this is a tug of war which direction our mind falls into the tag of War every day sometimes good tendency is pushing me and sometimes other old Tendencies are pulling that way this is a struggle but your strength you strengthen yourself in positive direction automaticate it that's why day and night if we think of Consciousness think of the divine within pray to Divine all these practices what are given that will make us win the other old Tendencies which I don't want I want to get out of it so that will happen say it is common thing Alcoholic Anonymous and others what they are teaching practice practice don't mind failure is very start again start again that is the point so spiritual life should be like that [Music] thank you chairman this is like the auxiliary practice we were talking about earlier outside of formal practice is every single moment I have to do it yeah yeah how much we become aware that is the point see we are see you we are sitting now in one hour you can think all my perception why is happening because with consciousness I'm not recognizing that
