[72. Shanti Gita - Class 72 - chapter 6 - verse 37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmmD0V9u34E)

foreign [Music] [Applause] oh Lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from Darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your splendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all so we are in the Shanti Gita the peace song stronger piece so we read the chapter 6 and we are talking we are listening about the nature of Brahman and the state of that one sweet Brahman how it happens so last verse 39 we did them foreign beyond all speech am beyond mine Beyond sound all the time pure and stainless that is in that there is no trace or tint of duality because the duality the upanishads cannot tolerate the word duality and there is no parallel no examples there is no Puma there is no parallel example Brahman is like this you can give some example but there is no such example you can give because it is beyond mind Beyond speech Beyond sound and it is because it is omalam absolutely stainless so what will be a parallel thing like that there is no parallel no example you cannot give any example of that even upon there is no question of parallel example exemplify in Hindi even that taught close to that with parallel to Brahman there is no such that and you can say it drisha it is like this it is like that you cannot say so he said that last time but a beautiful verse for everyday meditation those who are vedanta student they can meditate this verse again continuing that description this 40th verse which you start reading today it is said that is foreign [Music] foreign you cannot Surya taken by your ear you cannot hear him if there is some other person if he talks you can hear but this year you cannot hear the voice of the Lord no he taught three okay because this organs of hearing the organs are fearing which is normal here can hear on the material sound but that Brahman you cannot you Punisher May Express the idea of Brahman but this year is not fit to listen that listen to that that means you cannot this gross year cannot listen this uh truth or understand the truth by hearing anything no especially this touch touch means the skin we feel the touch and heat and cold so you cannot feel with this this sense this touch the sense organs of touch cannot have any experience of that and then foreign this eyes cannot see ramakrishna said that I have seen more tangibly than this is not this eye if this eye then when ramakrishna having the vision the people around they will not see the same suppose here we are all and someone of you are just having a vision your vision is yours I will not see that even then when the mind is so pure then this I will be ramakrishna's eyes sometimes looking like this but his far away in the samadhi so that's why it is said no he that Rashana this tongue rational the town it is not capable of testing that reality no he foreign this the smell this nose it it helps to smell but this cannot do that because he it is not a subject it is not an object to be smelled it meld it is not that means this is not physical anything this physical eye is physical here nose touch skin and tongue by which we perceive the entire world this Brahman cannot be experienced to that this speech expresses everything what you are trying to describe you can describe but this speech cannot express that truth upanishad also says foreign [Music] not to other any other sense organs it cannot be perceived by austerity you cannot have it you do austerity day and night but by that you cannot understand this nakarma by doing selfless Karma or selfish Karma whatever self so this is the state of Brahman that means only Rama swamiji said which is non-existing it foreign they can come back so but if it is it is void then you have any expression neither you will have any expression of a blissful mood so that is that is the state so this is the idea whenever we read a very first day we hear this and we read whole life to understand that we will have to uh last person I forgot for a long time we have not um all first of all I think it is a thing Brahman is not a thing hard there is an object I can see I can hear I can taste I can touch object foreign misconception of all absolved in that there is subject which can a little I know go to the astronomy look at the Starry Sky and you follow the astronomical calculations and expressing the same idea he says [Music] [Music] [Music] so it is saying it is it is called sat Brahman is called sachidananda the white is shot which is because it is it cannot be destroyed so if you cannot destroy anything by any weapon any means then why what will say it is it is there that the thing if you destroy then it becomes binashi it is subject to change and destruction everything in the world will be subject to change and description but because it is abhinashi it is on dying indestructible because of that it is called sadrupa so this is a good definition to understand why we call Brahman is sat existing because it cannot be destroyed it has never destruction everything in the world of Duality is subject to change and destruction say we are on one time babies then we become child we become adult then we become what you call middle age now we become oldies now we become Underground so there is a beautiful sometimes in there I see some places they defeat very nicely they may be born and how he's growing growing growing growing growing growing growing and and ultimately boom indeed and Gone Gone Forever that form is gone whom we saw walking in the ground for so many years how did he are 80 years 90 years whatever they are is living but that is gone vanished from the whole purview so this is the change that's why you cannot say salt now this is now it is sought but it is subject to generation the sun is not the same Sun and all the planets were inside the sun before this splitting so that has changed into this and this everything is changing we say climate change everything is changing weather is changing and trees plants human gods goddesses everyone is changing but only sought because it is it is unchanging or none you cannot just destruction is impossible it is it is not subject to any destruction and now similarly because it reveals itself and everything that's why it is called chit it is because it reveals itself and you don't need another light the sun does not need another light we now you need to see something you can take a flashlight or any borrowed light but the Sun Sun is light lights itself and lights the whole world with poisonous Moon Moon becomes lighted they don't exceed in the morning if you watch when the sun comes up the Rays of light falls on the trees the same leaves of the tree How Shining it becomes La it is self luminous at the same time it helps other two Express itself or it manifests itself light light it appears lighted Atman is exactly given an example like that it's parallel to that or close to that prakash of dwat because everything is manifested in the body is a prokasso means expressed manifested who that does that manifestation that is because it is sweetened it is nature is consciousness conscious thing a dead body and conscious body what is the difference it manifests it acts its expression is there so anything we find it is manifesting means that is the this uh it is caitanya it is of the nature of consciousness everything is permitted Brahman is on and why because you you know if the whole world is we like it you may say we like it but we dislike also something well no dislike is also like is it not like and dislike two words if we analyze little bit it is nothing different than that of liking I like this this is my expectation if it does not satisfy me I dislike it but if I like and I get more ah I am extremely happy so like certain dislikes and not two things it is the my feeling of closeness I I love it I want to have it because that is the tendency therefore it is the Brahman is permits everywhere either in the form of life or in the form of dislike that means it is like the we can take the positive side therefore because it is like that it is called the prior Ananda it is because when he loves something we when I feel attracted to something prio my own there is a touch of joy whenever I like something and I like ice cream and someone gives me ice cream I'll be happy Ness is Anand I find Ananda oh I am so happy I'm so happy because I like it it is prio it is near to me it is very close to me it is up to my expectation in this whole world we cannot survive without this tendency to feel is my liking or my happiness I I have this happiness through this and that's why it is Ananda and in that unknown foreign in Atman in the Atman there is no sense of disliking in the Atman there is no sense of disliking because whenever I love something there I see my Atman reflected says [Music] only we love every object means because the love object of Love is Ananda Ananda God is everywhere that's why we find so much joy when we get our own expected things so as anandaru because and in that there is no operata in all when you find it happens no if you love someone in your eyes even he smells bad to love that the smell becomes fragrant to a person of love loving and loving eye is not loving eye mom loves the child to the child is not having some maybe partial some defect in the body but in the eyes of the mother because mother loves the baby mother does not see the ugliness in that so wherever there is pure feeling of I love you don't see the defect there foreign see when you take the ice cream we don't see a priyata there because it will bring cholesterol everything we know but those don't bring into awareness we don't like that to think because it pleases me you know afterwards but in Brahman there is never any afterwards are below or that point it is because it means never ever there is any unlikingness or unhappiness in the object of our lovable things because of that it is Brahman is Anand Brahman is Ananda because positively it is we like it whenever we find any likeness it is because of the Anand the percolating to that that's why ramakrishna said Ananda is the same Ananda Ananda only bishwaryananda foreign when it comes to the bhajana spiritual practice meditation and prayer good meditation good Bhajan it's a higher is bitter Joy Anand is the same only appearing experienced more more and more or less Ananda not two but only it is polluted the sun is the same Sun when the cloud comes you can see sometimes no sun but you can see the sun like Moon you can see much clearer manifestation a darker manifestation depending on that covering foreign foreign if you love something you cannot see a priyata ah in this this world is deluded I have deluded us like that whatever we see in the world I like to get it we don't see the fault any any fault there I find Joy there huh and so this is the expression of Ananda okay let me see that with the translation says anything sorry 48 48 verse what we did before running translation will be like this certainly the organs of hearing or seeing or listening organs appear hearing that is ears cannot hear that likewise skin cannot touch that barely eyes cannot see that surely tongue cannot taste that undoubtedly the nose cannot smell that and speech cannot express that it is existence alone as it is imperishable it is essentially Consciousness because of its revealing nature you see in the whole world something is revealing no but it is who is revealing God is revealing or Brahman is revealing in the name and form and it is bliss as its nature is love and no dislike is ever there possible so it is bliss as its nature is of Love by a Brahman nature is love that's why see when the Brahma Gyan is come down their love flows for All Pure impure there is no such distinction that is the perfect state of socialism as a communism communism is here after coming back from that state they don't see anything which is not lovely but is not revealing the truth so they reveal to them they see the reality that this is a revealing to them and it's blinging Joy holy mother that says he call him joyful and when he sees that the Muslim died Bandit and also same in brahmananda sivananda likes this highly spiritual Vivekananda like people in their mother size they are all same that only is the state of where people can feel that it is the Brahman manifesting so now we go to the next one 42. what is [Music] foreign all this universe ocean is the substance of all the waves and ripples no this whole universe Stars galaxies whatever and all the planet in all the objects they are all coming from that Brahman therefore because of the all pervasiveness because it is there is a substratum of everything they also the body's growth subtle and causal ity as it's called asman it is called the self because the substratum of the bodies why do you call Atma Atma because it is called the Atma the self being the substratum of the bodies the ghost body three bodies we have three bodies causal body and because of its all pervasiveness it is called Atma it's a good definition why it is called of the body this body gross body not only gross body the subtle body dream body not only dream body the Sleep body all these three bodies are resting on what and the ocean of consciousness because it is substantial let's say you call Atma Capital Atma and also you call this jivatma mixed together is called jibatma what I am I am that substratum Consciousness added with this name form of gross Body Central body causal body added to these three bodies that has taken the name of this so it is called the cell because it is substratum of all the bodies and because of its all-permissiveness this is called the self Atma another because bring her bring her to Earth blah blah blah means it is vast and bring her thought also means firmness and it is so it is Atma what is Atma what is Brahman a new definition new type of definition it is said Atma it is called Atma because my Atmos is individual soul it's it is a ground on which is rest is so big and all pervasive that's why it's called the Atma and when because of the firmness due to its vastness bring her to us and bring her to what Brahman is bring her to Earth it's firmness and bring that vastness because of these two qualities it is called Brahma it is [Music] 42 . he said nothing has been mentioned foreign nothing special so Batman and Brahman there is no distinction there as it appears here that it is only two way of looking at Atma why say all pervasive and it is substratum of my all the three bodies my gross body is resting on that consciousness my subtle body is inside this body so it is resting on the same Consciousness and the causal body that also resting in the same one so because of this it is called this is the Atma because that gives the substance stay we are here because of that that's it that's my heart money you go individual wave think that you go down into the individual wave causal body subtle body gross body all resting in that portion of water but not the whole ocean you think of your little space of water so you go there that's called the Atman foreign and there is no distinction it is the same firmness and all expensive messages now what to do now now comes the Practical question is what is all this talk it is not intellectual talk knowing knowing does not mean intellectual knowledge knowing means experiencing in the very and core of the understanding that knowing this that that is called Atman that is called Brahman and white is Atman why it is Brahman because it is the substratum of all because it cannot be experienced to the senses it is not little as that five senses filled there that is the story also in the Ken upanishad all the gods they are proud of their own achievements they conquered the demons but they are the gods means some devota that means identifying with the organs of power so the god of the Wind she's a power and he he tried to understand Brahman which cannot be recognized in appearance some someone comes over here he does not look like a man does not look like a god or goddess or whatever we have our conception we say we cannot recognize so Brahman appeared in that way that's why jaksa and bio devata they could not win there and other gods also one by one and came back not recognizing because they are not yet that understood that reality that a foundation is Brahman Atman one Atman is ground is that Brahman the Atman we say because we look at the individual individual wave and you now think of the infinite wave in this ocean and and go bar down of each one and where you reach a firm ground of Consciousness everywhere that is called Brahman so when they forget that the Brahman is the power causal body you are talking from causal body level or you are in a subtle body level mind intellect intellectual level but that all this as a foundation and that Foundation is Brahman and that Foundation is individually if you look you should be humbled it's not I am doing anything nothing I can do it is the Consciousness behind behind my ear this apparent physical mental emotional intellectual body this body what I think I so it is the Atman is the ground that's where to know that Atman and then one knows that then when sarupam your own real nature not this physical body not this subtle body not this causal body you are not all this the ground of that existence which is giving you allowing you to function in these three bodies same water content so giving the shape of the eye so that is to be understood that as swarupa in your own nature not this is not the sarupa this is my mind and emotions they are not my sarupa they're superimposed my understanding is not sarupo it's an superimposition and knowing this song bisanthi aswam knowing your own real Rupa real nature when you know be something and become very satisfied rested and you rest in that Atman no you are that Atman knowing means not again I am saying it is not knowing intellectually as we are reading now it is not emotionally feeling something but it is knowing the real nature of us when each individual sarupam in your own real nature that is the Rupa real form that is the real nature be something when you get rested there oh Sake O original he'll be really fulfilled christato he will be Mission fulfilled mission mission accomplished son it will be your mission of life will be accomplished you'll be fulfilled he'll be then jivan he will be a man enough liberated while free while liberated they are free while moving in life you know you will be walking in the street but you will not look like us but you will not be like us but you will be realized so and realize means free while living realize jivan have been discussed in the scripture jivan muktu means one mukti is that after death oh he has very great Soul at the point of death he thought of God and see or he went into samadhi and died okay because at the point of death he had the wisdom and the video identity anymore and jivan mukti is a very higher state they say because you experience that and come down from that plane and live in the world of reality babaharic world transactional world and you see that you feel yourself you are all permitted with that Consciousness and you see the whole world is permeated with Consciousness and love and joy that is called the jivan that is the goal of life no it is said jivan mukti het away we are born here only for this purpose to get the jibon mukti shukha what is the tremendous Joy in realizing the divine within while breathing not that after death I will get something I'll go to heaven who who knows we'll go to heaven or any other place there is no guarantee guarantees that only now you can get it here then it is guaranteed you've got it now that's the jivan mukti when jivan when you are breathing when it is a life life force is still functioning you attend that knowledge and that knowledge is the knowledge of Brahman that is jivan mukti there is tremendous joy in jivan mukti that's why we adore these photographs here they're all jibanukku more than that but that is uh all the saints of the world we adore they are jivan mukhtas or they have experienced such thing the death does not make it Terror to them they live in the absolute Joy nothing can deter their Joy so don't know so what what is to be done this vedanta which has been taught who is talk teaching and where you understand it is being taught by bhagavan Krishna to whom Arjuna who lost his son abhimanyu on the 13th day of the war and that totally depressed and now some Krishna is pushing him in what flight you are thinking of your son died in the war in just where unjust War and what shall I do I am I'm not I am totally lost No Such Thing fight because it is a transactional world but in reality that is the truth so it is it is called the Atman that is you the Atman and get to that experience of Atman then you'll be totally fulfilled and satisfied your mean life will be meaningful and fulfilled now some question but I'll leave the running translation oh we are done almost what you see the next day this chapter will be over after knowing the real nature of your own self when he will attain perfect rest in yourself oh dear friend then you will be accomplished and best being liberated while living in the body jivan mukta huh after knowing the real nature of your own self we have to know what is our real nature and when you will attain perfect rest in yourself you can rest in your real self big self not the small self we live always in a small self I live always in the pity eye this pity eye he said this to me why he looked at me like that I didn't do that I this Petty I knew when you live in this cosmic eye big eye then oh dear friend he will be accomplished in life and you'll be blessed being liberated liberated not after death foreign if you get it now you live joyfully and then experience all under everywhere undaunted like some people cannot do what to fear death calm death with courage and strength he who hugs mother Kali the death hugs death and wants happiness and misery is friends the Mother of Divine comes to her not him so this is that fearlessness will come and that is the accomplishment and liberated they say after you realize in your life jiban mukti the point of time will come when the body will drop when you are forever still you are in the body so you are eating sleeping living in the little bit of Duality but when the body will drop totally brahmaline that's why they call brahmaline in Himalaya as you go to sadhus there's brahmali in Swami such and such that means he is marched into Brahman that is the okay so we should this is the goal of life to be jivan mukta practice we have been born here to experience the unadulterated joy of the total freedom and then otherwise there is no meaning of being born in this world not to cry and weep and die one day sir so I have done medical progress today 39. okay now if any question no more questions any question from this here one has come boom Shanti Shanti Shanti Om that's at SRI Ram Krishna harpanamas too so tomorrow is our gospel class by Sami medhananda gospel class now the question do I have my own personal Atman or is it common to all yes at one is the sachidan on the ocean just do you think your Atman is yes the wave standing there you think the the foundation of that wave you can say this is my Atman but this Atman is nothing but because no entire Atman becomes Brahman so yes I am my own personal Atman no no such as thing when you go to Atman Atman and Brahman there is no distinction if we can really go to that real self that real self is the self of all it is universal self and real self there is no distinction Brahma asked me that's why it is called a home a home means I which I not that I which is identifying now with my body my emotion not that I but I am that I am that means that infinite ocean that I am when people with their ego structure of the wave drops into the ocean when you say I am the Atman that means you wave drops into the floor and then they become one with the ocean then your ocean you are separating yourself with ego guru's body subtle body causal body that is a structure coming out as it imagine that's a physical body is a structure inside is the causal body and subtle body no when one identifies not I am neither the causal body neither the central body neither the physical body then water suppose the water drops and merges into the ocean then your Atman becomes Brahman you have no identity anymore that's why in Somali there is no identity who will identify with whom that's why Brahman and Atman are one in that state okay many thing no question oh that we talk every time subtle body and causal body huh subtle this is the growth word you know so rosebuddy look at that what are the functions what is gross body the this this is called eyes punch again into five organs of perception five organs of action hand feet etcetera five ten Five Element water air fire Etc etcetera and Pancha suksuta some there are different ways of explaining but let me do this five six five subtle elements subtle elements means same air water fire when you subtle part ner pot finer part so now we are here now suppose I go to sleep now what will happen you will decide identify with this physical body but you in the dream you are going in a dream body what you have in the dream body same fiber eyes here etcetera five hand feet Etc this is the subtle body I'm talking about uh I piped in then five elements are there there also you drink water they are also you see the earth a material flower fruits no so all the five subtle elements are there five five the three into five and subtle and 17 elements mind is there in your dream don't you feel that someone is attacking you or don't you run away or argue uh in the in the dream we argue with people and intellect is working my ego is also working so intellect ego and also memories maybe some memory may be there so these four mind intellect ego and memory all four just jumbled up into two they call two buddhi so mind intellect and this 20 I say three into five fifteen five organs of perception five hand feet carmindio and five subtle elements 3 times 5 15 and these two that's called the subtle body 17 elements make the subtle body your subtle body when you dream imagine that is your subtle body and we only die we get out of this body and live in that body that means you go to heaven or hell whatever you go our mind as much thinking we did that thought will lead us to that plane and now suppose when you are going to deep sleep then what remains all other drops you only remember I I you say I slept well I did not know when it rained that means you are saying you do not know that means you are saying I know that I do not know got the first argument I know that I do not know that means I was there and do not know is there that is called the ignorance that ignorant level is called the ego body that is called the Karana causal body and we come back we play hold our life so long we are either staying in the gross body or in the dream body or I do not know anything that body these are the three bodies but when and when you can practice spiritual discipline and grow from this level to that level to that level and enter inside then you can reach problem anyhow that's why we think that I am not the body not the mind I'm Atman I'm Atman I am the Atman we go to the ground of existence what we did today okay peace peace peace
