[66. Shanti Gita - Class 66 - chapter 6 - verse 21 - 23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WI0TdU73nxc)

[Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all so we are in the middle of the reading of our text shanti gita the song of peace the advice of bhagavan krishna to arjuna again primarily it is given before the war that we know as bhagavad-gita and this is the gita which has been again retold by bhagavan krishna when arjuna lost his son in the war and he was unethically killed there in the war so he was totally upset and in that moment he was very much despondent and this message brought him back to his power and strength so we read the other day the verses up to 20. so what we just read in two three verses before it is said that how that ishwara the god this sachidaan under the consciousness absolute consciousness he reflected in the cosmic mind and as a result he became we call god the creator sustainer and destroy by how by samaya by his own magical power a power of maya that means that power has that which is not there everyone can see it is there non-existent appearing in another form so that is with this maya he became ishwara and then maya abrita by covering by covert by maya then that god lord he became sarvaga al-nawar all knowing bhaved isha is the controller master of controlling everything sharp shaktimaan the source of all power and ichari sarvakottam he has the power to the agency of desiring whatever he wants to create it is by the covering power of the maya and then then then there came some kulp of a resolution what is the resolution came in the mind of the cosmic mind that absolute unchanging reality it says is from the cosmic mind arrows that type of resolution that echo evo i am only alone or one not alone but i am only one boho i will be many so that cosmic plan that came in the mind it is a desire that we are talking about the same thing in our bhagavata class and what it says because of this maya this power of god maya is a veiling power for us bailing power and and projecting power maya has two powers it covers what is existing and not only that it creates what is not there the gross example being this as you see in the movie when you entered in the movie hall the reality that we are all sitting there in the chair and there is fan there is ac air conditioned there is a white screen light like this we see everything and then it is no movie when the movie starts first thing they do switch off the light that means ignorance auburn covering and not only that they don't keep you in the dark room sitting there for one hour they project something and that projection is not there no reality there's a light and the real film is moving and we see the projection and we forget our own environment and we look at that with awe and sometimes we smile and sometimes we cry sometimes emotionally we are lost we are upset we frighten what is happening there and we are getting affected ultimately nothing is happening you are sitting your comfortable chair and your friends are all around no tiger is coming no serial killer is with the gun ak-47 is running there no running no jumping no howling nothing happening but you see we see that yes it is happening and not only that you feel the physical expression of the emotions in your body and mind so this is called the maya nothing happened i am the same atman pure consciousness and bliss but avaran maya shakti the power of maya is veiling your what you are it matters forgot i am atman i am brahman i am the pure consciousness i am sachidan and not only that it has projected this concept i'm the body and it's so real and everything is real anything happening to me my body i am upset with that i am happy with that anything happening in my mind a very tricky area some someone says some few words in the mind mass i am gone i am destroyed today i go to depression someone pampers me i'm like i go up so this funny thing is going on it's a projection so this is the maya maya's power it is not allowing us to know who we are it is our covering and not only it is not satisfied by covering our knowledge but is happy to create something which is not there and make us jump like a monkey and run like a donkey or what so this is called maya shakti so he says maya and in this maya utgata in the maya comes the time concept of time comes when you are in your own self buttless deathless eternal self there is no time it is timeless time space condition has not nothing to do in brahman in our real nature in our very vital self but when you are in the realm of maya maya this world there comes first thing comes time and then good got a color and that color the first created time is called mahakala that's a lord shiva great time he observes all the changes of time mahakala mahakal shiva he observes his changes this is observer but observer is one step down from the reality i am the observer the observation observer duality is there so here kalo mahakala it is suta that is called the kaala that is called the mahakala kala shaktir mahakali and the shakti of the mahakala is the shakti mother mahakali she is called maha kali [Music] uddhpavat and that it comes out of that let me see what is that so so it says time that has risen from maya that is called the great time mahakala the concept of time comes and what past production that is the shiva and that mahakala he is called and the power of that great time mahakala is called mahakali and she's a primordial as it springs up at the very beginning so that is the mahakali comes out that's why shiva and makkali we find the picture there is mother is standing it springs from shiv maha kaala the time concept is coming up and the whole creation starts and the whole creation is makkali's creation they call shakti manifestation of sakthi so we have read up to that first now 25th verse [Music] everything is born in time is it not this planet earth was not there in time one big sun came to the sun and there was some gravitational food or something it happened in time you are born in time we are all born in our own time anything happening in life in time it is happening so kalino jayati serbum this whole universe whatever we see this plant was not here it was jayate it become like that in time we say in certain such and such year this plant this tree was planted here this house was not here it was built in such and such here so everything in the in the level of our existence it happening in time and time and time and sermon everything remains in time see this building remains per hundred years it is so it is everything coming in time existing in time and kali maknuti in time it gets destroyed lost therefore survey therefore whatever you see everything is kala vasanuga is everything under the control bosom is controlled and everything is subject to time that's why it is said hitler is hitler in time did such things but there is the end end point of it the mullan came to india it is a time but when he did it did in time he arrows become a such power in time so all the world political leaders are bombing and doing and doing all these things attracting other kind in time and what will happen in time they will die they say whatever you are seeing it is happening in time whatever you see exist it happens it remains in time and it ends in time so there is nothing permanent here that's a time is one of the part of maya so everything is born due to time and remain in time in time everything attends dissolution everything comes under the spell of time everything in this world of duality even you see gods and christ and buddhas they came in time their physical body has gone they are nothing permanent and their impact in time say after 50 000 years who will remember whom where buddha where christ were rama krsna in the vast span of time everything goes on like that so it comes in time it exists in time we also we are existing coming in time we are all born in a particular time that's right that's why they say prague means after that day before that day your existence was not there track before your birth where are you you were you are there or not they say you are in your praga bhava state it's a technical term prague means above non-existent before your birth you are in that state you don't come out of zero you are in a state potential before your birth so in a prague of our state so but everything when manifested it is in time it is existing it's in time it will just be destroyed in time there's nothing absolute all right and when the person goes into deep sleep does the person affected by time of course because that time he may not be aware but there is a part of the mind remains still there otherwise why or otherwise it will be samadhi they come back and they say i slept well how do you say i slept well slept it's a past tense that means in that period there is not total dissolution total dissolution will happen in samadhi that almost mars as if you are so dormant know that as if as if dead as if dead but not dead still there so kali you know this is very important thing that say ramakrishna said once no had i known that this world is real then i could have paid of my ki covered the whole of kamarpuku with gold plate but it is all in time it is just it is all we are talking about the other class is sure even ishara is under time only unchangeable thing is the brahman if you call god god also creates what is a cycle one time he creates one time does not one time sleeps so if he sleeps sometime if he wakes up sometime and he acts sometime that's a change so in the absolute sense ishara is also in the level of duality absolute truth is only in that transcendental level where mind and everything is dissolved so so this whole world is a play of mahakali see which book is telling this the one of the top vedanta book is saying the world is a play of mahakali it's a gita gita is talking about kali not krishna krishna people fight with that kali and krishna they don't go to they're not compatible in their view so but anyhow that to hear this scripture is very clear kaala shakti maha kali the shakti of the kaala is the maha kali that's the shakti power without power manifested in the world does not exist only everything exists in when it is manifested a seed is seed when it manifested it becomes a tree before manifestation who cares for a seed but when it manifests like this banyan tree then is oh my god it's a big tree so manifestation is the question and that is the under shakti and the power of maya now kali no jayata sarvam therefore kali in time everything is born sarvang khali chopra everything is existing in time only kali bilay mapnothi and in time everything will be dissolved in time survey everything kaala vasanuga everything is controlled by time look at time is controlling us all no time says that it is morning get up time says now we have to go for work time say i am to cook time say i have to go to shower time say i'll finish with the whole day's level time say i am to go to sleep now see everything is guided by time time controls us with not of the rod in hand but unconsciously we are controlled by our whole life is controlled by that that is the you have to understand the devotees will look upon this as a shakti power mother it's mother's power working a mother is guiding us mother is protecting us mother is asking us to do that's why doctors always say i am doing mother's work ma i did it and i walked around this i did whatever jotu you know show no no whatever you hear is mother's mantra nagor you know when you go around the town you see monekaru nagar phiromone production so this is time controls everything therefore [Music] [Music] what is that this mahakala this great shiva kala kala is the great time god fire is not great time from look at this entire universe is interpenetrated by that time every atom atomic movement in subatomic movement even the plant growing into a tree everywhere the force of mahakali but that mahakali comes from where mahakala shiva so sarvopapi mahakala the maha kaala is sarbukbapi i'm not all pervaded say mahakal that great time or shiva as we say is serba bapi it is permitted everywhere nirakara he has no form no shape niramayan what is niramaya nirama is pure it is all stainless that shiva when not manifested it is all that's the sachida that's why it is said that that mahakala that great time which he called the unmanifest consciousness and bliss it's all pervaded and nira karo because it is not limited in any form nirakara niramaya it is free from all blemishes that is pure upadhi but when it gets connected with the upaji upadhi means limiting adjuncts limiting adjuncts means the water is water when it comes in contact with a cup it takes the shape of the cup when you pour into the glass it takes the shape of the glass you put into the bowl it takes the shape of the bowl it takes the even appears the color will be according to the color of the pot or where you are keeping so this kalupadi for the limiting adjuncts limiting adjuncts what are the limiting adjuncts we are all body mind emotion ego these are all limiting it limits me my infinite nature to a very limited idea about what we are we are that's why it is happening due to the combination with the attributes upadhi yogat due to yoga union of upadhi limiting adjunct limiting adjunct is imposed upon me yoga when it i identify dupadi then comes my world consciousness world view that in mahakali becomes then and then at that time time manifests in various forms and it shines forth everything is transferred in time a town a city a desert area phoenix has now become a big city no you go to the city that has been ruined and destroyed become desert no it's all in happening in time it is the power of time and shakthi but it is happening on the maha kaala that is unchanging time that is mahakar is it different terminology not telling about brahman here but he is giving the concept of time so the great time mahakalo he is it is all pervading and it is firmness because if it is infinite all permitting it cannot have a form if it is formed then it is limited it cannot be all permitting so it is alpha meaning it is formless and it is stainless and pure due to its combination with the attributes time shines forth in various ways that's why there is a hindi proverb there the sadhus say about maya maya maito brahmbahum jabtu nahito beach maya and they they say something bad about maya maya to chahari chamari nishan kinich this maya this misunderstanding this time you have created all trouble for me my brahma i was brahmana i am brahmana nahitu beach you have intercepted in me and you have created this delusion and see what is my condition if you are not there then i am always athman i am the atman i am the battleless so that's why it is called the time signs forth in various way what this it cannot be the swatches are on the infinite cannot be in limited in this name and form but it appears because of the maya mahakali our attributes of ignorance time shines forth in various ways now it's a giving little further description at how shiva mahakalo the time unchanging time absolute where there is no blemish pure he became like this because the maya we have heard are you called maha kali the shakti because of the shakti now he says means and the name is blinking of an eye and you must know blinking that means happy second even a spirit of split second animation from that time calculation to the yuga now no time has gone so much no how much it can you can and break the time once again to how much parts nano second nano second means what 10 to 10 to the power power minus 9 now see um so you can split that time even yeah that much even nimisha anyway so old days idea blinking of the eye it's so fast from there to juga jugo means aeon 12 years but in yoga is normally called exube is 12 years but real calculation is huge number of how many millions of years human years are considered from this split second to that huge amount of time you go from the time span last oh a2 lasting for juga means 4 million 320 000 human years human years only this much 4 million 322 000 years of human suppose we live one year so we live for 4 million 322 thousand year then only one juga one eon of time then in hindu calculation that golden age golden yeah then iron age now we are going to die on it deep dark anyhow that means wide span of time what they are saying imprinting in our mind that the split second minimum second nano minute nano second to the billions of years called perhaps one thousand yugas made call for one kalpa is called one kalpa is equal to one thousand yuga so one juga is four million thirty two three hundred twenty thousand years human years and split second the eye blinking from this small to this point right right 43 to 4 million 323 yeah one image 0.43 second okay google that's a google says not even half second right so you know zero point four three ah not even half second anyhow so that that's why i said from half a second uh it is overall calculation now culpo serbam all yoga kalpa sarvam tasmin proculpito prokalpita means imagined it has been kalpana we did the kalpuna over that what over what the timeless entity that is the mahakala on that this time starting from half a second to our nanosecond to this one thousand of yogas kala then there is kalpaha that means more and more bigger idea about timing everything all das mean prakalpitum are imagined on that unchanging pure mahakala and kalato avood mahatma from time it came see we are reading in the today's bhagavata training what is mahatma buddhi philosophy they will say then four of the 24 cosmic principles [Music] and all the 24 principles this all does mean broken and from this time came this mahatma what is the mahatha all the intelligence mind 24 and the five gross element five subtle element five organs of perception five organs of action this 24 principle everything has come sprung out of that mahakala my ego has come out of it that means starting from ego to our physical body this body is made of five element you know it is the only transformation of rice dal chicken fish vegetables fruit whatever we think we are eating it is nothing but a transform form no we do it looks nice it's by a fine thing but it is nothing but this elemental thing so here it says that everything came forth from mahatma and martha to do you go to the final level mata intelligence intelligence behind ego they all came but nothing from outside it all came from the substratum of that mahakala so it is there is much less difference in understanding because they are talking about the same thing could you make a distinction that what we are reading in the bhagavata in this afternoon and what we are reading in shanti that same principle same so what does it mean that starting from a split second to a yoga means 4 million 320 human years and a kalpa means thousand of thousand times of that human calculation of the yuga serbum everything in this universe we see this mean in it prakalpitum is imagined it is not there it is imagined is imagine why we are seeing now but it does not stay when an illumined person sees the whole universe is sunnam it becomes sunnah there comes the sunnah bada the philosophy of white void theory void of what the name and form what i see this existence where i am this perception about the sensory objects these are all mere your mental fantasy very difficult to accept this this is a fantasy of my mind yes how to believe it no but you do that it is fantasy because when you sleep it has no existence to you when you go to deep sleep where is the existence of this world with your anxieties worries suffering pain excitement achievement failures what does it stand it is no value it is not existing at all mind is zero you are zero this mind when taking into enlightenment and you enter into the mahakala we are talking about that absolute pure stainless divine self you may say i am saying that i cannot say anything about it because i will not be there these are all expressions coming down from that that's why or poor know who will say there is a fight with the buddhists buddhist white void until full fool but both are wrong because you cannot say if you say then you are defiling the truth how can you say without the help of your mind you are taking the help of your mind mind itself is changing every second your mind is changing your ego is changing your understanding is changing and holding in that object you are calculating what is that beyond that's why it is that's why it is the different language is used negative language that is you cannot say anything scripture say it is beyond your speech or bark speech mana beyond your mind perception of your mind as mind becomes pure you have a greater perception though but mind becomes mindless a point comes where there is no mind because mind is a limited tool you you calculate the stars and galaxies in all the galaxies and what is far away 100 billion light year what does it mean 100 like billion light year 1 billion light year is what one light year is what you have any conception you will abs you will understand what is that infinite absolute what happens beyond mind who will say what happens that's why it is better not to speak that's why buddha didn't speak much it was all fight comes speaking when you express and then comes the conflict no mind is right you decide and your intelligence is higher than me then he will win the case and if i am more intelligent i will i will win the case but it is not winning the case case is in the relatively level in the duality level again coming back to this world of duality but it is there is no one you cannot say one you cannot say it too you cannot say many you cannot say nothing you cannot say yes something who will say that you need a mouth to speak you need a mind to express you need an ego to understand that how can you say which is beyond all these limits so that will be the point so ego mind emotion intellect all these different things down to the level of this body and of everything is happening in time and it is the expression of time starting from a split second to a yuga and the kalpa everything is made in this great time that's why it's called the you have to name something we human being we cannot deal with nameless thing our transactional world does not work that's why when a baby is born what do you do you teach him he baby does not know anything he has no distinction with nose and air and eyes are nothing uncle aunty nothing no concept man women has no concept there is a knife or a honey sucking what you call toddlers eating something so he has no concept everything is same to him but we say hey hey no this is called nose this is called year how many days we are taught like that so we get into this knowledge no when this one become illumined they become like the child they become so innocent they see the truth everywhere the same that's why where you see the only absolute means you see nothing but that again again language is so difficult c don't say the word c c means you are using their eyes she means you are in imagining in your mind forget about that but i am to say why we say even even if you so this is also an indication nothing you can indicate it is that that's why it is ramakrishna said why it is sunnah no means void void of this world of this name and form in mahakala in this great time this entire absorption comes then this entire universe dissolves which dissolves every day for our in deep sleep similarly when one can get illumination or be awakened in the cell then they will they can say what happens actually and they cannot say anything what is the story of the bharadha bhaskar you know bhaskar is the teacher masculine bardo a teacher and student no and one student came to the teacher and said sir please teach me what is that ultimate reality ask you call about brahman atman you are talking about so he thought that as as we are talking big lecture that means you have understood nothing you're talking too much means you don't understand anything because you are using your brain you are relying on your senses you are relying on your mind these are insufficient tools in this area so the student asked sir please tell me i want to know what is the ultimate truth what is unchanging absolute is there anything like that please tell me and he has read some scriptures and came and the teacher remained silent and not saying anything after a long time the student felt very embarrassed sir please tell me i have come all the way to hear from you you are a realized person tell me what is that what is that reality hmm and then third time after a long time the student was earnestly requesting and her teacher opened the mouth he said my boy i was telling you what is that reality like but you didn't understand it cannot be expressed silence is the name only that who can feel he can feel swami vivekananda has a beautiful song what is that song obama [Music] there is neither sun neither moon neither this beautiful beautiful universe of our vision and there everything is all disappearing [Music] [Music] me everything is dissolved everything going away and last trace i i i last stress that stream of consciousness i i am trying to experience i was trying to see that i i i stopped the world was not there it entered void entered into violence exactly the language of buddhism void entered into whiteness then what is that i cannot say i cannot say speech i cannot express i cannot feel by my mind mind can be there in duality ego can be there in duality when ego also dies who will say what is that but is it something then is it yes or is it no people are fighting all through the life vivekananda who has the experience he or she can understand because after coming down he can say what is that and he cannot say when he says he defiles the truth that is called the understanding of the absolute mahakala that is the perfect truth okay so we can end here time is there any question so if you that there is no time timeless state time if you come into time mahakala that is you are talking about mahakala mahakali is there if there is no mahakali what is after telling it mahakala if the creation is there creator and creator what comes when when there is a creation if the creation is not there what will you say creator a mother is mother so long she has a baby if there is no baby why do you call her as mother you can give other description to her so similarly the creation and unless the creation is there this this creation creator question does not come as you said in the other class that it is mistake to say ishwara ishwara is a change god lord that's also under change because he creates vedanta will say he has some imperfection why he will create bhakto will say no no buy his sweet will and white sweet will vedanti will say why sweet will is he imperfect that sweet will we we wish what we are bored with one thing we get to get another experience yeah is the absolute beyond time space is that same thing that they're lacking something and get something it is not so so language is very difficult don't talk let's say experience is the only point real religion is inexperienced that's why some people cannot say religion is realization not talk yes before we have that experience that realization is it better to think of that absolute reality not to be too political with buddhists but to think of that absolute reality asset this or you know point is that everyone every philosophy is true you follow the path if your jain buddhism or any buddhism or any hinduism you follow sincerely you will arrive at the same conclusion there is no truth true truth is not there only one reality people have to understand that and this is the age of ramakrishna who has depicted in his own life everything leads to the same and he has practiced every path but my temperament may be devotional okay let me practice devotion but think and ultimately if you reach your perfection mind becomes so much pure no our mind is crowded buddhism will say and hinduism says same thing desire last greed if this dart and dust is removed from the heart then what happened the mind becomes transparent transparent mind is like i can see through and that there will be a veil of course when i say see true still there is a layer some distinctive layer penetrate that and that is so easy ramakrishna give the example suppose the ship is moving and imagine the magnet mountain if you don't the ship does not want to come close the magnet will pull in such a way you are lost you become one who will say you are a sheep that was a magnet mountain you become magnet realization will happen that's why it purify the mind purify the mind whatever path we follow matters very little the main purpose is the crowd it is three things three practices and they prescribe manonas destroy the mind mercilessly this mind creates all this duality mind is creating all suffering mind is creating all fantasy our fantasy of the mind see two people are friends all over suddenly one thought came in the mind of them one huh why are you doing this that this means that that means that that means that this is good there's nothing between the fact mind is the primary culprit so this mind should be purified beautiful manonas and they they are so strong nasa means chop the head of the mind there is no mind if you can do that bashan akshay your desire exhaust the desire there is nothing to desire for this is all transient what shall i do with it and tattoo cannot think that reality is unchanging absolute or you don't want to say say whatever way but vedanta says it is that absolute reality and i am saying that because to feel that experience i am saying but when i will go there then i will be able to in heart to heart experience what is that reality yes it's like you're taking the relative and collapsing it back to the absolute so if i remove the duality that's relational of creator creation etc because i am in that level i don't know how philosophically i talk about that i know that i am hungry i need some food it is a reality but this reality though so real to me but it is not ultimate reality even my mind someone's mind is in heavy joy no he forgets food he does not like food he does not need food a person is deep depression bring a food a plate he will not relish it he will not get it the world becomes all dull and meaningless to a person whose mind is depressed to a mind person of joyful cheerful there is no breakthrough he has not eaten for two days there is no dress there is no much luxuriousity he is happy and dancing and singing in joy the whole world is playing mind's play so how to get out of this mind not to kill it but to transform the mind and purify the mind and mind will gradually take the expanded form and that expansion will end when mind will die that the example of ramakrishna is that there is a frog there was a frog in the well he has only the concept of the well he's born there he's raised there and he was living happily and suddenly one day he found that there is a big frog came hopping hopping and jumping and seeing that big frog hey who are you i'm a frog you come where do you come from oh i'm coming from the ocean ocean is what is a huge amount of water huge amount of water my well this more than this then this ocean frog says hari this is what is nothing then he of ego his ego he wants to measure god he wants to measure the ocean with this little body little mind little capability so he give one jump big jump this big then the ocean frog says no no what are you talking it's nothing then he got a yes is it more and another jump and third time he gave such a jump that he burst and he died and by dying he understood it is immeasurable by your limited mind so let the mind be purified then it will happen and of course one thing is there when you come down from that level absolute experience of that then you are a transformed personality you become a buddha you cry for everyone suffering why you will cry unless you feel i am there why someone feels pain for others suffering mother feels the pain of the baby even baby is crying or not crying man knows mother knows what is the problem with the baby because there's total identification the whole identification comes that's why buddha says again buddha comes so many people can understand i will be born and reborn again till one dog remains unfair hungry to feed him is my religion who can say that where people are all grabbing money for their own purpose and selfishness and everything that is the life and these people are talking about touching the ground of their very reality i'll be born again and again to suffer thousands of miseries is the language of swami vivekananda buddha why he is to born again why bodhisattva what is the need of compassion i am brahmana i am satisfied that's all huh that's okay thank you no question today [Music] okay as it is posted on the description section all these verses what we did we read up to verse number 1 23 no three verses we did no see my progress is every day yeah 23 up to 23 we have
