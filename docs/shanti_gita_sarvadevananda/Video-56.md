[53. Shanti Gita - Class 53 - Verses 23-25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekbcoYiGotQ)

[Music] [Music] [Music] oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face on peace peace peace be unto us all so we were reading this text called shanti gita the song of peace is an advice of bhagavan krishna to same arjuna at a different point of time when arjuna was grieved and despondent at the death of his son only bright son of even this this happened on the 13th day of the war and now [Music] this question we are reading that what is the knower of truth is a general question noir of truth how do we understand how do they eat how they receipt how they talk how they interact so this is an interesting idea to think about how these people of spiritual illumination will be behaving is there any sign that we understand that they are something special they are some people of illumination so he says no the noir of truth they behave very diverse way according to their past sangha scholars samskaras you know impressions mental impressions we are all guided by our impulses something pushes us i want to be good but it is not in my hand something diverts me digresses me it's a buddhi and buddhi is a very bad thing right and good it may guide you to divine direction and once it may again turn you to the other direction now you cannot trust the mind but mind when pure mind you can trust that pure mind when one have achieved spiritual illumination the mind becomes clear distinct it is like a glass you can see through what is their other side what is this side but most of the time the problem comes mind is wrongly directed but for a knower of truth how he will behave because he has already cleaned the mind no but still the cleaning of the mind though it is done what happens when you come to the body level your old impulses will push you you do you may not be attached to that prior to illumination try to know the having the vision of god or the realization of the truth that you are divine when you go go to that point the life's trajectory was going on this way no and this life's trajectory is like throwing a stone it is out of your hand in last life when he died the last thought which which you had that is the throwing of the stone started there i will be like this one thought and whole life is going on on the basis of that and that's the direction and speed everything has been set now the life is going on suppose it it is it stone is thrown and it will drop at maybe 300 feet away at a particular time it will take a time of this time supposing in between the time you got god realization what will happen then what the reason is happen so you know your old karma is gone this karma will no effect no effect of any other karma will be there because you have realized the truth but your body your body will move in the same way because it is trajectory you cannot just change it at that point no you trigger a bullet when it is gun out of your ham and a hand then after it is released its direction and momentum is all set it will go and hit the target you can say don't go there you know i want to change it no no no that old traditional direction of the body and mind will be moving in that way now but what can you do you can realize god that's why when one realizes god what happens though they have realized but their normal behavior pattern does not change much they look like the same as if they are the old person that's why spiritual practice is very important that's why even it is said great spiritual people by practice they change their thinking process and everything but what is happening in the nature old nature because you are entering into the nature of the body when your mind is in samadhi you are up okay that when you enter into the body body goes its own trajectory the karma is guiding you therefore they behave differently that you are reading that it is said sometimes what they do these holy people like a nanabe should hurry he says that sometimes like an actor takes various forms by putting on different apparel some yogi is always engaged in a beggar-like behavior some other behaves magnificently like a king someone being desirous is engaged in so-called apparent enjoyment and fun some is endowed with tremendous renunciation detachment some wears gorgeous dress some is covered with torn clothes some is without any clothing naked nang taba huh some with west band girl on the copinum so you cannot judge how do you get no no knowledge is something else inside but external behavior you cannot judge by seeing the external behavior ramakrishna so simple and sometimes the janaka again janaki is the king who is the knower of truth but he's the king he's enjoying kingly all this krishna krishna is the king so he has all the queens and surrounded by the royal people like a king has been but he's full of knowledge again again you go to um [Music] rama rama in the exile sometimes the wearing ordinary dress in the as a mendicant use in the deep forest no and when he's again king in the kingdom he's sitting in a golden throne and commanding the ministers to do things but he's in our truth so that's why it is said because it someone will be using like anointing the body with perfume some important param smearing with the ashes in the himalayas you go sadhu baba and you see the kumbh melakuma you see how many shadows you see some of these hadoos wearing asses all over the body someone is using golden this thing that you see sometimes there is nothing in the body but one of these truss is there they look very funny [Laughter] not even no wearing cloth or anything but one hair is touches there someone is wearing some chain so it is peculiar so by by this external appearance you cannot understand their uh spiritual inner spiritual flavor but more ganesh sometimes sometimes ganys will be silent sometimes one gany will be vocal giving advice and things sometimes ghanaians may be angry to tapuri not mad because someone is trying to get some charcoal for hubble bowl smoking hubble bubble and he got mad is this it is a holy dhooni shalkilu so he ran with the tongue in hand that means this external behavior but they are all promognes so it is very difficult by external that's why holy mother sarudadevi said that it is what happens if one attains brahmagana bhagavan love does one grow to horns on the head if we know that god realization means someone is growing some horn oh he is ibrahim that you can you cannot because that does not happen god realization means in your heart you become aware of the consciousness of the divine you aware that you are that divine and the whole world is permitted with that divinity that purity that consciousness that blissfulness no so this is the chapter we are going through now we have read the last day 21 and 22 what is 21 says the yogis being totally free from all doubt and hesitations wander around with different moods and in diverse external appearances and there are sometimes in happy mood sometimes angry mood because the body behave body mind is not the they have separated vedanta idea they have separated themselves from their body and mind but when they are in the body what is functioning is in its old way it is going on so they behave like that but they are totally detached they are like a child child does not carry any impression but they behave behave differently but they have a very small young child they have no attachment they have no such anger or frustration comes but it does not stay with them they don't remember that child they may play together with a friend and got into fight but after two minutes they may forget and then they start their fun again so but adult people cannot do that because they have their song scars and they remember you did that you said that to me that day i remember maybe five years pass now but i will not forget that so this is the samskara but bro the brahmagan is the noise of truth actually they are like child they have no attachment to anything but their body mind functions in one way and they get behave like that so the yogis they are free from because their heart is free from doubts and hesitations they wander around in the world different moods sometimes like a child sometimes like a it is a ghoul sometimes like a gany knower of truth he'll be speaking like a fiery warts will come out sometimes like a devotee humble so that they live in different moods in different ways they cannot be known even a little by observing their external character from outside no yayate to tandishwa by seeing them to drishtvah by you observing them from the external you cannot have any idea no gayath you cannot know kinchit not even because in kinshit bhai shatter by the external from outside you know they sign by seeing the sign outside you cannot recognize them because next verse 22 you finish that last time that ordinary people due to body identity we ordinary people we behave because of our body identity no we only see the external sign no we judge people oh he is like that because of because i have my body identity so i observe everyone connected with the body and judge them but you see the external sign by how oh he was mean he was unkind his nature is like that but you cannot put the same judgment on again because they are detached from the body though they look like that eating sleeping like us but they are internally detached certainly the internal spirit is never to be understood from the external science how can i look at your face and know what you are thinking no so from seeing from outside and uh and judging someone is very difficult so guinness cannot be judged but those you can judge people who the psychologists they can understand by seeing the face facial expression they can assume something because they are dealing with the different people with different moods so they have some understanding psychiatrist and psychotherapist and others but that may be true may not be true also but for brahman ghanis you cannot put that formula for the brahmagani's noise of truth so today 23rd verse you jonathan [Music] [Music] he who knows sahjanati that person that means he who knows he can know that meaning only the one who has experienced knows no other who are simply engaged in intellectual debates those are engaged in intellectual debates philosophies different ideas with different schools of thought those who are fighting with school of thoughts pedanto qualified non-dualism dualism or in between the vedanta absolutism ekoji bobado one creation theory no creation theory there are so many facets of those those who understand this try to understand intellectually that intellectual thing is one but experience is something else so jamati he or she knows only who knows means who's experiences no not others who debates who argues in intellectual debate those people who are engaged in intellectual debate they do not know anything they are orana means the forest forest of shastra means the scripture sastra has you read the scripture there are different interpretations and all are interpretations same bhagavad-gita sankara charge interprets from the standpoint of non-dual vedanta the same gita interpreted by sridhara swami qualified non-dualistic idea name it goes dualistic explanation same verse emphasis goes on different because they are explaining from different perspective so but but they are realized that is a different thing they are looking at the same sun in different platforms from different distance but ordinary people intellectual people they spend their time in intellectual pursuit only sitting and questioning and answering and going on into heated discussion sometimes they get heated discussion and heated discussion to fight shout and then get fight so notation those who are engaged those who have not realized the truth they do not know the essential nature of these gannies ramakrishna could understand ramakrishna saw one sadhu came in daksinisha and he was eating something from the dustbin and feeding the dog and sometimes smiling hahaha and he said to sridharam hey sridhar will that be my condition someday and he's a ghani so see shiramura is no good understand is a noir of truth a mathematician can understand a mathematician no a physicist can understand better efficiencies now so in their field those who are expert in that field they know their who is what but only knowing intellectual knowing will not do whatever the spiritual wisdom those who have so this verse says he who has known he has known but other people who are engaged in debate only intellectual debate they don't understand they wonder in confusion with the in the vast forest of scriptural knowledge scripture is vast indian spiritual history so many the types of philosophies are there and it's intricate discussion is there the muslim muslims could not bond for bondage all the scriptures for days and days heaps of scriptures they put together and put to fire in nalanda and other universities you know so that means how many scriptures are you just to understand how big is that science of spirituality discussed among intellectual people debating but that will not give any freedom okay um that person only only the one that is the kind we have to face every day some people like that they want to enter they want to disturb huh only the one who has experienced experience he knows not others who are simply engaged in intellectual debates they wonder with confusion in the vast forest of scriptural knowledge there is no way for them to get out of it by any means ah sankaracharya says sastra bakkhan salam [Music] one eloquent person they can say some flowery words fluently speaking intellectually yeah bhagavad-giri the sound selection of sound to express the idea is so good sabbath the art of explaining the scriptures he is very extraordinary but these are all for it is for enjoyment enjoyment of your intellect intellectual enjoyment not to mukti it will not bring you liberation sri ramakrishna gave the example that in the almanac there is written that there will be heavy shower this month this day and ramadan says you take the almanac and squeeze you won't find a drop of water people talk big things but squeeze no experience here it is void without experience talk is talk only it is it is only some you may have some fun you may find some joy but it's intellectual joy there is great joy in intellectual debate that's why emotionally we can find joy intellectually we can find joy physically we can find physical joys we can find by eating food and this and that intellectual food that's also another food and that that type of joy you can get but not the joy essential joy what is your divine nature that you have to do spiritual practice that you are to dive deep into your heart so that is the point 23rd to 24th [Music] this truth of the atman the truth of brahman the real nature of the divine is this proposal is not easily attainable hard to attain hard to attain the truth because it is not visible i cannot see through the eyes i cannot dissect it with a knife i cannot find in a telescope or microscope or big powerful microscope and telescope didn't find dotman it cannot be in no tool is available in the world to know that as you know any material subject no it is not possible but it can be understood by sharp mind finally intellect very pure mind it can catch a glimpse of that truth mind cannot catch but it can catch the better glimpses of the truth that's why revelation comes in the heart no people feel i saw a light and this expression of that so when the mind becomes pure that type of expression may be felt that's why it is said this means the truth dr means the divine nature which is within atman the cell brahman that tattoo is this hard very hard to attain because people talk about that people argue about that study about that whole life people are doing thinking i am atman i am not the body not the mind no but to reach that experience is very very difficult naturally naturally difficult even to gain something physical which is available in the physical world you have to work so hard and what that which is not visible by the eyes cannot be caught by their palm cannot taste touch how can you understand that that's why bohu only by boho means many varieties of sadhana spiritual practice labyam that can be achieved only by tremendous spiritual practice that's why here is the key point that spiritual life is only for those people who practices religion not who talks swami vivekananda defined religion religion is realization it is not talk it is not intellectual gymnasium it has his own joy but it does not give liberation it does not give the wisdom so it is can be achieved only by deep spiritual practice not one type that's why sadhana is you have to discriminate what is eternal what is non-eternal every moment think what is permanent anything in the universe do you find permanent analyze anything bring into your awareness sun is permanent the moon is permanent stars are permanent i am permanent you are permanent what is permanent table is permanent so if it is not permanent what shall i do with it so analyze this is permanent this is impermanent so mind should be day and night thinking in this way so that mind will then lean towards what is permanent and and learn to get away what is impermanent is the second point you first know it is good it is bad and if you know surely it is bad give up that's called you detach throw away that object because it is not good if you know it is poison ultimately you know it is poison and its nectar if you wrote no really so long we do not know don't make a mistake we can take whatever we like but when you know that is poison like poison and this is like nectar so you didn't give up what is poison have the guts to say i don't care for that so this is necessary the steps then all this mental control in physical control titiksha um all these six stagers keep good coin money in your pocket in spiritual journey you know and mumuksat i want to be liberated that desire should be there so these are the quality of a student and student should practice this and then think who am i what is this universe what is this relationship with me so this is a serious task this cannot be achieved by simply sitting and debating with somebody it may be in india one time was full of these debaters and their style was that the scholars one philosophy will move from one place to another place and challenge the other person of different idea and philosophy and go on debating day and night and defeat them who will defeat so what is that what what will you gain people will say hahaha he's he's a great scholar that's all how many great scholars are in universities how many philosophy department in every university there are philosophy department many philosophers are there they are great they are understanding clear in in their philosophy but are they did they get solve their mystery of life the suffering the joy the money pain the agonies the fear could they conquer by the intellectual lectures no they can when they enter into the practice and everyday practice and detach not theoretical practice but actually to disrenounce if i know poison i give up if it is nectar i accept so that should be the way so that's why it is said can be achieved it is not labyam types of spiritual practice we in vedanta we say pray to god oh lord this is my mental condition please help me to clean my mind do karma whole day oh lord i do for you not for my own cause not by my selfish mood so purify the mind this way by meditation this way by meditate think that i am not the body i am the atman think of the atman or you restock who is the representative of the art one or the brahman meditate on that focus there so this practice is important repeat the holy mantra day and night if you are really having any mantra got some gurus mantra so this is very important otherwise this truth is this proper it is very very difficult to attain or it is almost impossible because of you maybe intellectual debate will not lead us to this experience even people do not do practice their life life after life they can study vedanto but nothing will happen it is to be reflected in the life it is to be really taken seriously and that to live that life bhagyang judisha now if once has the good fortune bhagava means kapal that means you have a great god's grace bhaga [Laughter] karma of the past life by good karma of the past life or for by god's grace bhagyan judisha if you have a good fortune good luck you have collected some subhash women's auspices by charitable activity by thinking of the good of others you have acquired some such good treasure good qualities of your life mind becomes selfless then pune no by that god's grace or holy man's grace or archer no and you need the grace of your teacher also your teacher's grace and your own karma of the past life or in this life if you are pursued with that then only this can be available this knowledge can be available so got a very beautiful idea first of all they say this knowledge is not available even people do bohus chardonnay with different types of spiritual practice lobbiam but it can be attained param that's supreme knowledge janmo sathyana so evo though practice for hundreds of life then it will not happen but by by god's grace bhagyam if you have the good fortune good luck judy said by because of suva you have accumulated super sancho sanchez accumulation you have accumulated some sugar auspiciousness you know and by auspiciousness and you have collected something noble by grace of your teacher that means by teachers grace necessary and the grace of the lord or your good karma three things are necessary your good karma god's grace guru's grace guru and that's why he said three things are necessary in spiritual growth your own grace of your mind is necessary mind should help us if the mind does not self even all this grace is there it will not function they say ramakrishna said guru krishna vaishnava tinir dwaya the three one is the guru the spiritual teacher krishna the lord himself his grace you got his grace you got your guru's grace guru krishna the devotees love you devotees also ask for your spiritual growth even you get all the grace but if you don't get the grace of your own mind then you are lost only more important is to get there how to get the grace of my own mind because it is sometimes placed trickery we do not know we think this is bad this is good but mind is deluding you don't believe that so easily go to your guru go to your bistro then pray to god for guidance is yeah good idea another added vedanta says you need four guests grace from poor guru kripa means the glace of your teachers spiritual teacher blessings faster the scripture you are reading reading this scripture people are going to kill somebody no how you read certain book and certain philosophy and then you see they are all wrong i'll have to correct them to go with the sword and chop them ahead people are doing is you know in the name of religion tell you they're reading sastra they're praying oh god oh allah whatever and how much blood state has happened in the name of religion they read the sastra but wrong interpretation interpretation is wrong who is doing that interpretation mind says sastra also rasta is like in hinduism we think that these scriptures are not books they are like mother graceful mother to guide us into the right direction when we read this it guides our mind no this is not the right thing this is the right thing because scriptures this is saying now this verse if you remember it's like mother mother telling the child baba don't do that my child don't do that that will not lead you to fully liberation and freedom by intellectual debate and this and that you have to do sadhana you have to do spiritual practice and their bug and you should correct some auspicious results of your karma good karma do perform good karma love people serve people so these are the indication it is like a mother no that's why you you have to get the grace reading this people mission interpret and they see all the time people are misinterpreting their own religion uh study studying the scriptures no so so this verse is very important then this you know the supreme truth is very hard to attain but it can be achieved only by lobbying param that supreme can be achieved only by extensive spiritual practice in hundreds of lifetimes that means you can practice continuously till you reach the goal some people can understand [Music] what is called arise awake and stop not till the goal is reached that means we are sleeping we are not conscious about the truth i say we'll have to get up awake then just be fully aware of the goal of life arise and now walk on go on moving don't stop anywhere until you reach the goal until you know that you are divine until you know that you are pure until you know that you are worthless deathless so that is the goal to be fixed and sadhana continue continue continue say sastra says how many days i'll have to some people take mantra and immediately they ask asha how many days it will take for god realization so how many days it will take who will say how many days it will take who can guarantee you it is you are together you have to give the guarantee to yourself if i say i am sitting here and i want to go to new york when how long it will take me to go to new york and i am sitting here i'm only talking about how long it will go it will it will take whole life to go to reach new york if you really only think that i will have to go to new york or even better example you want to go to san diego where how quickly i can reach there are you don't talk take your car and gps and then start and then don't think about san diego stop not drive drive drive drive whatever obstacle comes left lane right lane change the lane it is jam go the other way reach the goal till you reach the goal that is the vedanta says that we'll have to do that sitting idle and only oh san diego is good better san diego san francisco is much better this this scene is better that scene is better just go on sitting and chit-chatting like that you will neither go to san diego neither go to central san francisco so spiritual goal one fixed we have to practice and very seriously make an effort till we realize the truth it may take life and life and life what is there in it let us move on it may happen tomorrow also but it may take long time also who knows because you know the cloud comes in the sky no cloud can remain whole day whole day we say oh there is no skies the sun is today and it's very bothersome gloomy way there gloomy mind no but a blast of wind comes creeper grace boom and clears the sky is clear so that for that we have to make an effort our effort then god's grace blow the blast of wind will come but our effort is to be done ourselves so guru kipan atma kripa ishar kripa in god's grace my own grace means my mind's grace i should be kind to myself scripture anyhow no so let me finish this verse meaning the supreme truth is hard to attain it can be achieved only by extensive spiritual practice in 100 it may take hundreds of lifetimes that too is possible only if there is a good luck that barely comes from accumulated virtues and meritorious deeds of the past life and by the grace of the spiritual teacher so guru kripa sastra so this can be it can we can reach that goal if we are serious otherwise intellectual talk will not do that is the major point intellectual talk will not solve the problem now it's talking about vedanto but he says you know 25th place is very important i'll just touch we'll discuss the next day bhakti para aha this can be achieved also if you can renounce everything and you devote your mind wholeheartedly to me and echo it in one point in mind you focus on me that means mind does not go to anything but god so see that how much practice is necessary then mind will not go to anything but god it is too difficult for us but at least do it at the meditation time maybe whole day you cannot do your work is there your other interaction is there with people and things but when you sit for meditation try there's nothing now my me and my god i have no connection with the world i am and my my lord is in me so if that anyone can do and become one pointed love and sadhaith do spiritual practice by one pointed mind and do the practice puna pulao again and again karma is common and also do karma niskama karma selfless work not pretty loud why they do the karma only to please me not boss no other boss in our life in our workplace in our everywhere there is somebody tells me do this it is not i am not doing for anyone saying me but god is telling me to do or i am working for god only but i don't it does not matter who i am serving what i am serving but i am doing only to please god priti manos priti means british is the name of her no pretty man of the much what is pretty for his pleasure for the pleasure of the lord and then offer everything to me servam chittos then your mind will be purified see what is the vedanta book now harmony see how harmonious is the point swami vivekananda says they're talking about ghana assemble in your life take the two all the tools and move on okay we'll do this 25 bars again a little elaborately next day so we'll go to the question if there is any question he said om shanti shanti shanti harihum now some questions you also can question if you have any question you can ask a word of truth is considered an expert dancer who steps around or art even when it is a wrong step if we do it can ibraheen have actions like that of giris before he met takur or that of ravana brahma ghani because they have no as i said brahma ghani knowers of truth they are because they are childlike as i said childlike people have no no bondage at all a child triggers a gun i give the example no there is a gun loaded gun and child does not know he saw this in the floor mom and dad has written and he plays with it and triggers because of the triggering it hits maybe his mom or dad and died will anyone take that baby to jail no because he has no ego he does not know what he has done so the brahmaganis the knowers of truth are expert dancers they may appear to engage in all activities but internally they know they are separate externally their body may function the way it is but they are unaffected by those actions like a child is unaffected by its actions so they if you say that if a practicing that's right practice what we are reading today practice practice is important if you practice then mind will not go to the flimsy things because you have renounced them you know there is nothing in it after after getting one billion dollar suppose just an analysis brahmogano is a billion dollar project or all you got a receiving billion dollar so you got billion dollar will you then run for a penny worth thing in the world little fun of this sunset universe array you got the infinite joy why will you go for a penny little dot of joy understand my point it is a this question does not arise because if you say one is established in brahman brahma ghana so in that establishment he is absorbed in the infinite blissfulness such a bliss the scriptures have described it is infinite describing that in every pore of your body you will feel million times the joy the world can give it's each four how many pores are there in the body it will you can it will burst it will burst you cannot hold that joy so after getting that joy who is going to seek for one rasagulla ice cream joint or going for a um funny little tidbit joy it is meaningless billionaire does not care for one dollars one dollar loss or one dollar gain or will his mind go to collect one dollar anymore so that is the question compare that brahma ghana if we understand that's why they are they don't make a false step giddy's when he was totally transformed after coming to ramakrishna he became a brahmagani another question have you filled the presence of god can you tell us more about the experience you are so learned and give us so much knowledge without any that is your wrong idea so you know you what you are putting this question have you filled the presence of god anira ramakrishna is there who said yes i felt buddha rashankara all the direct disciples christ and krishna switzer eternal all have said yes i have experience i have experience and they're authorizing from ibrahimo says you do this you don't get slapped me on my face so so so many accounts are there then we can believe yes there is some presence not for me i cannot say anything so that is the point point is that yes god's presence can be felt in this life that has been testified by many many many many okay so another question since i started meditating regularly one and half years ago life is going so well i wonder if good things will stop happening if i stop meditating [Laughter] don't don't bring meditation thinking that if i stop meditation good things will stop or bad thing may not come no that is don't bring that idea and no the body goes because of his past karma we pass to different good bad experiences life takes us through so many experiences but meditation helps us to settle meditation helps us to separate out with the incident with the happening being very much agitated excited those things can stop that is the benefit of meditation but meditation does not stop our suffering suppose i have a headache the headache will be headache take some aspirin and then start meditation but if without aspirin if the head is really bothering you you cannot meditate so meditation is for purifying the mind meditation is for connecting us with the divine within so that focus is totally different and good it may bring good also but it may also sometimes don't bring desired effect but that does not don't blame meditation for that meditation is for your mental uplift and this obstacles in life comes because of the social context because of your health issues because of the circumstances in which you are in your office in your workplace or something so this are but it's good i'm happy to know that by god's grace your meditation is really helping you to do that but if something otherwise even i feel i will happen to a judge no it has nothing to connect with our meditation meditation is always a power which makes us sensible people and we can withstand this knocks and blows up life more strongly because we know these all the things will come and go it is my mind getting affected suffers more if you can ignore certain things meditation helps you to withdraw the mind to from the objects of suffering to god which is object of love so that idea we should keep another question would you please repeat what are the four things needed to reach spiritual goal oh we talked about what viveka bohirago like kripa is the grace of his share of the lord guru kripa the grace of guru grace of the scriptures and grace of what self my own self i should show my grace to my spiritual life no i should cooperate with my meditation i should tell my mind hey don't escape come now sit for meditation so mind own mind first is important guru kripa the grace of guru ishara kripa the grace of god and the scripture scripture should be kind scripture like a living living entity not like a book as we think book is a book but when you read the book you get some idea no and that is very powerful therefore it is called the grace is necessary to have a right understanding of the scriptures and also i told about the four other things i told what uh fourteen viveka bhairava saw some some of them etc six stages and discrimination analysis discernment that which you understand the not good or contrary to spiritual growth give up that go then acquire some good character building your own character strong foundation of character and your idea of liberation i will get i shall be free from all bondage that resolution the desire to be liberated these are another four okay all are done all undone any questions yes our very concept of ascribing enlightenment to another person's body mind complex isn't that paradoxical and what is that again so when we talk about another person's enlightenment we refer to their body mind conflicts but the enlightenment is not open about it mm-hmm enlightenment is beyond body mind but enlightenment if you have it expresses to your body and mind that's the point if you get honey you taste honey your face will indicate something and if you are given a bitter bitter melon and you chew it your face will give a little bit different appearance so this is when you reach ananda self enlightenment bliss and you are aware of your divine consciousness that will just beam a beaming expression will come a ramakrishna has a photograph when his hand is up the face is beaming with joy when he has been bursting into laughter as it were but he is not in the body consciousness but the through the body that joy as if getting expressed some people that joy comes as a horribilization all over the body you can feel that goose bump all over the body that come because this is a tremendous experience so it though it is beyond but as if it manifests sometimes little bit to the body and mind but it is not the absolute absolutely what is happening inside this body cannot have any clue of it our mind cannot have any clue of it because it is beyond mind mind and body true tomorrow yeah tomorrow will be our gospel class in the evening 7 30 so we'll meet you again and mother bless us all thank you to see you again tomorrow shanti shanti shanti peace peace you
