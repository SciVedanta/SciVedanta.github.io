[14. Shanti Gita - Class 14 - Chapter 1, Verse 42 - 46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84OeOfP3srQ)

[Music] ya lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from ignorance to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all last month last class we are sorry that there was some problem so the recording was not done properly and many of you came and missed a discussion we are sorry for that it was some problem in the youtube but anyhow that's why i am repeating though it is there in the you available recorded but not maybe full so i am just studying the same verses today repeating that what we read last time verses so it will be the vedanta is always reputation is not bad other our upon our brahma sutra says what is the way of unlearning the knowledge or wisdom of it means repetition asakrit means not once again and again the the repetition again and again of upodesa that was the instruction given by the upanishads given by this sadhus holy people that helps us to build up our understanding so though it is repetition for some people some of you but it will not be anything wrong because we vedanto talks about the same reality again and again i think it will re-establish the thoughts which we are having now the context was this we are we will be reading today from verse number 41 we read 42 from 42 hertz which is read the other day also but it was not transmitted perfectly so what we are discussing here how we identify ourselves with the body and mind and not identify without divine nature that's due to ignorance as we know but that is our normal life we always identify myself as body so you are you are you are you are suffering over you know you are suffering you are in believement you are in pain but for what where is the pain where is the bereavement in your body no your son has passed away your body you are strong enough something has happened in your mind so something has happened in your mind and you are thinking i am affected you are not affected say your mind is affected only make this distinction so in the verse number 36 you have read it already where it is the shri krishna said to arjuna your mind is getting vedi in the believe bent and pain that chamanos your mind is getting burning sensation as it were because of the believement of your son now you know mighty armored you know you can observe how your mind is getting attached you are drastasi you are the witness of your mind you know you are not the mana you are not the mind so this is the ground which is to be hammered and whole life struggle is to hammer on this idea that i'm not the body not the mind how many times we read it how many times we chant it but it does not enter as you have read in the yugobas history there are some type of buddhi or intellect intellect is sometimes stone-like stone-like means not that in the inside brain there is a stone not that but stone you want to put a nail into that yeah and what happens nearly not penetrated into it it is a stone jar buddhist so our buddhist sometimes jada not receptive to these higher ideas how many times we see how many times are you here but now i get out and someone looks at me at the frowning face right but my joy will go away huh he did with me how can he do are you he has done what he did he did his gesture in the face you have observed that you are the witness you are not that mind you are not that so try to analyze try to analyze and separate out separator this is the vedanta idea of negation so that was the verse number 36 and 37 always says that drastic drastica is witness and this show the object we see they're always pitch they are separate i see the table i am not the table i am the witness of something which is called table so these are separate drastic no i'm nothing else you are biloxi and you are separate from that but how do you make this mistake i am reading 37 bars how do you say abhi kaat manu you cannot analyze you cannot discriminate you cannot separate out right and wrong you have no discernment of eb mano and now you are thinking you are thinking my mind is burning i am burning i am weak i cannot raise my head this pirate meant i cannot bear it anymore huh i cannot eat anymore i cannot get out of my bed anymore have you seen the patients who become mentally very much depressed for some reason and that time physically they are strong nothing has happened to the physical body but mental body has become weak and with that association the person is thinking i am weak i cannot do anything i have seen such person two coming down from that step to this step that person is sitting and holding the floor and moving and then one step down another step down another step down like a baby's but he's fully powerful so this is your association why this association because you are not you are not a discerning person you cannot analyze that you are separate you are the conscious entity these are all happening in the mind and mind is really is wounded her mind is really it gets his hit but not me i am observing my mind so be always dressed up and this you're happening in your mind mind means what mind is called 38 39 it is called antakaranam mind is the inner organ instrument inner instrument what is the inner these are the eyes are the external instrument ears this is external instrument nose hand feet these are external what is the internal behind you don't see you cannot catch mind can you catch mine by hand no but you can watch your mind when you are meditating you can see how mind is running here and there so antakaranam akam then mind is only one absolutely you can say but technically you can call chitta because you are reading a text very philosophical text you have to say mind is not mine my mind is chitta and it has four functions but the same mind functions in different roles and get the name what is the name one is called mind mind means which indeterminate it cannot decide it is vacillating like our everyday affair shall i go to the class or no shall i eat now or no salai i shall be sadhu or not i shall be a brahmacari or not or i shall be whatever so any any thought you are swinging what shall i do what shall i do this is the function of the mind after long deliberation when mind decides no no no i'll go i thought i've thought enough i was thinking whether i shall go or not now i know i shall go no that is the faculty of the mind which is called buddhi intellect and now which is another factor memory i see you i know that you are dire how do i know my mind just took this picture and went inside quickly like google search in me and found all types of photographs there all there and now actually google is doing the same principle what is god has created here in the mind and he collects all the past memories and matches and says oh this is the name this reform she's done so this is called the remembering faculty but that's also mine and another is honkara i i know i don't know so i i that is also another aspect same mind acts as ego so antakaranam it has four types of actions activities british ripples and that is called mana which the sun called buddhi determinative so which researching searching something finding google engine that brings out the past memory into awareness matches that is called the and how they are born all these are grow growing how how in us it grows child's mind is one type adult mind is one type old mind is another type but they are growing pancho bhutan bhutan it is gathering its energy from the five elements five what are the five elements yeah then the earth that means rice dull whatever grows in the earth art water fire air and space from all these things a subtle mind gathers all these things and functions in this way and that also manifests in the physical body so got it these are very technical thing don't think that you know i am reading for so many years i i i'll get confused so this is the not one time two time i'm doing it last 50 years more than 50 60 years now but still i don't know he'd get confused because that is the player maya so don't think of my mind your mind is nothing it's a gross thing it has gone out of your food you the food you take that that essence essential subtle part makes the mind grow sparse makes the physical body we say oh i'm eating too much i've put some weight meaning the food we take it has two part one the physical part physical may adds this the body to the flesh bone marrow etc etc all the things in the physical level and this subtle part makes your mind makes your intelligence makes your memory makes your ego that's why it is said when you eat food what we do we offer to god why we do offer thinking it will be purified when you think that means you're thinking i'm taking pure food your mind is thinking pure food so your pure mind is prepared that's why in india there are so many so much of too much fuss about impure pure food touch impure pure touch and there are many people who do that that has some some necessity because any person who touched the food its vibration goes to that is it not any person suppose you are a devotee you are taking the name of the lord and you are preparing the meal that vibration pure vibration you are thinking and you radiate that to your touch your it is going to the food and all the items you prepare that's why it is said listen to some beautiful song or chant the name of the lord and prepare the meal that will be pure in food and pure food will mean prepare your pure mind very formula when you take food aharo pure food that's why we always say take prasad don't see some food and grab into the mouth before you say no no oh lord please make it pure and you take mentally you do that but hello your mind is lifted to god consciousness and with that type of transference that food is becoming purer food called sattika food that's why those people who are very bad character or very violent and things that that touch will come into the food ramakrishna could not touch and take food from everyone not that he was very reactionary to they are bad people i don't take their food not that their mind level of the mind is so mundane and so worldly or so low ramakrishna could not touch that if it touches he will feel some pain if he eats stomach will go out so this is the satika food is created so where that is the point that the inner organ does all this thing and it is made of the five elements aahara should be so when when someone does that this is for our good knowledge we are reading vedanta but vedanta is a practical side of it when you prepare food for any time in your home or in your or our center wherever if you can think that i am doing for god and repeat the mantra and think some sing some song or chant some mantra and do that that will carry holy vibration and that vibration that food when it is offered to god god also accept that god cannot eat other food give by given by somebody who has no mind and who is evil minded why because it is not out of any rejection but suppose something you you cannot digest it's a question of digestion saktika food can be digested thomas food cannot be some people you say i don't i can't digest your cauliflower i can why cauliflower is a thing to eat why not oh beans don't shoot with me why they are bad beans are bad no your system does not take similarly spiritual people with sattika mind they cannot take all these things anyhow so gross part of the food makes your gross body subtle part which is your mind pure mind prayerful mind when they to do prepare even you are not prayerful but you are a holy man you are touching and you are doing something that becomes holy so this is the aahara sudhi then satiko should diminish your buddhi buddhi will be pure god or intelligence mind is like one pointed this ways you are cleaning thing properly you are watching so you are making it healthy it is like uh if you are not attentive then some dart or something can come and unhealthy food is prepared so it even if it is not with devotion if you are still with one pointedly doing secularly really keep the same result secondly you can get a good nice food that's all you go to the good restaurant what they do how they prepare god knows but when a plate put into the tray beautiful all clean angry just hot from the um that cutleries are hot the plate is so just warm and beautiful design and that will make you something you know who prepares that is sakthika but we need not have to judge that much because we are not like ramakrishna so sensitive to pure food but for our purpose we should have to think that the same my food can be made pure that's why we purify just before the plate we take we pray and we think that god has glanced over it so it has become pure you know that story when if you offer a food does god eat anything no you give eight drops of good love eight rasagulla comes back does god take one no have anyone any experience that you have given some in the lunch for takur and you have sent some six mangoes pieces and it comes back five pieces no what you eat then deva gods don't eat like we ah munch justwater punti they put their kind glance on the food like looking that because that is subtle by that the food becomes dressed or purified so pure food is of course if you do it dust free and doubt-free things no that's good for health that will do the healthy part but to make the mind pure it should be god's name pure person doing pure thinking at least forget about what others do we can think of god and do our cooking and serving all these things can be done then it makes a pure mind so therefore bhikhari yeah therefore they are all made of the five elements and the subtle part makes the mind therefore this body and mind are all created it is not the uncreate thing unkit is god unclear is brahman on create i think is this sachidan on the atman but these are all created anyhow and now 40th we read also that that as your ongo means one part of your body is burned by agni the fire janati purusho jata there you think that oh my finger is burned but i say i am burned so this identification is coming therefore it is mistake of the mind to understand this so therefore as 41 says as one things that i am burned where in reality his hand is only burned similarly due to lack of discernment you are also thinking i am squashed by grief while your mind is only gripstricken so that is the 41 verse i have given synopsis for 15-20 minutes now now let us go to the reading again what we have read the other day so i don't think that you are bored about hearing the same thing second time it is always repetition is good for reminding ourselves now the 42nd verse we have read though i'm reading again today that jagrati sushupto that which is born at the waking state again that gets dissolved at the time of deep sleep you are that witness consciousness observing them and not the mind which is the abode of affliction that which is born at the waking state suppose you are sleeping what happens think when you are in deep sleep you have no concept of this world you have no concept of your room you have no concept of your bed you have no concept of anything any person anything because you are sleeping so as you wake up jagati as soon as you wake up jaya manam then everything was not there it appears similarly when i am awake and now i am going to sleep what will happen all this my concept about this world will get dissolved where why does it vanish where does it go my con awareness about this world about my all activities about my all thinking what we did whole day as if it disappears what does it go it goes into your state of deep sleep it goes mind it goes into the root of mind so it dissolves at the time of deep sleep so that which is born at the waking state again that which gets dissolved at the time up and that is what in your own consciousness that is the witness consciousness witness consensus i am seeing you with witness consensus says i am sleeping witness consciousness say i am dreaming so witness consciousness everything dissolves in it comes out of it understand that the whole universe is coming out of brahman you know we we here in other areas of deposition everything comes out of brahman and dissolves into brahman so now you just think about yourself what is happening every day when you are now after whole day when you go to sleep what does it go what does it dissolve does it vanish altogether no it comes back again but where it rests it rests in the witness consciousness who is observer and then again pops up from where from the same witness consciousness so that's the point that is called witness consciousness who is observing all this coming and going dissolving everything and not the mind mind is a part of that observer observed observed substance observer is the witness consciousness absorbed is the body is the mind is the emotion the ego is the intellect so it comes from the observer witness consciousness everything comes out and again it dissolves it is i give the gross example like you restructure there is a spring you when you release the spring it is only point one millimeter or one millimeter thin layer of some spring rolling spring it is called you are sleeping you are totally gone not gone but everything is wheeled down in the deep sleep condition now you spring you pull the spring and stretch it stretch it so when it stretches this part then what happens this is called the waking state everything is real so much and so sleep will be the dream dream state will be like little bit of the gross is gone subtle portion remains that's why we dream in the dream world but all these are coming out of the witness consciousness this is a great idea to think that there is i am the witness consciousness which is not going anywhere not coming from anywhere it is not ending anywhere it is not dead it is not created it is always their witness consciousness waking state is coming into it coming out of it dream state coming out of it sleep also is in it so it is all this coming and going in the level which is the observed world and that is i am the witness consciousness so that was the verse number 32. 43 says [Music] i have done this all this you can read the book or you can have it in your computer i've spread out the words so that you can chant with me please go to the book and then you can join means at the in the time of deep sleep mana see line when mind gets totally dissolved no there is no shoka shoka means believe men you have no anguish no pain is it not when when we go to sleep all our anxieties worries all our tension everything vanish is it not why does it vanish because it is working in the mind and mind is now going to sleep so i have no feeling about that that's why monashi monaste mana celine when it it emerged into the mind susuti at the time of deep sleep is dissolved and that time no soko there is not a trace of bereavement or pain or anguish no unumar gunu means little bit not even a little trace of that suffering or pain is there jagrati at the time of when in waking state we wake up again sorrow and afflictions each it exists in the mind again so as a miracle going on this world is so real and we cry and weep and everything but whenever we go to sleep all these things stop for that particular time when you wake up again mind becomes awake and with mind all this paraphernalia comes its joys its suffering its pain its anxieties everything comes so this is happening when the mind is dissolved in deep sleep there is no trace of grief at all in the waking state when the mind is aroused again this sorrow grief etc also it pops up is it not every day it is happening this is really it is called the magician's magic every day it is happening for all of us that's why doctors give some sleeping pill who are in extreme pain even feeling the pain of the body what they do doctor what they do they put their mind to sleep very simple formula practicing vedanta by medicine but yogis and vedanta student will do that by consciously thinking i am not the mind is it possible yeah let us see we go to sami turiyan he did it it's back surgery seven what you call carbuncle in the back big carbuncle and doctors need to do in those days to put chloroform or something to unconscious mecca and then they will do the operation but marine maharaja said okay no don't you need don't need to do that you just just do only come and tell me when you want to do right and here doctors came with surgery surgical instrument and everything and and they did quite a long time operated upon the carbuncle and after some hours done and swami also came back and said are you done hari how can you do that he did it because he has the power over the mind mind was disconnected so whatever happening in the body nothing it matters nothing so this is the point that it can be yogis can do one way and ordinary people can do another way medical science can do it another way to be numb the mind to make the mind numb so then you will not feel what is going on all the severe pain in the body we take pain medications what is that the mind is getting all these time instructions oh it is pain it is pain it is when you disconnect someone by eternal all all whatever so many pain medication is there now sarmang passes 44 bars he's trying to give the solution again and again the same solution you are observing the pain my my toe is in pain my back is in pain my neck is my pain you are saying my pain in my neck so you are a sakshi you are a witness you think you are saying so it is nothing to bring any philosophy you are the succeed you are the witness succeed you will be meant your anxieties worries pain anguish caught on wherefrom it come how can it be you are always the observer observer nothing get touched it is happening in the observed world made of mind and all the senses but we are feeling that pinning yourself to where feeling is in your mind feeling comes in your mind if someone where goes the feeling when the doctors do the surgery for hours i hear some orthopedic surgeons they do 24 hours surgery big surgeries continuously goes on and on what happens such a big thing is going on and why the feeling feeling is not there because mind is not there feeling happens in the mind you analyze vedanti is so true you cannot you cannot deny it it's very rational either it is happening in the body or in your mind or in your emotions or even your ego oh how he belittled me today how can he do that ari he cannot do you you have done your ego so where are you getting identified let the rascal ego go i also want my ego to go so then i remember my divine ego so this is the way that's why even devotees they undergo so much of torture and tension but they take it smilingly because it is it is good that they're telling my my my ego is bad okay good i myself say my ego is bad i want to get out my small ego i want to be in my big ego people will say how you are so doormat like no your ego is all anyone can trample arya which ego my big ego is there any power in the world who can touch my big ego sun moon stars galaxies are all under the control of that witness consciousness i am that ego but this puny tiny i want to get out of it as a vedanta student as a doctor as a factor i want to get out as a ghani i want to expand my ego to the that kind ego not this petty ego can anyone criticize me my great ego they will criticize my small ego so why shall i not appreciate that guy hahaha he is my friend today today buddha which is buddhist day tonight almost we can say tomorrow is the buddha huh so buddha's day so buddha what somebody came and just abused him right and left for a long time and buddha said like that and afterwards said when the other guy got exhausted saying so many bad things then buddha silently said you are done yes suppose you bring you are bringing a gift to your friend and you give it but that friend does not take it so what does it go back so i have not taken anything what you said so it goes back to you so my big ego when you stand in our big ego no one can harm that people sometimes think it is a foolishness it is yes in ordinary level it is foolishness in spiritual life it is a boon someone is smashing my ego that's why in this ramakrishna order it is said don't be a monk because they'll crush your ego it is called ego crushing machine rama krishna mishon is called the ravaged machine and propagation machine is ego crushing machine all the angularities oh you did this you did that you did it you do polish it and you become perfect so free from ego so that is the ultimate goal that's why they someone criticizes they feel joy he is my friend i myself hate my ego so he is telling something good his help helping me to remember that i am not the mind this mind that ignorant mind anyway that's why you are witnessing where you are the witness of everything you see tell me where is your bereavement believement is only happening in your mental sith that generates suffering anxiety fear suffering anxiety fear and the similar sustain 45 45 bar says swarupa [Music] why are you feeling this pain anguish bereavement because [Music] what is your real nature what are you really you are wrongly thinking this is really you this is not you neither it's mind neither it's intellect neither is knowledge you are a knowledgeable person no you are not you are not knowledgeable you are the knowledge itself so always think that way to me you are not knowing that it is there but you are not aware being unaware of your sarupa your essential nature the mind is dissolved in this sleep there is no research sarupa you are witness of everything you see oh 45 we are reading no sorry 45 says due to lack of knowledge of your real self you are not aware of your own divine self sarupo your own essential nature you can say also essential nature because of the lack of knowledge of your essential nature it's in real self you know you have identified not only you have forgotten your own self but you have identified with something else first you have forgotten your own nature and then you have identified with another thing which you are not true you have forgotten it is the rope but you have attached yourself to the snake idea so though you are touching the rope you are crying snakes neck snake and jump and loud howled similarly you are standing on brahman the atman sarupa not knowing that you are seeing the terrible thing as fear anxiety worries loss gain etc is dangerous but that is dangerous to the body dangers to the mind not to the soul that's the same thing same formula coronavirus is killing the body stopping the heartbeat yes it is physical working in the physical and it is in the made of five elements acting with the five elements but the atman i am a witness corolla corona has attacked me i am attacked by corona i mean is your body so your body will suffer for that but by the atman what will happen to that nothing has happened it is an observer witness so think this way even in the turmoil of all difficulties vedanta can make one strong to think difficulty real thinking just thinking which is true it does not we don't charge money this book does not charge money anyone but no one reads this book but people spend so much money to get other advice what to do in corona yeah that's true but we pay money we go and spend our time and energy but not here so here is the question due to lack of the knowledge of yourself false identification of the mind with the self and due to lack of proper discernment and you have superimposition of the characteristics of the mind on the self characteristic of the mind on the self and self is forgotten who am i have forgotten and i am thinking i am a beggar many people do that no when their brain goes out they think like so forgetting their own status and whatever mind is teaching them to think think that way and act that way 46 therefore one can cross the ocean of bereavement who who is the noah brahman the noah of atman who i am if one knows this upanishad says rishis to say they say that that person can cross the ocean of sqweep overcomes all grip therefore what will be your task now project nato make much effort make extreme effort for what bidwan atmanam atmanam know thyself know who you are please know who you are essential nature so this is the conclusion of the chapter shanti gita the first chapter ends so the essential meaning is that what we have learned in the entire chapter is this it has happened whatever is happening in the body and mind don't identify yourself that you are getting that brunt of that it is on your mind it is happening mind happening but you are foolishly thinking it is happening in with you and if that you can give up and search for who you are in reality then all your believement and suffering will end no one can give you peace unless you practice your own this practice of identification these identifying practice that you are not this body neither its pain and suffering but you are atman think and whatever is happening pause a moment and think where it is happening is it happening in my body or is it happening in my mind or my understanding people fight each religion fights with other why intellectually those who are do have reached the realization they don't fight they know it is one but those people who have no knowledge intellectually they fight they say my religion is true your religion is not and they go on fighting in first intellectual fight it comes to the physical level sword with the fine with the sword and gone all this no all intellectual in the mind people create this distinction white this white supremacy people talk about that this cast distinction people talk about that it's all in the mind level so mind think that he is he is another color person is a different person i am the right person and that is not the right so everything is happening in this level so if one understands the purpose of life is to get the inner peace how by knowing thyself know thyself know thyself and and take out the misconception and misconception will go away when we hold on to that truth and truth is that i am atman and we also learn from utman everything comes out it stays there and it goes back again every day it is happening waking dream sleep waking again waking again dream against sleep this rotation but where it is happening on the earth and witness witness is behind he's standing all the time watching all this going and coming okay so we end here and if you have any question then we'll go for five minutes om shanti shanti now you will find next time we'll need to start with second chapter and you will find that second chapter on your computer it has been posted already any questions this ego has too much attachment to the feeling it is not allowing me to be sexy yes you are correct that's why we are to purify our ego this ego this ego which i have now this is too much attachments because it is okay industry read last month this attachment is coming into the because the ignorance and forgetting that i am witness not identifying with the witness but with identifying with the objects which i am seeing so this is the mistake that's why we are suffering so much how to get out of this attachment again and again we have to understand it is not me i am not my shot i am not my house as we say i am not my body i am more than that i am not my mind i am more than that i am the observer of the mind so attachment will go away by this process every time reminding the mind which is in ignorance have got attachment the same mind will help us to detach some will be began on this beautiful world he said de-hypnotizing we are hypnotized really we are passing a life of hypnotist life so hypnotized how much people talk how much holy people give us blessings how much they teach us my mind round about way goes back goes back to the same ignorant state but if we work on that sincerely this is a wrong association a bad association you know we we used to save that proverb a man is or a man is known by the association he keeps is it not a person is known with which type of friend he has so if he has a good friend intellectual level oh then it's intellectual circle if his friend is a rabbis friend so he become rubbish if his friend is a very spiritual person and you have good friendship means you you are also spiritual you are seeing that so we are association wrong association and that association of the body with the mind has been sown thousands and thousands of times we have identified with body that's why we have become like body rama you are being born again and again and again and again and what you have born with the body look at the animals look at this minor microbes even trying to be alive some something dangerous coming death running away from death no so we have been attached to keep this body you watch a my very small tiny ant is also walking you stop it it's a spider in the corner you just see how it gets started go there even the silver fish did you see that if you watch their behavior all trying to save their life i'll die so you should be going this way going that way so and we have we were like that we are silver fish we are cats we are dogs dogs we have amiba we are vibrating so we have gone through this all this experience and what we have learned attachment for the body to keep alive to keep alive that's why anything no one wants to die that is that's why rama or rama but sister dev advised rama o rama and hundreds and hundreds of baths you have practiced this janmajanma yes therefore you are remaining in the world and thinking it is true now meena obaso yogina you have to practice now no i am not i am separate from it with this serious thinking he will attend to your goal okay with worldly people is it necessary to need holy company yeah you are correct is a deeper subject at least we start srabana srabana means read yourself and and think yourself deep thinking is manana repetitive thinking serious thinking we'll have to do and nidhi dhasana means deeper so savannah mananananani doesn't know these are the three ways vedanta teaches how to get out of this ignorance so we'll have to practice that yes true where will you get such friend who will discuss with you the spiritual issues so it is difficult but uh we'll have to try our best and pray to god to give some holy company in the holy company by his grace it will happen so i think no more questions so thank you all and we'll tomorrow will be gospel class but shiva pranav mataji will be giving the class at 7 30 p.m oh sorry sorry tomorrow is not a night tomorrow is the buddha's birthday
