[15. Shanti Gita - Class 15 - Chapter 2 , Verse 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nto8xZmf5KY)

[Music] [Music] lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and never more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face om peace peace peace be unto us all welcome to the shanti gita the song of peace so we have finished chapter 1 last time so today we will start chapter 2 verse 1. now and the last verse of the first chapter bhagavan sri krishna advised arjuna in the verse number 46 the last verse that shokan tarati chat magga atmaga those who are the noirs of the truth knows of the self they show kang tarati they overcome grief any type of grief they are overcome because that cannot touch them and sutibakyong ministry no this is not i am saying our scripture supanishats are also declaring that ataha now you are a wise person and you are grip stricken you want to go go over cross over the sufferings of grief and believe men therefore ataha therefore project notorious try your best make your best effort best effort to know your own self self knowledge that is only cured there is no other medicine to cure this disease of believement and suffering and pleasure and pain this duality in which we roam around there is no other solution to get out of it only one is this that it will be atma gyana knowing the self then we'll cross because no not knowing the self we are misidentifying ourselves with my body my mind which is not me as is not my house as not my car so as my body my mind but i have wrongly identified so you want to because of that identification i am feeling i am lost i i'm losing something i'm gaining something all these are your mental creation therefore don't roam around into this thought know yourself day and night the best possible way you can just emphasize totally your whole purpose of life to knowing the self if you know the self leave wherever you like it matters little you will not be grip sticking now that is the background and now the second chapter arjuna now says arjuna said [Music] he [Music] [Music] we are born in the judo clan so you tell me oh krishna no krishna you are the son of yodhu jaada was milk or what you call milk uh cows whether they're major thing and they're a territory of huge cows so that's the king of years so tata bruhi then tell me that one what what you are asking monobuddhindia atma or jawatma that atma that self which is nahi gochara is not within the realm of perception of what mano mind cannot grasp it mind cannot catch it buddhi how much your intelligence you apply it is infinite your buddhi cannot catch it in your senses of course eyes cannot see ears cannot hear our smell touch test they are insufficient just so that atma caught on how can i get it you are giving an absurd proposition proposition is that which is capable of grasping through my senses i can see that i not physically i cannot okay i can my mind i can mentally think this is this is this mind cannot fathom the infinite brahman atman in the buddhi analyze analyze analyze analyze not this not this but it is a intellectual understanding how they intellect neither the mind nor the buddhi not the india it is not it cannot anything in these tools are not sufficient strong to catch the glimpse of the atman then shaka tanglapati then how can it be realized how can it be understood because dupunishad says that what chatting declares neither by the eyes eyes cannot see the atman back by the speech you cannot express it that means eyes ears and all other sense organs through which we interact in the world we perceive things we experience things but these tools are insufficient there it is not working there huh if you want to measure the distance of this here to say the nearest galaxy will you take a foot scale take one foot scale and try to measure the distance impossible law it's not you have to take the scale of what light year speed of light so these are the ear sticks there that you can compare something but these are my tools through which i perceive the world and that's why i know myself like this but how can then you say that which is not to be grit-chatting cannot be accepted by the eyes not by the bacha now they were unknown means gods but here god's means those sense organs which reveal the truth touch i can understand something by touch smell i can understand something so these are all the five senses they are called the that by that not aposa i have heard indoor upanishad says the tapos are by austerity you cannot realize god rahuli mother also said hey god cannot be a god is not a commodity that you can get it by doing japan doing tapasha it is no so by tapas upanishad is saying by tapasa you do austerity for years and years and years but you cannot get that tapusa karmana but any karma you do by no karma you can do therefore how can it be understood i am incapable i have no other tool so please tell me please teach me so that is the verse where it starts sri bhagava anubhav now shri krishna in response to this great question which is the question of all of us that how can we realize that god who is infinite who is beyond time space is beyond the cane of my senses of eyes ears etc how can i then see that how can i feel that how can i experience that it is impossible here comes the question your eyes will not be sufficient to do that you know then you have to analyze who is the seer go to that so srifagawan means krishna says atma otishma [Music] atma [Music] yes atma is not like your table chair the air water fire it is not like that oti is so small it is not only fine subtle very subtle because of his nature is extremely subtle that's why it is buddhi aadinam your buddhi intellect your mind you are talking about your senses you are talking about ago it cannot fathom that this being fine see to to see fine thing you need finer instrument to see gross thing you need gross instrument so you are seeing the gross universe of name and form as is maya is producing this so your eyes are designed to see the gross only but how can we expect to see through these eyes what is to be seen through telescope to microscope you cannot do that you need another tool what is that tool there's a pure mind you have a mind that mind gives you the concept of this what you see the physical universe but to see that you have to finer mind subtler mind purer mind purer understanding purer intellect and then taku said ramakrishna said if your mind is pure then your buddhi is pure and then your senses will be also pure then then you will have a premier sorry you will generate a divine body love body this body is a gross but it in it there we created a divine body and to that there will be divine eye to that eye you can see ramakrishna's body apparently the outer body but when he has the vision and things he is not working through the body he enters into the subtle body finer body finer eyes that's why he sees he's talking to mother mom will you not eat ma rakhal is saying like that oh noreen is telling that all my vision is all all confusion and mother says no no no so how what is that talk is it gross some of you i am talking you are hearing if ramakrishna was talking like that we see hear that he is talking like that one sided talk like a telephone call you are hearing the receiver side he what he is talking you know what the other person is talking you don't know so but ramadan is connecting both ways so it needs subtle eye subtle mind subtle body to have visions and then another purer mind where mind will be no mind then you will understand what is atman stages no so this says atma atma being extremely subtle buddhi naam agocharo it is not within the realm or perception of buddhi mind intellect mind intellect senses it is not lobite how do you get it these are the tools what how do i get it vedavaki now listen to the vedavaca what is the veda the words of the vedas what is the vedas words you have to trust on that i am that how i am that then you analyze what is that that process will come and also don't you think that you only read the book and you will get but by the grace of your teacher guru because in early days the all this knowledge was with the gurus and they have realized people and they transferred that knowledge to their disciple so why he will transfer you unless you are obedient to him or unless he feels he's a right student so to the right student he gives the knowledge so that's why by acharya growth so it says o krishna son of judo dynasty kindly tell me how the self who is not within the realm of the mind intellect and sense organs can be experienced that was the question now bhagavan says due to its extremely subtle nature the atman is not perceptible to the intellect etc mind and sense etc it can surely be realized how through the dictums of the vedas and the grace of the teacher that guru very simple formula that means vedanta's hearthone is very simple day and night you analyze me i am that i am that i am that swamiji talked about there is a sadhu who used to practice vedanta what is that he used to say so aham oh i am that shaham so hum and he got successful how when one day a tiger was caught his neck that sadhu and going to eat him that the sadhu is telling in the jaws of the death so ham so ham show ham so it is established in that knowledge but we have heard that if you are really established in that level even the ferocious animal come to you they become quite calm they forget about the killing kind of thing maybe maybe maybe sound all do not do that said ramakrishna is such an exalted spiritual giant many calcutta babus came and they could not sit there for two minutes they went out and to get fresh air so wrong is powerless then you should have certain among animals there is a quality of animals if they're they're among them there is tamaso they are rajya so they are saturn have some element with you otherwise how can it occur so srivagawan says atman is very subtle extremely subtle the utmon is not perceptible to the intellect mind it can surely be realized but you don't think that it cannot be realized is not defined it can be but how through the dictums of vedas and the grace of the teacher mind intellect and the sense organs you have to see that atma is subtle that's why it is beyond the perception of these small tools to measure [Music] mind intellect senses are all objects who sees that is the sakshi shakshi means witness witness consciousness so you observe no i say i saw the chair somebody other than my eyes in me this is an instrument but somebody in me is there say i saw the chair so they go to the witness somebody is you do not know who is that but start there eyes are seeing but the object is seen there is a subject who is who is the witnesser and that is the witness consciousness that is our real self and the witness and noir of everything that means there is in me someone who is the witness and knower of everything he knows only anything comes in the physical level my eyes ears whatever message they bring it there is somebody in me as a witness or unknown and he also reveals that the inner witness is such it is not dull or dark no it's self-luminous that's why whatever message comes from that side it illuminates suppose there is something in this room any someone brings one basket full of flowers yes that is an object brought into the house but he who sees needs a light it is a separate light and i am something in our physical world but in in the spiritual world there is a witness and he is luminous he is that's why you meditate in the heart god the luminous god god is effulgent god therefore but this objects cannot illumine me but the luminosity is inside me which is witness consciousness it has the power it has the light and that is reflected outside that's why atman is self-luminous it is of the knowledge the nature of awareness whatever you know even don't know you say i do not know that's also needed to put a light you say oh do you see somebody came in this way and oh i don't know i don't know i know both case there should be somebody who is conscious entity if there is no consciousness you cannot say i do not know that's why the a good argument is this when you go to deep sleep you say oh i was fast asleep i do not know anything when you called or when the rain came or whether little shaking earthquake happened i didn't know anything that means you say i do not know anything meaning you know that you do not know do not know becomes a subject and you become object and you become the subject this very important point not that whatever we see feel that is only lighted by the witness consciousness what i do not know that is also lighted by the witness consciousness therefore because it is not the objects of created by intellect and ego etc therefore you cannot know through those tools it is because utman is not covered by anything and atman is the self so no one can cover the atman so everything is the worst one witness be the witness of this object subject object subject object subject and go on analyzing like this then you will reach someone that is the mohawk the great dictum veda the vedas declare vedas declare this thing and how vedas declares entire vedas so many words but your guru will then help you teach you how you will analyze this vedantic truth that's why teacher is necessary ramakrishna said in the scripture there are mixture salt and sugar both are mixed together salt has right sand sand and sugar sand you can easily separate out if you put water and the sugar melts by the sand not then you can separate out therefore what what is the essence the what is the sugar part of the scripture that is this analysis that you are the witness analyze everything is subject object subject object subject object then you are the eternal subject go go go analyze like that until go to certain point where you cannot go further and that is the atman so that was the first advice simple advice that you take a go to a charger your teacher find a teacher and veda bhakko you have to believe that's why you are to every every spiritual organization or institution have said our guru our teacher is this ramakrishna christianity christ bible that is the bed of akko whatever he said muslims will say quran whatever is said there that's the final word of god so you cannot do anything change anything so veda but ramakrishna said in the veda bhakta there will be many things which is not for you what is congenial for you your teacher will decide this is for you depending on suppose a pie student went there to the guru and he cannot understand higher vedanta philosophy or anything he will tell him to do some karma yoga jaggo to the preliminary work karma condo and purify your heart and again get some purification and at certain point when you are purified then you will understand that's why we hear the stories now the god and the the king of god indra and the king of demons bitra both went both went to guru and said sir i have read in the scripture that tarati shoka mata mobit i have heard that atmobit those who know the same thing our subject tarati the cross overcome should come believement suffering only if they know atman that is the subject today so please tell us about atman student went and then what happened then guru said oh you want to know that go go to the seclusion and do austerities don't eat past think of god do whatever and then purify come after 32 years 33 years anyhow some long years even saying anything he's sending him to 33 years austerity and then after they came back and then oh sir we have come back he has beard and all matted law body was dust and dart full nah oh you okay you look like shave come tomorrow after taking good nap eat well go to take a shower and shave and size and then clean yourself come after tomorrow or day after anyhow so then they came and the guru took them to a those days were probably there in a belgium glass belgium was not there so william glass was not there so he took both that disciple to the lake and lake of course lake water is very clean water so then he said hey look at that first day he also took them to to the lake and see who are you saw them dirty all matted log beard and nails and dart all over the body emaciated then say okay go and save and clean and eat well have a good nap good sleep then come back then he said see what is that he pointed out then how did you see yes i saw hey guru said isa atma this is your atma if you point it out like that this is your atma which is who is bdept of all sin apart brahma be sokka be jaura be mythu there is no ashoka bereavement there is no death name it to be or other in old age but this is the advice and go he didn't say anything go or anything he said this is and the brittara the king of the demons he was very happy but guru has said what is your atma he has pointed out to the body who is body not battered lock not beard bearded not dirty clean saved with food with nurturing and making it nicer and that is pointing away this is europe so gurudev has told me the teacher has told me maintain your body keep it well paid sleep well eat well enjoy bo he understood that and he saluted the guru and went back to his kingdom with a beating of the drum he started saying wow how i went to guru and guru taught me isha atma this is atma what else is atma this is the atma apahata parma hey dark this that all gone only naturally we did this is the char bag dorsal the philosophy of the worldly minded this world is everything eats sleep drink well that's how the many demons and everything that's why they focused on the body because they focused on the body so how to make it longer live longer in early vedic literature you will find that they they have prepared many horrible things very new discoveries to to enjoy life means what all the amenities they have to me the whole engineering department medical sciences all applied sciences are under because they focused on that they focused on that their total energy has been given to that how travel can be made easy they vimana means l aircraft different names almost the same name so they are to comfort the body to prepare such nice home nice food cutlery these that every everything has been perfected in that way health to live longer to do some surgery and surgical science and medical science as you said different branches of science they developed for how to live long with fun and joy that's all and in indra he has little much subtle element in him he thought that the teacher told me but how come he was also going back to his kingdom but he said no no no i probably i didn't understand because he pointed out to the body am i the body body will be old body will die how it will be all your bijaru it will die mrs mitchu be shoko be jorah jorah old days old days you will come to the body not maybe you may have after see now it is old age is how much after 50 you can start not old age up to 50 60 is youth no after crossing 60 you may say he is becoming little older 70 80 90 then he said and jorah yes old days old old age when now he is now 80 that's why he is sick more so you can think that but it will die one day then he thought and then after thinking he came back to guru and guru is not guru could have given all the teachings together see that's why guru acharya real achar just they give as the students capacity otherwise at the one time here what has happened even now everyone knows i'm atman i am brahmana and samadhi and need to be called for somebody so most of the people even young boys said 17 18 19 they think they have got rama ghana and they have got all their knowledge and everything because it is so easy and logical so we know everything but no that's a gurus were very tight in those days he will open their palm little by little okay and then indra then came back halfway he was going back to his kingdom he came back and saluted and said sir please tell me i i didn't understand probably he said that body this is atman this is this cannot be atman then he said okay then you go do austerity again 33 years baba 33 years old again he started doing again the same maybe should happen and then he said guru is telling yeshua guru is saying one word again and again this is your atman which is be left of all blemishes and things and then again he understood no no no my guru is talking about body is perishable but the prana is inner that is much longer prana survives it transforms one body to another the prana remains the same so probably my gurudeva is telling prana is the atman first he thought body is the atman he nullified that understanding by austerity and guru's instruction not saying directly because they are they are the kings of gods and goddesses no so they have a special element of buddhi so he need not have to say hey witness consciousness d is that don't talk too much so with the minimum talk they are getting the lesson so that's the way he understood prana is also limited prana is also sometimes prana one person is strong one person is weak prana is strong prana is less so prana is also ups and downs how can i be prana then you understood again went back again did austerity like that again came back again going so then he understood i am the mind then he said how can the mind be atman then he understood buddhi intellect how can buddhi be how ego how can ego be like that then he understood i'm the hatman witness consciousness all these things are within the realm of maya so guru is a guiding factor there these are ideal guru so with the in with the indication they are teaching but students like us they have to say so many things still i will not understand so that's why grace of guru is very much important because guru gracefully then teach us the how to analyze and how to reach the truth directly so the second verse is says act then third verse we are reading [Music] [Music] normally teaches this essence of the whole vedas [Applause] is mahabakka maha means great bhakko means what ordinary bakko ordinary words mohammed is great grand grand what what is the granddaughter four mahabharatas are there aham brahmasmi i am brahman thomasi you are that that supreme consciousness i am atma brahma this atman here is brahman when knowledge is brahman and sometimes they say sarbankal lirang brahma the fifth one they call sometimes fifth mahabharat what fourth these are the four right sarban khalid everything is brahmana but they say like that is only defined but muhammad and that's it poor mama cause that is the traditional in some places they use this also but anyhow that's not the point to understand is the point so so it is said that mahabharata now you have to say i am that i am that what does it mean i am that you are brahman are you this tiny guy a one dog can jump over you and you can cry and weep and fall down you are saying i am brahman i am infinite what type of nonsense you are talking now guru will tell nay nay here what is i mean what and that means what that is called bichara analysis of the great dictum the great magnificent word aham analyze what does it mean by your home and brahma what is that and what's me i am i am i am is me how do you link together and this and that will be together so by deliberating on the great dictums deliberating on great dictums you cannot do yourself you will be confused so therefore you are to guru as directed by the guru guru for this guru gives us advice in the line of the advice of the guru you have to think yourself i cannot do this i am that because guru has said guru has experience or guru is practicing for so many years he has conviction yeah more than me so let us take his conviction and what how he was taught by his guru so lineage is coming so guru upo not whimsically you cannot think yourself because you will be confused your understanding is not clear so we have to go therefore we have to go to guru true that guru maharaja to the path of instruction given by guru shisha shisho the student guno visham panna means endowed with good character to understand this high philosophy a student should be competent so you can go to less teacher when you are in a lower class but when you are studying graduation or master's degree you need a good teacher hi highly qualified teacher all our teachers we respect everyone but like oh you humbroom ask me to teach you need a good teacher higher teacher of course of all for everyone even the first when you go to the kg school there is a teacher no the kg school teacher may not be as wise as the university professor but he's a teacher but this is needed for that student a university professor will be not good very good to teach a kg boy kg girl to teach this child like that talk to him smile at him and do something so that's why utica there is the guno vishampan the student should be right type of student like vivekananda like student going to ramakrishna like teacher and then one stroke he got it he like teacher came to ramakrishna to teach and within three days boom done so so guru may be boot that's ah sister if not fit that's why you'll find one guru the same guru and so many disciples someone is making good progress in spiritual life someone remaining the same dull idiot no progress at at all why is it capacity no but guru has given that's a grace has already come if one can do practice it will be clear so instructed by the guru gunavisham lavith it should attend attend this quality being so their mind becoming pure by this process guru instruction is given and one will have to follow the path and analyze you know school teachers they give only heavy now everyone says oh my god there is so much home task home task is foreign is there forever when we are children we have to give so many calculations you have to do tomorrow you come and you have to prepare all these days or no and now also same thing goes on and go to school go you go they will give you so much to home task homework so so guru gabe guru only says hey do these few years and one sample math you will be doing and then now 20 being this 20 ready tomorrow so student would have to work hard should have the quality with that story guru or sister so one boy came to the teacher and he first came and he wanted to join the student to be a student to the teacher he started inquiring i said what is the duty of a student what to do what am i i am a student what am i to do they said you are a student you have to work hard you have to get up in the morning then you have to chant mantras you have to take a shower and do practice meditation etcetera etcetera as soon as it's done you have to make ready for breakfast and all this so much dough you will have to make the dough make the chapati and then potato curry and this and that and you'll have to serve the guru let's hurt the people and then after that then you have to study little bit then go go to the forest bring the firewood for cooking and then get cooked and then all this limitless work work work and then he asked what is the duty of a guru teacher a guru will sit and give advice so the student then the the boy said then sir make me fast guru make me first guru because she show is too much work so the point is that she's so work is much more guru has done all those things that's why yes come to that state people don't see we see raja maharaja and when you read eternal companion upcoming how much austerity they did how people cannot know day and night how they struggle uneducated he is brahman okay how latin one has spent his day every day huh no sleep all night joppa and then whatever after that is which stage say that also to understand everyone can do that understand everyone can do you should have the metal metal in you simplicity was there past lives karma was there but anyhow i am talking about whatever they did tremendous labor tremendous sacrifice tremendous spiritual practices behind it so students should have to be aware of that that's why this verse says by deliberating on the great dictum and by following the path as instructed by the guru the pure minded disciple who is endowed with noble qualities should attain that atman that means you have to be pure minded you have to be following the instruction of the guru and practice all these things so that what has been read in the vedas you'll have to do that any question now fourth verse is finished chat at least four words one meaning is indicated in the veda we have said four mahavakas in the vedas in four vedas four mahabharatas one from rig bait samoa jeju bed or turban one entire veda one mahaka great victim one great victim so a all the the dictums a carto it indicates to one one is what brahman sachidan on them so there are four dictums of the vedas the indicating the same meaning all the four my vedas thou are that i am that knowledge is brahman and what is that this atman is nothing but brahman this othman is born they say all these four therefore it indicates one meaning and you have to understand you have to listen from the guru tattoo guru bhakta having listened from the mount guru guru's mouth that means guru had to utter this that's why when you get sannas then the guru gives the mantra it is written here it will not do but this mantra should come from your guru guru listened to the tictum tattamasi thou are that from the mouth of the guru what will happen siddhim abba apniyat one will attain perfection or enlighten fulfillment so that means what guru will teach you that all the four victims you hear you need not have to practice four because four indicate one meaning ultimately that is the brahman and that brahman is only there and that you are so you are to understand that from guru's mukhat from the mouth of the guru or from the statement of the guru the listen from the dictum thou dawah that from the mouth of the guru you have to guru mukhi withdraw that's why vedanto is guru mukhi that's why very important in the music world also you should have some lineage similarly you have to listen brahma's music see we are reading hong kong brahmasmi then why you need to go to a guru to do all these rituals to have this same mantra this is not mantra this is we are talking about that to analyze but for your own spiritual practice you have to go a good guru and prostrate before him and get his blessings and if he fits your feet then he will give this mantra because he has practiced that that is the potential power energy that enters into you and you are to practice that is the last first receipt project no it should be done very carefully very sincerely so we end here today and we'll start from verse number five next day uh om shanti shanti okay now any question this okay now the question is very how can i get real devotion for some krishna [Music] we are reading now according to vedanta we have to purify our mind and the mind then will go towards god simple thing why our mind does not go to god because we pay much value to other things anything happens in my life very petty thing and how many times these problems came in our life how many times we solved it but it is not solved again it comes still we cannot give up those ordinary mundane things and we focus our mind and attention on to them not to god so my selfless work i am doing for god by praying to god by analyzing everything is unreal why i am so much worried what is the need of life this foolishness again and again analyzing analyzing praying by god's grace and the real devotion will come so let us wait for that pray for that sincerely then it will come then devotion for ramakrishna devotion for ramakrishna saguna we are reading nirguna saguna nirvana both will come mind becoming pure mind will run towards god you cannot help it mind being impure it will run for the worldly thing you cannot stop it so this is the simple formula here is another question each a student is a student's capacity based on their karma and guru's grace or is it only guru's case student's capacity is student's capacity we have come by our karma or our prayer of the last life or life life before we have come with a package with us and that is we are carrying that is our capacity in the same family even three children are born one will be very strong physically another is very weak physically so it is all because of the past lives karma if you believe in the karma theory so what to do guru's grace is to release us from the worldly bondage and that grace is already there we are only to unfold ourselves so we let us do our karma selfless karma let us do prayer let us do whatever we can do japa and if we do all these things by guru's grace or say god's grace they are same god's grace is guru's guest guru's grace means what guru has given us some instruction his grace is given there and now how to implement that i'll have to work if i get some instruction how to prepare a nice meal and sit and don't procure the items don't cook the process they are instructing the meal will not come then what what am i going to do whose fault one's fault guru gave you the recipe then you have to collect the recipe and work on that so this is our responsibility then guru has given what he has to give if we do work like that we'll feel that actually super karma our tendency will also change our karma attitude will change so all is god's grace guru's grace and our own effort is somadhi necessary for realizing brahman yes if we keep our ego then it keeps us separate from him so purity should be so much absorption in god's thought in noble thought or age that we are reading today which is contextual that to analyze i am that day and night day and night day and night what will happen brahma gyanu will come but when it will come this i as i am thinking that body mind just vanished ramakrishna used to say you could not say i it it egoless ego will die unless ego dies no samadhi no brahma ghana no street of prague no para para bhakti acted by anyone so all boils down to ego lessness naughtlessness ego zero ego zero year is the best highest that gives us samadhi on the subject of subject and object do you mean we trace the subject back until you reach witness subject and witness are never the same subject object here then i have used the term the object and the witness consciousness to analyze subject object means you step by step what was the subject subject was your external say a flower base is the subject who is seeing i am saying i am seeing in my mind so mind was the subject this was the object now mind becomes the object to the intellect intellect is the function of the mind how mind is running here and there so it becomes the object it becomes the subject then behind the intellect ego is there i was confused we say oh i could not i gave you wrong in response yesterday my buddhi my intellect was not functioning that means you observe your functioning of your mind so that is the object and subject is the ego and now ego becomes the object atman becomes the subject it is the same you can say witness consciousness yes all this analysis leads us to the witness consciousness and what is the real witness that ultimate witness is that brahman oh actually allah does one get a guru at the right time by itself when one is ready or does one have to search for a guru yeah yeah guru comes if you are really day and night crying and weeping to god then guru will come to your room ramakrishna was crying for mama mama so all the gurus came to dhukshi nesha in his room he did not go to search for guru but we are not in that level we search for we search for our job we search for our good food we search for our good money housing we search for some good insurance so we should search for guru also that's why because we are not in that state it will depend on the condition of the student it is a student of course you have to pray to god to get you a good guru but you are also to search for who is fit for you or who matches with your understanding who will be congenial to your thought level and see already swami vivekananda has given the in the bhakti yoga the condition of a teacher who is a teacher he has quoted from the punisher teacher should be knowing he will be in the knower of scriptures he has read scripture as well not as a pundit but he knows this real meaning of the vedas as we have read today what is that i am that that one word leading to that knowledge so that they have understood so of bridging he does not engage himself in any misconduct or anything and perfectly pure soul and he has no intention giving initiation to get money to get name could get good fame people will be pampering you no not for any purpose only for transferring the knowledge so that someone who is suffering can come out of the ignorance i have not heard the fifth mahabharata could you please respect it it is not called fifth baba ko but some places you will find a reference sarvang khalid brahma sometimes they can't consider it is a mahabhaku when that means the poissy come to the point four is enough but if you want to take it and practice sarvankhulidangram whatever seeing it is all brahman you can do that and then if everything is means i am also brahmana i am not outside i am not another entity so ultimately echo the only one meaning is the end of all these mahabharatas but i think it's called sarvam khalif brahma meaning servant everything surely this what you see this is brahman this means this is also this this also is included in that sarmam if you say serba or everything in this room that means are you not a part of everything so ultimate meaning is leading to the same goal but anyhow you need not have to bother much but you know four is enough you can take one hour to take one only okay so thank you all for joining and then tomorrow will be gospel reading as usual at 7 30. jaima om shanti shanti shanti [Music] too you
