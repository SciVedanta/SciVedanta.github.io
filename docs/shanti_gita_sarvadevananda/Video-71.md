[68. Shanti Gita - Class 68 - chapter 6 - verse 28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XVOzTKsYRnE)

oh lord lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light lead us from death to immortality and never more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face on peace peace peace be unto us all so we are reading the book called shanti gita the peace song the background of it is that on in the war of the kurukshetra mahabharata there arjuna saw saudi his son was killed on the 13th day of the war and hearing that and he was he was killed unethically breaking all the rules of following the discipline of war so he was so believed so he didn't find any interest in fighting in that situation bhagavan krishna gave him the advice and instruction which helped him to go out of the depression depression is bad but depression sometimes brings opportunity to wake up call so then then bhagavan krishna taught him who are you you are not the com body mind compound only you are something else and what is the relationship with all either you say you have every relationship with all or you say no relationship with anyone what is the relationship you have no relationship with your body when you go to sleep every night you disconnect with your body in your awareness what is yours and what you connect with outside so either you say it is all one absolute consciousness absolute bliss absolute joy that is everywhere and i am seeing my reflection in all of you not with me everywhere not disputing me but the divine me so look at that and then there is no loss no gain ocean does not cry how many waves what's dancing on the surface and how many waves dropped into the ocean ocean has any cry no but ripple has a cry oh i was drawing i was dashing i was playing and now my friend has killed me and i cry and weep no but when it merges into the ocean where is your fear where is your loss where is your gain you are that you are that essential reality so that was the message given by bhagavan krishna and that's an eternal message for all of us because we go to this type of situation every day with so much suffering and pain no fear and anxieties and worries why do you fear i lose what do you lose i lose my friend i lose myself why do you lose now you don't lose anything you come from the ocean you stand on the ocean you dance on the ocean and you merge into the ocean think yourself way one wave in the ocean of say pacific ocean think we have few waves here standing on the ocean playing on the ocean and when you go drown into the ocean it's all one h2o so this is the consciousness so that consciousness is to be raised that is called vedanta end result of the study of all wisdom is this to know that we are not the limited body mind complex homogeneous thing what we see and this is also not true it is changing every second i i i i i means my body it is not i am changing every second but i am the unchanging reality behind the change that which is in the time behind that infinite time this me so to know that will solve the problem but now here is the question that everything in in this world comes in time and that was in we read that verse just i'm bringing to our today's discussion back so it is that from the starting point of split second nanosecond to the time of infinite time billions and trillions and zillions of years you can compare from there to there everything is happening in time and everything is changing in time we have no control over it we are born one time we grow can you stop your growth today no i'll stop my growth your body will grow it will be old it will be young whatever it all the cells will change it will continue but it is change is possible on the background of the unchanging reality change is only possible if there is some unchanging substance behind is it not the waves are possible only you cannot take out the wave only no ocean only the wave can you pick up the waves waves cannot dance around unless the ocean ground is ground up ocean is there so oh so it is good give everyone this one that is also keep a copy of you thank you oh good everything is online but to get online is difficult you can share also so now oh understand that everything is happening in time from the nanosecond to the big time of many millions and billions and trillions of light year so all these are happening in time and great principle came and out of that what happens that great time from that great time get the great principle and the great principle came our ego see great principle purusha prakiti the ego ego is look at that it is giving the philosophy of sanka philosophy purusha is the consciousness look at the picture purusa and then it leads plus prakiti unmanifested primordial matter consciousness this made mixed together then comes your buddhi intelligence discriminative faculty and from that came our ego i i consciousness as i say i am eating i am going i am seeing i am this and from that came see how and all became mine and five subtle element so this this description is little uh satiko quality trick everything is embedded with tree quality your body mind and your intellect and everything either it is more of satico quality or radio signal quality or thomas equal quality that makes a difference who are more satisfy call them godly people they are called they holy people and those who are rajashiko and they are angry people egotistic people standing on their pride and arrogance no and then tamasik we call dull callous mean unkind so those are the qualities so that three qualities are giving rise to same this this this division how it coming so it says we have read that in the verse number 23 we have read from time infinite time comes the great principle great principle is they have called mahatma and from that came ahamkar so that was 23 we read that verse then it came that the very ego that three times the ego becomes three types it is not divided that way satya rajas and thomas ego may be divided into sattical quality sattika ego rajasi on the variation of shuttle like rajas and thomas qualities the pipes subtle elements are also very degenerated from ego from ego comes fight that's why you see five you see angkar see the arrow coming down on the right side creating five subtle elements five subtle elements what are the subtle elements they do not have any background so you will have to go to five elements everything is in the world what you see air no is there space two things water fire and earth so the five elements this body is combination of these five elements only our mind is also a combination of the five elements subtler thing makes the subtle part mind intellect grosser thing makes the gross things so gross and subtle so that's why they say that mind this the tamil seeker subtle thomas echo industry on the right side tamo sikho that creating five subtle elements ton matters and from that come five gross elements and on one side it comes the five mind and five cognitive and five active instruments that means cognitive instruments are what eyes recognize eyes ears nose no smell test touch no tongue these are called we recognize so that comes and five active organs also come let us call this back speech and we work to the end feet we move work no so like that five elements are created that's right written here speaking holding moving procreating eliminating these are the five money because they are coming down to explain to us what is this universe you see you see the five elements gross water you see the water we drink water we take shower in water so water is a gross element we see similarly you see the earth element it is space element so these are gross i can see i can feel but when you dream you go there also earth air fire all these elements are there but not this like this it is subtle is it not otherwise how do you see in your dream in your dream what do you see in your mind your mind creates the dream say yes or not who creates your dream your mind is it not and then mind is subtle can you catch the mind here no you're subtle now even mind is functioning but kind of catch mind like grabbing something this pain you cannot catch it is subtle so similarly that subtle mind has created whatever there you find that you breathe in the dream body don't you breathe don't you feel hungry don't you eat don't you run your hand feet eyes everything is there that's why it's called subtle not this one subtler aspect of this so that's why they are saying they five organs cognitive senses and five active in the gross and in the subtle level so that we read the other day so now i will come to the today's reading that on 25th verse they have said the five subtle elements they transform into gross elements from the subtitle part of the subtle element five sense organ subcon they are showing how from the subtle it has come to growth to give some idea about creation question is that where from the creation comes actually it comes from your mind to make that understand look at the chart it is your mind intellect intellect and mind there comes the ego where is your ego can you catch your ego in your leg easy on your head is you go where is your ego your ego is all over your body huh also your ego is connected his mind this my house this my friend no so ego extends so you has no body you cannot concretely hold but from that way that's why you in the verse number 25 we read the five subtle elements transform into gross elements from the satigue part of that subtle element came gradually the five sense organs they are known from the collective software qualities and now then from there each organ of action like elements came from the collective rajasik qualities subtle elements come from the life energy so you it will be too technical for you people who are listening first day but it is a it is to be started very well deeply you know it is a philosophy it's called the sankho philosophy and also vedanta philosophy so in one day we cannot enter we are a very technical area we are reading now now today we are reading the verse the that 28 verse maya upadhi is [Music] consciousness suppose the whole how this universe has come according to vedanto vedanta says it is come from the ocean of consciousness how the waves ripples and all the beauty in this on the surface why you go to the beach look at with great joy the rambling of the waves and ripples and you find out where it is coming from from the ocean itself but why it is happening because there is a wind blowing no that wind of desire god desired i shall be the ocean is come that is called brahman no ripple perfectly peaceful now that ocean said i'll be many then the desire came no and then started all these ripples how by maya this this wish this desire is called maya here cosmic desire you desire individual life that's called the individual desire cosmic desire god desired there will be sun that's why there is sun for all of us there is stars god says their stars are there you didn't create no scientist created sun and stars it is there and it was there it will be that by god's will we say it is by god's will it has happened so this verse says means the limiting adjunct which limits with the limiting adjunct of the cosmic god brahman bhavit isha he takes the name god absolute cannot be limited in any you know very we are in the position of very high philosophy today we in all all the dualistic religion christianity islam most of the dualistic religion hinduism part of it a dual entity is accepted god god's creation i am also a part of the creation two god and i am created i am a part of god or i am a just by is a segment of god no but how god comes where from god comes that response is not possible to be given by the dualistic people you have to go to vedanta it is said that there is only absolute one how one becomes many they say that is the magical power which was put in that infinite reality manifest as a personalized idea is it not like you are a musician your music talent can i find out music talent and take out and put it here on the table no you and your music talent is there at a time when you don't sing we do not know you are a musician so when the absolute saccidanando does not try to manifest a desire to be many there is no creation there is no world there is no you there is no me there is no sun there is no stars that is called absolute non-dual truth that's called brahman in vedanta one step down he has a talent of music he said i'll play music of diversity and that is called the by maya power what is the power that power is called the maya shakti that was inherent in brahman and when it manifest then he is called god and when he creates secrets then he starts creating major purpose that he want to create i am saying he it is not he it is not she it is not it it cannot be said you cannot define what is that if you define then means become limited if you say he is a gender the infinite where is the gender in it so he she better we use this language just to understand something of the reality so he says the maya upadhi he bhavit isha the isha the lord god who creates who sustains who maintains who gives boon to us whom we pray oh lord lord lord give me no that god is a personalized god impersonal god there is neither you no one to pray and nothing to pray be in an absolute oneness but one step down when god he comes to the god definition the same reality one step down then his musical flu his flute playing or musical the things start vibrating in the whole universe no and the whole universe of vibration starts and there comes ah shiva and not raju you have seen the shiva dance she was standing and dying that dancing that dance the dancing power was inside shiva when he does not lying flat absolutely pure that's why white pure white is the form of the shiva and when he dances the whole the vibration starts and creation starts no that's called the ishwara so it happens by what power it's called upadhi upadhi means you know it is a technical term upadhi means you just juxtapose or something on that so there is a rope you juxtapose a snake idea and you are going in darkness and you touched us rope you jump out and cry snakes next next night that is juxtaposed so absolute brahman remain absolute it does not change but the power of maya it appears to be he is called ishwara god and we are called jiva individual we are bound he gives us liberation so this duality starts playing there so the unlimiting adjunct of the collective ignorance maya that creates god so quite the point who creates this who created god well in one other person god's own power he is a brahman's inherent power maya has created this universe so maya what is maya maya is his power very simple to say the hidden power in brahman is called maya when it exercises that power as musician expresses himself so the infinite absolute brahman manifests him in the form of this god and then god creates this universe according to his plan so it is called the maya upadhi bhavit isha so isha becomes isha or god god becomes god when maya upadhi when he takes a suppose a person become playing in the role of a very say in old days suppose for these children they take a play of say like a tiger you put a tiger costume and you you can play in that costume and people see the tiger but it is the person who is inside with the maya with the with the covering of the dress appearing like that but the person remains the same person does not change who is playing inside that brahman does not change but it's expression as a world it changes so maya then ishara the limiting adjunct of the collective ignorance create god when god is god when this cosmic ignorance called the maya shakti it it is it manifests through the maya suki and individual ignorance suppose in you there is atman your pure nature but how you have become this way your ignorance in ignorance you are thinking you are a man you are a woman you are thinking that i am learned i am not i am rich i am poor where all these ideas go that's called the jiva of course everything you say separate everything i am atman behind you there is i know look at that all of us what do you say i it's an universal nomenclature you also say i i also say a baby sensai a russian will say i ukrainian will say i one in the any part of the world in india they will say aye hindu will say i muslim will say i i i i what is that i in everyone that i is constant member that does not change is it not when you were a baby you used to say i when you used to go to school that time you said i i did this i said i played i have my friend i i i i now you went to college that time you were i i i i did this i went there i made this friend i had this bad time i had this good time that i is not changing do you think that you are a changed person from childhood to today there is not one thing in you which is not changing i i i i i i do you disagree anyone you are to say i i am also saying i all the experiences i had a bitter experience i had a good experience i had a good sleep i have a good dream i had a good trip very good health i have a bad health eye is common good bad health hygiene what you call the visit they may change but common eye is behind all of us that's why this the second point come individual ignorance cosmic ignorance brahman becomes ishwara god creator god sustainer god who gives blessings and boons and redeems us that's the by the power of cosmic maya cosmic ignorance but for me individual ignorance i have my ignorance and that has made me forget that i am divine unchanging i behind my changing experiences think every day that's your vedanta you need not have to believe in a doctrine and dogma come to the religion and bow your head ten times here offer five dollars here ten dollars there no analyze here that aren't there in each one of us there is one thing common you are a atheist you are a thiest you are a hindu you are a muslim you are a christian that's called it is the universal teaching i remaining same in your own experience i did not grow that internal eye who was standing behind our baby condition in my childhood age my youth foolish my mature days dying time also i am dying but i remaining the same am dying is an action going on in the body and mind and body and mind is always changing just make it very clear body and mind and all experiences are changing but inside i never changes that is the unchanging consciousness so on changing consciousness when aj becomes individual ignorance added with the ignorance becomes the individual soul jiva i have become this why i the unchanging i have associated with this body and the mind and my understanding and my memory make me what i am call this bundle eye this bundle is a gross bundle but you see this bundle is working behind this also eye unchanging eyes standing now and you go to sleep go to bed is this consciousness will go your this body will go idea this idea go but i and see there you are dreaming something they remain the unchanging eye and seeing the dream and seeing after trip you go to sleep then dream is also gone this is also gone i does not go i remain when you are deep sleep everything is gone but you say i slept well that means your eye was awake there so that's why you call i it's called the unchanging eye this unchanging eye when it mixes up with this body mind etc that's called the jiva individual soul this is called individual soul we are all individual souls by unchanging eye the heartman in saskatchewan self capitalist in each of us there is a capital s and this is the smallest when it becomes smallest capital s plus this body mind complex added that becomes the jiva and for god also god becomes god when the absolute infinite consciousness added with this maya or this cosmic ignorance my is individual ignorance and for god cosmic ignorance remember two simple thing ignorance is the factor but ignorance in individual self it makes us this suffering personality crying sometimes smiling sometimes sometimes happy sometimes unhappy worries anxieties good health battle all these things are going on with individual ignorance individual ignorance equal that makes his jiva and the cosmic reality absolute brahman added with the cosmic ignorance that is called maya that makes god and god's creation so this if you understand then you've got a cream of vedanta just believe every day that in you there is an unchanging eye catch that you cannot deny it is your own truth your own experience i i i i is a ahadhara ego ego flows your flow of ego and that ego never increases decreases it never dies when it will die day time it is always awake you are sleeping sleeping time also he is awake and sleep the dream see the sleep and dream time also he is awake he's everyone has some rest but i has no rest i unchanging eye in us which is bull bliss that i that i is full of bliss full of joy full of consciousness and reality and reality alone so that never changes that never goes anywhere that is the individual soul comes out of that that pure eye consciousness pure eye consciousness in all of us plus added with our identification with this body mind etc we identify now with the physical one in the dream with this dream body you have a dream body you identify there in the with the dream body that's why someone is running running running a tiger is changing you see where is the tiger and chasing you and say i am i am being killed no that i remaining same identifying with the subtle body which is running in the dream and that goes to the causal body when you sleep you forget everything almost you are dead but you come back again when you wake up so that is the i unchanging added with individual ignorance called jiva got it cut it unchanging consciousness added with individual ignorance is called jiva cosmic consciousness added with maya her cosmic ignorance is called the lord god ishwara and ishara creates this thing and which also create you create your dream you create your world beautiful and are horrible [Music] everything we create you know our life is all creation of ours you can see with your mind being pure you can see the world full of joy a person who is in mind is cluttered is confused he sees so many things people who are really mentally have some some type of confusion in their mind they see so many things so many ghosts so many people are around but you are also sitting i am also sitting i don't see it so i remaining unchanging with the play in the perception changes it is my own creation that's why spiritual life we want to recreate what we are but go back to what we are not what i have appear now this is a mistaken identity and i have made it by wrongly thinking i am the body i am the body i am the body you know a baby has no sense of whether he or she no mom and dad and everyone teaches hey you you are a man you are a boy or a girl and we became a girl we become a boy we have no concept of any distinction but we have been taught so if we are taught from today i am the consciousness i am the unchanging consciousness in me is that on changing consciousness all the time 24 hours 365 days all the time timeless i am the timeless i then you are free why do you identify with the petty things which are coming and going which does not change is the eye so it is very rational but difficult to cramp we cannot that's why you go to god oh lord help me give me a serve me and take away my ignorance we prayed oh lord lead us from this is unreal because it is changing take me to the real we are praying why you are already pure unchanging you but we don't look at that side that's why we come to ishara god oh lord i cannot do please help me no so this is good but absolute vedanta says there is no such thing it is your mental creation you have misunderstand yourself and you have recreated yourself as a person as a man as a woman as an educated person as a rich person as belonging to america belonging to russia if you're going to china belonging to any other country in the finland or scotland whatever you say you have you are identifying i belong to this what is my birthplace that is my place no so but many people people move from different they are multi international people multinational people they don't don't identify with the country so we can also get out of our limitation and go to that unchanging eye in you it is there now it is there before your eyes there is some eye real eye i see i unchanging c i speak i is there on the ground of i all these actions and happening and this is called is created by individual ignorance it is called jiva so tool to term you got ishwara and jiva and brahman brahman ishwara jiva three times what is brahman timeless spaceless beyond all causation absolute unchanging cosmic thing it's in the cosmic level and now i look at me where is my cosmic level here yes there is something go dive deep and think i i i am i the body am i the mind am i the intellect who am i i i i say i this i or some bigger eye behind me this this eyes changes no today i say he's egotistic person oh no he has changed so much now he has become very humble what do you mean ego level ego is changing that ego is the relative ego but behind that is the real ego ah unchanging it does not change that's called this witness drasta shakshi cheta kevala nir gunastra upanishad said it is called sakshi means witness he witnesses everything your day your dream your sleep your past your present everything he observes only so this is called the i sakshi succeed witness dosta cheta is the only conscious entity nir guna beyond all gunas kemala only only that there is nothing but that and maya what what is this two both maya and ignorance belong to the same same category but maya means for the lord and for us we call abidda or ignorance for us it is petty that's why you call abidda or biddah biddham and for god it is called maya remember god corresponding with maya individual i connected with the ignorance called the abhiddha or biddya so but maya is predominantly mahasuddh sattadhikamaya but maya got created but he is not deluded like us we get deluded we get attached to the things in life we suffer so much we cannot as if we cannot get out of my suffering because my attachment my greed my holding on to things no but god god creates like a child he's pure child plays but no attachment did you see the children go for making some castle on the beach they go and play how seriously they do and when mommy says let us go everything remains and the baby runs away god is like that he creates but it is pure maya it is ignorance cosmic ignorance but it is purer level it's pure but for us it is impure that's why maya is predominantly pure and satiko and abiddha our ignorance is thomas mera thomas quality three qualities are there no sattva is the pure quality rajas a little you can case a rough covering but you can see through it it is like a red covering the lamp with a red cover this is the sakta so you see the light you can see the light but you cannot touch the inner light which is burning inside no so that is the sat there is one covering but that covering does not stop you seeing that brightness and brilliance now it is covered with a red tape or something you will see the same light coming out as red no and also intensity of light reduces the purity is reducing now you cover with a black tape over it what will happen there will be light inside but outside no sign at all or little feeble light our condition is like that inner light is all pure eye i i i i it is all the time whether you cover it with a glass covering or you cover it with a red tip and then you add with a tile black tip but inner light remaining the same so you see in the world people of different temperaments very people of heart love compassion purity no they are like this but it is red ego arrogance superiority sense of superiority and thomas dullness callousness meanness brutality this is as in no light inside has him known lies sight of purity con compassion everything is gone so that's why it is called the thomas so so this parts though i have read it took the whole hour but the point is that if you can get a little bit of this reading then you know vedanta in one monday at least you know the essence of vedanta there is no question of faith my faith your faith your belief my belief my belief may be different what does it mean truth will not change for that i believe that there is no god because it is all tape kept in such a way thick tape no no signal of light comes out but there may be black tape but little transparent you can see little light coming out and if you take in the red light that also may be thick or thin so this is the point and you can take out that then only you can see this light even then you can break the glass case then you go to samadhi then you merge into that truth i am thou art that i am that this uninterrupted consciousness loses its all surrounding bondage and the cosmic consciousness the faith the distinction which was created in the mind dissolves then i am that and that is called the highest experience in the vedanta you lose yourself you die we cry we'll die and these will die you will not die this dies for me every night when i go to sleep to how many people remember you have a body when you sleep unless you are sleepless you are not remembering your body so this is the point spirituality means to go back to the inner realm of ours removing the thomas covering the black covering black tape remove that then remove the red and then remove the white go beyond and touch the light which you are eternal light unchanging light all the light for peace and joy okay so i can end here only one verse 28 but this chart is only just if you want to know the intricacies yeah it can be improvised little bit but it is available in the online so we collected that but we can do it much better if you have any question we can go for that om shanti shanti shantihi [Music] tomorrow is gospel class and sami chidbrahmanan will give the gospel class at 7 30 in the evening and nishanth is always there to put some question hello nishant you are good that you are there always to have something you have any question you have okay so god with form yeah that comes one step down god with form it is it is god the first comes god no form and no limitation now next comes god is infinite omniscient everywhere but he has quality that is the christian god which is called in hinduism ishwara and islam called allah there you pray o allah help me i need we pray also god oh lord god please do this to me no he has compassion so quality compassion love protection yeah redemption all these qualities he has then comes god with name and form both name and form there comes the like christ like buddha's human and hinduism has subtle gods like the mother durga kali shiva they are the same with name and form but they are not separate in the form they carry the power the same power is carried you know suppose one police big police officer he has tremendous power no but when he goes in in public place or doing something he may be he may be like an ordinary man but does his power go no he has his power that that is given power it is already that manifest or unmanifest does that mean since they have quality does that mean the personal god and the god incarnations are they also figure because not it has separate yeah but that ignorance does not bind him because he is fully aware that's why though it is ignorance you are right that's why it's called maya maya i'm defining my equal to cosmic ignorance i'm using the term ignorance scripture is saying it is ignorance but not small ignorance it cosmic ignorance and cosmic ignorance you know in big ocean there is less pollution in a small pool there will be stagnancy no but the the same pollution put into the pacific ocean it is nothing it will go away the vastness of this so though it is ignorance but that ignorance does not bind god because he is omniscient he knows his knowledge conscious but we individual small pool so something dirt and dust has come so i don't know who am i so all the dust is to be clean clean clean my ignorance will be clean then i will understand that but god understands that he is the absolute this is the distinction that's why cosmic ignorance has no bondage individual ignorance has bondage we are in trapped in the individual ignorance therefore we are in bondage we cry and weep and suffer and joy and all do all these things now the question how to differentiate between karo and sakshi in the waking state you know how to we say i i i i no no i read i studied i was talking so this eye and how can you make out this eye versus the unchanging eye a very difficult you need to do rigorous analysis every day every moment as i am doing for last 40 minutes it seems it makes sense yes there is some unchanging eye rationally i may not understand but rationally says yes must be the unchanging eye otherwise who says we started our class at seven o'clock if there is no unchanging person standing behind witness who will say at seven o'clock 7 30 we started the class but it is now mixed with our this little ignorance individual ignorance mixed the unchanging eye has mixed with the individual eye so it is too very difficult to cut that level so it needs rigorous spiritual practice it needs rigorous analysis day and night as we can analyze waking state i know waking state there is iiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii ang i was in the sleep state iii i slept i was happy and in dream state i dreamed i dreamed i dreamed no so that i but it is always mixed so closely this our petty eye versus our big eye we have two entities ramakrishna said kachami unripe indigo and ripe indigo ripe indigo is the unchanging ego that unchanging ego mixed with the individual ego that's why we cannot separate out it needs spiritual practice it needs introspection every day to think again and again and again read am i the combination of this body and mind and this body of mind which body you are talking about which mind you are talking about today's body will not be the same tomorrow's body my 10 years old body is not today's world body of 80 years old body no and mind of the baby and mind of a adult is not the same an adult mind is not the same as the old man you go to the old man tottering over the stick and and making the world is different for that person than a young young person all bright and all gloomy are not bright and brilliant and singing and dancing everything is charming charming the old person is no more that their idea changes so what is true then there is nothing you can say it is true it is changing changing changing so this is to be analyzed analyzed analyzed its rigorous analysis buddha did it for years and years sitting in that posture no unchanging nature of the universe but changing nature of the universe unchanging nature of our own self that is vedanta you go to church matters little you go to temple matters little you do whatever practice you do but hold on to this point so there is this difference can be done only in a very rigorous mental analysis and every day every moment should be who is analyzing this and whose mind is keeping in the cosmic level pure level mind needs to be kept in a lofty level so that you keep it in down it goes in distracted objects that means it's going astray you have to withdraw that mind and focus on this point that i have an unchanging eye let me look back i am looking this side let me look back here and if we can go to the non-changing with your eyes open you will see the world has changed what is your mind that is your vision as is my glass if it is red i see red everywhere if it is blue i see blue everywhere so the mind is like that so next question of course in deep sleep ahamkara is not there but because mind is absent but that is analyzed only in waking is not it possible that i can be conflate conflating the real self with asmita or rahangkar or some more limited sense of equity yes at our present state if we try to analyze we will be confused with our limited eye with the big eye that may be but again don't give up analyze further then it will be automatically you cannot hang on to that you cannot hang on to that changing state mistakenly thinking that is unchanging my eye when is getting identified with this object that object is a pure eye attached to something else due to ignorance so we have an unripe indigo and ripened you ripe indigo appears to be unripened appears to be ripe indigo you know mango tree if you have no idea of mango tree we in india we have seen so many mango trees no so if you from a distance you see mango hanging you may think it is ripened but it is totally hard it is not yet so it takes time unlike when mango takes how many days to make it ripen in the tree it takes some days in spiritual life also yes this confusion will come but we have to by your spiritual practice go in and in and in and then that pure eye will be cleared in our conception actually what is the relationship between witness consciousness and cosmic reality the big eye what is the relationship with witness consciousness there is no so long you say witness consciousness witness consciousness you have to understand what is witness consciousness when you are talking about witness consciousness witness means someone is observing and something observing so so long you say witness there is duality you have to reach a point there is nothing to witness nobody to witness no observer no things to be observed so that again what i have discussed just now it needs rigorous spiritual practice self-control day and night to think who am i i am i do witness am i the witness go on at least you go to one step to second step to third step to fourth step now and then ultimately you'll reach there but now we may confuse that's true but that is a period of spiritual practice we will have to continue that so succeed we can how another question how shall i stay in the my nature of witness yeah that can we can practice that i am here my body is here but behind my body someone is experiencing this who is that experiencing person that's the i consciousness so we can think again and again and again and analyze and analyze and analyze your conviction will come that's why in vedanta in vedanta they say you need not have to do any other thing only sravana listening as we are talking analyze in your own mind also you see it alone [Music] reflect deeply am i really so am i the witness no i am the body thousand times my conception will turn back to the body but no no how can i be body body is changing body is transforming every day every cells are being changed every how many years five years or seven years all the cells of the body gets totally renewed so what what you're talking about you everything is gone everything is going in the flow so analyze analyze and re-establish yourself no i am the witness i am seeing my body somebody say oh see i have become so weak you have not become weak your body has become weak oh i am so unhappy today because someone told me this hearts words horse version said where you are unhappy in your mind in or unhappy in yourself no it cannot touch there your body and mind is getting affected by the things of the world so you are not the body not the mind but you are something else so analyze so that this practice is to be done and then everyone can think who is in me we call in devotion god is observing everything in the dualistic language you say god god is seeing don't say god say witness consciousness he observes everything another question did all abraham disciplines attain this side in the disciplines legacy anyhow did all of suramar into this disciplines attain moksha you mean disciples probably anyway so yes we hope so yeah they have moksha means they they they are all i hope so because they did so much austerity and their and their life was transformed and not only that whoever came in their life they got the benefit so i think yes but you can try main thing is let us try who has happened for whom matters little if it has happened for x y z what is that to me i am suffering i am to get out of this problem problem is mine take it seriously i am suffering because of my identification with the body and mind anything happening to the body i cry weep no and many people in the utmost health condition they don't want to die and death question and crying why we are dying every second can you stop your death every second in this one hour we have all changed can you stop it so what is the point accept change is the nature of the body and mind but i the same person never changes hammer hammer hammer go and type deep type deep dive deep and you will find the joy you will find your own response not to look at who has god who has not got of course they have because the sign of spirituality is that they will be calm they will be syrian they will not be affected so much as we are they will also cry if they fall down no if you breathe again krishna no more question how does witness consciousness dissolve back in the higher self witness consciousness need not you need not have to do anything you only think i am not the body not the mind not this i am that witness consciousness go back there and hammer again and again and again go back to the witness concert it automatically dissolves you need not have to do when the drop of water comes from the cloud and falls falls false fall how it will touch the ocean you need not have to think how the drop will be ocean you need not to meditate on that you made it how quickly you can come down and merge in touch the ocean touch the ocean inside the same motion suppose imagine in the pacific ocean you are a wave you are on the surface looking at another form another body no and now you think no i won't look at that let me look at the ground of my existence go down down down down down what do you find the same ocean and the same ocean i will find what i would do you go down no no no you find the same ocean there is no two ocean only one ocean all this diversity how it will happen how if that question does not come only to dive deep it will happen thank you all um peace peace peace you
