[69. Shanti Gita - Class 69 - chapter 6 - verse 30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoikqdAKf-s)

[Music] um lead us from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and never more shine in our hearts with your respondent face o peace peace peace be unto us all so we are reading santi gita and will be verse 30 31 here we read the other day that in avid jiva individual soul becomes alphago knows very little and but it is chidavasu the reflection of the consciousness gives this jiva jiva means you see is reflected sun but that reflectation has no existence but it appears it is there and it's working like that it has no existence other than brahman but it appears to be like that how because of molina he avidya because it is covered by with the ignorance ignorance of the nature of molina superstar is god there is only sattical quality cosmic sacrificial quality and through that this the power of the cosmic creator comes over there but individual soul they are molino which means little darker little polluted diffused and that is impure molino avidya and this they are in ignorance and its nature is abu ranath mika it covers and the chidavasu the reflection falls there that is called the jiva it is all sulphur gastropia it has its limited nature all these jivas are what it's like the bubbles in the infinite ocean of consciousness so chaitany kulpitang servant in that in that cosmic consciousness everything is imagined little ripples and the same sun reflected in so many ripples becomes so many individual beings you me all are reflected the consciousness is deflected in the mind lake so that we read the other day that the individual ignorance of the why it is happening due to the preponderance of the impure sattical qualities sattical quality not in pure state but impure state and is indeed the veiling nature its nature is to cover there the jiva is the reflected consciousness this jiva we are only if the sun is there then reflection is possible if the sun is not there there is no reflection that means cosmic consciousness is reflected in the individual ignorance appearing as jiva that's why it is said jiva is shiva there is no existence of jiva jiva cannot be there so what is that it is only that consciousness is there and coming under the realm of ignorance he becomes limited knowledge because he is the same consciousness reflected coming in a limited uh what is called adjunct it becomes called the uh knowledge also we are all pogba we our knowledge is very limited knowledge god's knowledge is cosmic knowledge he knows everything sarbagh god is sarvanga and we are all panga we are very little we know very little in this universe of this relative universe and about our real self so everything is imagined in that consciousness like bubbles in the water now we'll read the 38th verse shipped what does it mean to ilu mindu as the oil drop bindu of the tail boil if one oil drop just ha ship though if you just throw it or scatter it it potato swarovski in the lake in the water there is a water in the lake if you sprinkle some wild like that nana rupino bister bistar it gets spread you see when you sprinkle little water a oil it tends to spread over so nana rupert it is so a drop of oil that has fallen in the waters of the lake becomes scattered in various forms it spreads in the water but it does not become water the water oil does not become water while remains oil water remains water but you can feel on the top of the surface the oil is spreading like this what you call that oil oil film so likewise and now now similarly the next verse is connected with this this is the example as it happens as the oil becomes spread on the surface of the water similarly anonto purnachoi tanni [Music] [Music] similarly now consider this water lake of the water we are considering just for example to understand now this lake is not lake it is infinite consciousness and it's full full of that consciousness there is nothing but that now mahamaya the great maya in the book in bhakti school we call mahamaya vedanta is saying great maya grand maya same same idea bijlimbita it has been manifesting what has been covering as manifesting you know bhijrimbhita therefore the maya has manifested the infinite undivided consciousness as this world non-arduino because we don't see the water we see the wild surface of oil similarly maya the cosmic maya mahamaya is visible this is the maul maya that's why tantra it says ma everything is ma to whatever invisible universe nothing but mother because it is a shakti and this nana rupee you know january in different names and forms the whole universe is only name and form that's why vedanta says no what is this word plus name and form so this universe of name and form mahamaya bijrimpita mahamaya the great grand maya is expressed or manifested or appeared in the form of diverse names and forms gives disappearance of the world so a drop of oil that has fallen in the water of a lake becomes scattered in various forms it spreads in the water similarly various types of appearances we find in the universe why but it does not become water as water and oil remains same so here the the likewise maya has manifested in the infinite undivided consciousness it is all maya it has manifested ourselves as it were in all diverse names and forms which part of that consciousness can she feel even a little with names and forms that mean that part a consciousness meaning that everywhere is consciousness which part of that consciousness can she feel even a little with the name and thoughts that means he's spreading every nooks and corners nothing left uncovered so so long in the level of relative level we exist then it cannot be said that there is anything else that's why we don't see brahman we always see the top layer of oil and bistino and this oil is here exemplified as name and form of diverse characters and also if you drop of oil is poured depending on the this nature of the wave or ripple it spreads differently so this universe is everywhere it is differently manifested diversity is the plan of creation so that is the play in which mahamaya spreads everything and covers our vision but it is on only superficially it is only little layer of it but behind is the infinite ocean of consciousness so this is that's why we call even bhakti school and vedanta also ultimately muhammad mother grace grace grace [Music] judiciary of kashi viennas the door is the just simple one door is blocking open the door you can break through my door of ignorance and that the door which leads to me to the moksha or liberation that is to be broken so it is maha maya mahamaya so everything is that in the ken opunishad they are appeared mother durga ah say mother maha maya and she gave the knowledge to indra you didn't understand who was unrecognizable for an entity that was brahman and by that power you have got all this success and glory so this potito saroshi jali has a drop of oil that has fallen in the water of the lake becomes scattered nana rupino vistino in variety forms in various forms it spreads mrna but it does not become the water likewise therefore these are beautiful parts to meditate upon one can meditate on this this is a this this can be used as a intellectual reading this can be used intel in a very deep practice of meditation just think that chaitanya that consciousness is spread all over anantu it is everything is nothing but conscious absolute consciousness in brahman and maha mayab is repeated it is all manifestation what you see here it is all manifestation its maha maya is appearing like that but it is nothing but that brahman because which part of the consciousness can she feel even a little that means she has spread everywhere there is no little space left also you can think in this way the visible universe is covered but there is unvisible infinite layer is there where there is no covering the they all we say that all the ripples and waves are on the surface and how much is that quantity of water in that ripples and waves and how much is the ocean itself there is no comparison of it so that's all uh only here what do you see and that reality is only beyond all this limited calculation so it is this limited we seeing the visible universe we get so much astounded what is that unvisible infinite behind this visible universe is imaginable that's why when you chant the word om a u m and dot these four things are there a is only a part is only the visible universe this name and form what we see in the visible world is they called space between this visible star to star galaxy to galaxy how much is the space bigger than that and more that is your deep state of what you call the corona state causal causal body cosmic causal and then beyond is the dot and brahman is all together nothing left out the visible universe what mahamaya biswim bita on the maha maya has expressed in the surface this visible universe of name and form then plus that space between or even heavenly states of existence and then karna where you cannot say anything but that existence is there takuru is to go to that current stage and then beyond when samadhi perfect so who will say what so this all pervaded consciousness it is filled with everyone and she feels which part of that consciousness can she feel even a little with name and form now 32. [Music] [Music] [Music] maya is not capable of doing any wonder in the brahman that means any change no maya as much maya tries to change but it cannot change anything so maya is not capable of doing any wonder in brahman actually in in reality maya does not do anything what happens the consciousness by its own inherent power alone displays the various problems [Music] evo the twitter no consciousness has a power as they see vedanta and shakti and all these philosophy here we can reconcile that that maya has the power of doing something which is impossible possible it's called agartano gautano potiosi she is expert maya is such which cannot be a fact she can create recreate and appear like that so it is appearance only but it has no reality it is brahman only is real when and as you say how it came out normally something to manifest you need some other help in material world but here material world no no other agency is necessary as we give the other the example to create anything in the universe we need two causes are there one cause is called material cause another cause is called efficient cause one is called the nimitz and another is called upadhanakaran upadhanam is the material because upadham and nimita means cause his cause or in what way instrumental cause say carpenter is the instrumental cause and material consolate all the material wood furniture wood paint what you call nail glue all the other instruments these are called matter so material cause and instrumental cause these are the reason for creating anything in the material world two to two are necessary but how you are saying this world this maya is creating so maya has some separate power that to make it understand now maya there is not any other thing extraneous other than brahman in the brahman that potential power what is there that's why it is called that that power by its own inherent power as as snake has its power to move like that and snake can stay just coiled up so someone is a big scientist when you look at him we don't understand from outside what knowledge he has but when he speaks that knowledge comes out so that knowledge was where but somewhere else than that scientist the scientist is carrying that knowledge within himself and it manifests sometimes does not manifest one time it manifests other time it does not so therefore but this is the power what power is this it is this scripture has given the name potiosi potiosi means who is very expert in making what is not there to appear like that that is the power and the magicians they do they say be fool us all and thousands of people will be there and they'll be be fooled okay i was in the pc circus magic not the junior pieces father in a star star theater there's a big uh thing going on so many people came and pc soccer came and he's making all tricks and everyone is be fooled is just impossible possible for us watch please watch look at your watch what is this and you see that it is he has changed the time to in all everyone's mind and within split second he said now you watch now you see your watch everyone is saying oh we are reading the wrong time before it's all his magic so he's standing on the platform and then suddenly and put a cotton in front of him and the carton dropped and the man disappeared and then where they're sitting just behind two three rows behind us he says i'm here so how the man from there will disappear with the cotton cloth and putting over him and he said we see that only the curtain dropped and the man vanished and that man is just how he can run from there to their mystery but he's a trick only but there is one sadhu who became a sadhu his father brahmachari that time so i was in sarudapit that time his father knows some trickery magic and he said swami can you give some coin so i i have some coin probably i gave it and he took in his finger showed me where is the thing it isn't palm and suddenly he took it in between this and he just threw away it's gone his hand is nothing is there he showed like that and then he pulled from my body and the bomb that the coin has come back and he's throwing his dear and there and he's bringing wherever he likes i know it is his trickery of the hand the coin is going somewhere here hidden in such a way you cannot see but it's such a trickery this is maya nothing happening but it appears to happen particularly in early days you used to see they will take a magician will come and will take a and hollow what you call the drum hollow drum so and then you'll talk so many things and your attention will be diverted and then you'll put a c here is the empty drum do you see that and with the stick you will and you see it is totally blank and it puts on puts on the desk and then by that time see there's nothing your son and then covers it with one cloth and then he said you please come and one audience come i can bring out whatever you want somebody said i want a mango and he put his hand and gave the mango hurry how he will read his mind or he has influenced his mind whatever trick he has played the person selected at random came and asked something and not only mango then someone has some some other item and he's bringing one after another if he can manage such out of nothing he can bring mangoes and things he will be rich by itself every day bringing mango mango mango he says i'm gonna sell it so this is something trick is going on but people get mesmerized so maha maya is considered to be playing the trick trickery but it is trickery whose power it is the power of brahman understand that is the point not another agency like that wood is one item and a person is another by our item magician is a magician is true but his magic is false or it appears that is the trickery and he plays that trickery that is his joy and maya and it is said maya sauna suppose all the audience is there one who can recognize the trickery then he will not be bewildered anymore he will be realized god so it is said maya this maya mahamaya who is playing so much of confusion in our mind as it were we are entangled into the world but she understands she'll be happy if one can recognize and then maya will then disappear from that person maya sawanashi no so so here is the very important point cannot do anything by this wonder brahmani in brahman is not capable of doing anything it is caitanya swabalino eva it is within satan within consciousness that's power of manifesting that power of creation is there and that is the power that is from shakti and satiman brahman and his power so that idea he saw moleno by his own power intrinsic power only nana akaram in diverse forms and names production displays exhibits demonstrates so many so maya is not capable of doing any wonder in brahman he can do to jiva we are jivas we we may be bewildered but maya is not brahman is not affected brahman knows because it is brahman's power so all this manifestation therefore you cannot delude the brahman idea is that jivas can be deluded by this play of the magician but the brahman is not at all affected by this it cannot be made to forget or do anything that is one without a second ok 32 now 33 [Applause] [Music] [Music] now very important philosophy is the sankara's philosophy of what's called without changing anything you can see it is as if it is deformed nothing has changed but it looks like that without changing the original suppose example you put a stick in a tub of water in a bucket of water you see that stick is broken at a point it looks not straight it's refraction refraction of light you know but when i see i see it is broken but nothing has no change in the stick but i am seeing that changed or broken you are driving in the hot summer now if you drive in a long stretch you will find that as you are watching as if water is there on the road and and then you think water and then you drive close water you know it's no water at all at the same time road you go to the desert and swamiji gave that example in while he was walking in the rajasthan desert area and then he used to see he knew you know science he knew the reflection it happens so he knows everything but he still every day he's see watching water because the trees are reflected in as in the pond or lay out a lake you see the reflection of the trees on the bank no and it's fresh water as it were so he was going going one day he also felt thirsty and forgetting that he approached and as he approached he said where is water it is all sand the same sand but it appears so that is appearance without changing this sandy bed bed sand is not changed but appearance is real here is the same thing road is road you see the water there here in the stick example you see the stick in the snake example we get frightened we cry and weep touching a snake in darkness because i have some concept of snake and we feel that the snake has beaten no but without changing the rope we are feeling the snake's appearance and there is another example this is the bivartavada and purina mubada puri namabhati is that you put that day you put the milk and it transforms into curd or yogurt no now can you bring the yogurt back to milk no it has purinator it has become like that so if it is become you cannot go back to the origin so if it is coming from brahman and you say that it has become this world okay i have become that the world the part of the world i have no chance of going back to my source then because you only do yogurt yogurt cannot be brought back to the milk so this is the example of what is called the purina so these so the main thing is that that example is to be brought here for our understanding about brahman and this creation vedanta says you see this world but it is not there it is without changing the original substance you are seeing something which is totally absent this is called bivartabad this is sankara's philosophy and that gives the foundation that whatever i am seeing i am saying only it is only just an expression in our mind my seeing through the mind and mind is giving a wrong interpretation that they're called when the cheetah becomes then it is brahman taku said sudamon sudda buddhisudda atma akh when their mind becomes pure is sudda mind suddam sudda understanding becomes sudha pure perfect and sudda atma and then this is atman when my mind loses its definition of mind mind is vacillating changing look at our mind every day when you meditate when you're not meditated mind is running here and there and then making us mad but mind is that is the function of the mind but when mind does not do that in the potential suggestion then mind becomes calm tada then rush to the witness it remains in its own divine glory when the mind is stopped and that is called this sudden that's why we do meditate so much why try to cool down the mind so when it will be able to be calm and cold then drasta the witness was behind it will be established in its own nation that means we'll all be seeing the reality in its fullest extent that is the state when mana oman bhavanti when mind becomes mindless mind becomes mindless that is sadhana is necessary will also drop ultimately so now the biber told that that's where reading bibartos after about so what you see this is the bibarto i see the stick broken into two pieces but it is not that change what i see be worth no what i am change observing the change it is swapnawat as you see dream every day we have some dream but that is no it is only there as as long as you see when you wake up those are gone it is just a fancy of the mind so soft number this universe you see that's why you come dusty shresthavat this three sister i mean i see as soon as i see there is sister this is justine this brahman is there but sister is there creation is there because i see there are different place philosophies this this time the world is created and it is there that's why i see that is the dualistic idea and sister estimate justice system i cast my view and then the world remains i close my we go to deep sleep every day where is the world for me when i am in deep sleep so there is no dristi no sisty even dream i mean i am seeing dream that's a dream is there so this is non-existence appearing as existence so that's why don't see don't see the world see god that's why there is one good lesson and don't seek god but see god it is vimerto see god you are seeing that it is table it is spews it is floor it is all it's only you are seeing that without changing the original consciousness it's all permeated by one consciousness no budhistani in the substratum is the brahman tunin malay which is absolutely pure in the absolute pure consciousness absolute pure brahman this satnavat bivartang this universe of name and form what you see so solid i see it's solid it is liquid it is gases but this is only viverto in the dream don't you see solid thing when you are hitting our car is hitting something some wall our car breaks dream car breaks with the dream wall dream people smiling with a dream another dream a man so a dream person is drinking dream water this water will not do there but so now i understand how funny last night i saw a certain dream and you're just so real as long as i was it is vivarta because nothing has changed you are lying down in your bed in comparison this way you can understand and comfortably in your room but in the dream you are in a jungle and you are being chased by some tiger and you are running running running your heart is palpitating and it's so real so real surreal but if someone takes a camera on your face you'll see that you are lying simply a calm person but what is going on in your mind level it has created the universe it is vivorto it has no real existence but it is appearing to us absolutely strong and powerful no way of getting out of that as if the tiger has already caught you and suddenly you get up and some people take a long time to come out of that the effect is still there even no dream is there still people get yes help heart palpitation that subtle fear enters into the gross body also its impact so and this gross impact of course is there all the time so this we cannot really understand this this in this level but that's a dream experience and sleep experience is very helpful for a vedanta student when you are sleeping all your human worries anxieties fear or excitement joy gain loss frustration achievement everything is vanished from you not a iota of existence of this universe and it's in feelings and its emotions and its values are there at all good bad holy unholy so everything is just evaporated there because it is very close to the brahmana now that without changing anything it is all brahman all the time 24 hours but it is appearing to us it is a bibarto so vedanta student does that always so sarmum this tani to need mali in the near mall extremely pure stainless nermal budhistan the substratum that remains the same and this bivarta is sapnawat this appearance is like a dream and a dream play going on and we are italy what is the example when in the sky there is a cloud or dwarf means smoke that maya is like that you see in the sky when it's covered with the smoke or this cloud you see there is a tiger you can see so many things according to your mental imposition you can see the cloud in diverse ways it is it appears so many things but there is nothing but the sun and then even that cloud is created by the sun this is also another example it is said that when some people do something wrong she is a killer has killed somebody but he keeps some clue behind to so that police can catch him [Music] either his something will be left here thumb impression will remain or this and that he think i no one i banished my all what you call all the testimonies but something so maya also is that creating this maya has create kept some clue loofah and through that loophole you can enter so it says in the akaso you see maya is like a dhumahat and you can see so many ideas thoughts according to your thing you can watch the sky full of cloud that karjam will be stream and you can see its activity also but sanga's personal nasty there is no touch of any nothing can touch the sky nothing can touch the sun and the ambaro the space is not diluted or made impure by molino tata by by this cloud it cannot pollute you cannot do any uh impure bring any impurity in that truth on space space remains peace space remains pure you cannot do anything to the space fire starts and we say oh it is smoke it is so much smoke but what happens to the space space cinema space brahman remains the brahman where the fire happens that is in the in the relative level in the level of so long one is in mind and body suppose someone is in deep kumas state and then the fire has happened what will be his experience he will no idea about it even medically if one remains like that and someone is going for some surgery and that time some huge disaster has happened outside you will not know anything it will be unaffected simply because the mind is not there so this verse is very important to think about we brought down everything everything serbum sarvam means everything is illusory like a dream maya and its effect the visible universe have spread upon the substratum of pure consciousness this too has come out on the substratum foundation and foundation is the brahmana consciousness just like smoke spreads in space there is no association or contact between them there is no association or contact with smoke and the space space remains always faced and smoke comes and goes it affects us but not the sky so brahman is not affected by anything as such whether our mind gets polluted our mind gets pure impure it is untouched by anything brahman remains unaffected by the activities of our mind so everything is illusionary like a dream maya and its effects that means this visible universe has spread upon the substratum of pure consciousness just like the smoke spreads in the space brahman that's why swamiji said that you see the you see brahman first and then you see the table i am seeing the table you think table is stable only but he says no you see the brahman fast and then you see the table you see the goldfast and the ornament next without the gold ornament cannot be but people look at the ornament as we are minus gold minus the concept we look at everyone as a human being not as atman not as brahman that is because of the bibarto and maya's play and this is not really has happened viva one word makes so much sense that it gives you the direct idea that it is not created at all it appears it appears it appears it appears and whatever you are seeing it is brahman only there you are seeing the web you are seeing the bubble it is whatever may be his name but it is nothing but water water water water same water as the ocean water so it is the untouched by the ripples and waves ocean does not get actually does not gain anything and lose anything maybe there are waves infinite number of waves come and it sinks into it so is there any question so you can keep it up to this power [Music] is in my dream then which one i should trust nothing to trust these are all false jagaron is mytha sophmo is also there is no position of anything you whatever you are we are holding that's wrong this is wrong and then the dreamer is also wrong any thought is coming that is wrong it is only brahman so that is the bibarto idea super imposing our mind is super imposing and it is creating only our own clothing and creek creation our own big shepherd everything it is only big shepherd and aburuna covering the atman and creating the big so mind is there nothing in waking state it is happening but you may say this question if it is so why everyone sees the same sound i am seeing there is i i am telling that there is a one asa tree you also say there is an assault tree everyone comes there is a certainty why everyone says so because it is not the creation of your mind as you create in your dream but it is a creation of the cosmic mind you know when you you become the cosmic mind when you dream whatever your subtle thoughts and ideas were there you do not know you are not aware that creates the whole scene of them who creates the who is the producer of the movie in the in your dream movie who does that do anyone go to create your dream no no example is that when you go to dream who creates your dream my mind your mind and your mind who have planned it your mind has planned mind is the producer mind is the actor mind has become the road mind has become the cause mind has become the lake water mine has become in which the you your car dropped into the lake that is also in your mind so you are the producer you individual jiva is so powerful he created the entire dream world and he created himself there he created his friends enemies love hate everything is going on and car is whether metal or non-metal everything is your mind has taken all the shift now the cosmic mind what is called god he dreams and he didn't see sun moon and we are all created by that cosmic mind so we are bound to see all these things and we are charged just we read that we are happy we are bound because we are under the under the spell of the maya mahamaya but nothing has happened that's really beware to theory it you wake up and you see the dream parishes when you wake up from this dream long dream then we become illumined then this world venice shankaracharya says no i was watching this universe of name and form just before my illumination and now everything is gone gatam [Music] just now before my dawn of my knowledge in the ignorant state i was seeing this universe so strong solid and everything and now nasty kim there's nothing [Music] that what was not there it marched into the void marched into the void there buddha says buddha wide but it is not void you come down and you can feel what you experienced rama krishna is to go when coming down and we see the whole gospel what his experience sometimes he is saying when i say i will drink water i come 100 feet down from that level of experience there you cannot say anything who will say to whom so that is it so this is all analysis is good to see that this cosmic mind is god's mind and it is individual mind is this mind we can get we every day go beyond this mind state not beyond mind but we our mind dysfunction will become dysfunctional but by meditation and prayer and vedantic thinking day and night and mano nasho you have to destroy the mind and then that will come in vasanaksha all our vasana holy mother said if your all desire is gone now nirvana how take kunihoy you become free from vasana then now and now we will get that liberation who can stop you because rabindra says [Music] i want this i want that after getting this no i want that one i have not seen that i will have to go there i have to eat that and you finish one and then another i want this i want this bohu bason array pranapanasai with my earnestness i am grabbing and trying to get it oh lord you are so gracious you don't say give me whatever i want by depriving me you have saved me bach i am now rescued by you by not giving me whatever i wanted like a child i do not know whether good or bad i want this i want this i want this the whole world is chai chai chai chai want want want one never satisfied and who lord how kind you are you deprived me from having it many many people have a good thing he's expecting something and he came just almost to grab it and it dropped huh whole life struggle goes and i was working for so many days and last moment is this so in in material life really it is a loss but in spiritual life it is again oh lord it was not good for me so you have taken away what a grace you have taken away from me one question has come okay we end here um [Music] krishna panama stu so tomorrow i will have some this is the gospel class tomorrow at 7 30 and this class will be stopped for three weeks for you know two two and three three tuesdays and but some other swamis will be speaking and then tomorrow wednesday i'll be gospel day also next few days some you will also give one day a class so we'll hear from him the question comes now the question our senses are exposed to myriads of worldly inputs daily like literature arts music today mostly dwells on the pleasure and things of the world should a spiritual aspirant be vigilant about what world inputs he is exposing his senses to and how does these things affect or influence our subconscious mind it's very true you have given the response to in your through your question spiritual experience should be vigilant that all about what worldly inputs is coming to the eyes some input going to the mind in the samskara listening here going to that mind through the mind it's making some scar it's all settling settling certainly so how what garbage you are collecting in your room or what good new good things you are collecting so see we should be careful if we don't be careful we'll fill our heart with garbage that's very vigilant we should be vigilant and vigilant is very important and if not then we'll have to pay the price not today i will have to pay the price no one will pray for me because it is deposited in the subconscious you know or do not know you are depositing it in subconscious whenever you are thinking any thought you are making a decision in your life whether it is giving you good impetus or bad impetus we are the creator of our future creator of our god realization is not a matter of joke unless one is vigilant about one's inputs and word is bombarding with everything you just go into the youtube and try to see one good lecture and see how many things come and they say see me see me click me i am here i am here i am here good bad so many things so that is the point the world is also bombarding with all the sensitive experiences and just take me take me take me take me but how can you do can you will be blind if not then how to handle these things we have to handle that what is that don't take the exterior see the divine play who is behind this i am seeing whom i am seeing this person or who is inside the person if we take that as a ramakrishna said swan swan if it is given milk and water together when someone drinks he can extract the some saliva is there some secretion milk can be separated he can drink the milk so that type of thing two things are mixed together we all have to choose what to take if you look at something which is attractive so what is this point of attraction what you love a beautiful rose rose is the point of attraction or who is behind the rose you look a baby smiling baby very charming whose charm is this it is the baby's charm or it is the lord's charm so that to we can just deify our understanding and then take then that will be helpful for spiritual life and what is drastically to be rejected which is not good for our spiritual growth and development so everyone should be very sincere to watch on one's own inputs yeah and we are super imposing problems in everything but you know no more is not so much reality is reality yes no you can practice that it is brahman it is brahman but but there is danger at the beginning stage if you say all this brahman there is a chance of being identified there and not knowing you will be worldly minded therefore for a beginner as a student we should have to understand this is temporary this is permanent so this is i don't like that practice isn't the scriptures just to think that everything is that will be the ultimate yeah that's that's that's the practice when you're practicing with that if i don't feel the ananda or the consciousness then how to bring these two together the understanding and the experience no no when we do that automatically joy will come but unless the mind becomes pure it cannot be experiencing the joy in it but it at the beginning we'll have to do this by like taking medicine bitter medicine like that bitter melon or same like and then when we get a little taste of it but not every day little bit test you you all of us got little bit one day one morning one time it was it was great joy this tomb this morning it was actually i'm more happier than so we get a little glimpse but you cannot say that you have not experienced that but to make it in our lives day-to-day life we need to be allotted that that question is very important what i am taking in my mind you should have a filter we have to create a filter i will take this much i'll reject the other thing then maybe which is spiritually uplifting i'll take that and other things i will reject that that needs a character then needs very strong character okay om shanti shanti peace peace peace you
