[12. Shanti Gita - Class 12 - Chapter 1, Verse 31 -35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azlVqEAkdsM)

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] from the unreal to the real lead us from darkness and ignorance to light and illumination lead us from death to immortality and even more shine in our hearts with your resplendent face from peace peace peace be unto us all right so we are back to our reading of shanti gita the description on the web destination of the baskets you can find on online so we have read this shanti gita it has a critical analysis the key arjuna lost his son in the battlefield and getting depressed and find no interest in anything in the world and very restless so he went to krishna the lord krishna and then krishna is giving this advice to him that you know in this world there is no relationship up with anyone where we are we do not know how we are born into our parents we do not know and after being born then how everything relationships set up that also is mysterious and how these relationship also get discarded disconnected it's just like a as if something happening unknown we are all playing in a role and is telling arjuna let's see how we are born this body is formed out of some mixing of semen and in the mother's womb it goes and then there comes the baby it has no relationship with anyone but in this way the parents have started thinking is my son my daughter and as the baby grows have no concept he also grows gradually and thinks oh they are my mommy daddy oh my auntie uncle no relationship no one known each other but it started creating all relationships and as the sun go grows it becomes young or whatever happens to the child or the son we feel affected because parents my son my daughter and the child also said my dad my mom and this relationship goes on and when we die that also we separate out relationship is very uncertain and also we do not know what we go why the relationship goes away where we go so but people get bewildered in this way that peter mumma passang they get in a lovingly endearingly in the womb of her child in her room a child the recipient of all their affection is born this child is born out of the whatever is happening to the bodies and they produced and but the parents being deluded are bewildered they hold around the neck of the child and say my child my my daughter my son and then they get into the attachment there is no attachment before because there is no child what is the question of attachment but it came and they feel that connection now today verse number 31 we are starting there that same analysis is going on how much relationship we have with the world how much relationship we have with our friends and relatives friends then we'll list we know how do you get your friends you went to one school and that school some people came around your life they are my friends they are my friends suppose you had not gone to that school so you go to stanford and someone is going to say san francisco university they have a different friends because he was there he has friends different here his friend so all this friendship is on unknown and we gather together for some period of time and this once again for some time in a period not knowing what he came from and where do we meet you so therefore there is no connection or you know there is no connection with your son with your wife with your you yourself your friend all this you are saying it's too relationship it happened this way by ignorance by your mysterious unknown phenomena which is affecting your mind you are feeling that you are bound you are born you are this your son your there is not no such thing so this is a very starts inquiry into the truth so this 31 verse says who chant together manda [Music] [Music] you have any relationship this body also you you related to this body when in this birth if you believe rebirth and last month where were you who is residing in this body now you feel if someone says someone have named me some other name then what would have happened somebody says no some other name was given to me i will respond to that name so it is all fictitious somebody gave some name they say i think it is my name and what did you say about me huh did you talk about me i was hearing but if this is no no no i am not talking about you i am talking about service tarana oh oh oh that's okay that's okay so this is our fake situation in life associated with this name i am affected and if the name is changed you don't identify with that change you identify with that name then you would not get bothered so now they hate our samantha there is no relationship of your this body your body not the our issue no soothe not your wife or your husband as you are thinking there is no relationship it happened it happened in a coincidence or as a devotee we can say god's plan a divine plan it has happened so there is no such relationship not even with your you are crying about your son you lost your son but there is there is no relationship with your son it was not there in your life it came maybe at the age of your after marriage after some time you got that baby no and after some time when he grows and he went in fighting and war and this and that and he died so your relationship is most in the mind our relationship our identification is mine you will see we see in some some relationship which does not work with the parents sometimes in this country or in india then what you your parents i don't want to keep any relationship with you mom may say to the son son may say to the mother father may say to the son you are like this you don't change i am telling you do this is this it's for your good i have no relationship it happens actually it is based on some emotions and that come out of ignorance so passable being tied to in a bondage yourself but charmed you are momota you have been charmed that me and mine that concept has come so you have no relationship with your own body nor if you have no body relationship is so what you call superficial so the relationship with this body with somebody that relations will be more futile basically this identification with this body is a fictitious thing i i which i you are talking about five years before the eye this body is today the same body when you are 10 years old what is that body that time you also say i my body which body you are talking about what a fictitious relationship here so if we really vedanta is not something you have to search with somewhere else in the deep corner of some temple or church it is hiding there it is into our day-to-day experience look at that how foolishly we are talking every day and as if we are very intelligent people you every day boast about your ego or your pride your body your mind which body you are talking first tell me which mind you are talking about you have a baby mind when you are crawling in the floor in there mommy used to take care of everything no what is that mind now that mind is now your mind now no so what are you talking about i this whatever you see i they are not yours what the question my relationship this my table my book my house my car my son my daughter my husband my wife what are you talking about what relationship you don't exist you are changing all the time that relationship and you with that changing thing you are relating with somebody else by the relative my son my daughter my dad so don't mind because we are a very vedantic book we have to analyze like that but does not mean that you should in our practical life will treat everyone like a stranger not that but to understand we are connected with everyone with atman not as physical body flesh and bone not as emotions not as intelligence not as memory they are all fictitious the change change but the consciousness which is we are all one there so we should love each other because of the love of awareness of consciousness or brahman or atman and this relationship what we are building up it is like building a castle in the air this is to be understood the whole teaching of vedanta is only that is it not we are our building all relationship all our worldly attachment on something which is fictitious this is trying to prove this fictitious relationship fictitious language and you get bewildered yourself and you say i am hot i am wounded you said like that how could you talk like that yes it affects us maybe days maybe months maybe year we can forget that so this is the point to understand that this relationship is based on a unstable ground because this body itself is not me because body itself is a mass of change my mind is not steady it is a man it's the change every day it is changing changing changing you are becoming more intelligent than yesterday by reading this book by listening to this but hearing with this talking your intelligence is not the same yesterday intelligence so these are all fair because everything which changes is not real but there is a reality then then what is the reality that's the search of vedanta vedanta does not end in negation and zero nonsense vedanta ends in fulfillment and joy and bliss its analytical process is very crude and you can say very heartless we love everyone and you are saying that you are presenting our relation loving relationship like this we come to read vedanta this is the prada no that is not the meaning meaning is that you are missing what is your real relationship your relationship with everyone is very intimate very deep when you think that you are atman you are brahmana you are saccidada that does not change but what is changing you are wrongly understanding that is you and there you are getting stuck and then you are crying and weeping and falling in pain and agonies love our affection all the trouble comes there so this is guiding us to that conclusion you have no [Music] [Music] you have become enslaved stupidified by the attachment thinking my my my this my my my thing is very worthless today you say my my my and tomorrow you hate it the thing you love today tomorrow you hate sometime but you love with much affection after some day you hate it so this is the point it is all a fictitious thing it's my ignorance maya that's why the term maya that's a term ignorance is creating this delusional experience that it is true it's just a great example suppose you go to see the movie and you really got intrigued into the movie and someone is stabbing someone very severely very bitterly and you feel you are doing your facial expression is changing nothing happening it is a light and said play going on and you are seeing here you are sitting in a comfortable chair and plan or a air condition is there and your facial expression as if someone is hitting you why what has happened to you no one is around you you identify with that scene and take it to be so real and you then cry so this is the same thing vedanta will tell this is the same thing happening here the relationship the anyhow open it it can be kept open okay this is also ignorance play within play whatever we say we are in under the spell of this ignorance we call lovingly the great mother great mother's play mother dancing mother playing so this is the ignorance now now next verse 32. momata [Music] [Music] mura fool you are getting totally bewildered attached and stupidified how do joy it is difficult which is difficult to conquer this momota password there is as he passed against the chain of muhammad me and mine me and mine that is the chain and that has created such deep bondage in you so it is said that's difficult to conquer so many things are happening in the world we read them as the news even reading some serious news we smile and laugh but when it happens to my imaginary some friend who i have a relationship how relationship i have a college friend or maybe school friend or maybe when i was in some place i met some people something happened there oh i could not sleep last night because i got this bad news that someone is dying and this and that no huh how many people are dying you are not concerned about them you have mental connection created in your mind a fictitious relationship and you are concerned about one person if the death or suffering is the cause of your connection so many things are happening you will be connected with everyone why not so this is the momota me and mine that's why shankaracharya has quite wonderfully explained it it is i am this my these are mine this is the mystery ramiti this type of nature and local baba the human society human being are continuing this type of understanding and they are either in pain or suffering or joy or pleasure this is happening it is a very vedantic analysis so if we really that's why he said we understand this how many times we are reading this from this place this type of teaching is going on maybe last 80 years more than 80 years 80 90 years no what has happened we are remaining the same we see listen when it enters there it goes straight outside sometimes i think little bit it's so limited it has no impact again and mama me and mine i i said that i am that here don't know how ego me mind attachment that's a door it is difficult to conquer conquer this weakness the tides of minus me my mindness this time this is the type i have connected with me there is no no tie you love your watch and someone hits it then see how what happens it breaks your heart how can you do that no say a new car the whole car said in fire you don't bother but you have a car and someone put a little scratch on the car what happens you call police you will have to take action like this and that why they did it and why they broke it like that and so it is true but where is the bondage one day you think this is your car suppose you have sold it today and tomorrow morning you hear that that same car was vandalized so will be your problem anymore will you feel any sad no it is not mine anymore see as soon as you say it is not mine then you are free when you see me mine then anything happening there you are getting affected so it is really really mysterious thing if you don't think it is the intensity of attachment listen yeah if someone say that's yes my body master somebody said god has given me this body to work out some problem no so whenever we say our intensity of pain will be less this is an instrument god has given this instrument to find some solution of the mystery of life so this then i the intensity of ego will be reduced mindness will be reduced and that's why the holy people when they think of god god they don't think of the body anything happens to the body there is a common saying sami turiyanan maharaja used to say sami turiyananda [Music] and body and suffering let them understand their affair you won't mind keeping joy that means this body and its suffering is a physical thing it's not mine you are separate just you see that's why look at ramakrishna with that in excruciating pain situation he is keeping so much joy so a body is separated he is there in the body but he is withdrawn from the body not the body not he is going to sit and analyze that but he is established in that truth christ crucified and at that point he's not crying what he's saying oh lord forgive them so what type of peace he contains they do not know what they are doing a blessing because they have disidentified with the body so spirituality is the identification from the body be in the body but not of the body be in the mind not of the mind you have to use the tool so this tool has been given if the body is not given how could i get this opportunity to hear all these things how could i i have read this book how could i have gone to my guru how could i go i have gone to jairomatica holy places of pilgrimage ramakrishnan's birthplace how could i solve so many holy sadhus this is given an opportunity it is not bad but if it is utilized that way identification will be less and anything happens god's will god has given this body for the successful completion of this planning of god realization so i am here but i am not this it's the vehicle given to me alone the body has been loaned to us by god if you do every day you think that god you are residing in someone's house guest guest house you are a guest if you think that this body is like dharam salah garam salam is in roadsiding so you are driving long distance and so many stopping you stop and there you find one in so you plan but it's a nice place i will stay in this here and approach and get a room and then pay some money and then they keep you for several days you don't know so this body is like that a room given by god to experience something not to stay here forever because every day it is becoming old body old old body whole old old home older or older and it one time it cannot function so the idea is identification with the body it is the sud jaya muhammad apostles [Music] it is very difficult even for man of a human being what the even believe in surah but for the gods to to shave her this identification with the body is very difficult that means we have to do more sadhana more spiritual practice to identify that this body is not me is a temporary abode lord has given me to fulfill some mission and i should not identify with this body with anyone and entangle but you can make relationship with everyone not to be entangled but to be free how to be free thinking of god if you can see this is also the same god resides in everywhere so it is impossible to savor and it's also difficult to conquer but the tie of attachment this attachment with our body with our mind with our emotions with our ego so many levels of our attachment physical level attachment mental level attachment intellectual level attachment ego level attachment so it is all attachment and then connected with so many things every level we have so many similar objects therefore for both gods and humans it is very difficult to sever to separate out to cut this tie of false relationship mind again i'm telling false relationship this relationship which is set without god with anyone that's a false relationship and if the relationship is set with with god being the center then husband in husband is god invite his god the little relationship got to god relationship that is freedom you love a friend seeing god in him seeing guardian well it is a freedom but if we don't see that god into our picture then it is a real suffering very difficult to sever to tie the style to cut the style it is on syntax there is scriptural illustration that in the there are many horses some they carry load and they go one place to another the one man they may have 10 horses and they are going from one place to another place but they cannot carry so much of night time they may run away from one place to another place it's a reality then what happens they take a piece of rope at the end of the day after they are being put to line line by line and the owner as if he's tying their leg turns a piece of rope around and make a noise so that it means you are tied and you take takes out that row and does it the next so one horse another word his leg master with two legs they put a rope around and as if he is making a knot and makes a noise and when horse understands oh my leg is fixed and and the horse will stay all night like that they will not move imagination my legs are tied but it is not tight at all it's all free they play the streak with the horses who are carrying load from one place to another so we are also like that there is no time you know one days something we began on the song of sannyasia says there is no one there is no time it is accepting you you have created this mental imagination that you are bound because you think that you are this and everything related to is yours and someone is giving you pleasure someone is giving you pain but you are not related in that you are athman that's a freedom so it is impossible to save her and it's also difficult to conquer this tie of attachment for even for human beings not only human but even the gods and mohammed or you know you have become perplexed like a fool thinking that's my wife my child my family like that next verse 33. [Music] [Music] now this is the advice of bhagavan krishna towards you know who was weeping and sobbing and got depressed because of the death of his son of imanum he says this first of all thing you are not the body you are you are not this flesh and bone or the mixture of your mind and emotions he's addressing arjuna to give strength you are a mighty armed person don't behave like a what you call dull and weak personality come up your great powerful person almighty armed no you are not the body you live in the body but you are not the body i live in the house but i am not the house you live in your car you are not the car but [Music] yeah you are not the body then what the question of your son what the sun will come you are not the body your sun is also come it's a fictitious thing if your body you see it is not you then your son is also something which is imaginary now you have to renounce all these well how can i renounce it by discrimination by analysis by reasoning reason out this is the only vedanta path with reason that's why it is very dry many people love i love vedanta but when these things come very difficult it is dry where is joy you sing and dance ah krishna krishna krishna he makes finn joy and you are so discard this card with god this is not this is not it's hard dry that says how many people can understand i shall give you dry hard reasons this is the vedanta dry hard reason but you can make it sweet i can i'll give you dry hard visions softened in the sweetest syrup of love you add bhakti yoga here then it will be love we read the bhakti-yoga last 4 30 class so you add that blend together then this journey will be very pleasing pleasurable that's why very few people are really qualified for vedanta because misconception comes with the body idea india this is always discarding the body discarding the mind this guide your all emotions discarding your understanding cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut and then what will remain that will remain almighty armed you are not means you are weeping and crying for your son tell me where if your body is not yours then wow how the relationship with the body comes your soul where is your son then cervantes now you have to renounce it is not renouncing means oh there is my money one costly pain i denounce it is not like you cannot renounce like that here renunciation is analysis mental analysis you mentally analyze that this is all happening due to ignorance misunderstanding seeing things in improper way not viewing the thing in the right perspective that's why these are all happening all examples no all examples of rope snakes all examples of what so many examples all examples of so many ornaments and the gold not seeing the gold seeing the ornament cookies animal cookies all cookies animal cookies are so many animals and then essential material is the same sweet biscuit now ocean oceans and this so you see the diversity but the background to see together so that is the knowledge that can help us swarm so you give up all different types of your misconception that you are the body you are not the body you are not the mind so what the question of your friend relation your son who passed away who died who came in your life who was not there he came and he grew and then went into war and then killed so these are all analyzed analyzed analysis and renounce everything not only analyze bichara means analyze and reject if it is not useful then you have to reject that keep that which keeps you with the permanent reality and tell me the renouncing everything by discernment please realize your real nature swarupam understand what is your sarupo real nature this is fake nature fake nature is imposed on the reality fake snake on the reality of the rope but there was no snake at any point of time though you saw it so this is the mistake this is called ignorance this is kalavidya this is called cosmic play of the divine maya so being trapped into that but you can come out of it only by analysis by uh discernment that is given so that was the verse number 33 now you know after saying so much of advice but again as we are arjuna also said [Music] now it is very as we do all the time after a big discussion then we say you said all these things but but the question but but you have said all these things i do intellectually understand them but king korami what's like do the jo jagannath oh you are the lord of the universe [Music] my mind he is scorching in the fire of believement sorrow because my son whom i loved his khan i cannot stop this i understand intellectually but i don't understand i cannot take it in my heart that's not the problem for all of us in our life all this suffering intellectually maybe you may tell me it's a hundred things but what about your feeling i cannot get out of that i may reason out but that does not take away my shoka believement it is burning my heart and i am scorched by the fire of this believement why [Music] i am thinking whenever i think my son and his putra my son gunna his wonderful qualities how he was mighty person has good looking courageous strength of a boy of character so all guna and his activities it fits in the world and his extraordinary power which is shown in his work so this if i think and also rupa how beautiful was my son it's looking so nice so sweet you know i think of this and my mind gets totally lost so what can i do oh you know oh no krishna oh bhagwan the lord of the world universe please tell me what shall i do so this is the problem that's why we have to listen this means we have to listen it again and again before june like person such a talented intelligent all-rounder person who are perfect in the reading of the vedas and others in early days they take so much time again come back to same question as we put our question you said all these things i understand no but i do not know how can i not ignore my feelings my my my heart is burning in suffering and believement whenever i think of mind so it is a very realistic question no originally representing the question of us all we talk high vedanta but in practical life something happens where goes vedanta you go to into depression does not mean vedanti is wrong but only to understand i have any relationship with swamiji saying that if you want buddha or they said like that if you are not and renunciate or then if you do not leave your heart and home become a sannyasi you won't be able to comprehend the message of viranta or this knowledge so knowledge will come only if you become a sannyasi so does it have relationship because arjuna is not a sannyasi so that is why this knowledge is difficult for him to come comprehend no it is not that god and if you sannathi means what you are trying to define what is sunnah sundance is not wearing gerwa okay cloud it's not sannyas yes it makes it separation that you are taking the vows and you are planning but you are a student only no different than a householder but the question is that are you really detached i am not the body not the man are you established in that then if that mindset is there in the household or in the monastic life matters little nag recent examples of krsna's children they're all this brahmagyana no problem but thing is to understand what is renunciation renunciation of all our attachments me and mine and anything related to me and mine so that is what we are seeking is touching tracing so that should be that has to be taken care of okay is it it is so powerful machine okay sorry i am getting sometimes back maybe sorry anyhow so uh yes actually in real sense everyone will have to be so nasty monk mentally and until and unless you will not be able to realize the highest because holy mother said even the least trace of desire is there it will not enter into the eye of the needle a thread will not enter into the eye of the needle total detachment for promotion but means detachment in the mind not in the physical only if one has in the mind is also physical the best that's why we respect these sadhus who are wearing gheru or ochre cloth but if that external ochre cloth is not important it should be internal occur also occur so that is the verse says oh lord of the world what shall i do my mind is burning with grief when i remember the qualities and various activities and the physical form of my son of human new that is the situation what can i do so this is 34 and i will read another and then end today and for question answer he will if you have any question answer then we'll be replying that after finishing this next part 35 35 says [Music] [Music] praying bother me tell me the way way out the ashoka so that i can so commits believe me the stroke of subsides in me prasamati so machintha para manon my mind i don't want to think but my mind is dragged as it were to thinking of myself [Music] my mind is always engrossed in the thought of my son whom i lost similar thing will happen for a doctor god his mind will be saturated with god no or vedantic i am a student atman brahman the consciousness so he will his heart will be always filled with that but you know for this conditional genesis my mind is always absorbed in this sinter unconsciously my mind is dragged and filled with this type of thought you know engaged in thoughts in my mind nitam always do i is be patient or be keep myself in peace for a second no lovatic not for a moment i can keep my mind at rest lord you know the way out so please tell me you pile the way oh krishna you know by which i can shukha my show comments grip comes down it becomes perfectly quiet my mind is overwhelmed with anxiety all the time even for a moment i cannot hold my patience my mind how much actually those who know those who have lost their own friends they understand this any time and ramakrishna even he said when his nephew died how much he felt afterwards he said oh my god i have got my connection with my nephew i could not keep connection with my body it was beyond body consciousness all day all the time but he said i cannot keep account of my body what how much relationship i had with my nephew but i felt like a towel squeezed like that in my heart that type of pain and then he said mother showed me how intense is the pain of the householders who live in the household life no to show that their pain and agony so you can easily understand how deep is the pain and agony of arjuna being losing such a bright sun bright warrior and all with all endowed with all brightest qualities so that's why he's saying though you say all these words you know i understand it but please my mind is so restless i don't want to think but my mind is dragged as it were in the thought of my son his qualities his form his beauty his ability his characters and i am not getting peace so please teach me how i can make peace in my mind so you know as i can get appease my sokka and believe me that again shanti that is the shanti gita i attend shanti ayat in peace please let me know so we end here today 35 and we'll start from 36 that what bhagavan will start advising him that again those who have done before but again he will continue to give their lessons too because scripture say this vedantic truth is so so subtle that it is only one's hearing it will not do listening reflecting and deep contemplation again and again day and night to go on doing like that then only it will be settled and it will be it will take a seat in our heart and then we will be able to understand it is possible to overcome this by detaching or discarding this connection and understanding who am i what is my real nature who is my son who came as my son who is he he is also sachidando he's also in bubble he's got someone ripple in the ocean and the wave is down he's gone to the consciousness sachidan on the back why do we for whom do we and i am here now i will also go then i will march into the ocean so vedanta will say you don't have lost you have not lost anything you should not have any benefit you should not cry you should not weep that is the we'll get it more from shri krishna from verse 36 next time um [Music] that's is there any question okay as a student we can learn everything if who's someone's mind is uh very much inclined in analytical path and really it is also very reasonable thing you need not have to talk of high philosophy you need not learn any philosophy you look at your life then you will understand your body is not permanent and no one needs to prove it your mind is not permanent not steady your understanding is changing every day your ego pride today one time another day another time so see these are all flexible things you are not that then who are you analyze so this is not that any anyone entering into a university becomes a phd not that anyone entering into the vedanta study become a vedanta brahmagani not anyone entering into the bhakti school become a bhakta not anyone entering into meditation class become a yogi and need to be called samadhi to a student as a student we should study this and take benefit of this and the recent is this ramakrishna vedanta it gives us this opportunity to blend all this together so that your life becomes really a perfect blending and you understand intellectually you understand emotionally you're understanding you through your action to your all efforts in the life in the full yogi pan you can make yourself perfect huh is there any significance to us being attached to our parents or our children because if a parent wasn't attached to their child then they would just let it die the point is that you are right you are mixing two situations it is a question of they are not saying you be brute you be vedanta means brute go and throw your child throw your wife out hey you are maya get out then you have to first kill yourself you don't you don't you don't eat anything then you you're not not the body so why are you eating why are you showing anger if you are not the body so this does not happen it is it makes a loving person vedanta means is a perfectly loving person even ordinary householder people cannot love their child in that that degree because they see the consciousness in them you have to see in your child what is that child child is nothing but consciousness in one form like it is the example i as i have given ocean with so many ripples so many ways merely billions of people's waves did you see the ocean so one wave is there and when when you are living in that so long you have the body identity yes you would love your child it is your responsibility you have to raise them you have to take care of them but i know they are not the mass of bone and flesh but your baby is nothing but the expression of the divine so to bring that awareness is vedanta there is one question how to handle a son who is disrespectful and ungrateful that's a very really so so true what can we do yeah but you know as a as a vedanta student we will have to do this very in a major way see though the son is our daughter is not respectful does not listen to us that's true but if you follow vedanta who is my son who is my daughter such children plus name and form so sachidan aspect is there added with name and form in that name and form you see this difference his your son if he is your son actually he has the mind and you as a mother you have a mind so difference is happening in the mind mental thinking you think one way some thinks another way if your thought and sons start to tune together then you say my son is so good no there's no parallel oh he does not do anything without asking me and i like him because he is so good so i say arjuna his father is saying thinking of my son high my mind goes there because he's a good good son suppose the son the same son would not listen to anything of mother or father one day two days three days what happens then the relationship break you know so as a mother i would suggest what to do you love your child and give freedom to them whatever good you do and teach them a realistic point if you do this this will bring good to you i think if you do this it may not good good to you that's my life's experience and now you give the responsibility to the son or the daughter it is your thy responsibility you decide what is good for you i love you as my son i wish that you should be well established in life you will be in perfect peace and joy and to be established in life you should have to be careful about how you are moving this is my suggestion if it is good take it if it does not take it whatever your heart wants but don't blame anyone you have to feel the consequences you make a good choice you'll be happy you make a bad choice you will be suffering it is yours but with my matured experience as mother i would say my child had i been in your position i would have done this i would have done that so like a friend if you can teach your son that what is good for him and after teaching that if he does not listen make him a responsible person let him do two mistakes five mistakes not listening to you and do some mistakes and then you say lovingly again hey brother you my child i told you anyhow you did it good you got got an experience okay be careful next time like a mother affection you be affectionate all the time and see that the child is not matured you are mother now after so many years your understanding is different than that of a youthful person with just growing yes the whole world is different for a young man and whole world is different than like people like us who are running 280s our world is a different world how much blood pressure what is the sugar level what is the kidney condition what doctor told you are you having a really problem and you go to the young man the whole world will crush now he'll conquer the world i'll revelation i will write a book and change the world so this is all true so you have to understand these are the two states of mind so we cannot say it is bad but i would suggest to make them responsible is the duty of mothers and parents so please try that and if the son does not listen pray to god pray for the child and let him feel the consequences you have no control no one can can control the other you cannot control me you may give me suggestion if i don't want to take then your advice will be creating anger in me i don't like that you said me one day don't do this without giving reason or something you know i understand it's good i will do again you think i am lovingly doing no you are not laughing in doing i don't understand that and i will revolt against you i'll fight against you and then that is the bitterness created but as a vedanta student detached outlook god has brought me this son in my life i will teach him vedanta by making him independent independent thinker let him think and if you do this this may good may come this you do this it may not be so good i think this way now i give the responsibility on you you now be safe and sound and do what is good for you and you do mistake mister you win win good go on and support support support as a result he will not leave you sad will love you and one day he will understand my mom tells really for my good only but young people don't understand that so early is such an image and we don't like that what mom and dad always taught us we also did the same thing when we are like them okay another another question if i practice seeing sachidanan even in an evil-minded person who approaches to cheat me is it possible to stumble and make mistakes in the body-mind complex yes if anyone approaches you and cheats you before cheating you should text that person let him not cheat you anyone coming to me and a guide of a good man and wants to cheat i should not be vulnerable for that accepting that cheating i should have to be watchful observe what is the intention of the person why is so kind to me why is showing so much sympathy to me out of nothing is there any motivation behind it we will have to analyze that's the pedantic teachers everything put into the dissection table analyze cut open and see and then take your steps so saccidananda is everywhere but always remember sachitanon is covered with cloud the sun is all the time in the sky a deep layer of cloud comes and you don't say sun anymore you say oh today so dark sun has not come sun has come sun is always shining atman is always here be an evil person be a holy person be a educated person be a fool but only covered with ignorance so we have to understand when we interact with somebody that though he is sachidan and though he is god but he does not know that he knows himself to be what his mind is teaching him to be his mind emotions ego colored in ignorance he is behaving that way so be careful that's my request we'll have to anyone can approach and can say that i am great but his life should show it if you don't find don't be careful there okay thank you so thank you all for these questions and tomorrow will be gospel class i will take that gospel class tomorrow also thank you thank you mother bless you all and let our every day be a learning from vedantic perspective and let us face the challenges and solve the mystery solve the problems in vedantic perspective we detest
