[Bhagavatam 020 - A Guide to Liberation : A Son's Advice To Mother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9PnMqFFbMY)

let us begin this the wonderful topic algorithm and with this local Shanta booyakasha but the mana solution which wat arum gagana attrition me the Burnham Shuang Lakshmi condom Kamala nayana you give me the arnica myung Bundy business para salvar Luke Rica we are saluting that great Lord who will remove the fear of the worldly existence the worldly existence again and again the Hindu scripture everywhere will be going on telling worldly existence and this phenomena we call it world so that is the main mystery we are living in it in it surviving it our ancestors believed our next generation they will be living what is the problem with it so that is the spiritual knowledge we are seeking for the truth which is permanent and when we are seeking that permanency which never changes we find that in this world everything is changing so that is exactly what happened why this changing in the name do scripture whether it is approaching through the devotion or from the path of knowledge one thing always they will say that everything God has created those who are following this class regularly you know that we started in the second book 10th chapter and thirteen verse that the God the Supreme God he's making a wonderful decision Eco na na de amici eco one Nana tone to become many uninjured desiring Mayan we are not studying Shankara we are studying horrible death and there in the second book did you scandal and the sympathy I and 13 the sloka it says Maya bath Richard treetop the God is making himself in three different parts himself oh my this is the word if we can understand the Maya then everything we can understand but the problem is we cannot understand why the moment we can understand Maya there is no Maya then what remains the truth and nothing else so when we are looking at the one side and moving the movie that we are observing we see so many things going on happening going on happening with now happening and we are also in that suddenly they stop that light what you see the white blank screen and nothing else and similarly so many things are going on happening in our life and every time the anxiety what is going to happen next next and next right from our birth what is going to happen next what is going to happen is going on but suddenly something happened because of the knowledge we see nothing happened actually so that is Maha through the power of Mariana the God's power it's not our power God's power and he is deluding the whole people all people whole universe why on Nietzsche the justic heart like that I want to be so this is the beginning we have to remember that and then same supreme lord manifested as Mahavishnu the scripture that we are studying that is bhagavata in the Bhagavata the main god is the Mahavishnu the mahadji's with respect as a Bishnu and the B student created Brahma and that Brahma he gave him the knowledge also and power also and he asked him to create the whole universe different varieties you create Brahma started creating and Brahma created syama manu and satrupa we are not going to all the details we are coming to our main focus the copy the Muny and this it begins with the SIA home manu and shut aruba Brahma created them then he said now you have to develop the whole the human race and we find that how the first time a marriage ceremony occurred over there the third skander's twenty second or third fifteen and sixteen verses describing that we have already started attended the marriage ceremony the first marriage ceremony accordingly the whole thing's are coming down and you know that kardama and devotee the kardama was a rishi the brahma created out of mind cardamom and David booty was the daughter of the scion glance at the Rupa and they will get married the Hindus that believe that this whole creation is divided into four time zone the one is shut the Hyuga second is treta-yuga then to upper yuga and kali you some people are of the opinion that this is the Kali Yuga summoning no still it is coming with the we had at the end of the Opera but this moment we are discussing about the such thing what is the speciality mentality of the people thought process of the people why Brahma he was having so tough time he was a lawful creator he was greeting and then he was asking go and then develop this human the life and all but none of them you know that we have all the mentioned the names of the Rishi's and also the who even the Brahma created only one thing they were having what is that thought I want to realize the Earthmen and no other in present day bro my no problem he is now enjoying his vacation because all people mind is in the world they're so eager to do what Brahma wanted to do the now they won't do that was the problem and he was the first law and the Brahma was the first born of the Vishnu Vishnu created him so we can understand the power of Brahma but he was not having then he went to his son kardama son means he created him he said kardama why don't you marry they were booty she's a very fine lady and he will be very happy if you marry hard cut them out your father please don't order me in this way I want to be a monk I want to go inside the jungle that was jungle only everywhere but still then he wanted to go inside we are imagining I don't know he was not there that it was constantly the kardama the Muny he was telling no I want to go inside the jungle and return meditate now frames how many of us feel like that almost none only one lady rang me and I'm told I am disgusted with this can you please allow me to go and stay in your home at when your Ganges facility I told you have to bring someone and have to give in writing that we are not responsible what type of thoughts are going on we do not know suddenly is she thinking to go and meditate it is not so easy it prayer and the problem again so this the cardamom oniy constantly going on thinking now he is not agreeing to his father's word then ultimately Bishnu came and today I am going to be your son is it okay then what else kardama was retiring to realize the Earthmen and that art one has taken the form as Vishnu and seeing Vishnu is coming and telling I have purpose I had to take the human form and I have chosen you as my father or before either everything was fixed so I have chosen you as my father and you should marry devotee because I wanted to get hard as my mother then what kardama get you the car Tama agreed to marry and things were going on the discreet ascetic he was obeying his father's command but he always felt strong urge to go back to the forest the ones Kodama expressed his desire to renounce to devotee the mothers they are always attached with the family because they know the children their more love for the children and then all those things water you will do certainly we cannot leave and go but father sometimes they do and kardama was telling that okay you take care of your children and whatever the Brahma asked me to do I have done now I am going then the neighborhood the she told lamenting oh great one if you go away like this now your daughters will suffer who is going to take care of your daughters you have to give them in marriage if the father is not there then we will do that again if you go away there will be no one to give me the spiritual instruction to overcome the samsara and look at this as I was telling that subtle yoga the mentality the temperament the thought of always going to realization and Nazrul Islam in one of a beautiful poem that has become Essam also mentioning about ceramic ISNA shut the you give you know sweetie only quality Tomita Porsche oh you have brought that type of and a feeling of certain yoga industry yoga austerity thus Ramakrishna's austerity and you have brought that you don't want anything of this world where everyone is hankering to go to her name fame money position you are the one you are only crying to realize God you have brought the picture the idea that thought that we think about this after you such that you get Oona sweetie it is a very pure that thought you have brought in this world and here also we find devotee is crying too before her husband kardama who is intending to go away now kardama suddenly remembered the maha vishnu told i am going to be your son and if I don't obey then sir nothing is going to happen to me I won't be able to realize God I must have to follow the command of the god you know that when Shami be vacant and the wanted to go away and to meditate Salam Krishna told the keys in my hand whatever you are going you cannot do anything with the key is in my hand that all realization everything it is in the hand of the supreme god so kardama waited and then he consoled his wife by telling maharaja quadtree eaten at mana return MDT humanity actual government are doodled some property this sense to it what Gita Sanskrit a different revered Gita Sanskrit are more easy for the people so people they like to memorize that but what data but bhagavata Sanskrit is little different mark Edo Raja good 300l decent logical three princes don't don't do behave like this and you are not a helpless omen the lord maha-visnu will soon be born in your room as your son vagabond thieves Akshar oh now Raghavan the option he used the word action-y option because he never changes but even then he is going to take birth as your son up shallow so this is the way the wonderful way the always with a small little world did we reminding us that whatever is going to happen only Maya see that is why again and again it comes back he is optional he has no shut up all changes but still then he is becoming yours on and very some proton very recently it will happen so wait for it and then kardama instructed his wife to practice austerity to receive that purest of the pure the Lord of all beings so this is also in our society they always say when a lady become pregnant from then onwards she should constantly listen to the holy words go to the holy company practice austerity remembering God chanting the name of God why because then our children will be very good children and it is sure because when you whatever the thought you are thinking that would be the impression will go to your that's for sure and that has been proved again and again if we look at the parents of all these only people you see how good they were and that is why I always say one pre-show miracle to save those who are born through prayer they are the audience highly cultured people sensible people feeling for the others and those who born just for the physical craving an aria uncultured so this is the difference so the here it says now the Moitra mooney I think you have not forgotten him the Maitreya actually he was narrating all these things to his brain Vidura Mitra was also very close brain a better Piazza who has composed this and better pears are told the maitre and mentor again he was telling to Vidura and we are listening their conversation through another person sugar and the sugar when if sugar was telling and that other persons also went there and one pretty intelligent person also was there suta that sutra is narrating all these things so DC's jungle not at them it's just like a forest such the Jarl of muharram iam his goes on spreading spreading and spreading if you like to read all the scriptures and one of tena that the connection is so difficult to remember the whole thing so here the mantra he is telling the booty a presentation Gaurav in a Prajapati Samia certai a pollution custom opposite GU room now the evocati took the instruction of the cardamom very seriously if you like to have that Lord as your son you have to practice austerity and this neighborhood didn't started practicing very seriously and began to adore the supreme person Mahavishnu recently Yuma must have and see someone he has seen a very good another actor a writer of one of our Swami was the direct disciple of marshal of the money TV and he went to the mother and told mom suppose I am praying to you how I will know that you are answering to my prayer then the mother told shunt Anandi is not shunt the Rupa Chantal and very old firming I have not made him the shunt Ananda G was a very high soul holy soul he went to the mother and mother toured three days you should not talk to anyone if you like to convey any prayer to me and to get the answer to that prayer three days and nights you should not talk to anyone eat as little as possible and utilize the whole time praying to me meditating and me concentrating on me and then your reply will come I will give you the reply it's a promise only three days and here the day baccata she didn't get that assurance for the three days so she had to continue for your superiors for a long period of time but she never doubted why a great faith on her husband kardama muni and he she knew whatever the kuruma has said it must be true so diva hoodie he was practicing what who is the eternal who duster Hooters - means the eternal and the teacher of all the GU room we then absolute faith some episode they are some young stud tire would create field Raghavan Salam Krishna said in his Bengali Bashar's Allah to Vega if you can develop the faith then you achieve everything but the problem is we can never develop the faith all this some doubts LLL be there and sometimes some people they get some information and the hint that gives the the minds the solace that's good the field God said I am going to wait for you what is the problem God say at the tang of my date she will surely come Kaku Dharma will surely come I have taken the name of vagabonds Ramakrishna and every day every evening and warning I am repeating that Holy Name how is it that I won't be holding I will surely be that is called faith we have this type of thought for many other things but not forgot why because God never wants that we should have them we should develop that type of faith and if you once you develop that failed then you have think God never once that we should be free you should play all the time and sitting over there the guard is going to enjoy this so that is the reason the evocati very sincerely she was practicing and teacher of all the GU room with that guru he said neighborhoodie apiece and Asian's and they means the instruction goal of a in a Prajapati that Prajapati means her husband some boxer tire create field pollution pollution means death inside reciting the ins with in every heart called kirusha cutest thumb in ever changes of budget karoon guru means the teacher of the old world teacher of all and she started praying one day brahma and she knew everything sir brahma the knower of all realized that the great lord vishnu incarnated as car thomas son for the propagation of the philosophy of knowledge for the propagation of the philosophy of knowledge maha vishnu he has taken the father as a son of the cardamom and he has come to greet brahma has come the thesis the beautiful way they express the brahma came to greet and he was accompanied by marathi and other Rishi's he came to the ostrogothic are Dhamma and on the bank of the shutter Shweta D works this shitty River is no more in India but it was there there are lot many other references about the shallot roti and we find the difference in the bhagavata also this charity River and addressing his son the cardamom now the Brahma sake bida attempt yerucham about dhinam so Maya bhutanam Sheba deem the big Branham copy mooney in the third book 24 chapter 16 verse and very clearly he's mentioning to his son that now vada pav Bhajji Anusha I know there the Lord has true his Maya incarnated himself as your son incarnated himself as your son who will prove to be treasure of the whole world and this is the beautiful ways 8 beta hum our temper ocean Veda I know aha I know our dilution that the supreme being the first about Islam has incarnated somehow I am again that Maya that's why Shanter acharya when we are thinking that the Krishna also promised that I will become I will incarnate Shanker's didn't said no but he said yes eva he be eva as if God is not coming but his power is manifesting as if he is here evil you know any foolish officer having a symbol of the government wherever he goes is the government any government officers wherever they are they the representative of the government so did that way the God's power is manifesting in a form and we are thinking that God has come but it is truly that particular life through whom the God is playing this time the Kapila is nothing but the god himself so that is we find over here about the ingham saw but why in the bhagavad-gita Sri Krishna told to save those who are holy people so I I will come again and again to see those good people and also to punish the bad people here that other one is coming but there is no bad people nothing bad was there then why he is coming this is the question when the krishna is promising that i will come again and again krishna is also the same vishnu in the form of krishna and he is promising i will come yada yada either milani Robert of Arthur then I will come when there will be problem in the righteousness people are not following the righteousness I will come but why now you certa you got a priority wants to follow the the righteousness also the only then why then God is coming so he is explaining bhutanam shiva Dean the gum brick Branham Kapila Muni he is coming only to spread the knowledge the knowledge that he will give now you see that God Himself is coming and giving us that knowledge now let us go back once again it at the beginning God is creating this universe out of himself and after creating this universe he is also imposing different type of attraction through his Maya so we are deluded into the mind we love to hear the music and also visit different places and so many things check shoe karana Shiva Shiva top and all this way a good smell and the sound and the touch and all those things are going on he created a tool Maya nothing is there in fact in reality so this is the way he is telling and here we find now he is coming again himself as a teacher to give the knowledge and what knowledge that will come afterwards the knowledge of the cathedral and again it says are you seated on Artesia some car charge a Samana tava Loki Kapila Mediacom gonna party till tiburtina now the Brahma is telling to his son and this car Tama he said the leader among the main of realization gana a dish taken is not only God only gana means public and sister Anna the people loved were already realized among them history she is that master is the chord among those who have realized God and he has come Shankar charge a because his philosophy that is going to say Suman Nadal is the authority people accept him as the authority Suman adhara and he'll be famous Loki Kapila it taken the people will know in the world will know him as Kapila and gontar t guilty Burton and then he's telling he will increase your fame he was a very famous man kardama but though he never wanted that name and fame was a real guilty how see today even today again and again we are remembering kardama why not because he was a great Muni in those days through many great you knees were there not that he wrote many other books we don't know about that just because he was the father of Athena and by that way that your son will give you lot of respect and they cutiebanana but he was thinking by saying these he will learn him and say stay back in the in your home and look after your son but it is totally different kardama was very happy oh good my son will be very famous etc and here we find again the kardama muni he himself is a realized soul and he understood the real nature of God who had painted as his son so one day very secretly he was worshipping his own son so this is the beauty in the father knew who is this the one day Bhagavad see Ramakrishna is a small little boy that time he was playing and suddenly saw his father has made a beautiful the garland of flowers the father was meditating preparing himself so that he will put the girl to the God but that young boy he came and took away there and put himself and there you are shouting others they were scared my god his father's personality is very difficult to go and stand before him maybe he'll be angry but father didn't see anything why his father knew this boy is not any ordinary one the garland I have prepared for God and this is the God Himself was taken and enjoying so this is the realization otherwise that is why the God is coming to those people they will understand otherwise the ordinary people don't understand they will misbehave with them but this is the reason so again and again refine that naam the car Tama he is praying to his son Olaf Toa the one for whose realization Yogi's meditate for long meteors the car Dhamma is expressing I know who are you only to realize you only to see within the art the Yogi's are meditating for such a long time oh you have born as my son in our unworthy family only to spread the philosophy of knowledge now his father knew all this so he said you have come and he has a son and why you have come to spread the philosophy of knowledge the frames as because most of us we know the bhagavad-gita and it is oft quoted yada yada hi dharmasya even in the Chanti also there the mother is telling whenever the Lord's work will be necessary I will come but now we are reading the bhagavata which is much giving the account of almost said to you go well there was nothing no nothing wrong then why the God is coming this is very interesting only to give us the knowledge why because through that knowledge will go back to God again and this is the divine place sometimes we have observed that the young mothers they are letting their children to work just newly they have learned to work so somehow in trembling and working and the mother is constantly calling to me come to me come to me the baby is coming to the mother sometimes when the baby going in a wrong direction maybe fall and that immediately mother comes and put him in the proper place again calling come to me come to me from a distance sitting over there a man men say why unnecessarily asking that vivvy to walk she can take her on her lap she wants the baby on the lap and she can go and pick the baby but no this is because in the car love love for the baby but mother's love for the baby but mother wants that he should come walking on his feet similarly God has tremendous love for us why because he has created us the God has created us but again he wants that we should walk towards him and we neva this is a problem coming we are making mystic God like the mother coming and listening as properly again he is releasing us come come come you have to practice you have to go that is the why he could give the knowledge to everyone instead he has come in the form of the capella and giving us the what is that knowledge in the Bhagavata we find two types of devotion the Gianna octi and that ordinary acting that is emotional devotion and devotion wit knowledge however the gives the devotion with knowledge why should we love God that the Parvati is telling and here the kardama muni is pretty praising his son hola the people who seek spiritual illumination know that you are the glories and you are the lordship detachment Fame knowledge prize and auspicious nassif Sanskrit it says assured by Raja Yasha dianna Raghava and some fodder now when the people they asked about the definition of the God the bhagavata will see those who are having the six qualities can be called as God bah-bah-ba-wa Shariah Vidya Gianna Baraka Yasha Sampada now the kardama he is requesting his son very small boy he is asking I have a humble request to you and grant me a favor when the Kapila say what do you want you know what is he he knew that he is the god he knew the seeds say that God has come as his son and naturally I I want to go to God and God is here I can be with him no instead he said pari project bada bing cos theta Ohama shuo cover and the third book 24th chapter 34 verse it says pari project further beam are sita hong the shook-up cherish a I desired to take up the life of a monk the game come back to discuss he wanted to become now his father the drama he said no you have some special duty to perform you must do and I am NOT your father and you and my son and I have every right to ask you to follow even then you are stilling father please please then the Mahavishnu came he told I am coming too as your son he waited now that the Mahavishnu has become his own son and he came to that Mahavishnu and told I have kept my words now you have come now give me the permission to go why accept sannyasa one cannot get the complete liberation so he sees over here but he Bridget for the beam for a project but it remains the lungs are supposed to move all the time and father beam but the beam that is the thing that I want but he projected a beam must either I want that monk earth on the show cachoeira shape and I will have no other desire or be shoka no shoka no other sorrow in me I will never feel in that way so we show culture is she I like to move as a mom become a monk is really really as a blessedness but unfortunately some people suddenly they get this type of dresses and they don't understand what's the value it's a great way of grain frames I will tell you a personal story of my life I used to see my father offering from distance Namaskar pranaam to a person who was wetting their give you a clan and I was that time maybe 12 years old 12 13 like but inner inner in our locality in those days the boys and the girls is to go out and they knew each other so I knew that gentleman and thinking that father doesn't know about him other is to live in a different places so I thought that I should advise my father and tell what I told my father oh you are offering product to him do you know he was in the jail for some time now he has lost his job for some wrong theme that he did now he is putting on the Guru Agra though only to cheat people so I give that advice to my father and then he saved I never forgot what he said he said I am NOT offering for not to that man I am offering pranaam to that ideal that he is putting on and a girl that is sannyasa ideal then he said you know the sannyasa sana sananda sanatana all they were great sages they were sannyasins what is the sannyasa sannyasa means no desire except liberation no other desire except good for others so that is the sannyasa and that sannyasa for a long long long time associated with the give you a color saffron color so we neither we're even you see this saffron color you must bow down not for the person who is wearing maybe I don't know what type of person he is but just for the ideals so again and again I tell our devotees also sometimes the people get associated with one particular Swami they like him and talking the Xiaomi also visiting their house and taking care of their children so within a family man so naturally and those who are not doing that these are bad traditions is a good son yes you why because he came in and doing like this not like that please don't make any mistake in that Sarnia season hi Jules what is that ideals love and unselfishness and nothing else the pure love and pure unselfishness and nothing else and when you are appreciating that then only he will get there his father kapila's father he is again and again asking please give me this permission now the tree she made three she was narrating to be dear vidura again he is telling Peter Ypres city or a foreign or unnamed Martin political Shia thus mean Bindusara our scene Raghavan Kapena Killa again it is a third book 25th chapter the pit early process it they are only now as the father garden departed to the forest he has taken the sannyas and left Pavan Kapila in order to please his mother the duty of a son he is having their duty of azar pleasing the mother Priya cheeky Shia this mean wind stirring of our sealed Raghavan Kapila and then he continued in that Hermitage in that Bindu sir window sir is the place on the bank of the shalash wotty so he was having that he stayed with his mother for some time now here he was not practicing any ritualistic thing his father was doing the Habana and all those audience that was the system Kalina stopped all that he was constantly every day every time every minute he was remembering that I am the holy self I am the holism so no ritualistic thing thoughts no ritualistic do if you go to advaitha as drama this is a uniqueness of the Rama Domitian if you go to Belliard mark the huge temple not one there are three four temples and in every temple there are all our priests their worshipers sannyasins Brahma Charles every day I write from 9:00 3:30 in the morning that the door will open worship is going on till nine ninety nine o'clock and each and everything they might all - details they will perform the Duga puja is coming you can see that in the TV how they do but the same Ramakrishna mission they have kept one Osterman his name is a toy customer and that is in the Hamada now in the dog track and I think it previously it was a newbie now it is the Oracle and the particular place is called Maya body because a beautiful guest house they have developed you can go inside the a jungle of the Himalaya right from there you can see the Snow Peak that all the mountains everywhere beautiful the huge hill is that they have been given to the Astana but no worship no temple no pooja nothing is there whoever will go over there only to meditate and nothing else the Swami Vivekananda say there are only there should be only two levels you know usually we are having three levels physical level spiritual level and intellectual level physical level intellectual level and spiritual level the most of the time it is very difficult to remain in the spiritual level so our mind comes down to intellectual level so wherever you go you will see the monks they are not having anything else but books they're going on reading books and writing and these and they're only ponder because intellectual level if you don't have that then where it goes physical level now had to visit what to eat to whom to meet and all of those things will come so all the physical level it comes so you have to remain in this - and if you go over there in my Abbate they have a wonderful library and the meditation hall but if you feel that no where is there is no but devotees they go and there are some if you waken this photo they will go and throw the flower and sometimes they will go and and paste that sandal paste and all this and sometimes incense sticks they will do like this and from devotees and the emotion is very difficult then from distance the manager Mars which say enough enough man it's ok it's ok now we can stop it like that you will go on today this is advaitha it is our Kapila Muni we will study that Kapila Muni the philosophy now after maybe few weeks we studied that unique philosophy after Shankar Acharya sometimes he is very harsh and capella is criticizing the breda but at the same time accepting also because of the knowledge now he stayed over there one day his mother came neighborhoodie and said to his son how he is addressing his son you know oh lord I know you are dad who can cut the bondage of Maya devotee the mother and she is coming and telling to the sound I know you can cut the bondage of Maya because of the Maya all this problem on what is the Maya manifesting in the individual life home God that Maya in the individual life how it is manifesting wrong God aiiii right from the birth and what is this hi we are all dying because of the you know the families of the fans are breaking why because of the too strong eyes and the lawyers have any happy the more the ego conflict the lawyers are more happier easy as is fight fight we are there but why it is only we don't understand each other we cannot exist with each other the people are ready to leave with the animals but not with the human being why because of the animals are not expressing their ego but a human being will and that is the reason we have to understand that what is the religion for only to make our life happier how the religion can make our life happier if you understand that our main problem is the strong ego I know everything this is the best thing I must do it if you don't then go away go away and the other person also should say okay you also do like that let me also try in this way and that is what we are constantly trying to tell people this adjustment of it comes and that we can those who have read the life of Bhagwan see Ramakrishna Salameh Krishna was almost 20 22 years entered than the mass or the money day so if I just by age he could say to that young lady a shred sit over there and whatever I say do that but know India verse 8 then even in Bengali you know that we have the Bengalis are having three different way of addressing to e to me up knee to he means those who are very junior you can say three two in Hindi to me those who are like the husband do I must say to each other to me and friends also said to me and when a respected person up me the mother used to call ceramic isne apne and Saddam hottest urge to call motherís to me one day by mistake he said to e and he's Ramakrishna the famous man he went all the way to marshal the money Davis that caught the place and again and again said I am so sorry I never could understand that it's you I thought it is my niece has come so I called Queen please don't mind that was the respect for the wife if the husband is having that type of respect then only the love will come otherwise not and then what even the ceramic dish to sate mother is to follow but one day ceramic is not old don't mix with that lady she is not a good character and if you are talking with her people may misunderstand about you the next day's young Krishna told don't mix with that taught to heart but next dish young Krishna said mother restore the quitter again not ignoring but knowing that whatever she is doing is correct immediately the man likes the Ramakrishna immediately understood there must be some reason that's why she is behaving like this that's called no ego but self-confidence and here also we find no ego but self-confidence with this is the maya and this bondage of Maya this ego when it goes away what remains only God the today we will conclude with the one question that the mother is asking to our son she is telling G Garcia a hombro treaty Purusha nama Mr Carr movie dan burisch Tom she is addressing the son that an enlightened me about the property and the pollution was the per treaty the matter was a Purusha the spirit I salute the you oh great among the Knorr she knew about a son and this is also the wonderful tradition of the Hindus it never goes with the age it goes with the knowledge when even a very young boy with great knowledge can teach the others now this Kapila then now he will go on teaching his mother in the next days will read that Covina's and he was having some many sisters one sister was unusual have you heard the name on a show of the Kapila sister Anu sure may be many other ladies this ensures the sati do you know the words the sati sati means they have developed the spiritual power just following the duties that was given to them that's all the adversities very pure they will never think anything else and it sure was the Satine and about her it says that there was a drought everybody was dying and they went only told her to are not claiming other other monies that went to Anu schewe mom mother we are suffering we don't have the water can you please help us and the air you know in our scripture all emotional immediately they will describe a new shoe Assad for meditation brought the rain no not like that oh no schwa she inquired where the water source and met the tunnels brought the water of up there you can understand how thoughtful and active the lady she was a very strong that way and she brought the water into that place and people started telling her the she is the David the divine lady our problem is not only in India all of Europe a wool of Asia any good thing immediately they will make him as a god or goddess you know that immediately he was a politician he did something immediately they will go and drink and some people now in our India I found in the newspaper and there they have placed a picture of our president Donald Trump and they do not know I don't know whether he knows or not that fellow over there in Andhra Pradesh doing worship why and for some reason so anything immediately
