[Bhagavatam 079 : Swadharma Of a Sannyasi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2y53PBQHKM)

good morning dear devotees and friends to the sunday morning and we'll be discussing about the swa dharma of sannyasi that we find in the bhagavata particularly the part of the uddhava gita so let us begin as usual by remembering that all pervading god he is the master of the the whole universe sarva-loka so this god who is all-pervading everywhere so naturally cannot have the form the moment is having the form is it limited it cannot be everywhere so that is the reason god is everywhere in all being but why he is having the form because we cannot conceive the all-pervading consciousness all pervading caitanya serba chaitanya can he conceive can you have any idea no that is why the god is limiting himself and taking the human form last sunday we discussed about the divine life of sri krishna now this all-pervading god again came in the form of visnu those who are the regular students of the bhagavata you know that the lord vishnu he took that form all pervading god he first created the brahma and the brahma was creating this universe but then a time came the brahma had to pray to the supreme lord to take a form so the visnu form he gave him that this is the vishnu then afterwards the sun brothers the children of brahma they also requested we came and he said i am vishnu the all-pervading consciousness in that form that vishnu again is taking different forms we call abu taara abataran is descending coming down so that is the avatar and this avatara he came in the form of sri ramachandra he came in the form of sri krishna and in the 10th chapter we find the sri rama and krishna and details about the krishna and this lord krishna now departing he is leaving this human form the krishna form going back to the divine abode because his purpose was done dharma that was done the last message because this uddhava his follower his disciple his friend he only he said when you are leaving this earth who will guide us we need the guidance almost the same thing lord buddha's disciple ananda was asking the lord buddha the who will guide us then the buddha said atma deeper you have to be your own teacher here also we find again and again the lord krishna is talking about the and in the next class again we'll find the knowledge remember that you and me are the same now here when the uddhava asked how the society will run then he said that i have made the human life human society in a different small small group one individual life should be in the barnas and astramas the burner brahmana shatriya bhusha and sudra according to their aptitude according to their capacity they should work in different places of the society and society will grow and also the human individual life astrama one individual said 25 years the one one group that is first is the brahmacharya then the godhasta then the banana prasti then the sannyasi we have already started what are the responsibilities of a brahmacari the student life then the goddess the householders life what they should do what they should not do how their life should move all these then the third banana prasti also we studied this is the fourth stage that is called sannyasa this from the uddhava gita we found this the four astramas fourth stage now the question is the moment we say sannyasa it's a sanskrit word means samyak samyak means total nyasa means giving up you have to give up completely the people if you say you try to earn that is encouraging well you will get it you will you have to strive for it i can understand but giving up whatever i am having i have to give up that is very difficult so sannyasa life is really difficult because you have to give up whatever you are having i'll be quoting from here and there not the whole scripture so and there what actually we are giving up god i sense but can i simply say hey i am giving up my eye my ego am i going i am going out no it cannot be because the i is your identity i is our identity and we do not know where from this i has come and now we are completely surrounded by this i without i we cannot survive now we have to understand this the ego is very difficult and ego is making a division between god and me otherwise i am that i am that god so now the god says that you take the sannyasa this is the preparation and the technique to understand how to remove the eye the preparation began in the brahmacharya condition because that was the knowledge the god is everything and we have to understand that then in the goddess the life because that youthful life that is the desires are there they like to enjoy but then with the control you cannot simply do whatever you like sometimes some people think that i need freedom we'd like to do whatever we like no you cannot you have to restrain yourself not only from the society point of view but also from your personal individual so many things comes within the mind i have to control i should not do it that is the training in the goddess the period then comes the banana prasti after the retirement now you have not only the knowledge you have the experience also you know how things are moving when you look at your grandchild and the baby is crawling on the floor you know that this baby will stand up and will a young man then he will or she will do like this and you know the whole picture you are looking at the small kid the crawling on the floor but you know the whole thing that is why because you were there in that situation i was there in that situation so our experience that is called bharanaprastha and the banana pasta means withdrawing understanding that everything is going to change and that is the preparation in the bahama presti life traditional banana proceeds are very difficult but in the modern times the what we can do slowly slowly now it is mostly in the cities i have noticed the elderly people they are living alone maybe they are taking the support from the outside some people will come cook for them clean the but they live alone not with their children children they sometime come visit that's all so that is a unique way to withdraw the mind now i like to it is not a selfish life but understanding if you are selfish don't like to adjust with anyone because that is a totally different story but the preparation for the banana prasti and from the banana prasti to sannyasa means you love everyone you are concerned for everyone you are taking the care of everyone hey hello how are you etc i pray for you all things are going on at the same time you are not attached to that that is very important that is the preparation so attachment and detachment the moment you can detach yourself with those people and the things whom you like so much your preparation for sannyasa is ready and when the sannyasa we can one can take that is in the uddhava gita this is 18 chapter 12 verse it says it says when one starts feeling all the achievements due to karma as the suffering of health etc should burn all desires in fire and accept the monastic life when one start feeling that all the karma followers that i have done i should burn it burn it in the fire i don't need it i have written so many books i have given so many lectures i made that institution myself i did these i did that one person may do so many things and the people may be constructing their images stone images erecting on the street corners it may be there i am not attached to that i burn all my karma yada karma  issue bhipaka means the result the karma bibaraki issue location is giving up all those things means that is the sannyasa be raga be the raga raga means attachment beta gun no attachment not that i won't leave i will leave but without attachment again and again this little thing we have to put into our mind we have to understand this it is not that i should live in the beginning of the life of the sannyasins they go to a different place where the people don't know them it is better for them because that time attachment was so close now slowly slowly after 10 years they can come back into their own society they can live with their own people all around and asthma and without attachment that is the training that is the understanding so be raga be the raga attachment attachment has gone but things are there things don't change i cannot change my brothers and sisters and all the relatives how can i only my attachment to them has gone away and i feel for them as i feel for others also if they are in trouble i will also try to help them as i also the health others but no special case this is called b raga jayate then he as if he burns the whole karmapala and prabhajit he goes away into that monastic life and sometimes it is said as a spiritual injunction also whenever you will feel the strong urge to give up the family it is better for you to give up the family and go family life but we have to understand at least in the ramakrishna mission they become sannyasi those who are not married but if you are married you are having some responsibility just to save yourself from those responsibility you cannot no ramakrishna mission doesn't like that and they don't allow so once you are married you have to remain in that of course some of the direct disciples of bhagavan si ramakrishna they were married because as per the norms of those time just to get the the married within the ten when they are 12 years 15 years very young they never knew what is marriage but the parents used to put them into that but bhagavan siddhana krishna arranged in such a way he was the god himself so obviously he turned the minds of their wives also so they never felt bad they were rather happy because the joy within was there by the grace of krishna and some of his disciples swami vivekananda was completely bachelor many of them they never married so they were not bound so hareba birajid whenever you are feeling the urge i don't need this name fame i like to leave so that is it means take the sannyasa once you renounce there is no return to that you have to remember oh let me become sannyasi for some time and then again i will go back not like that in europe america sometimes they do nowadays in the modern society just out of curiosity everything just let me go and test it is not like that it is the promises for every life you know the promises in the married life promises sannyasa life promises you took the oath so it says and then it says that the the classification of sunnis are four types ata bikshunam means those who go for begging that is a very respected profession only for the sannyasins not for all a begging otherwise in the society is the worst profession we can say some people who are begging on the street or they have lost everything but the sannyasins they go to house to house five houses they will go they will ask for the alms and if they are getting whatever they are getting out of that they have to survive not sixth house only fifth that is all tradition atar bhikshunam and who are these viktors mukshar thinaam why they have come out on the street and begging because they want to get liberation muksharthinam there are four types kuti chaka the one who stay in one place means many udaca means water the uddaka one who goes on different places and drink the water from in from different place of course nowadays the same company the bottled water they're available everywhere so the same udaca we can say no it is not like that it is like the people who are traveling to different places another is hamsa and paramahamsa hamsa is an ordinary they are also the developed in spiritual life they can live in the world and also at the same time out of the world and paramahamsa the swan is a different grace so paramahamsa sannyasi they are sometimes they say yati yati means the end in sanskrit yati chinya is after writing the sentence when you put the stop sign that's called yati that means the stop no reputation so the sannyasins are also known as the yati this is the last birth they are not going to take birth again so the circle is complete it's called yati yati sannyasi paramahamsa like that they always ramakrishna mission tradition is the paramahamsa sannyasi that is the reason we live in the society we visit different houses family houses we take the oath that we will remain pure at the same time we will go and give that teachings of the purity to each and everyone so they are the paramahamsa sannyasis our tradition is paramount there are four types of sannyasins now the question is what is the duty of a sannyasi it's very simple dharma paalana and dharma shiksha now we know the duties and responsibilities of the brahmacharyans the main duty of ibrahim is to serve the guru he has to learn from the guru learn from the teacher he will never go against and that is called sandipan he was the teacher of the sri krishna and sri krishna the god himself was so humble to him so that is the way one should understand and this is the brahmacharya then gaarastha then banaprastha and sannyasi what they should do what is theirs their responsibility dharma parliam dharma they should practice morality and righteousness in their own life that is the first thing people are so eager to give advices but the question is do they follow those this is the thing everyone is so eager to give the advices give the lecture that bhagavan si rama krishna when he was talking about it master masha the recorder he said oh this we should go and tell the calcutta people that we should go and tell the people that image worship is not good worshipping god in the images of stone or the wood earth that is not good suramar krishna rebuked him and this is the problem with you people you have not learned properly a little knowledge and you go start bragging so one should understand that is why first is dharma pollen unless and until you are practicing all those things you are not supposed to tell it then come dharma shiksha what is the dharma shiksha morality and righteousness one person he came to bhagavan si rama krishna and started staying with him he was regularly following all the routines of the surama krishna and he was thinking sadama krishna will be very happy then after two three days sriram krishna inquired are you married oh yes sir you have children yes so how they will survive without you you are here with me know that god will look after surama krishna said no go go back as because you are married you have taken the responsibility of the family you have to go you have to earn and then you have to maintain your family that is your sadharma so swadharma is very important sometimes seeing the hmong so they are free they don't sometimes some people they come they say how you are spending your time whole day and whole night and day after day months after months how you spend your time you don't have any work well you can stay with us and see how you spend the thing is dharma poland what is that dharma swa dharma what is the swadharmap sannyasi we are slowly we will go to that that is the today we are going to have that now before we go for another discussion i will tell you a small story of a great sage he was from the christian tradition saint francis of assisi the saint francis was a rich man and then one day he saw the dream that jesus is asking him to help the church and he saw in the dream that one church is tilting rich man's son and he thought oh that means the jesus want me to erect the the church which which is tilting well so he started traveling he found on the top of a hill one church is really tilting and then he was a he had money he engaged the people they again innovated the whole thing met the proper church he went inside and prayed to the god and came out and said now whatever the duty you gave me i have done your church is now standing perfectly immediately the whole church broke down he thought what is it there must be something else then he came got that vision that jesus is asking live the life of a true monk so that the people will develop faith in the life of monks when the most of the monasteries what happened when the people they come and then they leave and they get the money from the society and they forget why the society is supporting them why the society is giving money to them then slowly slowly they become rich and when there is the gold there is other things also they started enjoying the life not even the colonel things maybe but still they forget to live a moral life an ethical life and that is the reason the righteous life so the god asks this young man this francis to leave so he went to a village he started practicing he elected a humble church but no one will attain no one is to visit the churches and why they are not coming he inquired and he came to know that they are very fond of marriages almost every day there will be marriage in the village and they are eating drinking making mary happy so one day he came to the villages and then announced i am going to marry three girls at a time people got very curious the three girls at a time he's going to marry so all they gathered in the church and that may be the first time all people they came in the assembly of the church and there he said my wives are and that is the true for every sannyasi poverty chastity and morality the organization may have the wealth and it is necessary to further work but individual monk living in that organization should always feel that i am a poor person i have not earned anything as a morsel of food that i gave twice in a day that is sufficient for me a simple dress that i gave sufficient for me so that is the poverty chastity remaining pure physically and mentally i am completely pure and morality whether people are observing it or not i should not do anything which is not monastic uh good for the monastic life i should not do that so these three the saint francis of assisi taught us a sannyashi should be very very alert bhagavatha teaches alert and careful about his movement when we were becoming the sannyasi we were the brahmacharyans there was a system i think still there that not a single brahmacharya or a monk should go all is either two or three why you do not know what is going to happen in the bhagavata there are stories there's a rishi stringer muni of course he was a muni he was not a sannyasi marisha shinga was a very pure of the pure and that the story if you are interested you can read i am not going to tell then the king of the that country he was not having the reign he came to know the most pure person if he comes and perform the yangya then only the rain will come and how to bring the pure person they came to know the rishi shringa is the most purest person so they send some of the young girls and all that so this is the way it always goes one should be very very careful a sannyasi should be very alert and careful about his movement where he is going that is the main thing about his food about his speech and should perform every action after proper analysis just out of emotion if we do then we are in problem the one should know there are so many stories in the sannyasin's life just out of emotion they broke the vows so that always happened just putting on the geruah that anyone can do and in our country particularly in india if you have some the long hair and long beard and you can put anywhere and now the girovas are different colors some red some these than that and good quality clothes so if they are wearing that and people will say he's a babaji he's a guru but babaji guru only out of dress just a long beard no this is one should be very very careful that's why in the bhagavad-gita in bhagavata also it says drishti putham the sannyash should leave friends we are discussing about the last astrama sannyasa astrama what is sannyashi should be he is the ideal for the human society a brahmacari then is the ideal the people always think that he is the ideal she is the ideal the nuns and if we are just putting on the dress and then cheating people oh that is the greatest scene so that's why one should be very careful after becoming a sannyasi what we should do we should be careful about it this is the this why what movement he is having about the food he should be careful and mainly about the speech it should not heart anyone through his speeches or unnecessarily encouraging in the wrong path now sometimes some people are having the tremendous control on the language so they can make the pond they can use the words in such a way they make the minds of the people mesmerized some political speak speakers are also like that though they are not good leaders can't do anything for the country but when they stand and speak people will forget all the difficulties and follow them so this is the power of the speech so this one should be very very careful when they are using the speeches are they going to get do any benefit to the people and when the people are coming to meet them with some problem if they don't know they should be very clear clear that i don't know i can't help or otherwise in the moral way they should give the teaching this way you should try so from the experience and it says and in the the one should be very careful about the food why in our belured used to say when a brahmacari or a young monk is sick then the elderly swamis used to come and instead of showing the love and affection oh don't worry they will say hey you have come here to serve not to be served why you should be like this the one brahmacari he was dressing the vegetable and you know in our country it is not like the nowadays the modern things have come it is very safe but very sharp razors were there and on that you have to peel the potato and it's so difficult and then he cut the finger and he was looking at the swami in charge and thinking he'll be telling oh you have cut the finger come come with the he will apply the medicine and all that instead he said i asked you to cut the vegetable not your finger you are an idiot sitting over here can't to do any work properly where you use your other and then all the thrashing why because you should be alert when there so this is one teaching a sannyasi and brahmacari must try to keep his body healthy and so that he can serve the organization and the people for a long time and this is another teaching is this means this word he should not think that i should have always the company but when the swamis are going some devotees they follow there is a different thing mentally psychologically he is always alone and alone means thinking about god the constantly thinking about god and not the maybe in the company of so many but at the same time he's completely alone swami vivekananda he gave a wonderful the way he described this when you can think that you are completely alone in the the bustles of the new york city i will appreciate and hustles and bustles going on all around in the new york city but at the same time when you are walking or doing some work you are all alone you are not with that and swamiji said when you are active when sitting in the cave of himalaya you appreciate the active means is thinking for the betterment of others praying to god for the support help of the others constantly active very much active so mentally so this is the sannyasi life that we have to understand ethan is not afraid what will happen to me when i am old somebody must be by my side nothing like that you have burned the boat at your back and hold the hand of god and go on so without the courage one cannot become the sannyasi and if they are calculating oh at the time when i am elderly some people should be by my side so i should keep contact with these people he cannot become the sannyasi sannyasim is carefree and sunnah she is careful about the god if the god wants me to suffer i will suffer the very courageous very strong mind only can become sannyas calculative outwardly they may be but real sannyasi never even care like that all india's are very much controlled and nishanga shanga means company nishanga even in the company of hundreds of people he is alone constantly his mind goes back to god and sitting on the lap of the mother he is enjoying atm that is in the 20th verse 18th chapter this three words he is very happy he's playing with his own self atma rather constantly meditating or thinking or concentrating on the self atmobine he is that cell now here is the question sometimes some people they think those who have realized the brahman or that knowledge supreme knowledge or the god they never talk with others they never do any work they're always closing the door and leaving all alone he went there talking they're talking to himself laughing just like that is a sign of the madness it cannot be the sannyasi it's a wrong thing to understand a rather exactly opposite way we have to think he cannot see anything but god in anything is a very positive way when a is preparing to become a sannyasi he should close the door he should be alone he should be lonely as bhagavan suramar krishna gave the example when a sapling is growing up you have to give the protection otherwise the cow or goat will come and eat it the wind the sapling is grown up as a tree now you can tie a elephant into that nothing happens the strong tree the sannyasi life is like that and paramahamsa sannyasi are your standard and in that case he is not talking with anyone avoiding everyone that means something wrong understanding sometimes some organization if you go they won't talk to you they have their people volunteers or devotees or the paid people they'll be talking with you and all the sannyasins not talking they're all why not nothing wrong you have to see god in everything some people say women should not come humans are not allowed what is the difference the same god has taken in the bhagavata itself the god made himself in two different parts one became a man another o man it is there in the bhagavata the woman is also the part of god half part of the god and how can he say no we should not talk to the women we should in the beginning it is okay but after that all through your life if you are practicing in that way that means you are not strong enough the mentally one should be strong art whatever i see is the manifestation of god different type of people some are so good some are so cruel some are very tactful okay i understand but at the same time i behave accordingly that's why suramar krishna and mother both suramar and master of the devi you have to be it according to the the nature of the person and according to the situation so why they are teaching because atmo but at the same time i know this tiger is also is nothing but the same god but i cannot go and embrace the tiger i know this person is also the manifestation of the same god but i cannot but he otherwise in the externally is a very bad person i cannot go and make friendship with him that is there at the same time i see the god in different form and i enjoy bhagavan's ramakrishna he was traveling in the calcutta street and there is a part in the city there's uh there the ladies they were in different dresses they were there they're the prostitutes and the devotees were closing the windows of that carriage the salaam krishna should not look at them but sirama krishna opened the windows and he was shouting oh mother you have dressed yourself in these different forms and you like to enjoy oh good sriram krishna didn't see any other except the mark ali so that is called atma kilda at maratha atmoban according to the situation or otherwise everything are the same so samadar the same sightedness that is also the sannyasi if a sannyasi discriminate oh no he is not my follower so i don't like to talk or encourage them oh they belong to that group i don't like to go over there he's not a sannyasi it must be shana whoever comes to him is a god coming in that form friends to maintain the standard of spirituality is so difficult so sannyasi's should purify his mind by constantly keeping his mind on god purifying the mind there are two things god and god's creation i always say like this when you are putting the mind on the god's creation it is becoming impure why because there are different type of things are there and you'll be diluted but after that it is all temporary just like the beautiful shadow and if you try to catch it you won't be able to hold it so you'll be tired so misery will come that is the that is the reason they say go to god one little girl she was playing and she was trying to catch her own that shadow but she could not catch it and she was getting the irritated and she was crying then the elderly person sitting over there nearby told uh sweetie what do you like to do i like to catch my shadow but it is not stopping whenever i am running it is also running away then the gentleman told why don't you sit over here keeping your back into that light you sit and you see your shadow will also sit with you then catch it touch it so you have to make in that way i am running after the world and the world is also going away i can never hold it so let me see it and see oh this is me only so the god realization should purify the mind constantly keeping in mind on god he must leave a secluded and congenial place he should leave if he is leaving in the marketplace constantly different type of things are going on and mind is very difficult to calm down so sannyasins after the they'll be going to the villages and narrating the bhagavata and then they will return to the temple in the village side almost every village there will be a temple he goes to the temple and then take rest so that he should not be into that the places the marketplace or the places where people are there param she's free from any formalities he moves around without any formalities sometimes some people the inviters and when we were young just joined we never knew the one day myself and another elderly show me we were doing the swami passed away and he was in ramakrishna mission instead of gold park we went to the place in murshidabad to give the talk i was a brahmachary that time and one lady invited us to go to their their place for breakfast both of us went over there and after the whole thing was over then the swami told they have give you gave you so many things so many items you have enjoyed in exchange what you are giving i thought because i was not that way properly trained i thought oh i should have brought some gift for them i told swamija he was not knowing otherwise i could bring two three books for them or taku's picture no no they can purchase and look at their library all books are there what you like to give to them second time also i couldn't understand then third time i understood i have to give them some spiritual appearance and then he said yes and how you can give that by praying for them so whenever you are visiting some householders house not that you have to take some gift for them the other people are taking so you are a paramahamsa sannyasi you did not to carry a flower bouquet oh it is your birthday this is my gift nothing like that you go there but you have to pray and you have to share your spirituality with them those who are reading the biography of bhagavan krishna those who have read you know he used to visit so many people but he used to go and bless those houses households so that is the one one thing he should do and behave like a pure mind child though having knowledge of atman all the time very grave face the i have seen god i know about the god so don't come near me like that most of the people they do try to do like that that is i don't know maybe they may be real but according to the scripture no it is not necessary that means you are trying to show up and when you are showing up that means you like to impress people people you like to impress this whole world is temporary whom you are going to impress and if they appreciate oh this swami is like this he will not do not do this not do that all that is not the pure sannyasi life he'll be just like the child happy simple and not only that when the people are insulting even he will say nothing to them rather he'll pray for them once again go back to suramar krishna he was invited by a group of people but they were not aware about sirama krishna suramar krishna was sitting in a corner of the room and nobody was inviting him to for food other groups are going and sitting and you know in india if you have visited you know that you have to make yourself in that group otherwise it's very difficult but krishna now and then he was telling what is it they are not calling us unless they call how can i go then his disciple he was also the son of a very rich man afterwards he became very famous hmong swami brahmananda so he was there and young man he told let us go back the salaam krishna told no we cannot we cannot who is going to feed us in this night there is nothing left over there i we have to eat here then ultimately the owner of the house or any the family members they didn't come they only said they met servant to serve some little food salam krishna touched those food and blessed them not that he was eager to eat he only wanted to bless them i you have invited me for food then you have forgotten but the sadhu should not take anything in the against them so this is the sannyasi life the sannyashi should not afford the ritualistic part of the veda tashanashi is going and doing puja most of the time the people the thing sunnah she should go and do this puja and this that so nations are not supposed to do so they don't understand sunnah says life are completely different maybe they will that offer some flower to god and show a little light that's all and there'll be rituals that is not your nation's work that is for the brahmanas they should do go and do that so sannyasi's lives are totally different sometimes when they see do not understand so bhagavata they are giving this teaching and uddhava he wanted to know very specifically from sri krishna what these people should do and that is the step-by-step he said asanashi should not insult anyone and must not do any harm to anybody should not do any insult and must not harm anyone this is a great teaching so much of restraint so much of control is necessary why because sannyasi is aware what about if this line if this teaching is not there in the mind how can it be a s that atma which is the supreme para para means the supreme if that supreme brahman is manifesting in every being how can i insult so that is the teaching one supreme self alone dwells in the bodies of all being and in one's own body how can i answer people don't understand but one should not bhagavata is careful about the food for the sannyasin and it says to save the the life one should eat and they should go out to collect food why without food that your health will be weak and naturally mind will also become weak and in how you will do the work god's work the strong body is necessary swami vivekananda when the monastery was set and he said that each and every individual monastic should perform at least one hour physical exercise to keep the body healthy ma sharadamani devi those who read that biography of maharada then she went to the kuala para very close to the jarambati and there was a asuma and one swami was there with some shaun nations and brahmacharyans but he will never allow food to those people to save money mother went and saw these young boys they are working so hard but the food is nothing and the swami told no they should practice austerity the mother is mother and she's so clever she didn't go for any argument she said see you cannot offer only one item to bhagavan sriram krishna apart from the rise you have to prepare minimum five items to give to the god and those items should be cooked with a and a big number so they all can take the prasad from then onwards those young brahmacharyans and swaduz the monks they started getting good food so that is also necessary most important in sannyasi life is same sightedness the bhagavata 37 words it says no biker there is no another thing i said i don't like this so i can like this no it is not it's only god the sannyasi is constantly aware that there is only one god and he decides in everything no biker there is no alternative so that summers same sightedness oh i am a hindu i am from india i am from these some people they come and they talk like that so we don't say anything but they do not have any idea and the next live you may be somewhere else god forbid today you are so proud that you are from the holy land is that and next life do you know where you are going to born so why you are so proud of it brother utilize so the sannyasi should not discriminate this is the most important things but how is it because his life goal is god and god is all srimad-bhagavatam because how he will be same sighted mad bikshaya he sees me in everything that is the reason many of you that you're seeing the evening prayer the bikshani mahojai swami vivekananda composed that song every evening all over the ramakrishna mission they will be singing and the one sentence is there bikshani mohoja the moment the god just a glance if the gods grace come on you a glance on you all your delusion will be destroyed otherwise not smriti said friends i i may take another two three minutes hard to conclude this one the smriti said that every sunnah she has only four things to perform regularly smriti it's not shruti sriti means the veda smriti means the supportive books sunanam shocham tatha viksa these are the four duties one should perform bathing cleanliness and collecting food and living lonely these are the four things one shannashi should perform panchama there is nothing as fifth duty someone said and you know these was practiced for thousands of years by the thousands of sannyasins they won't do any work but they are taking food clothing all support from the society but will never do anything for the society swami vivekananda went and saw the one swami is sick he is tormenting he is in great pain another one he is meditating by the side of the river swami you told won't you help your brother he's suffering there that is his karma i'm not going to hell my duty only to bathe and to keep my mind clean and to collect food and living alone that was the concept of the sannyasin but swami vivekananda broke that that is the great contribution of swami vivekananda and sirama krishna he broke that smriti and reset the motor swami vivekananda said i will give this mrt and he's reset the motor of the shandashians what should be the goal of a sannyasin four elections no he said she should strive for one's own salvation and also for the betterment of others through the ramakrishna mission developed schools colleges dispensaries hospitals and conducting the relief works why because you go and see god the living gods are suffering that is the reason the ramakrishna mission they do breaking the slumber of the thousands of years the fourth asama the sannyasis stage is now rising up the concept of living alone and trying to see god within developed a kind of selfish unsympathetic human being bhagavan sirama krishna given new light if you can see god by closing your eyes can't you see god by opening your eyes gave the path and he said go to the villages serve the poor help the downtrodden and be free that is sannyasi friends i will read the one the verse a poem from the song of the sannyasins it was composed in july 1895 at the thousand island park new york the swamiji said quickly i will read from here wake up the note the song that had its birth far off when worldly taint could never reach in mountain caves and glades a forest deep whose calm no sight for lost or wealth or fame could ever dare to break where roll the stream of knowledge truth and please that follows both sing high that note shannash in bold say um thus day by day till karma's powers paint release the soul forever no more is birth nor i nor thou nor god nor man the i has all become the all is i the bliss no thou that thou art that shandash in bold say um so this is the sannyasa astrama should do thank you very much asking what is the difference between dharma and dharma and swadharma that is a good very good question dharma in general if you have heard this bhagavata discourses then you will find that the sri krishna himself is telling all the things that all the people should perform the four awesomers all the four astronauts all the members of the four astronauts they should perform these these these days but again specifically for the sannyasins for the greyhouse these for the banana prastis and for the students brahmacharyans is separate so swadharma particularly that period of time you should perform and dharma that is you have to perform in whatever group you belong dharma and sa dharma that means there is no object so when you can merge the mind in that supreme con consciousness it's called nirvikalpa and swabi kalpa means you are again concentrating completely merging into that but with one object maybe it is omkar maybe it is the form of a god or goddess so that is called sabi kalpa and nirvikalpa while cutting something wouldn't you feel sad and disheartened when the senior teacher scolded him this is the teaching see not that the senior swami was not having the affection he was having the affliction but he scolded because you know it's like the the military training it's not like ordinary the military training the military people they have to be like that not that the teachers are ruthless but they give that impression so that they mentally they become strong now for us also we have to live all alone without any support god and me and no one around so i have to be conscious i have to be alert so that is the way they teach but they have a lot of compassions yeah so the next question was from yes we do ramakrishna mart and ramakrishna mission there are two joined organization so with the same xiaomi's they are in the modern the mission you know the mission means because of the legal thing so if you are performing some social activities you have to register to the government and should be responsible for that but the mod is not like that in the india the hindu sannyasins are having their own astronauts and they are not responsible to the government to give what they are doing and not this is but the sannyasis can visit and we do visit the householders houses so i think thank you thank you for the good questions and let us now chant this mantra and we conclude foreign um
