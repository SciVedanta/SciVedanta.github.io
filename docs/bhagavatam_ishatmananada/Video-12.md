[Bhagavatam 031 : The Soul Of Bhagavatam](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRcyMprw3pk)

after a two months the gap because of this tremendous the for disdain particularly here once again coming back you didn't know this beautiful scripture of the Hindus which is the combination of the Guiana and octave this is a speciality of the Hinduism the Guiana and the of T that has gone side-by-side formless god and god wit for so that particular scripture is bad order we are studying the reversal from the last year or 3d now if you wait a few months we have to drink this and then complete so let us begin with this thus total shan't sedation's government operation made should I said 300 a Lord Vishnu he is the matter is the master of the whole universe server Luo quick not the master the whole universe in last November 2018 we have discussed the third scandal how the jivatma the individual soul was created I want the ball it was created this jivatma and when the Guru sure the Supreme Being in is influenced by the qualities of the property nature she was overwhelmed by egoism the Omkara and that is jivatma this is a the bhagavata it gives the explanation how this individual self came so when we discuss about the spirituality the always rating we and then god these are the two now our relation with God and what we are we are the jivatma who created the Lord Himself how he created that the bhagavata says the Lord came in very close proximity with his own power that skull bracketing the name has been given that is the prakruti and the probability is having three qualities shatter a giant Amma and then the Lord is coming the consciousness is coming to the proximity of that immediately the it's changing and that becomes the jivatma and that is the ego when he says the eye a cheerier Shankara in his beautiful book the vivid to Romani is a the greatest book of the Vedanta and he says with a sloka 184th he's describing the big t annamaya kosha you know that the human being the Balanta they say we are having different sets the cautious cover and the satisfied on no Maya Manu Maya pranamaya then began ah my honor the way I am NOT going to describe all those and are beyond this on the Maya kosha is the supreme self the puncher coachable action Atma so beyond that but let us only concentrate on the big Jeremiah kosher and what is this big annamaya kosha Shankar said it is the combination of the booty the minds determinative faculty and they are combined with the organs of knowledge I repeat the booty which is the determinative Faculty of the mind it is not mine is the one part of the mind which takes the decision and those who are attending again and again this baton the class you know the mind they are segregating in four mana would teach it ahamkara the mana is that we cannot take the decision that part of that and another part of the mind which can take decision is booty cheater is the storehouse ahankara is the force that acts these are the Total Recall mana and in English we translate month now we're from this Jeeva the Hawker hurricane that they are explaining in the began Amaya kosha which is the booty reflected by the consciousness and associated with the organs of knowledge that is the big annamaya kosha put the associated with the five organs of knowledge and then reflected by the consciousness please armed guard bhagavata says win that consciousness which is the supreme pooja comes very close to its own power then it starts changing in power the property it starts changing then comes the jivatma and what is this jivatma I sense the moment of our becomes it is separated from the God so that we it goes the knowledge saith the big annamaya kosha extremely urgent wing to the close proximity of the Supreme sir however the author says very close proximity of the patottie so the supreme self the god is coming to the property very close and it is taking the form and I say I hear also day it is the superimposition of the underserved then the again just to understand this particular point very clearly because what we are that we have to understand according to however that the Supreme Being the Purusha come close to the property its own power and gets activated and the Saints the Omkara evolved and the deceiveth ma Jeeva Atma the we say that it is individual self and the same creation is again explained by the Vedanta how pure consciousness reflected on the intellect booty which is associated with punch again in 305 organs of knowledge it develops I and that is the ego and the rest apartment so this is the jihad one now if we ask we have from this prakruti king who created the property this phenomena then it says three different views very extreme operating they see but length like the Ostrogoth Kragh or the Gudivada this is there is no creation at all don't ask this question this is no creation at all it is nothing but your illusion that is called a chart of Arda it is not born at all why you are thinking about it this is very difficult to understand why because we feel that we are and this world around us the one gentleman trying to contact me from faraway place to give the information he's left a message that he is going to have a grandson so he's so happy this is the life this is obviously it is there how can I deny but at the same time we cannot say that they are false they're untruth the goal of other ashtavakra they have also understood and that is their level of knowledge and where they don't find anything in this world now when we were before the sannyasa what was the dream to become someone took our money to purchase a good car and these and that is all then something happened it became sannyasi and after the training and after association of these we always feel why people are wasting money on those things so the same person the idea is changing rivers are changing conceptions are changing wife experience knowledge is I feel more comfortable all alone sitting for meditation reading holy books and great joy comes from that as someone to do the same thing it will be a punishment for you why so that is the standard after Xiaomi Vivek on the side we are traveling from the lower truth not false lower truth to higher truth is all experience so a jihad to bada is an experience which at this moment you won't be able to understand this is one thing second Shankar Acharya understood it so the Vedanta that you study this all shankara's Vedanta and the Shankara he understood that all these people won't be able to understand this high thing so he said Maya order and in the Maya sister is the creation of the illusion yes it is there as long as you are under the spill of the Maya when you go to observe that in the magic show as long as he was sitting before the magician you never can think that whatever he is doing our whole illusion thing it is all true he's putting a girl and then cutting the whole body into two parts and it's terrible we are thinking what he's going to do then the girl comes up and say hello and we think oh my god how could you do it and he showed that a tab which is nothing having nothing just a gap Act and then suddenly one pigeon comes out of that and we say old and weak lab and say very good but all illusion everything is we are singing looking at it understanding in trying to understand how he is doing it but that is happening just before our eyes even then there is true what we saw is not true so that Shankara say is like that what you see what you touch what you feel this world is nothing but that illusion this is the Maya model Maharshi made of the earth he thought that too is difficult so again they are coming down and adjusting with our understanding when you go to teach in the class for standard or great of I ever sings a great scholar how you speak so that those children can understand what he is telling then he goes to a college then the university tell you that Assembly of the scholars the different type of terminology is different way of explanation so the gradation it goes we are children in this world of spirituality we do not know anything about so we are only thinking me and mind and think we should go to God and we should pray to God and so that we are protected that is the basic thing in every religion everywhere they are only thinking in that way so be the basher super smarty sukshma subtil the subtlest of the subtle truth he is for the interest of the ordinary people he is making in the bhagavata the formless taking the form and he gave the name Vishnu and this Vishnu in according to the rod Hibino Dashami great scholar the word mission means be whistie profit of profit on sarvam but no thei ET vishnu his covering barakatuh up rockateur manifested unmanifested everything is covering and that is called business now most of you have great issue Phoenicians what is the first words of the ship initial he shall wash em me done Sarah Verma what's the difference between bhagavata and began to them see you think this is the beauty of the indivisible they are presenting the same tool which they are not changing at all presenting the same truth but in such a way so that we can understand so now in the Bhagavata the beta players are presenting their all-pervading consciousness in the form of Vishnu we will come to that and today we are discussing the soul of Adam Adam bhagavata from 1 to 9 all the standards 9 skander's dedicated to Vishnu and also the devotees of the Vishnu like Prahlada and all others and you know in the beginning we have already discussed the Bhagavata Purana and Ferrara has a characteristics we don't understand some people has written two pages story and then another person has written nearly 500 pages story and it's a story no result difference is there in that there are differences are there coupon Miasha we call and then the same way the pedometer is a piranha and karana is having ten characteristics we discussed that in the beginning so that ten characteristics are present in this book then only it has been accepted as a piranha and this here is representing the formless consciousness as the form and that's called the Bishnu it is manifesting again if we ask what is this Vishnu so let us go back to the sugar they were the that son of the Veda bears you must remember the sukadeva the great sage and he was narrating that story he heard it from his father learned it from his father and then from his own realization he made it beautiful conviction and he is now letting it to the gathering of the congregation of many various ages so that sukadeva is now narrating and sugar saved it is the eighth book it's Kanda fifth chapter and 15th verse he's sitting a incident happened Indre he was doing along with his element an introvert drunk the most of the time we find in the this drunk so he was walking and suddenly he made it he she do bossa do Russia usually he never talks with anyone but that day when he saw the Indra below this man is coming he is maintaining all this administration so the dude worship was having a very costly girden he opened it and gave it to Indra in there was in a different mode he never recognized that and he threw it on the head of the elephant but the elephant also never liked it he took it down and stumbled on that fast on that and you know to gosh our Indians knows this name and they will never keep this name to their science they never say why very short-tempered tremendously powerful spiritually but very short-tempered and immediately the worship caste Indra oh so much you are thinking that you are the lord of the gods okay all the gods and all these that you are having everything will dry up no one is going to recognize you and later suffer do Russia give this curse and I have to go in the new in the team came in senses oh my god does a mistake I made then immediately went and called you know that anything happened so immediately other ministers are called and they will be discussing so by you and the Surya and all they came together and this what to do one mistake has been done the only person can hit helpers it's a drama that they went to the Brahma and Brahma was in the amount mailroom look at it they are giving the name of the place and the person and the incident we cannot simply deny it there are some like that there are so many indras injuries opposed so whoever will be capable for that post is like a prime minister of the president so in there was a post so Indra thought that I am going to use this post so he went to drama and requested him to save him and the Brahma medicated and he found this a bad time is coming for the dealers they said no I cannot help you it is not possible rather let us go to the Shiva that tomorrow is the shivaratri the Shiva the lady also him come and together we'll go to nourish Abbado nerection you know cook shaneoh a denier of sharra Pattabhi serger sthiti Sonia Martin got the Raja SATA Tomasi Kali is the it's Condor of chapter xxii verse he says let us go to him from whom everything has come and only he can who is the creator of me myself and also the prajapati's the Devers assurance and data born of the wound garages eat under a sweet sweet adjourn and germination from the seed good BJ and this is the four types of the creation so all is coming from him and you know what this supreme being is some other if T is neutral so we have to go and you have to tell him the somehow that I made a mistake then only because of the symmetricity he said there is none whom he cares or destroy or protect or neglect or welcome still he assumes the qualities of sattva Raja and Tama as the time required for the preservation creation and dissolution of the universe now be the hunter says everything is coming from that Supreme Being but coming through Maya it is not actually created bhagavata says as because we feel that it is actually created so that creation is coming from the four different ways and created by the Supreme Being and so we can feel we can associate with this idea and it becomes very easy so he will ultimately give us that this is the way you should try to pray then the Brahma the Shiva and the other all gods they all went to that Supreme Being and how is that pleased with the supreme being recited now for the Brahma they say is a man who pervert but for the Supreme Being in the bhagavata it's describing tamasa param not this world tomasa brahma is the fifth verse 24 verse of the fifth chapter Thomas of param be all the ignorant and you know that the beyond the great declaration that Veda hominem Borgia Mahanta addict Evernham Thomas of Paris thought those are studying the Vedanta they know their also says addictive arnhem effulgent Thomas of Paris thought beyond the ignorance here they are going to the God the Vishnu the personal God so to say but what is the place Thomas of Paris Todd beyond the ignorance and free from the trained of the ignorance so same way we are approaching and what is this knowledge and ignorance now let us take the help of an ceramic dish now he is more close to us almost of our age and he understood how to explain he said - no one is knowledge to know mainly is ignorance so Thomas of Paris thought is a beyond the ignorance what is that ignorance knowing meaning the moment we think that all these things are different that is the ignorance the ceramic is me in the beginning of the gospel of the office that talk gospel of ceramic is nahi say the a Kijana non-gang - no one is knowledge boo boo Cajun UNAM again - no many is ignorance so this is the idea and this is everywhere now sometimes they speak in a very clear language as sometimes the speaking up as a different type of way that through the stories and all in the Sinai when the Moses he was climbing to get the instruction of the Supreme Lord and the last part if the description is he had to pass through dark cloud he couldn't see anything so that is the feel that is the way you have to cross the ignorance is that dark cloud and when he could cross the dark cloud then he saw the effulgent one the God with all power this is the story of the Old Testament and the Moses and Jesus he was tempted the before he was going to realize the God the temptation came once again that is also the same the ignorance what is the temptation I will give you the Supreme Lord shape I will give you the kingdom he will be decent with that everything and in the bhagavad-gita also before he was getting that supreme knowledge the Marroquin the different names with the same activity they came and trying to delude don't go to God rather you achieve these things what God is only one but here you are getting so many those who have great the Upanishad Kotoko Nisha they're the new chica towers also offered by the yama as so many things so we have to understand that this is the ignorance and we have to go beyond the ignorance what is the ignorance manifestation of the god I don't want the manifestation of God I don't want what the God has created I want God himself Raghavan see Ramakrishna again in his very simple way he is telling you like to know how much property the germander is having the landlord is having for you are going and asking this man and that man you were to go to directly to the landlord have a good relation with him landed himself will tell how much money he is having property is having and all that so what is difference me and one if you know one then you again mean you are the realized soul if you know me then you are not so the spiritual practice particularly in the way that Hindus they move you have to understand whoever comes before me is the manifestation of God so I see meaning this moment but I know is the manifestation of the same thing and those who are in the name of religion asking go away from me don't come to me don't touch me they are nowhere in religion they're just living in there and giving a poor signboard I am a religious man I am the Poojari of a temple no we're in religion so why we're standing the bhagavata why you were studying the Vedas to understand this knowledge there is no meaning there is only one but right this moment I cannot understand that one so I have accepting meaning as the manifestation of that one by that way from the many I am going to the one so this is the ultimate the time and again it has been proved that to reach the light one has to pass through the darkness again it says in the 26 through 50th the Brahma is describing the qualities of the Supreme Being in the in the eighth book 5th chapter verses from 26 to 50 so so many verses each and every word I will quote only one and you will find that how the Brahma is going on describing the qualities of the Supreme Being and what is that they say in the province Ramakrishna the Swami Vivekananda composed a the prayer song he said need guna guna Moy almost every evening the devotees of Sai Ram Krishna to sing that song near guna guna more Negro has no qualities no appetites but at the same time this guna mine is having all these qualities Apogee Creon undecaying Sathya the truth an anthem infinite artyom limitless Gauhar shyam residing in every being nish column without an equality operator of the turkey on the beyond the wars and tarts mana of grey Onam the faster than the mine Manasa ja vu again in the kanesha the word has been used Manasseh ja vu what is that Brahmin it moves faster than the mind mind is the most part fast even the faster than the light because you cannot calculate you just think from here that I am going to some place you are there so that is the first nosov the mind and it says it is beyond that faster than the mind so it didn't say the light useiess mind why mind is the most fast moving thing but the thing is when you reach over there what you see the same God so it is already there we use travel to the mind and reach over there he is already there so it says faster than the mind Manu of guru Onam but asana dukedom beyond debate so in the people they come and they converse and they're debating that this is the god this is not the god is beyond that debate and then he says 'no mama he ba ba remember any Nia I salute you who highest and the most adorable being salute to you the most adorable being and who is that exactly the Vedanta in describing the Brahman the same thing but we are not satisfied we cannot understand this all pervasiveness we can understand that you are faster than the mind we can understand that you are all-pervasive but still I am not satisfied I need something tangible so that I can see I can talk to I can breathe I can cook food for you so that is our desire and you know that in the Hinduism they have introduced the five different ways you can have the relationship with God make a frame like a mother like a child all this way so this is the beautiful all the emotions that the human being is having these emotions are utilized to reach back to the source to the God and if you give the Balanta the pure Balanta which says the world is nowhere what will happen to the ordinary people they'll be totally confused and then if the religion is very forceful and asking them to practice that they will make the mistakes so that is the reason we have to understand in the Hinduism a different angle they have from the different angle they are trying to give the supreme truth and this angle is beautiful then the Brahma prays the impersonal to become personal this is the turning point the impersonal this becoming personal why the first created being who created the oh the Brahma and then the Brahma was asked to create the whole world the whole universe Brahma did that now he's going back to the same creator and told I can understand you in this way and he was explaining a pink reham suck them on anthem Adam gohar shahi knows it he realizing but whatever the other people they won't be able to understand you so they say set to another Shia Atmaram the please who God revealed to us revealed to us sir Tom no no miss us - Shia at mana Hosmer karana cuchara present naina this issue now some become the mahkum Boojum in the 45th verse it says Oh God revealed to us who have taken refuge in D and are eager to have your vision kindly reveal your holy self in a manner so that we can see you with our eyes look at the prayer please reveal in such a way so that we can understand with our eyes we can see you reveal in such a way so that we can see you with our own eyes that means take that form by which we can understand you see you and all so however third this is the skanda that is dedicated to Vishnu the first took to nine and this Vishnu now taking a form why here it comes and they say because this is the eighth the scandal the eighth skander the description is that that they have gone to the Supreme Being Thomas of beyond the ignorance and reaching over there who have gone divers the gods were already very high in the spiritual level and who are leading them the Brahma and the Shiva who are the embodiment of that Supreme Being so now these people they are going and they are praying for whom they are praying for us the ordinary people and they are praying Oh God we know that you are all everywhere without form but we are not satisfied please reveal yourself in such a way so that we can see you with our eyes this is the prayer and the formless is going to take the form and how it is taking the form then see sugar is describing how the formless the all-pervading the supreme being for the benefit of the human being is taking the fall McDonagh an important brahmana Rupa Kalpana so here putana anouk important for the benefit of the devotees brahmana which is all-pervading consciousness without form Rupa the form Kalpana then imagining those forms are showing in tourism so many varieties of gods and goddesses so many and if you when you are going down with that the small room where do you keep your blood bags and shoes on the wall you will find so many gods and goddesses one gentleman he made that so many varieties of gods and goddesses now he is writing to us he is having 500 such those things they want to donate to us if you are interested we can distribute to you but Otto Kahn came you will take $1 at least so this way it goes so many gods and goddesses but are there so many gods and goddesses no that's why enthuse are with you know the sweet so many varieties of gods and goddesses they live together without fighting but you go to other people who are only what even one God and if you say something about that God immediately there'll be bloodshed this is the beauty of the Hindus and this Hinduism is the the wonderful approach it takes each and every one and here we find we are standing on that particular time when the formless is taking the form why because that formless was requested by his own form brahma own form vishnu shiva and also da the highest creation david us Devers and he's when he's praying in that way please reveal soft one that you who is that we have already started a big cream sat down etc he says so that Tom you know for us to share so that we can see at Monomoy smart karana guru jerem you reveal yourself so that we can see you then what happened de Nieva massa savvy diva pretty hottie Shanna now abortion come Disha shooting at Muhammad Ali womb now queen that God revealed then after these it says the brilliance was so much even the gods could see anything they could not see the sky they could not see the art they could not see themselves because of the tremendous light that came on their eyes it was dazzled only two persons could see one is Brahma and Shiva so even when we are approaching God to have the form that Tichina also you have to be pure like the Brahma and the Shiva why it is so pure because they are not separated from God what is the purity and impurity from the viewpoint of the Hindus when your mind is attached to this world the manifestation it is impure when your mind is attached to the God it is pure that's why they say take initiation and take then go on taking the name of God you know in in the Bengal and many places particularly villages they will never allow you to cook for the God if you are not taking the initiation and they will say your body is impure as because you have not taken the initiation your body is impure you cannot cook for the God why they say that they don't know but those who have taken the initiation they take you know that we will cook and our body is pure why their bodies pure they don't know because they are associated with the God taking the name of God so when you are going on taking the name of God the more you take that more you keep your mind on God more you are becoming pure master of the money devastating what is the spiritual practice my son only to keep your mind somehow at the feet of God that is spiritual practice the if you can when you are singing when you were doing some work thinking of God thinking of God thinking of God by that - you're constantly associated with God and you are becoming pure and that purity will help you to see God himself otherwise not the God is taking the form but to see that for the Living God it is not so easy the young Narendra he went to get the help from Provence Ramakrishna he was starving that time his family and he sent him to goddess Kali the moment he entered he saw the Living Goddess and because of his purity you could see not everyone could see so naturally all many people at the air who needs money they will go to the goddess Kali and say you revealed to nothing they're not favourable to us also that don't do the condition you have to understand to realize God you have to be pure and pure like Sheba she was auspicious pure like the Brahma the son of God and sometimes they meet misunderstanding and mixed explanation with the Jesus ate and the path I am the way you have to go through me they think Jesus is the only bad no the purity what is the purity and the Son of God see how Jesus is declaring I and the father up in heaven are one I am the son of God what is the son means I never forgave my father my personality that you see everything belongs to father my thinking my life everything is father's that is purity and that purity is the fact the when he says I am the paratime the way that means you should also become pure like me and how you can become pure by constantly thinking god that's so in the christianity also they repeat the name of God they go on counting the bees in Islam also it is there but this image again the reason why the going on counting the bees were too high if we understand these and that is the reason only one who is pure like these gods can see other gods could not see the Neva Maha's are Salvi Deva protection are the dozen by that brilliance the Devers could not perceive the sky the porters the ground or even themselves how then could deceive the supreme art man he could not see the supreme art man who took the form even the Devers could not see now only Brahma and Shiva could see that beautiful form of the formless the form of the formless in five verses then the bhagavata described that form of the Lord known as Vishnu here it says the color the complexion was deep blue deep blue was the complete beautiful eyes wearing a pure bright yellow silk tint --less like molten gold the lord is having will for an attractive lemes face and for it and wearing a wonderful crown and jewelleries holding Sudarshana his weapon and stream and manifesting from three means the lakshmi manifesting and his chaste ajar the generosity sauce i Amaya Mohan Guevara namana Musti then the finally gear when that form the Vishnu took the form then the Brahma is offering the this is sanitation how he said that Hajj Arthur janmas City the one who never takes birth has taken the birth how some some way some severe my on some year Maya with the help of your Maya here also when the Shankar Acharya he is explaining about the creation and he is explaining about the avocadoes in our next class we will discuss about the avataras the how the guitarist's the power of the Vishnu is coming and Shankara says Java evil as he flees taking birth is not true jatta evil that is color avatar and we find here the I is also telling you have taken birth Oh powerful one through your Maya what is that Maya the involve power of the car it is the power is with God all the time now he is using that power to manifest and he manifested in this way that use the form you know the goddess Kali there there was no images and the one person krishnan on the a gamba Guiche hamburger she is a Sanskrit the like the MEMS see at that type of title ie God the hominid his name was krishna ananda he was a great scholar and the worship of Goddess Kali goddess Kali Shakti there anything even the blinking is nothing but the shakti expression of fifteen so one day he was praying to the mother mother can I have you image so that I can give it to the people ordinary people who can understand who are you and he can worship you he was from big all this Christian and dogyum baggage and he was praying praying praying a one day mother he heard the mother is telling okay tomorrow early morning the image that you will see his mind and he was eager he could not sleep that night he got a worldly morning you usually used to go for bathing to the river he came out and suddenly he found there was a lady that ordinary lady she was in inca in our country you know they use the cow dung as far as a fire now so they were making that cow dung cake she was doing that usually those ladies they wear their clothes almost above the knees and then and she was putting the hand in this way to throw that ball on the wall the Indians can understand how they make that cow dung cakes so when she was doing that one her left leg was on a higher place and then the right leg was up below she was doing that krishna and the son mother is this the image that you asked me to propagate can I do that and seeing looking at the the pond it is coming the respected person is coming you know out of shy she cut her tongue usually they do in our country that we always showing the tongue and cutting that time they am very shy so Krishnan and that number you saw that and he was crying mother is this the image you are showing me you told the first image and he went and took the deep in the water then he saw the goddess Kali's image that we now see if you go down in our basement you can see the huge photograph of goddess Kali which is in Dutch nation that is the image the Krishna and the Hagen body saw inside the water but not that one so this is the way the image of colleague came that this is the way the image of Vishnu King the business image came to the prayer of Shiva and the Brahma and he is telling him who is not having any thing to take birth is taking birth how through the Maya Raja at the generosity some of Maya mock then I'm not reading that holds Luca Mahanagara animu namaste I offered at the feet of this great soul my respect so this is the the formless taking the fall and when he took the form he was termed named as Vishnu who is all-pervading again thank you very much still we have five minutes time if you have any question we can ask on this session 2019 we will always give five minutes or ten minutes but the question answer of the rise but please ask question otherwise the time will be resting awesome question has been created historical even Connie Kalia yes yes the goddess Kali right and for this Bishnu also distr the creation because of that we wanted to have it for the same way all the Durga the Ganesha and but the Krishna and Rama they were not that Krishna and Rama they were born so they historical but with the power of God tremendous power of God that manifested so that is called that Krishna first is the Rama then the prisoner and presently Robin see Ramakrishna say he who was Rama he who was Krishna in this body now so that is the power of God that manifested and that power is Vishnu anything so confusing well we always say that in Reverse is this yes see if we can understand that he is asking the the problem of Maya is coming up again and again in the Bhagavata is a devilish fall in the operating form everywhere the Maya is coming and what is that Maya the power of God why that Maya that we cannot answer that's why Raghavan Salam o Krishna say this is easy child if you take that as your that to God we form and he has created the whole world through the Maya why that God will is ease will we cannot ask but if you have the capacity to discriminate in this way you can always go to the Google father and as the goggle father is telling nothing has been created and that is true the ultimate truth is dead in reality nothing has been created it's all creation is nothing but Maya Goga vada is so correct but the thing is question is are we ready to understand that if not so we have to start through these how accepting the God has manifested in this form and God has created me too I am not separate from God but this moment I cannot understand this so there is the process what is that process believing and practicing believing the words of the great souls who has realized God in this way through prayer through worship through vigil and I will also do that and slowly slowly you can see even the ordinary people taking the name of God is transforming and that is the proof the God's name can change then why not then the time will come we will go beyond the Maya it is not that no one said you cannot cross the power of mine who can always be the Bhagavad Gita Krishna is very clear he said is very difficult but with my praise you can always be free yes when I talked to Maya so the Jeremiah if the very correct 10 very good there's a good answer and if we're asking rajesh khanna's of course the energy in the BB to Romani the Shankar Acharya has very clearly explained as far as possible because Shankara say it is not possible to explain Maya because it is beyond as the Brahmin it is beyond that capacity so only through a new harbor only by our feeling we can understand this is Maya how the me Raj they give that example me Raj there was nothing but I myself saw the water I saw all those trees and when I reach over there there is nothing so I give the name me Raj and the snake in the Rope the classical the example of the Vedanta and there is nothing the no snake is there but I see the snake on the road so buying experience from our own experience we can understand something is there which I cannot explain but that is happening and that is called Maya and that is the thing okay then and this and you know that we are still having some of our calendars is a beautiful calendar that every year we publish and with the team this year we have published that 125th year of Swami
