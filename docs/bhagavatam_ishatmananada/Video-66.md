this beginner distorter Shanta garden would you say [Music] but the mana solutions be schwa our [Music] governess attrition me Birnam shuhang rush me condom cumberland iron [Music] you give me Dianna tambien Bundy Vishnu [Music] Parimal okay girls we are studying bother with them but of course not slow after slogan we are following and different picking up choosing some wonderful incidents and then explaining this bhagavata is containing the knowledge and the devotion and reading us to a very righteous life the here we find how the God himself has incarnated as a special being the Hindus they believe that the god came in different time he created and then to protect his own creation he is coming down taking different forms different names at different time and helping this creation but this is not from the point of view of the Advaita Vedanta you know the Hindus always have parallel two approaches one is pure or Twitter Vedanta where there is no - no question of God no question of Incarnation that is a different approach and this is another approach the god has become everything so we are studying this bhagavata from that point of both our Twitter and Twitter we are trying to analyze how the UH traitor who is one all-pervading supreme is becoming to how Vedanta will say to Maya the reflection is coming as a light is coming through a tinted glass maybe a red colored glass the light is coming we said it is red but light in fact has no color so that is a different aspect and at the symptom we can say it has become red and I can see it I am feeling it like this so here today the supreme being incarnated I have given the name super human who is this superhuman forgiving Sri Ramachandra now after a few days the Rama Navami and the Hindus all over the world will be celebrating this great function Rama Navami and they'll be fasting the pure worshipping but wind is wrong today we will discuss but before this in our last discussion we discussed about the greatest gift many of you attended you must I think you remember that what was the gift that was given to God the King Bali he offered the greatest give to the God yes this we have to remember the King Bali was warned by his guru shukracharya why because a very spiritual person approach to the king o king even giving so many things to so many people will you please give me only three steps of land and who is that adores a little boy and he came and Roxtec body not that the body couldn't understand he understood there must be something special in this boy and the small little boy and he is asking three steps this covering a little space no something is there he understood it but even then he said once I have said yes I will give you and moreover we am here and I am distributing we will come whatever they will ask I will kill that was his promise the beautiful things goes see what we are learning even when the god is coming to challenges and trying to take the this how much we can truly have failed in our promises we must have to stick to that his guru understood shukracharya warned him he is not ordinary person can't you see this is the Vishnu he has come in that form he is going to deceive you he will take everything from you and give it to the neighbors he is favoring neighbors it will survive his time but this time since I have promised I will kill and he came when the Lord of the huge form covering the whole world with his two steps and then hearts balling you promised three steps where I'm going to keep my three third step because two steps on the three world that the Hindus the belief saga Martha and potala the needle world this world and heaven in two steps it's covered now when I am going to place my third step and he offered this time though his guru shukracharya addressed him as a son of his father but he said no what father grandfather who was his grandfather Prahlada the great devotee those who have read these and you know just for the fun of it for the just enjoying the reading you can treat this borrower particularly the stories very fascinating and you will learn so many things this prelada he was his grandfather and this body remembered his grandfather and the grandson of Perla written mentioned his father grandson of the Pandava who was a devotee of Yogesh noon now you have come to test me and you are testing in such a way that if there is no chance for me to offer him anything but only one thing is left with me that I offered he said but on tritium Carew she she made me jump she's name is the head this head is mine and this head I offer to you and you place your third food on my head and that's why the orders the same this is the very special place on the head one should not keep that sometimes some people they even put his dead legs the feet on the head of the cat or the pits that also they should not do why because it is a very special place and the Hindu the belief that only the lord vishnu the guru the supreme guru he decides on the head so this bottom tritium guru stretched me young with the bhagavata the eight skander 22nd chapter and second verse it says be pleased to place your third step on my head being pleased with the king body the devotee and seeing his determination to keep up the truth the Supreme God was very very happy in the beginning he was showing anger but when his wife came and told the he is a devotee he is giving his life for you still you are angry how whatever God you were then Prahlada king and he also said that oh god you should not be angry with body then the brahmana of the gods also came and pleaded in Tripura Bali frames one thing we learn from here if you are determined to do something good each and every one your relatives and gods and your ancestors all will come and join you - it helped you with the body he was punished by the Supreme God who first came his wife then his ancestor then the gods from my and others all they took the side of the body and they were bleeding and requesting the Supreme God you should not punish him I didn't go to all the details only to remind us that if we try to do something good knowing for sure all goodness will come to help you and what happened then the God smiles and say I was testing him don't think I am angry with him I was testing him and he will always be with me sudah suddenly he can be a tetraman graziotti upon you the healer why hero because he was not afraid at all to keep up the truth his promise he was ready to give his life even so he said the Lord said you will be always with me you will feel my presence all the time and not only that I will protect you she says sorry Berto onto our Rock she she I will protect you so what I will learn from the story almost all the Indians little elderly Indians all the dogs Tony of course the you know that here in America they call it NRI they came good here when they are very young and they were students and they studied over here not much of this background but still they have heard from their elderly people these are the stories every household they will be constantly hearing why constantly giving the inspiration to do good if you did good then your ancestors will be with you your relatives and friends will be with you even the gods will be with you and the Supreme God will be so happy so this is the inspiration to do good so that we find that the supreme bheem he is doing like this now bhagavata gives us a very interesting description of the different incarnations of the Supreme God along with the list of the kings and their families in the beginning when you started this we told this is a piranha is a special type of Scripture the piranha is mixed with the history and ultimate knowledge the history and mythology love together they made a beautiful 18 puranas the so passed and this 18 puranas the mixture of the history and here if you read the whole line chapters nine scandal they're giving on what who came after whom or the kings and the families list is there one after another we won't go to that but he will start with one king the souping being incarnated as a super human sri rama and the sugar from the sugar he came to know that the very powerful Kshatriya King Kurt Angle his name is Kurt Angle his son was did gabacho deliver his long hands and then from why this katana katana was very strong physical so they say the God is to come all the time to request him to fight with the other people the Donna burrs and the shooters cartilage to do and do that the one day when curtain the was fighting in the war the gods were very pleased and they told we like to give you some moon only one thing I'd like to know how long I'm going to leave all God's became silent towards that the you only much you know very few days alert but on the left of all his word and everything he ran back to his house in his kingdom and immediately sat in meditation that is also the speciality that a spiritual person always do the moment he will feel that I'm going to die instead of running towards hospital take the refuge of God immediately of course other people will take you to hospital but you we mean your mind you know nothing no problem I am going to go back to my own house original house so that is called spirituality immediately will turn the whole mind and meditate Kurt Angle started doing that so anyway his son is still gabacho and dilgar Babu's son is the famous Rahu the almost all the Hindus they rebel but the Ramachandra they even say the Rahu is the dead person and from Raghu his son was a jerk and then came that dasharatha very and the known name to all of us so this our job and that dasharatha this is the lineage I'm just giving you very small line it started very very far and all coming down this long line this dasharatha he was requesting the gods to come and help me please - Arita also used to help these God's got his small G the white God because you know recently I was hearing they said thirty five hundred million gods and goddesses that the hindus are having he said no he is only 35 people 35 gods so Sahasra and Hazara these are the confusion and this is the seed that 35 people they are one equal two thousand and millions so they're in exalted life 35 whatever it may be here it says that - errata when he was not having the children he was praying to the gods to place to some of the Rishi's the came and they started doing the Yankee you know the through the yunkai you can publish it and nothing is the everything in the atmosphere in the nature so you can catch it and can express it now it is the scientist he had brilliant now see I am speaking from here and all over the world people can look at me can see me hear me as if they are present very presentable here some so many people now observing they call it live stream what is this live stream can you imagine say 50 years before the live stream no it was not there even the telephone this to go on dream like these then afterwards they'll be shouting so loudly the machine was the nest even without the mission the other side people could hear and sometimes even say years even here no like visitors to have but anyway now the slowly the science and technology developing so much what is the science and technology harnessing the nature the same way they also used to use the nature and from the earth dicta power and from that power it could do many things whether it believe it or not and from that only the Supreme Lord came down and became a little part ways became full brothers rama lakshmana bharatha and shifted now we will only keep our energy our gender in treta yuga the Supreme Court took the form of a perfect human to give a guideline to the human society this supreme human being is read on the 9th under tinge of the bhagavata despite how sri krishna took the form of sri rama and his three brothers but we find a wonderful description in the ramayana the bike carrier sri ramachandra and read the introduction that that happened as through a conversation that great rishi Valmiki the biographer of shri rama so he asked the question to Narada none other was also a great rishi but used to keep a lot of information you know the some of the people this to keep lot of information will be travelling here and there and keeping information we have seen in even in our bio days in our neighbourhood there will be a person if we wanted to know about a faraway place awesome geographical or sociological wish to go to him and so ask do you know this place oh yes wait then he will go and bring down a book and even say see this is the place you can read it so he was like that and all peoples to depend on him did we used to go and ask him so like that only Narada was a very very knowledgeable person to many many things so when the lot of the game and this Rishi Valmiki still now I will quote the whole passage in Sanskrit kouachi means important local goon Obon cast a video bomb man requested to go on counting the qualities that Baalbek is asking cohosh mean sankirtan loki is there anyone in this present age that at the age of BBQing a person now his quality please go on counting how many good qualities first is guna bonne biere Iran permaculture critic question sir taco de la ratta are no bongo cheetah brother duty mong-koo Anasuya agora then cursive repetitive Archer Jetta lucious's and yogi who even gods are afraid of pretty beacons and so how many qualities who come to 1010 little confusion anyway let us find her ear cohosh means some rotten log what is the sample T that is the age of the ball making that is the treta Yuga this panic is asking at this age is that anyone who is noble fasting who is not and also hearing third his harmonica structures for protect us check grateful field Saturday Barker then truthful and did her broker determined Hanuman self-confident jitter Koda he can control his do Tamar handsome and Anasuya caja forgiven now he's asking could she be the pasture even the gods are afraid of when he becomes angry so now did you count correctly 10 okay at 11 or 10 or 11 whatever now these are the qualities one should have and that's why I gave that this is supreme person it's Superman now it is the thing Superman is very muscular body and be jumping on them and the Superman must be having these all qualities with all these qualities who can be except God so only the god he had rented he took the human form a Sri Ramachandra in reply the Narada saying this is a beautiful way he is explaining fish tuna shut ratio bearing in mind is like the Vishnu that means is all-powerful Vishnu nah shirisha brilliant Vidya means the power are powerful so mobile priyadarshan on and in beauty is like the moon the moon is always beautiful so many people they will be all the time particularly the lovers they notice oh your face is just like a moon and the lover is so happy moon is not that rays of good but still the fields were happy if you tell like that so and this is the way vishna priyadarshan are so mobile so mommies more and in beauty is just like the moon you know the person the beauty also comes when a person is coming to the society who is a really good-looking person the 50% the problem is solved and if the person is not that good-looking me maybe he is having some good quality but he has to prove that he is having the quality because in the beginning people don't believe so that's why we find that all gods and goddesses are beautiful and not only that but one see Ramakrishna say if you have to develop the image of God it should be beautiful otherwise your mind won't be concentrated on that so this then God upnishads show grow they in anger is like the fire doomed afire colony colony and that is the clothing rain he is angry he's like that and shall we are pretty we Shama so the boat is angry to whom those were bad and at the same time he is also in forbearance he's just like the art that is the son of the shelter I have seen him in better go and know and the biographer came to know all details about his object so he started observing and following and developed the biography which is known as Ramayana Ayana means the fact this is the path of Sri Ramachandra why he keep that name because that path if we follow that means all the good qualities that developed in reality the God who incarnated as Ramachandra then we also can become like him so this is a go show me to see another biographer absolute knowledge that our Valmiki the treta you get the time of Shri Rama Valmiki's very recent we can say almost in our time the bal Mickey he also meditated on Sri Ramachandra he was not in the time of Rama Chandra party meditated and Rama Chandra and when we were meditating slowly many things revealed sobral Mickey revealed so many good qualities of Rama Chandra and he is introducing language and the wars Rama here I will ask you to know Valmiki was a devotee here's the world worship Shri Rama Chandra as his God so the God and the devotee that was the relation but at the same time when he's introducing the Rama Chandra his beloved God his deity how he is introducing a conversation between Shiva and Parvati and the poverty is asking the Shiva oh Lord is it true the drama the son of dasharatha is absolute Brahman can formless eternal absolute becoming human who is asking not ordinary person the Parvati so why the Tulsi das she is coating Parvati to convince the people the DC is possible why not Lord Shiva say dear Parvati you were aware that to protect Dharma and to save the people from the suffering that supreme God takes fall and this time here in the as we wrong so this is the the convincing way they are putting the Supreme God is all pervading can take form and if you ask how it is possible the question will be why not reply will be the why not why because if he is all clean and all-powerful full he is all-powerful can't Italy fall and if he can't it the form in that case he's not all-powerful so he is all-powerful why this is Ramachandra will come to that before that we find the Dogon see Ramakrishna who was in 1836 on a very recent and when he was very young he found this Ramada Inn as if his family deity is to worship and he became mad with ROM Lala so just now before coming over here I heard a story from one of our monastic members and you are stating that one American young boy almost a hundred years before at the time of that that period he went to India and he saw the small image of Sri Ramachandra he liked it so much he stole that and came over here and he started worshipping not knowing what actually that will American he was not introduced with the Indian culture he was not knowing anything about the Ramachandran but he only liked it he was fascinated with the small image but he was not playing with it he was worshipping and after that he gave it to when he was reward he give it to a young lady and told keep it and he will find these that lady kept and for few time days and slowly slowly she came to know about the Krishna movement - she went to the Krishna involved no it is not the same God is not the same image but anyway she continued him to know something about the Indian Way in Hinduism then afterwards she handed it over to her daughter with a young daughter she started playing with that dog small that Rama Lala Lala means the child safe healthy happening then when she grew to 21 or 22 and I think she completed her graduation from a college then she came to become a nun in the Hollywood center it is the inner heart you tell she came and she stayed over there as a nun she was trying to practice that life then her mother came with the small image of Rama and after Swami Rama probe Anandi will you please keep this image in your shrine because I will go to some of the place but it needs to take care because no child everything you have to take care of him the shaman kept it and every day when used to offer puja used to give flower to that but every day he started developing so much attachment with that ramallah the he was thinking that I should not give this when the lady come back and say no somewhere it has gone it is not yet but he could not say that the when the lady came he of course gave back and saved you know I have become so much attached to these I think I should not give it to you back but even then the lady took it back then after some disease she came back and told now I think this particular image will be here happy I cannot get this please give it here from them this thing happened in America is not India or the land of all stories now it is in America in Hollywood you can go and see the drum ladder sitting over there this Ramla how he came and how he is sitting over there and still will say and now it's are all stories so this happened Saddam Edition also told this lahmlahlah became so dear to me this become very very difficult now I think many of you will purchase the ticket for Hollywood right Salameh is apparently the son of Dasaratha but in reality is all-pervading God is very close to everyone because he resides in the hearts of everyone friends now will come the Padma Purana but no Quran is a different purana but it is also beautifully defining Rama how ramante yoginah ante Satyanand a cheetah at money et Rama patina so param brahma be deity the Yogi's enjoys the police in meditation and why you is anyone of us when we are enjoying the meditation something all of us are trying in our own way but winds with one Ds may be certainly mind become very concentrated maybe one or two minutes we find great joy that joy that the Yogi's they give the name Rama the Yogi's enjoys the police in meditation and called that please as Sathya Ananda the onion the means the joy joy of the truth and shield that is also the existing and per amorem nam and they call it rama why ramante yogino yes mean surah rahman t means enjoying when you enjoy that is long run the meme the meaning of the name Rama is enjoy when you enjoy now I was giving a class discourse in the Dallas yesterday we were discussing about crunchy kosher and we have a kosher anandamaya kosha right many of you know Annamayya pranamaya Monomoy a big Gianna Maya anandamaya kosha but very good so these five cautious as because this is the baton to society you must always know about culture because that is the only thing we always discussed and along with the Porsche a busted trailer the three different stages what is that Chartres is awaking then sadhna and and most of the time when you listen to the spiritual discourses we go to second stage the softener that is dream stage and then only when then all the discourses are over we come back to chakra but in you know chakra Swapna and third is so the-- they start so these two things if you remember they never be daunting one is our star trail and puncher kosha why beyond the coast is that Artman buncha kosha bill optional art mom will efficient beyond that and this anandamaya kosha so we always think under my approach a means brahmin is Anand Swaroop he is also the embodiment of bliss so we go to that Ananda know this on earth is also not Brahmin why the Sun and the means again three so Hinduism is so much it is so difficult to remember these are non the when you are reaching after that soup theme the Sousou tea you get run under in the dreamless sleep you get an under then they say it is not that under it is not the same one why because these aren't the having three qualities one is Priya Priya means the object that you like that you love when you see that you get the joy right sometimes if you go in the market not to purchase but the call that window-shopping and you go to the window then you see you beautiful young people they will go and see the motorbike does this is good and how much over 20,000 are okay afterwards so like that window shopping you are going you are enjoying by seeing the things and that may be the people who will like that skull clearly and then next stage is Mordor what is that know that if you gain third thing for you and after that I see and then the father parties and give it to me I saw the bicycle and I was thinking no it won't be when I was requesting father or that or no we have to first a school exam then only we'll get him and all this thing suddenly one day in my birthday the father came and to come out when I came and it was yours and the birthday and the joy that I gave that is called Buddha the Priya and water and promoter is the kernel pleasure so these are the three types of on under and that R&D is the Anand amaya culture that is not the supreme brahman beyond that without the object when you are full with joy eternal uncle comparing that is called brahmana think of that our goal is to be super dear so this Rahman under a tank Brahman and again the Yogi's those who meditate control their senses when they eat that joy they call the name Rama ramante yoginah SB sarama now the Supreme Being who created this world again incarnated in different names and form and guiding the people this time he came in the form of Brahma but why to guide the society to form a human society in the human society if individual human become good society become good every individual sir slowlyslowly if all the individuals become good the whole society will become good friends you know when Robinson Ramakrishna came to this world Rama gender came to give we a better shape to the human society Raghavan Krishna came he was giving the idea how the ruler should be and the thinker should be mainly the rulers thinkers brahmana and the Kshatriya other two groups they'll automatically follow so the ruler and the thinkers this should be good so Krishna came for their see Rama Krishna came and he is giving the shape that all paths are leading to the same goal someone died on the sunday of the unification and the signification is possible when your mind become broad and knowledge become really really unfathomable and how is that the knowledge is that God is supreme I cannot limit the God by saying this is the only path one can reach God God can be good in any fact it is up to God only I cannot say that God cannot go over there Who am I to say their discourse you know the sometimes the ruler of the country when he is going you say stop and go to that place you can even no sir that is not the place you should go you cannot God will go ruler will go you have to follow so like that we cannot say that God cannot be realized through this path that path this way that way that is exactly what's wrong - 20 in all his life he combined that see yesterday only I was talking with the devotees of a billion dollars and this way what is this Ramakrishna he give a boost in this idea and after so many thousands of years in the human society in the human culture Solano mr. pastor in 1886 and 1819 3 it entered into the head of some people why not invite all the religious people to have a meeting over here in Chicago in reality what they were doing only commercial exposition whatever the day they did discover they wanted to sell it for the marketing only this be huge the Columbian Exposition and there was no where about the religion but some sudden people started thinking why not invite all the religious people why they thought and that was the first time is it not the unsuitable way that God is working and then a person came who was the disciple of that person who followed all paths and declared at the end of his life all paths are leading to the same goal he came over here why I am telling this is the power of the God the Incarnation the God himself and this time this is the United Way we must have to think after so many 2000 years I was reading in one of the newspapers I do not know whether it's true or not but they coated the present Pope at the Christendom he said there are good things the other fails we have to understand that after 2000 years can imagine and the very closed society the Jews now they are inviting other religious groups also to discuss over there Muslims are inviting other people to discuss other religions in their own places don't you see how things changing this is because of the God gave in the form of say Ramakrishna so that way it works help me I am also planning to purchase a property over there and the Chicago only for this purpose you know and really really thinking seriously to start as full of world religions and also home of harmony where all the religions will be shown and dot so all these things I will discuss with these in details with you people now here the same God came in the form of Rama Chandra to give a shape to this society and how the human being can become a perfect human being first his GT in real he's the Conqueror of the senses in our religious advises meeting sometime is very less opportunity to speak because they always talk about the social things I said why you are constantly thinking about the surface why don't you go to the road what is the route change your mind of the people and if we can do that then the whole society will change automatically the leaders that you see where from they're coming from the society and if we can change the society all people are good they will also those qualities first and foremost controlling the senses when you look at this market you cannot be the same this market economy means the total freedom to your senses you are having this phone throwing purchase another that for how many years two years oh my god you're using two years old phone draw it and they're going on throwing market economy and in pretty every day every day you know that now in Dallas the two different people and they brought the car the resolve was called Tesla car at the back it is a team and I purchased I told her how much you paid for this car oh very cheap xiaomi $57,000 57,000 chief i I could develop the whole village with that money but anyway this is a very comfortable car no sound no engine and I was surprised when he wanted to keep my back he opened the front deck and then you're keeping with on the engine this engine at all then I got down and went and saw the year there is no engine all things are happening like that the faster and faster inside no song very smooth and the pressure will come on the rock band you have to make the roads very smooth because because of the bad road the sound is coming met this one so things are changing every day how to control the senses now if someone will bring another car and he will open the door I will surely ask mr. Tesla what because in real I have got the test of that obviously we have to come the senses I am satisfied with whatever he got suspecting second the mind some here the cheetah some year the cheetah means the Conqueror of the mind you have to control the mind the mind is the main thing in the human being if you constantly keep the suggestions to your mind I am very happy and so many things I'm still having what's my problem you are happy and if you won't thinking I am NOT happy wherever you were you are not happy so that is then and one person he went to visit his Romney and the schwa me was asking about East from Canada the shaman was asking obvious Kannada do you see snow another very hard place they never saw the snow so they are telling here do you see snow I just know fall so that the roads are very good and he was telling Swami we are bored over there seeing the snow and all we have come to you to get the peace the Shawnee is also not in peace and the man is also not in medicine the Xiaomi is not East because the small heart and the small caught the Asian of that he is thinking of the Kannada and the Kannada purple who is really really very rich person I know him so he was telling this for me I don't like that so can we exchange now it is not possible anyway so who is happy the one who has controlled his mind you know was control his mind I'm ready no problem the thing you were happy at the same time treaty mom what is this treaty understanding the circle thing in the spiritual life three is not the booty is the three the three is completely different understanding the circles thing on the spiritual life that is called three most of the people the gross minded people they will think God in a different shape the form and they understand that is the God no to understand God and the subtlest form skull tree and then called Internet he is also intelligent because Buddha man why book Daman because in the worldly life you need to have that type of quality understanding everything Marshall Thurman is TV she is to tell the ladies you must give all information all around you but don't see anything just get the information what that is necessary who is where and what they are doing keep them but don't talk about that then the problem will come the information is necessary what is happening what is going on this information and good demand then very energetic then they'll be getting up in the early morning and bathing and meditating reading books and working and continuously going on and on energies this is three billion then no more of the moral laws meeting good meaty means the model does there is a person I can do anything because they don't understand anything shall I do that or something is there very precious and no one around of course be careful there is a camera in our place then most of the places now they're having the hidden camera so really were going to do that so you should be careful and there's some other day when there was no Canada one very strong person came and lifted this one his baby but even then he lifted that and he was thinking that he will carry but anyway could not is that we had to keep it back so this is the way people think that needed they're anything as because the cameras they're people that the foolish is there I am controlling my son known the neatly means what is good only that thing I will do not a single thing even if my parents are asking me to do something immoral unwilling to do that that is colony together and good nature Sriman what must be always always smiling face understanding the problem of others should talk to communicate that is called Sriman Sriman means beautiful stream beauty but duty means what you behave in your nature that is called stream and so these qualities if one can develop he'll become a superhuman truly so this is why we are now studying whities Ramachandra indeed in this way now you know that the Ramachandra botswana and stop green I just caught one or two large mana his brother should grieve his frame they were talking the brother of Ravana he was provision his name was provisional he came deserting the camp of the Ravana he came to Rama these people were doubting him and they were going on a pricing Sri Ramachandra don't accept him don't accept him we do not know him and what will happen we do not know don't accept him then Rama said softly proper night table 'him Hospital charity oh boy absorber booth it bill Dada me eat a proton bomb this is the one full exposition of a broad-minded person if anyone comes we every maybe who every maybe if he comes and says I take refuge in you I cannot say no but that is my brother that is my promise oh I am sorry boo-boo tape there and keep I promise to protect everyone who ever comes Dada me a turd rotten mama I am promising and this is my promise whoever comes how it is possible and that is the characteristics of an Asian India India's characteristics is this when the people they were getting tortured in their own country they came to only to India long back par she is the king and then there are the Muslims they came the highest the Baha'i temple you see the bottle of the followers of the heart Allah from Iran they came to India India see I didn't know what God he were worshipping no problem be here then like this one after another they came India always said come stay with us no problem try to develop the nation try to develop the nation that was a wonderful nature of the country and lastly the Buddhist the king thousands of them crossing the border fearing the Chinese when they came in he was in a very bad shape we neighbor is to get the food you know the most of my age people didn't remember it was so difficult to get the food than those days my the senior people is to constantly think about where the food will come a miracle Plus that also they stopped for some reason and then the that time they decided that we will have our own food the Green Revolution right revolution all those things came but that was the very bad time for India even then when these people came the Buddhist is okay no problem if we get one break we'll make it half and you can take the half so that is the why because the National Guard Sri Ramachandra is having this idea whoever comes to me my promise I will protect so that is sorry deliver so afterwards how when a person is dead sometimes we hear even today so how the nature of a nation full complete nation is changing because of the philosophy because of the Rama gender practice this philosophy what is the philosophy when the Robin er who is to constantly cursing Rama and abusing languages used to use who attack his wife Sita even when he is to come and fight the Rama every time is to say it seems
