[Bhagavatam 021 - A Guide to Liberation : A Son's Advice To Mother Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Kv-mW2ckeU)

that is change from this wonderful local Shonda Gordon would you girl but the mana solutions be short our gotten desolation me shoe honda loves me condom come on Diana you can eat the arnica Myung Monday Vishnu the the main god is Pavan Vishnu and the pedometer is explaining about the other two being the Paragon bassoon Muharram the other what is speaking from different stories don't two different characters is a pure knowledge that he is teaching we have started discussing about the sons advises to his mother that this is ridiculous usually the mothers are giving their prices to the Sun but here we find is completely different why because this is Lord Vishnu who became the son of devotee and cardamom this devotee and cardamom they were the father and the mother of Kapila and capella was the one mission himself now the questioner failed believe God can God come in this human form keeping that apart we are continuing with dis advices and I find that a person if he is not God it is impossible to give advices like that now after the regime the cardamom left devotee the mother requested the son Kapena to enlightened heart so that she can get liberation from the bondage of this world now friends who you were discussing that that was a different era almost all the people there to think about the liberation about the spiritual practices about the high modern values so that was the trained general train or people this to have like that see here also we find the kardama was a Muni and we know in the last time we have great that the kardama he knew his son is not not very personal mr. Vishnu himself and that's why taking him in a secluded place the father prayed to the Sun and said I want a favor what is that favor for him project but the beam are Sita a hampi shook actually she but in the project but it project I like to roam around bodily mass Sita but I mean that capacity means I need to become a monk I knew that I have the responsibility to look after your mother since I am married I keep the world but he kept in conditional so that when you will be born I should be allowed to go away so this has a strong desire constantly to become mom to become holy the people like that no attraction for the world things there is very very important now one young man was telling me at that time they were not having the Apple phones that's why they were free from all those that they had different different directions the world is having the attractions all the time now these attractions constantly dragging our mind and who in the car demanded that the mother came we know much afterwards at a time of the punishment a husband and wife having the wonderful Thailand the wife is asking the husband why you are leaving husband was a very famous rishi the expounder of the brahmana Brahma Gianni and he said because this world is temporary as long as it was my duty to look after I did now I should go away and he was having two wives the he told I will give all property utility to both of you then one she told what I am going to do with that property which you were just leaving like this that means this is not important something must be very important for which you are living the heart alone I too late the following you instruct me same way the devotee also coming and in the third book 25th chapter sloka 7 through 11 7 to 11 she expressed heart prayer she was beginning near Wigner near dong-won assad indriya dharshan armed inna some of your money in a present now on tonnopro Bravo he's addressing her son as the Bravo and this Bravo is a master is she is not considering him as my son utilized to do that mother yashodha the foster mother of Shri Krishna she is to think in that way but devotee she knew who is this my son so Bravo boomin Bravo o Great Lord devotee is stating I have been in the darkness undone dominar of the gross infatuation and utter helplessness went to the pool of the senses or shot in real dharshan armed assault still ready assert that the word this is used to give the meaning as its temper it is not there no it is not Seth and aza sometimes some people they translate that it is not just negative no it is they are pretty much there our India is our senses are very much there we understand that so how can you say it is a sir that is not there brahma satyam jagan mita the mid-table doesn't mean it is not there the sometimes they will be telling in the Sanskrit shut off ringa treasure means the rabbit and you cannot have the horn of the rabbit that is mithya the shutter Shinda is not it can never be of course we do not know no idea sign as developed so much it can be but normally it is not and that is the reason say that is mikta but what about this world whatever our senses what about our body we cannot call it as a mid-table it is very much there then what is it temporal because it is temporally people should not be much into these that is dead rises again and again in the whole spiritual indifferent to it is say like that and here she is telling I have been in the darkness undone tamam under means Thomas Dartmouth's what is under I couldn't see why because of the darkness what is the darkness ignorance what is the ignorant that these world is temporary I couldn't even feel like that when I was young I was thinking I should do have these have that so many we were to do the same thing then it time comes but each and every one of us then we say notice enough is enough this is not the thing that I wanted in there women are sometimes he mentioned in that way whatever I pray I pray the mystic jihad joy the full courage I what I am dream my mystic and what he did I don't need that I don't want that yah-ha-ha-ha-ha china so this is the whole life I wanted that I should have the name fame success everywhere then when I got those things no these saying even want it I wanted something else and what is that the peace the happiness yesterday two young gentlemen came and people they were talking about that officers were here working engineers so I was telling what is the goal of the life didn't answer and now they're cautious so all the time we think the goal of life to achieve these to achieve these to have this and have that then ultimately when I am completely alone when all have gone away then I feel no I never wanted this what I wanted the peace happiness the joy the fearlessness the conception of the permanent that I wondered where it is searched I searched in the wrong places and that is the reason I couldn't get as to give the example like one young man wanted to know what it took eight pass in the school exam and he went to teacher said how to take the pass Marx had to get the pass and exam ticket go and read the books if you read the books then it'll be that fellow couldn't understand undone come on he made the mistake he thought books he went to the library and read all the books different types of storybooks and frictions and there but in the examination nothing was there he plucked he failed in exam and then he came and told the master what is it but you read the books but wrong books so I mean what is they but I am NOT getting proper direction so why Assad in real - alarmed because of the in real the inner ears are constantly dragging me see the mother the evil team she also learn it lady and she was not ordinary because she became the mother of the Lord Vishnu so obviously she was having all those qualities she understood it and India torsional constant bullying by the India's and where the injuries are taking to the world while to make me deluded the millions and millions of people are having the same problem and makes by your face I reached the end of this darkness I have gotten you a great guide Duan bargain Tom bargain the great guide Shankar Acharya in spiritual Amman he is mentioning three things are very very difficult to get only by the grace of God one can achieve the human birth desire to be liberated and finally and very difficult to get a good guide in the path now why he said like the majority of the people not that they are not religious but the religion means a little bit of morality practices that much what is the religion you just practice a little bit immorality I am NOT harming others I am NOT doing these in their and goody-goody man and versa so that is not religion that's why Shama he said religion is realization what is the realization understanding the truth what is the truth God alone exists that is the truth and the Robinson and Krishna here and there in different way he is mentioning if one is there then has many zero you put as the value if the one is not there zeros at zeroes Noel so God is the only so she understood and she is telling you are my god the best guy at this Bible God so I am NOT going to lose this opportunity and to get the kite is really really very difficult then in the eleventh verse she is mentioning that was the seventh one not the last eleven T she is telling - um - uh guitar home now listen to the word she is mentioning sharanam sharanam saw brick samsara Pooja Jigyasa pretty pollution namami such Dharma be done breached now Marshall domine David dreese gender coach apparently drunkard and not very good character person but he understood the mother is not ordered lady and she is the goddess to the god and she is the power grid is Chandra told this to heart brother who grew up along with the mother but he never believed it this lady using Goddess Durga it's a divine no no no no I know her very well we all grew up together she is just my elder sister that's all Girish was pursuing that man you are an idiot not understanding go and just hold the feet of the Divine Mother and say give me mu T go he persisted this man came half-hearted and then he touched the feet of the mother mother today what happened to you good thing is that exactly are you still English but he is persisting the Directorate and they think that you are a divine mother told her I am your sister this is maharaja though that young that person was born in the same family same parents grew up along with mother couldn't understand it's not so easy and that is why the deva katta didn't make any mistake the devotee accepted her son as the guru and giving the great respect to heart sharanam sharanam and taking refuge and it is a very important world I am taking refuge if we don't accept the wholeheartedly the ideology of all alert Italy for some no use we come to this temple go to that temple go to this mother go to that Mataji this is a good student of philosophy and that's all living here and there and nothing wrong but not going to be getting any spiritual progress now you have to accept one ideology and you have to continue in that nothing wrong in understanding others Octavio boycott of not calm in indeed they say you have to sit on your own videos or nitro G strongly but at the same time you go on telling yes it is good where you are going to that matter chief very good and oh yes that is very good that you are going on what they are having Prashad good all that mine is this so the heck is that individual choice and then accepting that you have to stick to that most of the modern minds they just want to have some idea what ramakrishna mission is doing let me go and check okay nothing so the parrot source and retain this thing that in India in where Hindus are having so many different sects and everywhere you go is good and everywhere I know the families and the in-charge ageism so no problem now you become a tourist guide that way but not the spiritual father you have to accept this and this is an ideology or accepting and then just a month this mother is telling I seek shelter indeed I seek shelter in d12 ah Kitana sharanam at this dish why because she understood this my son Rishi is not deluded at all no relation of mother son guru shishya and then she is telling Tom to our guitar I'm Sharon know you were the best teacher you like an axe kutaro cuts the trees of samsara for thy servants saranyam submit samsara row taro means the tree saranyam who have taken refuge in you sub Richter why the brigde he doesn't know know anything we'll never take any decision what even the master will say he will follow that is very brittle the brigde the word the servant why Salman is not any decision completely surrendered and I am here not taking any decision which is not a matter of jerk because you have to give up all your ego each and every one is having the ego and they always wanted to do something of their own following exactly what the master has said very difficult do you remember that story those who have played their biography of Sri Ramakrishna he comes to one of his direct disciple every great person he has take this cockroach and kill it outside and that young man why to kill she left that cockroach go and came back so now Krishna the great master he was sitting over there the moment he returned back did you kill that no it's not necessary I just left it whatever I say do that 100 person so that is the main thing and some of the people say why that disciple was correct why to show that it is not the question of all those things no emotion is the question of the the principle that Hank whatever you say I will do Xiaomi we become the group of young people came and they told trauma chided to accept us were cool was it then go and climb that tall tree and jump from there I have seen do I ready to do that I know my jumping from there it will be great benefit for you if the Guru says and I'm ready to do that he was perhaps scratching his head jumping no not that much the way to there whatever you say I will do that this another great if you read this book the wonderful books that they have and the vibes then only we can understand the one the Marathi gentleman he was in army British Army he heard the name of Xiaomi be vacant under and when he was on vacation in his village he came to know that because none of this training passed through their village but in the village station that won't stop and his British time punctual so that was one of the first time in the British in India they organized the problem now it is everything in global even a goat is dying they will block the train and all that and they will ask the government to find out the goat like that but that was British time this young man wait and sat on the train tracks they are waiting that actually news plated what to do and what not so many people the villager sitting they listen okay ask them to go and stand apart train will be very slow but it's not going to stop that is British rule is rule but for you say little it will be slow the slowdown requested sharmaji to come out stand at the door some it is dude this young man saw so many people saw he immediately decided I am going to follow him and he started running under the train he came my dad to be after Madras from eg left by that time again he was some people they helped him became to Calcutta and then he was searching Calcutta see naturally you know the East from the village background doesn't know English know Bengali and he reached into Calcutta Calcutta was the capital of that time India so the big city somehow you near East very little more and Shami he was very happy then afterwards in the one day family asked him to go along with another schwabe to purchase a car and told moment the cow is purchased it becomes to our customer hold the Rope of the car here the story begins when he was crossing the river Ganga and the moment it was purchased yacht star - Rani now we have paid the money the car cow is ours yes he mediately hold that rope because guru saved then afterwards that they were crossing the river but that time because of some maybe the year some waves the cow became afraid he jumped into the water this young man also along with the road jumped into the water without doing any swimming somehow he survived because cows are very good swimmers so somehow with the help of the cow he survived went another show other people ain't and brought the bird and shun his quality what is this you went along with the cow into the water and you don't know swimming how could save itself then then his answer was you asked me to do that I followed in words and that is the Guru the shisha means once have accepted I have said yes yes whether I am successful whether I'm dead no question but before that one should be careful to understand who can be chosen as cool so here it says I salute thee a homonym Ameen the greatest among the north-south Dharma be damned barista SATA Parma baton barista barista means that the grater so you are among the north of God he was the best and create to enlighten me about the matter and the spirit what the mother is asking G cos theta / dt / lucious here Gionta property Purusha what is that property mr. nature so that is the matter and pollution is spirit and we are having the to this body is the matter and within that there is a soul that is the spirit and without that soul without the spirit nothing is the earth this body have no use without that soul so tell me about that healing is questions written about the questions we can understand the mother was a very advanced soul though again and again she is digging I'm groping in the darkness I do not know anything of it please help me but she was in spiritually or that is philosophically with great advanced seeing the strong desire of the hoodie to get the liberation Kapila became very happy and he saved from 27 in the 15 verses 13 to 15 2015 version 13 to 27 the total 15 verses explain how to realize the truth I am mentioning this because poverty is a very big book it's very difficult to another once you start reading it will lost in so many stories and and from the earlier taking now only the Nuggets of course and you are taking out that and presenting because it won't be possible to complete the bhagavata when you are reading one gentleman he was telling dead do up the frames they are reading bhagavata in dollars and he was telling the shaman and we are reading we listen to you but we cannot relate so I decided that it is better to mention the chapter and the stoker so those who are listening over there they may be able to find out from where I am explaining the capital began by praising the benefit of spiritual concentration now why I am mentioning this word spiritual concentration concentration the one pointedness if you go to any scientist they are concentrated if you go and talk to them they can out there are so many stories about the great scientist and someone gave the break first and the scientist were busy in the lab then afterwards the big cat came ate the whole plate and when he saw the plate is empty he thought that he himself has taken that that was the scientist completely forgetful about his body even so here we find the scandal that is the book third twenty five chapter and so from 13 to 27 Kapila is green on even will choose one or two from there and he said yoga atomic up from some motto mystery star F me me it is the opinion my opinion this rias Arya for liberation mystery sire for liberation a topical means art ministre means very sincere here the art article means very sincere yoga effort to control the senses whom some is the best for the human being is my opinion matter of me so what is that vice pastor price if she is telling you have to control the senses really I was wondering when we think about the God realization and the people who have realized the God and there are so many what help they have done as we do same thing they have done they got up from the sleep then the big day in the aid then they all the things that we do regularly they also deed right from the Ramachandra jesus the put each and everyone then what specialty need controlling the senses that's all look at Sunday period on this photo she was practicing meditation in meditation just to be drawing the mind from where from the same subjects what happens you become Vivekananda if we come Christ if we come Lord Buddha just by that so the Kapila he is giving the advice what is that you have to will draw the censors from the same subjects and concentrate your mind and that is the best way for liberation what is the liberation the bondage and liberation the bondage because we have the desire to enjoy the same subjects that is the bondage and liberation completely free from the desire not that the same subjects will be destroyed the hair can detail for some other people to enjoy but for me no desire at all that's all sometimes some people who have developed a diabetic and very controlled mine they will go and see that's all people in the party they are having so many sweets varieties of sweets they will say ah very good then obviously the Indian people the nagging the no no no no way to be one day if you take one nothing is going to happen to you and you say it seems he is taking earth okay let me know you said not this thank you I've had enough of it so that is the self-control not that the sweets are not there it is there but you are not having the desire to take there of course the fear of the disease that is a different thing and when the desire completely gone for name fame Shamim Ramanathan and he'll known in his name when he was given by the Government of India the greatest that countries that have a word respect but my motion are something in the proportion he said no please don't give it to me the why because I won't be able to give the respect to that thing I cannot put anything before my name because my guru has given the name Swami Ramananda before that nothing and after the name if I put that which is the highest respect for the honor for the country that have been insult for my country that also I am NOT going to do that so don't give it to me can you imagine the people the whole life they always think I am going to get that and they'll be going and loving with the powerful people please give my name c21 papers I have published so many things of course now how do you rate the people but I published 20 200 papers like that they were doing then afterwards they will get that and then great honor they were mentioned Bharat Bhushan and this is this and that when here is the man you simply cry no desire what is the desire to be respected to be honored to be known no desire so that is exactly what is telling that you have to heart become very sincere Yoga nishta but they are becoming spiritual attention concentration maybe for many things but this spiritual concentration means you have to have the complete clear idea this world is temporary I cannot hold this thing all thing will go away then previously it is to say go and hold the water within your palm and if you hold the not a single drop will be there maybe just moisture will be there there so you cannot hold this life a little heavy the small little girl yesterday wonderful came she was very sweet and you feel like the attachment in that then slowly slowly that girl and grew up then she would develop a warm personality and still if you think oh that little girl mostly the grandfather's great-grandparents the thing in that way but by this time they have grown up then one power Swamiji who saw me the joining young used to think that I am still that young then he used to say alien man anonymity for tears because that year has gone so like this it goes because attachment because the emotion so this way we have to understand each and everything whatever we like or dislike is going to go away then what I am going to do with drawing the mind from there what had happened excellent piece not that I'm going to lose all those things that will be there that love that affection all those things will be there the joy the happiness will be there but no attachment that is the team then copy the money is telling it because of the psychophysical being the human being that is not the body of course we have to have the yoga those exercises so that our this body should be strong why because we have to reach to some goal and to reach to that goal the body is also the vehicle I cannot soon we have to those who are planning to climb on the top of the Mount Everest what do they do the first they do the exercises that they lit that body becomes strong so that they can climb and can fear that those things the same way those who are boxers most of the time they'll be doing exercises like that it goes here also what is really essential now I went to give the top over the meditation in the Art Institute and there they may be recorded another winter visitors are coming they will be using their the day I was telling this the yoga are two different times one which is helping the body another which is adding the mind the body and the mind this is very very essential important and here the body of course so you have to keep it free for this but he sees cooking disease you have to give much importance to the monument chief the Kalu a silver Dyer look to each apartment madam now where is the bondage in the mind where is the liberation in the mind it is not in the body when you feel pain very free pain in the mind and sometimes some people when they are non complete the mind is not acting at all conscious at all if you cut their legs also they won't feel like they're they will push the injection and you completely make you numb and then they will open your body they will operate you don't feel anything what mind is absent so that is why the cheese kallu are super tired and seems you were thinking that you were bound and you are suffering the world what is but the bomb bind us and the Moktar no no madam this is because of the mind Ganesha September dire return Bob MC McDowell now it says it is a view of the wise that the mind indeed is the cause of both the bondage and liberation of the beings goonies you suck tongue but tire if the mind is attracted to who knows see this is the problem of the indian scriptures they'll be using so many words and that's why you have to have the book ability very strong so with the different type of words will be there and they are using to explain you so what is he receive goodies you gonna miss the qualities what are the qualities sattva Raja and Tama these are the qualities and this saturation dhamma they are the permutation and combination the whole world so instead of telling the world here the Kapila is mentioning you nation if your mind is going to the gunas this quality is at the random on then it is going to the progressing further the means this nature means the power of the creation it becomes bound so that is the very clear goonies you September tire if your mind is going for these external world and simple way if anything that is changing temporally if your mind goes to that you are bound by that then what is permanent except God everything's in everything is impermanent except ramen everything is impermanent we also feel that you got to understand that but we cannot keep that in mind all the time that is the reason and then Bob Bart who see the Supreme Court Rotom attached moved ie if you attach to the Supreme God liberation so that in general he said then he is telling a Hammurabi mana tree comma Luka are the be humanely beaten yet Urbana shoot'em are to come also comes Imam and what happens if we can have their so not the copy distilling freed from the boston breed acceptor impurities not purity and impurity in the value what is very clear but the followers of the bhagavata will be sprinkling water don't touch me don't touch me that is the day economy they don't understand what the God said now you are feeling India high cost low cost we should not come into the temple and if hygiene is a different thing please come after bathing wearing a fresh clothes that is okay that I did because so many people will be gathering over here so if you are having some other problem please don't go that is a different thing but just because you were born in such-and-such and you speak in these before because you are working in so-and-so level so don't come no that is completely on going against God those who are really trying to serve God understand is no difference Raghavan see Ramakrishna say the devotees have no differences bhakti Giardini that releases the language the culture no difference why because the love God in the ramakrishna mission anyone can join and if the tradition of the hindus that only the brahmanas can take the sannyas another Muslim boys are also joining Christians are also there but mr. sutiya and Hindus indifferent they are coming in a ramakrishna mission in the first three years they should practice some discipline after than two years they will go to the head courses in the balloonman and under the care of the guru and practicing the spirituality meditation reading the scripture complete five years then again another four years completely in the nine years when they will test they don't check that your emotion your anger attachment all those molars all those impurities have gone then they will give you that you are considered as a brahmana the highest cost because you are constantly thinking of God so they will bestow the sannyasa run these notions and yesterday's very difficult to get very difficult so many will come but half of it they go away the because of things not that simply you go and get this one no and sometimes the mothers they don't understand they will purchase the Gateway and they will stitch is properly then will bring the son and give it to the president mother sharmaji give him sannyasa go and enroll your name over there and wit 14 years is not so easy so what is that purity you have to become pure what is the impurity thieves only comma lupa our TV our TV etc the only two things they say common desire and Noble that is also the hankering to gain there the last and greed that is the translation and last entry they are the impurities generated from health is generating I and mine the wind I and mine is there the mind becomes is not there that mind becomes pure and without an inter allottee it is in tranquillity then what this the question comes the wind and trying to understand the spirituality I must withdraw my senses first teaching I must be drop my senses what happens then you'll be purified how to beautify because your karma and lava will be completely gone and so when the gamma and lava is not there your mind is completely pure and in that pure mind what will happen then the cheaper the individual self endowed with three qualities knowledge renunciation and devotion when the impurity has gone only three quality will come the knowledge what is that knowledge knowledge of one man's though I am the student of Vedanta and then there that is good they Harlem but enthusiasm but what is the knowledge knowledge of one and when you are different known that they cannot cow and these and that no that will be difficult in the sometimes just for the taste sometimes we see and it is also necessary in Ganges we after the Saturday evening after all the for the retreat then we say devotees let us go to the beach and see the sunset to that beautiful beach over there in the Ganges friendly and then I say instead of disturbing the local people because if we go so many cards say 50 60 cards if they go over there they to be disturbances what other people also they won't get the chance to park their card you will share their car take 4 people by people in one car in them there you can understand some people will quickly go away without sharing the car but they are studying Vedanta so the practice is very very difficult to not just with someone giving a helping hand to someone understanding someone was very difficult and that is the practical thing if you don't do you may memorize the whole library nothing is going to happen to you why because the mind is impure and what is that impurity I had mine this is mine cover me and my husband Tony will go nobody else so that way this is the see Jana Jana means the knowledge of one then renunciation veiled argue what is the beta detachment from anything that is temporary only did she you anything that is temporary and there it is and the devotion that Scott Lochte and what is the 50 the moment we said the bhakti we always think of cooking something or offering something not like their victim is one point in love what is the bhakti one-pointed love and nothing else though the word they have used the bhakti and the definition or has the definition of 31.8 love that's concocting so if this three are there then experience of the Supreme Spirit transcending the nature in Kavala untouched by anything kilala ki mothership the Cavalia they say sometimes the cable or is that cable of untouched by anything that is cable eternal self-effulgent circled in design in divisive all and unconcerned he also see the property which has lost his binding force potential for two jessamine now in the same third book twenty-fifth chapter 17 and 18 verses the result of these practice is giving very interestingly the person who is successful in the spiritual life not only he will see that Brahman which is one everywhere but will also witness also see the power of Brahman the power of God the power of riccati by which all people that is the beauty and easy to say but difficult to do Kapila knew it the couple is telling said to I would say with it will be easy for you of course mother afterwards today we won't be able to reach to that the mother devotees not for hard perhaps for us she said still no I'm a very literate person please tell me more easiest way the Coppola will give that advice maybe in the next Sunday we will discuss there he says one pointed devotion to death all-pervading man presenting our being this is the best way copy distilling nah sorry show Asti Shiva on top yogi now promising tere naam siliceous t who don't have any comparison like that what is that Cebu Punta Shiva hear the word Shiva has been used and people sometimes misunderstanding see the bhagavata they also are Shiva Shiva is not that Shiva if the Shiva means best sheep upon top the best you mean on promising day what is that understanding that Brahman is one and that consciousness is presenting a flipping frames those who are the students of Swami Vivekananda spirit Rafi didn't you feel that we make and introduce that same thing GB premium college age on who is loving the living beings he is worshiping the God supreme god and that's why he began the with great conviction he saved by unselfish work he will reach the same goal where put the wrist by his knowledge and Christ by sprayer and he saved that unselfish work is the best part seen the know about that and you have to help people how help me the so many organizations of the air they are ready to help people but here how he is helping them thinking understanding realizing their regards that's right to embrace that idea we become the same mind guard the down to the special object of worship the poor the downtrodden the illiterate oppressed trains that is the main thing we have constructing huge churches building temples and so many things but just with the side of that people are suffering we don't think about it if you go to the different temples is greeting so much of wealth when we were showing these to God do you think God like those things it's a great mistake of course we can have a big temple for our own purposes we'll go and see that is ok but when there's an opportunity or necessity to help the that first that slash committee said and he has we find he said one pointed devotion to all-pervading earth man one pointed devotion to all-pervading Artman that is the main world that means the Hartman is present in a everything and mainly the manifestation of that is besting the human being so show me TC human beings the moving to barnacles but the Jews travel nothing means the temple the moving Tabernacles the human being if you can some people are suffering you just listen to that they are suffering as a great service they want to do something just help them as as possible to create help the great service to God the couple gives another suggestions prashanta Oh Jeremy portion at manoa cover ubiduo sir evil sod Shukla to moksha Dharam of our Britain first he said capita said that to serve the people who are there because within them the gods are there and second is if you go to the body people and have their companion friends the time is up in the next discourse we will take up this wonderful topic who is a union the way that he will go to a holy person but how to understand who is only Pina is giving that definitions Shankar Acharya is giving Raghavan C Ramakrishna's giving and see Lama Childress guru he is also giving the definition of the holy person we will try to understand their this is very practical suggestions because unless we know those things we won't be able to make any advancement just going to Temple having little another solace oh we came to Temple that's all and having a mark on your forehead it's okay for you go ahead but those who are very sincere to make the progress in the spiritual life you must have to understand these two three steps otherwise it is impossible let us change this mantra and then you can young Brahma Boden Andromeda student II did a study be the sound but the gram ha Upanishad EE Guardian saga the on our sitter that did the Deen of Allah saw
