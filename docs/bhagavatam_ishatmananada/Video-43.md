[Bhagavatam 058 : The Self Alone Is The Teacher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6dr9AmmElE)

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hudiburg was afraid to lose his friend and of course the master Sri Krishna who decided to give up the body now all of the people as we have already seen that they developed okay the some people never cared for that with the Krishna is dying or not and some people who came to get advice to see themselves not about depression so we find three different type of groups the province the ramakrishna is telling there are two different types that three actually the two mainly what are those Anton de barranca the devotees are two different types what are very close under other they understand the philosophy they feel for the that person who is practicing that leaders are very close and another group there from outside they also support but not so close and third is there their only supplier they give something and then they throw paper at them so like these three groups here we find the one room not at all caring for the Srikrishna now we are all crying playing our Krishna please come and when the prisoner was in person there so many people they've ever cared about Russia and second group they were thinking how to set themselves so they were taking the advice but here we find one person would so the very close devotee never review so Ultima came and he would I was asking that please don't the body then where we will go he said we actually he you meant it what I'm gonna go without you I cannot get the guidance I cannot get the inspiration please be here so he was going on praying like a child and Shri Krishna is giving the answer what he was trying to Krishna the he was trying to give him the inspiration so you must stand on your own feet where you are depending on me so first he's saying it is in the eleven skander 7th chapter 10 verse of the word father bottom Gianna big Gianna some yoga are totally didn't Atma a new power to start mom now under how he began nursing the history Jana began a salute to words I was wrong kitchen also now and then he has used his two words Jana and began what is God so that we will come to there afterwards but at the general meaning of this being possessed of knowledge and realization John big Jana Sangh Yoga is having the knowledge and realization and then with your mind satisfied with the realization of the self and feeling the very self of all being even not face any of struggles now the onion say no struggles will be there so he is telling the his disciple could double if you have the knowledge actually what I am and what is this universe and if you realize that then you won't have any desire and when there is no desire there is no misery there is no pain there is no problem the human free so he is going on telling them that we find the same type of instruction in the breeder denomination and deliver under culture says Gianna he is giving the example and from there is they those who are explaining they are quoted from the earth from the period are none he says Gianna what is that Gianna Brahma atomic graha seen what is knowledge Brahma eaten of grub are sealed EDA means this manifestation in the beginning of the manifestation before anything was there there was been so this is breeder no competition Brahma Baba Edom Agra RC this cell was verily Brahman in the beginning so nothing except that self then second state does man atmanam a very humble March me so then hims to say I knew only I am Brahman except remember nothing was there so if anything is thinking whatever thing Brahman if I don't know anything else what I cannot think of some people in the religious and even good here to some people they were wondering that you say India what is that India you don't know so obviously that will never come to your mind so there was nothing else except the Brahmin so the thought also came the smart mana Eva 8 what is there that thought came what is that uh-hum promise me and that Brahmin in the third stage this man from that that servant above earth that that means this universe everything above earth was created it was created from that does not that serve the first chapter the Brotherhood operation is the tenth verse it says like this this does not that sarvam our birth from that Grumman this universe manifested nam why they are putting this in the beginning there was only brother and the thought was that remember and from that government everything has gone he is everything is Brahman the year of Subramani whatever why you are crying what you are thinking you are separated I and you are the same as the Jesus said I and my father in heaven are one he never said look at it he never saved my father is there in the heaven and I am here he never stood like that he said are one we are both the same but under this is pure redundant we you sing but now if you analyze oh this is the only begotten Son of God so they are same but we are we will help you you are thinking to separate yourself and thinking that you are Cena thinking that you are we - what to do but God never said like that the jesus said I am the way I am the path if that is so what is his path unity unity of what jihad mind Paramatma so I and my father in heaven are one and the kingdom of heaven is within you why don't you understand that it's pure be done third we love Jesus because of that we respect Jesus because of that on 2014 we please come and he will see that we are celebrating the Jesus with all whatever possible way we can why because we love Him we respect him why do we love and respect people he told the began told me so that is the thing here he's also telling the smart from that from that means from the Drummond Sullivan of a world and everything in this world from there from the Drummond and if from the Brahman you are also dominant that was the argument to that we the Lord was giving the apartment and what is big Ana realization of this but once anomalies to use all this a very rustic village background he said see it is like this if you have heard about the milk and the what the milk can do how it helps that is called young but you have brand and really got the effect of the good quality of the milk that's gonna be gamma the God is there God is all-powerful and if we pray to God God will protect earth is all guiana his own knowledge but if you truly believe and not only dad realize that is called Big John Gianna Vicki on knowledge and the realization so that is Raghavan see Ramakrishna for anything and everything you should run to see Kali what is that Carly no student still now it is their same image but we can't go and talk to that stone image we rather find the worshipers of Pujari's and self can you please do this and then we don't talk to that Kali talent avoid neutralization but we know this image is the image of all-powerful goddess that knowledge is there realisation is not there but cinema Tichenor realized this is the mother it is giving the birth protecting and also destroy so this is the difference began and she really nam what is the Sharia anyone having the physical body the and and also tano's who knows but the best is the human being the sharing any naam that means the human and also gods the course are also having the body but that body is not like hers the celestial body so we have a different type of body the cars have different different body but they're also they're having the body whatever don't be afraid rather try to reverse the plume money the Krishna was then he's a father those who realized Rahman they become free from all desire hence not bound by any result of any action if you don't have the desire so you are not bound by the action well that is the wonderful way he's doing so suppose you've realized that everything that we see is all temporary so naturally the desire to act were to be nothing will be there we have purchased on behalf of the Vedanta Society a church in the northern side of Chicago do you think it belongs to me I was jumping going here and there being brain Tsukuba didn't get the money and after that with that money I purchased but it doesn't belong to me in society and while we are purchasing there are some things so that the society human society at large will be benefited so they will know because I was planning with some of our devotees that we will try to invite all that current into the sect's and actually request them to seat on the same tires and to discuss what are the commonalities why we don't receive each other why you don't like each other what is the problem problem is our ego not the God we will invite the cationic the British turn the Mormon and all we will ask them to sit and say you all love Jesus and what is your problem then so let us try this is the whole planning I don't know how far it will be possible and in the beginning to be so difficult but the more the modern society grow very easy and it'll be so wonderful isn't it so that is that way so if one of us the spiritual teachers the modern teachers inspiring the human being the morality yesterday I attended a program with the Hindu temple they organized for the young the technocrats like that professionals the young professionals are very less the heart is not for us but they are trying to inspire them what is that along with the profession there should be morality so in the beginning itself they kept me to speak about the morality but I found only our world devotees not the young people the young professionals so I mean obviously I just shortened when to talk and came back trying concept I was having some program over here so this is the thing if we don't learn then how can I help and what to learn more ality what is that morality you belong to the society you belong to the society that is the morality you should not do anything in any way you toward your action you the talks you words should not harm the human society why because he was sitting on a tree that is Kalina society and if you are cutting the same branch on which you are sitting what will happen so this is what's called the spirituality and true morality so he said if you don't have to deserve so naturally you won't have any problem and again be saved one who sees Brahman becomes completely free from and death so these are the ways the Sri Krishna is trying to inspire Buddha and obviously for all of us there are many many devotees who says we don't like to take initiation from the balloon mark around estimation because once a lifetime only I can get the touch and blessings of my guru and then afterwards I cannot I cannot go close to so many people obviously you cannot go and touch the feet of the president mother who is 90 92 years old it's not possible so then naturally they'll be keeping in a distance you can go and from this day so we did not get the satisfaction of talking with the guru sitting with you serving him not so they say but if we have the Guru like otherwise so they'll be coming visiting staying with us this is different time and here it says why you are different even guru all the time my guru so much from evolution that used to say don't call me good I have introduced to you with the bronze non-christian good everything for high because the dependence mixed a one week I know that this is the way I have to call I have the knowledge now it is my effort so that is called the self confidence that is exactly what Krishna is trying to keep to firstly say see it is possible gonna be Gianna sanyukta if you have the knowledge and the realization no problem what is the Gianna that everything is nothing but drama why because from Brahman everything is created this is gap and began realize it how you realize seeing everything as the manifest of the same room man the telescope in Guiana and the woman do you have the big Journal that idea everything is nothing but God Prince even wonder what is called big calendar I said I think disciple of swami vivekananda committee he used to call him Gupta because he has a son named Gupta before joining she was dedicated to shiny and Sun he told each and every human soul every soul is nothing but dumb man and he realized himself you know how there was a patient his whole body in those days there's no proper body and it made a medicine and proper treatment so he developed other in his League particularly third toe it was rotten so it was terrible painful the cook to March when the people used to call in come to mothers and good to management about the earth and he used to call everyone God God what happened to you time in great being said so where it is the pain in the toe I feel that the fakirs are there they're biting me he's really very trained oh then how you think that you will get little that free from that thing how can I help you if one who take out all those things from that leg I think it would have been better you know what he started sucking that fever my god is it possible and that is color there is nothing and nothing except drama now only just reading the books and now it is good not like that this is called big Gianna the realisation everything is Brahman and nothing else but the ones around kishna was having cancer throat cancer and people those whose to come because all rich people high society Brewster visited so naturally some people used to come not for sluggishness but to get acquainted with those high society people a taste to come and mister apparently show the great respect for am Krishna and then they will have said this is my address card can I come and meet you this one a business the social it was all right you know the why he took that he was a god you could say himself but then he took that to see his ailing one place Karan Arjun has a reason that I have developed this why now I can understand what true devotees and only those people these young people they were there with him constantly serving him and they were young boys they are not hardening so some devotees these two come and eat the money and they still physically serve tl9 24 hours they were starving and ceramic dish never scuffing and he cannot go every time to the toilet so they should keep dad in one place everyone was doing all but man was ready to clean that but at vessel not in the not game show me Vivekananda used to look after the outside world arranging money and all that he once gave me this is well why you're not cleaning then everybody told party no this is a cancer if we go and touch that maybe it is contaminated from here oh my god are you thinking that way and that will you serve him he is God Himself can't understand that he's the God every part of him is nothing but God and then to demonstrate you can imagine what he did he took death and drank that can imagine this is coming gianna nothing in this world as except from and nothing in there so that is called bky c ramakrishna toward the you and me are not different texas Teresa there are others they were also very close they were also very devoted this is not only not only good too so that is called knock that out of emotion out of knowledge what is that knowledge nothing in this world don't try yourself without that knowledge but when you do you must have that knowledge you must have that realization then you will never ever find that it is the filthy things you will find that it is a holy passion so this is called began and the moment you realize that you're free from birth and death again he see it soluble water sewage Shanta Jana began with Shia question but auto-completion not be but the interviewee buna began he is telling and impress rising they're realizing the oneness gonna be keanu nice chair this chair is certain about the knowledge and realization and this is Vedanta belong to never say believe without to say understand and how you understand and through argument through analysis through practice through feelings understand that and then accept it so this is called beyond a big journalist chair realizing the oneness janab economies chair one become friend of our being servo motor shield in the Hinduism sometimes the people they say the Hinduism there is a the wonderful way they prayed long long bad a whole universe is our relatives but just clear didn't feel that the feeling should come and the feeling comes in the sannyasa oddly why because we don't have any attachment we don't have any family we don't have me and mine we don't have any thing to oh if I don't go to that person you'll be hungry then he may not give me the money well no nothing like that we depend on God if God gives it is okay if don't gave us okay this is mine not mine everything I still pray to God and I always say like that this is your world and you have given the thought into my mind and that's right thing if you don't do don't tell you know proverb for me I am very happy because if extra pressure is coming so that is that I don't care because it is God so I am doing it so it is telling like this server puta streets Shonda why am trying like this some people they can't they're also Hindus the same why you have give this Jesus and Buddha they don't give us Ram Tichenor have you ever seen that any Church they're giving sluggishness picture why you should keep it doesn't mean that it since they are not keeping but because they don't understand and if you understand naturally you should do there's a difference and what is that son of a motor slipped shall it only leave these and never practice what is the degrees of them in business it is and that teaches that understanding the knowledge and realizing the truth you've become the friend of all and your mind become free from anxiety Shanta also he sees mean everything question mark at Markham Vishal and that is in RISM and he sees mean the God in everything that is exactly what Sharma ji said the why you see this world seek God the God is here no emotion but reality how because there was nothing but the brahman and how to provide everything has come so obviously this is one plus one equal to two like that the God created this universe out of his own so God morning what else so this EC and sugar labored in narrative Shri Krishna very forcefully he was giving them assisted them and thought anyway the man is understood that even the sugar was listening that he told you know what I haven't do whatever we create humility he approves the Lord and said O Lord of yoga you occasion you have described in a path of renunciation it was good I accept the path of renunciation that you are teaching me but it is not for me why I have the desire I want to be with you I want to serve you and all those desires are there no it is not this path is not for me see stealing the euro-asia this path is not for me Sonia selection on the giving the ego but how can i if I give up my ego you won't be there and I cannot think of it you should feel always in me so you and me that should be there other people working let them follow but I want you so this is called love the path of love just like a child laborer mother is telling see I am so PC mine your name or she will never agree no no no you should be here so that is called the love you would Tubber he was also having that he seen daca William - shut up one it is very very difficult so the please helped me now he is giving as a Nvidia wonderful he isn't putting himself he said Oh Lord whom you have considered as sweet person Niassa that is a mistake I am NOT he said so I am mom why are we eating morality be God taught my yarn bitter cheetah at Manny's on Monday Oh Lord you considered me as a field person to become a sannyasi no no no no so why are that I am deluded so I moved over there I know you would be telling the time oh this is a mistake I know I am worthy so this is the best approach in now we must understand what is our position there's somebody said something and immediately will jump onto that now you should understand what is your position Lord Krishna is telling in follow this pattern and you say that is not my path because we do not consider like that one of my friend we were together Ramachari for nine long years then afterwards when it was the sannyasa he was a very good person then ordinate person yes EMP applying person the answer to our president Mirage they delivered then I told what happened to you you are so close what happened to you he said nine years had tried and I said no the desire is there I analyzed my mind again and again nine long years and then I found no I'm going to cheat mine so and also the world if I accept the table give them is complete renunciation look how's things here I still respect him I still had connection with him why they're sincere so he told not this is not my paths unless it's not knowing but maybe in some other birth I was seen but this time I have to go I have to settle I have to marry her to earn money because all desires at the end at looking problem so this is the way it should and he's also telling you thought that I'm a good fit candidate for sannyasa know that's the mistake so I'm not right I am very much attached to this body because a tunnel regardeth on but it was attached to this body it's not possible and that is because of your Maya that is because of your Maya there's sometimes some of the sannyasis they will be putting the care and sama so it is like this like that but I keep everything very nicely so when I was promoted from then from the first day onwards then this today hey why you are so careful about the dress I don't know I like it so let me start with this suddenly I will become that some people they will squeeze their dress like these to show that they are careless I don't know I'm cheating people no I won't do that I like this smartness and proper care and before going out I go and stand before the mirror I see that now I am really Jerrica through tea ok they don't have it go but when I was in tapasya I was practicing austerity all alone in Himalaya they never cared at all this so that is a different thing but unnecessarily to just impress people having anything one gentleman came in mom can yesterday I am very humble you see I'm small hard and I'm happy and it is so small when I lie down my the feed goes out but that's such a small room I am happy at what is it to communicate America not only that almost all the 50 states you got a visiting in America the Gila devotees are giving the money Michael that money utilize to make it room for you while you are visiting here so all of these hypocrisy we hypnotize ourself thinking that we have created long wrong this endeavor is very clear he said said Krishna this is no more of everything krishna is telling no no you made a mistake I am NOT that person I am diluted and I am attached to the body and I are say that is because of the man because of your my Ironbound I was not one different because of you not you have to save me we have to save me this is good bit of my ability to I am attached to this world son birthday Oh God Raghavan kindly instruct me and who is me your important forward he's using the world anew shoddy brittany.brittany is the servant servants are done that I can practice easily give me that process by which I can easily I can practice this theory is not possible for me Nikita Meena on Gaza uncle's amines easily so he is telling their sannyasa giving up attachment is not for me because I as to this body hence Oh Lord instruct me some other methods that I can easily practice and feeling that Krishna it says he I know under this much you better go to some other teacher I didn't always say that you stand on your own feet except etc only be done - I know you better go to some other teacher he understood that is a very clever everybody immediately steady surface it ISA Trisha Atman at man onion but our amnesia be bhootish opener on you jab shield item 17 verse history even among God's I find no other teacher of the cell than you you don't say that go to other person because I've already checked and I found forget about the human being even among the gods there is no one like you so we must teach me so you have the sub difficult journey but tug of war was going on Krishna Murali Krishna was going on pressurizing him putting him you must stand on your own feet you cannot expect that I have you all through with you that is not possible the he is a game-time telling him the transitory means the he is pulling in this way and the devotee putting another day you should be with me you should be my tire you should be my teacher and Krishna tolerate how long son actually is it now Krishna is giving the argument in this world there are people without Maya they are realized truth Rani Lomonosov monachan okay Manu chalukya means in this world prana frequently so many people are there Liu seanny they are very capable to understand the truth some would turn the heel at mana at Lieber a super are Shia from a sugar are Shia evil desires from death they help themselves and they got freedom after in this human world there are people who know the world who know the word means temporary everything is passing they understand this world is completely temporary constantly changing as long as I am here it's okay that much don't get attached to this and help themselves through self effort to get out of evil desire selfie for the krishna once again telling him the disciple of Lord Buddha on Ananda he also was crying when the Buddha decided to give his body 82 years old with Buddha was 80 at that time he was trapped and he means in those days it was a long life he said an 80 now I should go and now why were crying onon the was crying in the same way and cooked up I did who told you at Modi oh you should be your own master that is how the Buddha was teaching when we once now he has not decided to give up his body then all they came and they were crying including Marshall Advani then ceramic Tichenor told where I am going for his date and going from this room to that room the dead means nothing I'll be there my spirit will be there and always with you only what do you will be there and then he said in this way from this room to that you it's nothing so that is to understand the war what is this world manifested and when the world is not there unmanifested but it is there so we have to understand he is telling there the in the nineteenth verse of the bhagavata Prai nominee John Oakey look at the projection our local doctor Wednesday understanding this world so not aren t he at man eternity they are helping the themselves couldn't tell the heart mana at me how are cleaver through their own argument through their own booty a understanding or sugar gosh aiyah all the time people cannot help you all the time guru cannot help you all the time teacher cannot be with you so you have to help yourself how understanding what is good and what is bad and that is the reason all the time and afterwards Lord Krishna he is also encouraging themself country to second in this world there are people who could realize the truth of this world what is that they realized the truth of this world what is that truth in this world then Korea garner some hundred in Sanskrit they say Korea means cause the end effect cause and effect car karma karma is the cause Konoha the great cause and effect a man was going and there was a forest near the forest he found that is slain animal a data element somebody chopped it and there was a so dogs I know there now this is the picture is so distant a dead animal was there and it was obvious that the sodas got died animal and that's why it is dead this is now shall we see the soul has killed the animal no the sword cannot kill the animal there must be human being somewhere the human being used that soul to kill the animal is a date this is called inference you didn't see them human being or anywhere you saw only two picture did anymore and the sword but now you can understand that not this is called inference the heroes of this world in this world we see the stone we see the heels it's not moving it is not talking it's not as if leaving and the tree that was planted by great-great-grandfather still there it is not moving but a human being at them they're moving the beings are also their animals and birds they're also moving so two different types of things appear okay now who has done it just like that did animal and the soul it is a body and the intellect is there but there must be somebody someone who is conscious and playing the things so this is inference how can we come into conclusion that there must be God which is concerts and all-powerful by this only there is a person a God who can put the consciousness in the inert mind is our body is completely not when he died is inert our friends relatives are very close one that throw this body as quickly as possible to dispose of why the body is not important it is inert inside the body there was something which is consciousness which we actually we like to endowed because of that consciousness we like that body not for the body but what the consciousness this you understand and we're from the consciousness scheme and how the consciousness were attached with the inert body there must be someone which is really really intelligent so he has done him we call him God so how he is God how we understand God by inference so direct knowledge or three inference also we can then say Krishna emphasized on self effort is telling Hartman on guru god mom eeveelution appreciated Hartman guru Hartman your mind here are promised your mind is your guru now whenever you are trying to do something wrong a part of your mind is dead no no this is not good you should not do it though that bias is faint but it's still there ask anyone and go to any the reformatories the jail and ask those people who are there that they will say yes in our mind that thought came but they never bother about that so we committing a scene before that my mind comes up and try to stop me but I don't listen that is the problem so there's a Hartman or guru this is a teacher who is a teacher and what is this guru they're using the word guru means who help helps us to go beyond the ignorance so that is guru is always doing good sometimes they'll say yoga guru this guru that good even the thoughts they will have their own gurus even the pickpocketers they will have their own depth are not good the Guru the word means those who are helping others to go beyond the ignorance and what is the ignorance the causes that makes us suffer now the mother and father they asked a young child please go and sit for your education and the won't ask didn't also check what the teachers has commented over the error every time they are doing though they are busy even then they are doing why so the child should not suffer afterwards so what is the Guru's word these only to do something so that that my student my son my children should not suffer the Guru helped said that is called guru one who is helping us to go beyond the suffering that is called guru and this guru he is helping us from acquitting what is that I told you that in Andaman he was having only little money and impurity 500 rupees I was spending 450 orphaned children with them to take them and to naturally other Swami's and other people total almost 57 people here they're very costly placed the on demand ball player how to survive every day I was commenting even one degree nod as to see the two are not going what a sponge and their knowledge is one like that I understood what is poverty over there and God showed me that right from my birth I never saw poverty I never could feel what his hunger in and Amma in God totally taught me that I was so much greed what will happen next day next day and at that time a person came offering me bath full of money a huge where one person cannot lift it to three people and for the thousand dollar a thousand rupees notes full up there and there was no one I was the master but the God was within me so I felt I should not touch it this is sinful he is hiding this money because that another the financial organization they come and rake up into North so his house was that they targeted so he was thinking too and where to kill under the weight of the schwa meeting the no one is searching no one will think that it is there I don't know no one was there I couldn't even take that and he were telling me there are four bags they told keep the four bags and we will take after seven days will take only three one bangle before you I myself lifted that and kept it back in the car please take it who was the mind my consciousness my achma why because unless amazing I am working for the people and why take except this thing of money I should not the one great spiritual leader she told I don't see the color of the money I accept all types of money and then hell no roundish the mission is negative that the moment you are going to give money and there is asked your name your address and all the information we may suffer but we should not exit who is teaching us just the krishna is telling make your own mind your guru and that by that way you'll be helped self alone is the teacher and particularly of the people to direct perception and inference they gave the other ization of the truth here about the self alone is the teacher and by that way you are constantly judging this world is changing every moment it is changing you know that your identity card sometimes some people will give 20 years own photo and they're very happy I look so good but in reality it is not is about changing even I am changing every time my face is changing her but this is nothing if your hand changing world is changing and anything that changes cannot be true and if the world is not true then what is root must be something else that is called the way of judgment and then we come to the conclusion there must be someone somewhere who is holding it and making all the changes that is called inference and through the inference you go and see it's true until you that once I we were going to amour not four of us four new Xiaomi in 18 1986 we were ardent in the and we got the little vacation of one month and faster you went to Amman out in touch me and that was not the power time is all snow-covered somehow secretly for with one of us we hired some their horses and horseback we are bear so Thailand and these people the four people they were helping us and then one person was there he was little naughty he - oh my God look at that snow that we should not go are we already gave hundred percent whatever they wanted money but half way and now we climb we have two decent halfway from their French attorney that is the place and he was telling when we cannot go suddenly I noticed that the smoke is coming up from one of the houses that few houses were there kiss close by today the smoke is there that means fire is there the smoke fire means you and being is there no animal will come and light the fire so must be human being quicker and truly that is called inference smokey still that whisper had is there and the fire means human being we infer then we reached over there truly human thing goes there and that is called ionization the inference that must be God practicing that way then realization obviously it should be so then that is the way we should proceed and our guru the Lord Krishna's telling be your own guru among the human being those who are of the balanced mind deidara's and capable of practicing knowledge and yoga knowledge means this there is nothing but God and yoga means practicing regularly to control the mind some Cayuga Bashara the heart be orally proportioned Imam the all-powerful selfish of the Hoople iran and directly realized me progression the directly real as me so what first concluded mine and what is this mind different thoughts how the thoughts are coming back calculation that we are better bleeding the mind is the problem and what is this mind different thoughts when the thoughts are coming because of her sense is going out and collecting information and that is putting over there you know now in America people at their American passport holder are green card holder marble but they will keep information of India and they are agitated the moment few Indians are meeting then on a cup of coffee they'll say what is happening in our country is there what is this because attachment so because we have about country we cannot forget our society wherever we are the scene which they see you have to understand why you are agitated test how we can give up that that's meant by understanding whether I am agitator or not nothing is going to happen it will go like that and slowly you can withdraw your mind to self control people find the truth through analysis through symbols through inference what is the symbol we find that Raghavan Salam Mishnah he's suffering so much still praying to God o God please keep good thoughts in the minds of the people why he's doing them and he never accepted any money in even he could not touch the money even then though I am a follower of Ramakrishna but I
