[Bhagavatam 076 : Swadharma Of Ashramas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DBvBYKEpz1Q)

dear devotees friends let us begin our sunday talk on the bhagavata with this the beautiful uddhava he asked sri krishna to tell him about the various laws and duties prescribed for the various caste and station of life we are studying that this is important why as we have already discussed if the dharma the system of morality is not there i am using the word system of morality as dharma why because that transform the mind purifies the mind detach the mind from the worldly objects so these are the duties anything that the society is taking for the society's sake it's a society means so many people together obviously all individual in their own individualistic way if they behave will that be a society no so similarly one individual whatever he is doing is affecting the whole humanity and particularly modern days we can understand it very much the communication it has made the whole world so close in any part of the world if someone is doing something wrong and creating some problem for himself whole world humanity is affected by that we are suffering so that is the way we have to understand what is dharma it is a some kind of discipline that the human being should follow not only for his own individual benefit but for the benefit of the whole society all humanity so that is called dharma dharma for the human being and it is holding us as a human being the majority of the people they don't understand and they're angry actually not with dharma but some of the ritualistic way that dharma has been introduced in the different periods of time it is obvious so we should not discard the dharma we should not discard the religion just because some people misused it or misusing it we should try to understand it properly and that is the reason we are reading this scripture at the bhagavata and in the bhagavata swa dharma is a great word if the swadharma is practiced the whole society will be a perfect society if the king is practicing his swadharma as a king the very good administrator and without any narrowness as because these people they belong to my team so i will only support them whether they are doing good or bad no question or others even they are doing really good but as because they are not in my team i am not going to support them rather creating problem for them this is not the king's duty so raja dharma there's a beautiful word raja dharma the one who is sitting and that position should understand it and should feel it he is the master of the whole society taking decision for everyone he is the father figure of the whole society dharma and the judge giving the judgment even his son has done something wrong his hand should not shake to write the punishment for his son even dharma the same way all the society in different level if they are practicing dharma and if we see that i always say that what is god god is only two things love and unselfishness and nothing else we talk about god we go to temple churches mosque synagogues for what god but what is god that image that or the symbol or that particular place or the book that is writing about him no and that is the beauty of swami vivekananda he's very clearly said about it even in the veda if they say after the realization you don't need the vedas the vedas are only guidances so we have to understand this the friends the best person who is teaching us the dharma over here is bhagavan sri krishna he practiced it in his own life and he created it so he is talking his friend and disciple he is asking this question to him and he is giving the the cast and the station in life this is the specialty in the hindu society sanatana dharma they created this why according to the capability of a person a person is not capable to rule and if you place him as a king what will happen he will take all the assistance below him lower than him so that will be a pygmy type of thing so naturally those who are capable that particular person should be in that particular place for the benefit of the society so they divided after observing the capacities qualities they divided the human society in four different castes and brahmin who is a brahman capable to control the senses and the mind he is a brahmana capable to control the senses and the mind friends we will we are repeating almost why because this is very important to understand everyone's mind should be very clear particularly those who belong to the hindu society they themselves are also criticizing the caste system because the misutilization of the system but the system that was developed it was so good so great a person can be i i i will come to the other the sources where they say it is not by birth but by the karma but by the capacity to work but by the quality that the person is having i will quote from our own scripture from the hindu scripture and this is very very important the control of the senses and the mind first quality second austerities he can for beer austerity means tapasya the brahmin has the capacity to practice that then containment always happy forbearance compassion truth and devotion to god anyone having these qualities should be called as brahmin so this is the first grade the someone who is having the capacity to understand the mechanism of a thing and they are very intelligent they are very smart in understanding the mechanism of a machine another person cannot do that shall we fight no this mission belongs to me should i should do it and then afterwards you can't use the machine rather break that machine because you don't understand so the society should be governed society should be divided into these four parts it is there only they don't say brahman except to the intellectual people and not only intellectual highly moral people because they can control their mind and their senses they understand what is good for others and good for the society they should be on the top they should be given more respect if we are not respecting the scientists the doctors the engineers the good administrators the good teachers where the society will go we have all respect for riksha pooler but if we ask the riksha pooler or any ordinary person who is not having the capacity to go and take care of a hospital and prescribe medicine just think of it the catastrophe so the same way a person who is capable to control his senses and we know how difficult it is just try to control your sense and you'll find what difficulty and that is the reason all the religions they prescribe fasting why because the body wants food now you have to control and every religion every they'll be asking you to control all your passions all your desires a particular time at least for that particular time maybe 15 days one month you should practice this control this among the hindus you will find for the whole month they will put on the gerua saffron color the dress and they will become the one month sannyasi they won't go to the house they will never do anything normally they do nothing they will just try to become a sannyasi and try to follow the all the practices of the sannyasi in restraining themselves once in a whole year only for one month 30 days but that is the great teaching training so one who all through his life practicing that shall we not respect him the controlling of the senses the anger and naturally his intellect is becoming very sure concentrated and as because he is not having the attachment to anything he can judge thing and very nice way so the brahmins are the best judges the true brahmins then come the shatriyas they have the strength they have the courage they should have the valor ability to be a pain or they should be generous industrious and natural tendency of leadership should be there otherwise a shattry or cannot be shattriya because we are reading now a long long before all the shatrias they were the kings the administrators so they are mentioning the shatrias and now it is in the modern society majority of the countries almost all the societies they are democratic societies the people are choosing them but we have to choose those people who are having this type of capacity to rule the country otherwise it will be very very difficult so that is the reason the person who is really having the strength so that should be if you are joining in the army or in the military these are the qualities if you don't have the strength not up the courage then that will be a great punishment if you are joining just for some salary no then you from the beginning from the first day you will go on thinking when to go away from this place the shattray is the love that it is in their nature so see our ancestors the great rishis they were great thinkers and they understood the people who are having this type of temperament and if we put them to meditate if we ask them to concentrate what will happen to them hypocrisy they will only close their eyes and they will doze up they will sleep and then whole life they will go on cursing the system but if you put that man according to his nature to that particular position you'll be so successful so that is the idea the shatriyas the strength the courage valor ability to bear pain generosity industry and a natural tendency of leadership that is the nature of the shatrias and the third con the bashas d faith in god that is the bhashya d faith in god they are philanthropic and charitable by nature humble and not satisfied with wealth this is the very important thing not satisfied with wealth earning in the is the nature of the bashars that if they become the fifth richest man in the whole world then he will go and say oh i'm only the fifth four person before me i have to become the first so that is the desire it is not bad that is the nature so obviously if you are asking a monk to become those who doesn't want all those things if you force them no you should be a businessman what will happen they suppose a father insisting a son who is having a monastic attitude wants to be alone doesn't want all this wealth and forcing dame to become a businessman because he is having that business the sun should inherit what will happen that is the thing so one should understand the capacity de faith in god that is the uniqueness of the business people if they are not having but only running a huge institution you should know they are not actually the bushes bishops are very good people very good people they go on taking all the culture from one part to another the whole world become united they know each other because of the bushes not only there they are sailing things marking dishes or the materials they also carry the culture in the olden days they used to go in a big group and they used to hire some other people to protect them and in that caravan in that procession in that group they used to take different type of people like a philosopher artists globe tartars and the teachers they used to go along with them businessman is to give them all shelter protection and these people used to go from one place to another this is all in the history so these are the capacities of the bushes and the last group they're very good people but not capable to think they are there in their mind they like to serve ask them to do something very happily they will do and always satisfied people and they are known as the sudras sometimes we think oh they are the worst people they are the last batch no no no no the lord said they have come from my feet that that is the description they were born out of my feet and that is the feet where we go and touch all the brahmans and the shatrias and the boshes they go and touch their head on that that's the most covetous place covicious of the god that we go and touch that get the blessings so that is that means they are holding the society so we have to understand them but in our that prabhupada's take in society what happened the people don't understand it and the ego that works so much and as because the india was the under the subjugation for a long long period of time almost from 10th 11th century it continued after the 18th century so obviously you can understand almost 1 000 years we forgot anything that natural so all these things became jumbled up the kings also couldn't understand all now once again we have to introduce this and we have to understand this and we have to say my brother is a brahmana but i am a bhusha i love this economy and i am doing this business nothing wrong my brother is a contemplative person meditative person he is doing the research like that no problem so one family can have this practicing high moral values like non-injury truthfulness helping others at the time of need is common to all burners even today in some parts of india in the name of the burners the some people they torture other people not knowing that in their next birth they will be they may be getting more lower births than the sudras now they are boastful they are thinking that their brahmin are higher caste what is higher caste if they are be misbehaving it is the karma and being a hindu all you know that the karma fellow is there and what will happen to you in the next birth do you think about that so this is very important and we should understand it and we should try to imbibe these good qualities once again not only in indian society but in all societies practicing high moral values like non-injury truthfulness helping others at the time of need should be common to all so see this is what the society now friends this is we always receive the one question who created this caste the i like to quote from different scriptures to give the answer to that the caste system cast ridden system uh the india all the time the only thing that people there always criticize about india and hinduism is the caste and very peculiar of course those who are working to construct the temple and they gave their not only energy of course they took little money from you but they gave all their energy ability capacity capability all then the beautiful temple has come with so many carbs and all that and then you say hey you are not allowed to enter into the temple can you imagine that he was there in the beginning where you have placed the your guard that was the place he cleaned first maybe that was a very dirty place now he covered that he developed that in a beautiful shrine and now you put your god and ask that man who did that no you are not allowed to enter it is your problem it is not the system caste system it is your ego it is your misunderstanding it is your ignorance and don't impose that on the society so here how the caste system came who created the caste system in the common question i will quote from the bhagavad-gita fourth chapter 13 verse our great god sri krishna he is telling very clearly chathur bharanam mayas wisdom and then he said guna karma biba gashaha bibhaga the department because the the segregation are the different groups that he made on the basis of guna qualities karma capability the quality and the capability is the basis of this chaturbanam in the euro of america people would understand it but the india particularly hindus and the hindus in america also will understand it very much and if they really understand and respect sri krishna as god and the gita as the scripture they should know at least in this modern time we should not complain about this caste system because the god himself has done and done for the benefit of the human society our society and that is according to the qualities fourfold caste was created by me the god by the differentiation of quality and capability guna and karma i will quote from the bhagavata itself is the seventh book eleventh chapter thirty-fifth verse the seventh skanda in sanskrit it says yeshua yet yes a very simple sanskrit this be need the whatever qualities will be found in the individual person will be considered into that particular caste whatever the qualities will be found we have already read the qualities and if the quality is found in that particular individual he will be considered that he belongs to that caste it is not by birth as because my father was a brahmana and i should be considered as a brahmana who said not god it is you it is me it is our ego god didn't say that so we should not complain that is the very wrong system no it is a very good system only thing if we properly utilize it swami vivekananda was criticized such a exalted monastic he was you say he was the king among the monks but you know at that time there was a gentleman i am not naming him and he considered him as a traditional hindu and he said i am not going to address swami vivekananda sannyasi because i don't consider him as a sannyasi why he was a shatria he should not become a sannyasi can you imagine and he crossed the ocean so he lost that cast also he outcasted person vivekananda gave the new birth to the hinduism and these people and even the ordinary person he was a great person but that is the peculiarity and it's not the scripture it is not the religion it is that person the egoistic person ignorant person thinking i know old religion and behaving like that a time the some of the people like this narrow-minded people they didn't allow vivekananda to enter into kali temple can you imagine first time they allowed but we heard that they washed the whole temple and second time he didn't allow and the dakshinesha where this young man he meditated with his guru surama krishna because of his meditation because of his realization the whole area became purified swami vivekananda saw the kali goddess kali there in that temple and when he went over there they washed the temple can you imagine this is called ignorance and this is called ego but these people are thinking we are great religious people we are the real great hindu but this is the problem with the society we don't understand it vivekananda realized the god is kali and whole night he ran over there in that courtyard singing that song that was taught by sudama krishna to him and in the morning time he was sleeping salama krishna was so happy the best of the best among the brahmins ramakrishna and he was so happy with that shattri a boy so he's not yet according to the quality the human should be considered of it even if we find that in the in some others called character he should also be considered as that quality ma she was a just ordinary lady but this is called realization knowledge from realization and one can get the realization of the truth when one is completely free from ego otherwise a small portion of ego and out of ego if it is there one cannot realize god the truth so when the mother realized the truth our mind was broad and that mother could say without hesitation asking the brahmin boys and girls of his house of our household to go and touch a doctor who was not by cast a brahmin other ladies they came forward and started shouting no no no we cannot we are brahmanas and this doctor is not a brahmin a brahmana should not touch the feet of non-brahmin you know the answer to the mother mother told if he is not brahmin then who is a brahmana he is a doctor and so so highly educated and he is giving service to the society and so humble so gentle educated humble gentle and serving the society if he is not a brahman then who is a brahmana this is knowledge from realization and another knowledge from egoism the ignorance we can say so brahm means like that i will quote mahabharata the bhagavad-gita then the bhagavata in the mahabharata it is in the banana parva in the banana parva the king yudhisthira brahmana who is considered as a very religious person if the qualities of the brahmin is found in the sudra then sudra will be considered as brahmin and if not found in brahman that means those specific qualities brahmin will not be considered as brahmin anymore it is not by birth it is but karma it is by qualities again and again all the scriptures they are repeating with this we have to understand this bhagavan sirama krishna he said if by eating pork one can remember god and repeat the name of god and practice high moral spiritual life i say thanks to him hail to him but if by eating a vegetarian food one behaves in human way i suffie on him if a brahmana eating the vegetarian food so called pure food but in character is me behaving very opposite i say five on him that is i'm quoting from another bhrigu and bharata in their conversation also i'm not quoting that conversation they also supported this thing that it should be the cast should be on quality not by birth and i will conclude quoting from the tantra very clear if brahman should not be considered as a brahmin due to the birth or samaskhara because he has the the secret trait upon ayanna or he has read the scripture veda no character is the only earth stick to be considered a brahmana the shiva he is telling like this so how we will understand that he is a brahmana so one should understand this now friends i don't think we'll be able to complete today's the other other the astra so barna four asama iv the four asthmas now in the burner according to the qualities asthmas that is the period that one should develop and manifest those qualities so the first three group the brahmana shatriya and bhusha so they used to go and in their childhood days just to go to a guru to understand this dharma just to learn dharma same lifestyle same way of discipline they used to practice and then afterwards when they are coming out so not by birth but by quality this the caste so obviously when they're going they're all young children they're going to the guru getting the same type of education and training and discipline but when they are graduating coming out in the society they are becoming three groups brahmin shatriya and vaishya bhagavan sri krishna he also went to his guru and another brahmin boy also went to his guru and he was very poor but they both of them they learned the same thing from their guru krishna was having krishna you have to consider him as a human being was having the qualities of the shatrias he was courageous he was brave he was the valor was there so he became the shatriya but his friend as because he was calm composed and satisfied with the little thing he became a brahmana it is there so like this it all goes it is a burna and it comes the astrama now let us now listen to lord krishna and about the astra mahu what he says asama means period of time human life has been divided in four parts first is the brahmacharya that is students life second got us the householders life third banaprastha a retired life and fourth sannyasa monastic life so these are the four part the human life begins with love and affection from the parents up to age six only up to six years then from 6 to 16 they should spend their time serving the guru and learning from him that was the brahmacharya time from the 6 to 16 10 years of course we cannot apply that nowadays but to some extent the the unique way that has that was framed that also we can take up to six years the child will get all affection if the child is not getting the affection not on because they don't understand they want only the assurance from the parents that they are safe that's all and nothing else in what name we are calling them and whether we are casually them whether we are bringing some these are that is not the main thing main thing is they like to understand whether i am safe or not and then they get the happiness when they get the presentation from the father or the mother or the family members it is not for the presentation but the love the assurance of the safety that is there so this is very important in the child's mind if that is not there then the growth is stagnated the growth become very very difficult that child won't be able to believe any others when that child grows up why in the beginning he didn't get that so that dissatisfaction it is so strongly imprinted in the mind it becomes very difficult so parents should be very very careful to give the children the correct way of life from one to six is nothing so that is the time they should get the love affection and all this encouragement then from the 6 to 16 their education begins in those days the lifespan was like that so they used to go to the guru in the in the guru griha how they will live as a brahmacharya it is in the 17th chapter 22nd verse i am quoting when the guru will ask him they will go and sit and learn brahma means veda they will study what veda now what is veda in a very brief we started the veda over here in brant society and i think that is recorded in that eternal india there's a lecture series or saga of the soul sorry and the saga of the soul eternal india mahabharata and maybe ramayana whether it is there or not there is the eternal india but the saga of the soul a series of lectures that i gave and there all the four vedas we studied not in details but in brief to understand what are four vedas those who are interested you can go and get it from the youtube what are there in the vedas all varieties of education and then they will be teaching in the in the end they will be telling that now oh girl oh boy you are educated you are going out now you will marry you will settle as a householder and you should follow these things the dharma means keeping the promises again and again i say that again and again because that is the truth if you keep the promise that you have taken the oath that you have taken the vows that you have taken then not only you are satisfied but the society is benefited they know when i am going to this person he is going to give exactly whatever he knows and his capacity he will give so when we go to the polish in the society we only people that we can believe is a foolish they are supposed to protect us but after reaching over there in the in the station police station and if we see they are behaving completely different way with me i will my mind will break confidence will break and the reaction in the society will be completely bad that is the reason guru kula system the gurus is to teach them the veda what is the veda not only the different education but the behavior also i was telling the the ceo of the techno india group and he agreed and immediately is a so kind person and very enthusiastic i loved him so he immediately introduced a system to teach our the little backward in education group the girls particularly in the society a group of people are there who needs a helping hand but they like to have faith on them elderly people they do not can't do anything out themselves so if a lady is going and staying with them helping them providing them all the services reading out from the newspaper and the book and all those trainings she should get but along with that morality non-stealing not hearting that person with the rough words or behaving in such a way that that person gets the problem no these are the main training other thing other services even a robo can do a machine can do but the human must have these so the first quality that the gurus in the old in the guru griha they used to give is this then i was in perulia for few years is a residential school the monks are there teachers are there the students is to stay with us as a guru cooler system used to say because of the number of the students it is very difficult that you can understand a one shanyasi with 50 or 60 students how individually he can difficult but the system is now the the modern society is like that we cannot sit with 10 boys it's not possible we have to accommodate there we had developed a system even the rich person is coming rich man's son or a poor man's son they should be equally behaved they needed some pocket money we told the guardians that you should put the pocket money say 200 rupees or 100 rupees and that they should spend for six months or three months something like that i've forgotten the system is there and they like to purchase some candies or the biscuits or these and that they used to have the passbook like the bank pass book and they will take that bank pass book and to our the shop and that is also asthma and there they will show and say i like to purchase this and it will be in the credit in the bank as they do in the credit 100 is there now in the david today you have purchased five dollar today is twenty dollars like that it will reduce but you cannot complete that amount within a short period of time the period three months or six months it should you have to i think three months now what happened they usually used to check but it slipped so one boy he spent the whole amount in one go he went to the shop purchased the whole thing and he secretly wrote to his father i am getting being insulted by my friends that i am not having the money in my account father is a rich man he drove from calcutta and i was the first man in the office he came and all he banged on my table and said it is my money it is my son and my son wants to spend my money who are you to stop it so look at it the guru cooler system we wanted to teach the boy to understand even a fair thing even a rupee that you are spending it is costly to earn that it is so difficult we were going to we used to give that training we give the training the father came and bang i understood young man his son so he is boastful i could please sit down take a cup of tea and let me ask you a question just tell me whether rabindana's father was richer than you or not that they were landlords then the father understood ah they were richer and they have you read the life of rabindranath how austerity he had to follow when he was very young boy a simple dress simple food and like that so if that father could do why you don't understand you need not to bother about spending your money just go on accumulating your son will go and spend it no training is necessary to spend but to understand the value of the money that is essential that is necessary that exactly what we are doing and that is called guru kula system even in the modern time these are the problems this guru kula system the brahmacari dition proprio anupurbat after becoming dtr what is the deity dithya means this is the ceremony of the second birth that is cigarette threat ceremony the sacred trait ceremony after having that friends i have quoted many times the dwigia the second birth why the first birth the child the human child doesn't know the culture it's just no difference between animals and the human child they will believe in the same way they don't understand slowly slowly as they are growing up the parents are guiding them and they learn what and how they should behave and that is the way called the second birth and through a ceremony it is given and the ceremony is called that secret trade ceremony that they will be having a trade and there will be seven ties and each tie will remind him a morality i am not going to tell any lies i should all always follow the truthfulness i am not going to steal i should always always follow these and this is the way this it goes so they will understand that they will remember that when they are worshiping so that constantly at the remembering to help them to remember the moral values this is the trait all the three they get the brahmana shatriya and vaishya they get it and having that at the six years they will go to guru one should leave in the house of a teacher with self-control and study the vedas under guru's guidance that this is the the first thing hindu life actually it begins even before birth you know and then of course modern society i do not know but in our younger days we have seen whenever a lady and she conceived immediately the whole household they will ask her to read some holy books listen to the devotional songs so that our mind constantly thinking of the spirituality the god and that effect goes to the sun also the child the baby that is in heart so this is the way and then there are so many ceremonies are there one after another write the ceremony to remind that this is the thing that you should have to do so it goes on then after the birth there is also another ceremony and then finally when the child is grown up up to six upon ayana the secret trade now they become brahmachari when they go to the teacher's house they are brahmacari what is the brahmachary means as a student focused on study focus to learn that is called the brahmacari no other thing in the mind they should not think in and now every student even when they're very young are having the cell phone and having so many connections and look at the effect in the society they're educated they're qualified they're capable to do many things but i do not know are they having the characters the human characters so that is the main thing if a person is not having the morality if you cannot control the mind and emotions and impulses if you cannot think about the others others betterment it becomes selfish so that is not the human society that want so one should understand that now now the two types of brahmacharya one is called after starting they will go and become the householder brahmacari all the same but then after the study a group they will go and become the householders another is there called noise tikka this naishtika brahmacari after the brahmacharya after the students life they will become monastics so this is called the monastic life the traditional brahmacharya life is very very hard the restrictions are very rigid which in the modern mind cannot even think of so from the 17th chapter in the in the 17th chapter from 23rd to 30th verse all these verses are giving the complete description how those brahmacari should be friends i am not reading those if you are interested you can read from there we shall read the basic discipline the student should follow and i will conclude with this and the other three astronauts in our next class we will have a brahmachari should get up early in the morning before sunrise this is the basic brahmachary should get up not only the monastic brahmacharyana stig brahmachary also the uupakurvans all those are students should get up in the early morning before the sunrise and then after attending to the clinton cleanliness you should meditate and repeat the holy name of god the mantra then serve and attain all duties that will be assigned to him by his guru so this is the way it goes acharya and here it says means big the brethren means as a promise the one is taking a great promise and he should not consider his teacher as an ordinary person he should consider him as god himself the god sri krishna is telling that acharya mamiya the teacher should be considered as god and in our even our the young age we have seen our teachers they were so respectful we could never even think looking at their eyes they were so qualified and so humble so simple so full of knowledge and all the time eager to share the knowledge with the students guiding the students those are now slowly because of the modern society it is changing and nowadays no question of coming close to the relation of the teacher and student because it is the classes are online the students sitting in the in the room and the teacher is somewhere else so it is going on so friends up to this and then in the next sunday talk we will continue with the other responsibilities the teachers should be considered as the god and they should not be looked down upon in any time thank you very much questions first from chabad is it the sound is all right you just listen listen is it possible to have some is it possible to have some sessions for younger kids sorry i don't think it will be possible there are you know when you were learning from here if you then you tell to the younger people so that will be better and you can communicate in a better way um she's saying how do we inculcate it in culture our children in their daily life oh that's very good idea there are some books and they have given and the vedanta is nothing i will tell you vedanta according to swami vedanta is nothing but the self-confidence not ego not ego self-confidence so go on telling your child your that you are doing good very good but it you can be better the the self-confidence will come and never ever ego be very careful about it ego means i can only do and no one else and never compare with others you know when the most of the time even when in our church younger days the our guardians is to compare with some other friends look at that your friend is so good you are not never ever do that and sometimes if their two brothers are there or a brother or sister that is the very difficult situation because mostly parents will compare look at your sister she is so good and you are not so they become the naturally that young mind cannot accept that never do that you you so it is your own capacity and your sister or brother it is his or her capacity so don't compare as a parent you should understand the psychology and vedanta just know it self-confidence the more i grow the more it seems to me that everything lies in manliness xiaomi vivekananda said this manliness means complete self-confidence thank you so the next question is from shauna croix roy is asking persons don't bother about karma paul they can go for karma and those who have desires they can go for karma yoga is it correct assertion please explain i am sorry it is not it is not those who have desire and they go for karma yoga no the desire is a different thing karma yoga the karma what is coming before me what we are doing so like that i am doing but without waiting for the result or anchoring for the result the one the teaching is there don't seek don't shun so that is the way the life goes in a monastic life of course but for for the life in the society you have to crave for the better position better karma and when it is when it is done then you should say i have tried my best i have tried my best and she never even become dejected or sorry let me tell you once again i i got little disturbed so thing is like this when a karma your duty your responsibility is coming you should do it in a concentrated mind and you should attain to that as best as possible and that is the way you can perform and after that you say oh god i have done it as best as possible and the result is up to you so by that way if you can do riskull karmaphala and those who are not understanding the result so anything that you do the result is there every action as is equal and opposite reaction isn't it i think uh i could answer to your question so aru when you are reading read clearly and then be there please otherwise it disturbed the i can roy is asking can you please guide how to start performing meditation and what to think during meditation i don't know if you have taken initiation or not if you have taken initiation then your guru will guide you and for a simple meditation purpose that you take long breathe and slowly think that your the oxygen is energizing your whole body and by that way slowly slowly try to forget i will tell you in the in the small way that you can practice at the simple system first you see a lamp with the lamp holder and then slowly slowly after practice only to see the lamp on a lamp holder that's all and you don't see anything else then afterwards you you can't see the lamp holder you see only the lamp only lamp and nothing else then that when that is perfected you see only lamb then forget about the lamp and see the only the flame the light that is if you can see the only flame only light within your heart and then the fourth stage merge yourself into that wonderfully virgin light but this is called meditation but don't practice more than 10 minutes and if you feel that your heaviness in the heart aid don't do it so that is the way you can do next question is from superna gosh superna few years ago i was fearless courageous etc but now with the progress of time i feel i am losing all those satria qualities please tell me what to do how to regain those qualities wonderful that is see as we grow as we grow so our the second and third that's called astrama you are talking about the burner burner is the shatriya brahmana with all that but astra next class we will discuss about the astra also the first we have started is the brahmacharya the student's life and second is goddess the life and now i do not know how old you are if you are a

the next question is from tanya gua tanya is asking pranam swamiji thank you so much for your precious words my question is how to remove the ego from the mind oh this is really really difficult thing the hardest thing to remove the ego if you read the gospel of sirama krishna you will find again and again srama krishna is telling like that but one wonderful system that he has suggested ramakrishna he has suggested that ego you cannot go beyond ego because our existence is ego the i so obviously very simply you can do i am the daughter of god i am the son of god whatever i am doing i am doing it for the betterment of the society and i am confident this will be good like that for everything give the credit to god go to god attach to the god and that will slowly eradicate the ego not not me not me thou thou this is the simple way you can practice and the some people in the another gyana yoga they practice i am not the body i am not the mind where from the ego will come that is little harder and we can discuss about it afterwards also so i think now we should conclude and which conclude with this sloka thank you for the wonderful questions now this verse and we conclude foreign
