[Bhagavatam 036  :  Can the Veda Reveal Brahman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2Ou2sce9irQ)

good morning let us begin with this would you good for you now but the mob sedation B Schwarz harem governess attrition me hongou Lakshmi you keep dianna commune Bundy I uh [Music] Krieger is a great God all pervading coward but I am using the word God the moment you use the word god that means is personalized personification of the Supreme Being this is the very speciality of the in reason God all-pervading God within my grew inside the temple and whatever way I think to the morning I reached back from Cincinnati they have a Hindu temple over there and like all the Hindu temples the big one has 100 acres of land they are purchased and since that is open place inside the temple if you entered all the I was counting actually how many gods are there I could reach up to 20 and living other small small gods and goddesses here and there so does 20 and all the twenty the beautiful dome with the golden color centered two things appear the deciding this item at the center is a home god I don't know who actually planned it but exactly what the Hindus the thing home god and by the side of the own car Lord Vishnu so the Vishnu and the Omkara are the same the whole car is a symbol of those who are trying to reach to the truth true knowledge and Vishnu is the God where the devotees trying to reach to the same knowledge or same truth so the we chant over here Shankar Karim Karim economy's his form is very calm and composed bhujangasana lying down on the snake bait like this but Mon album he's the king of all the gods silly Asian now here today we will discuss a very interesting question you know that all these days we're almost one and a half years we are studying the bhagavata back to not the hole all the sneakers only choosen from here in the air and this bhagavata here we come when the king pariksit he was the grandson of the or tuna just to remind you my most most of you know grandson of the Arjuna he got a girls from a brahmana boy that he is going to die within seven days to understanding that I am going to die for sure so instead of going and fighting and taking care what he did that is very excellent immediately he gave the whole kingdom to his son Jimmy J and we returned and made a small heart on the bank of a river and he was getting ready for the dead he was not at all afraid of death now the lots of people they assembled of the Rishi's why because they knew before his birth Krishna saved him will happen now he's going to die but this is not the age for him to die maybe that Krishnan will come and do something miracles hoping that all the game and they were waiting and also one great sage came his three sugar the sugar diva came naturally seeing that learning person spiritually learn it realized soul the sting started asking question which you hear studying all the time he is asking a question under sugar is giving the reply and as is the tradition of the Indian Way of explaining he is adding some stories and anecdotes and conversation so it became very big we are picking out those conversations and very question we even study what is the question can the big reveal Brahma now it is like holding the whole Hinduism if someone says is that Jesus was true the historical there's a call then a higher criticism some group of people they started criticizing analyzing so they told this actually there was no Jesus and if the Jesus is not there then the whole Christian Utley will crumble down it is not possible whole thing is depending on him like the Buddhism etc Hinduism based indeed and what is that be that is the truth and how you know that this is the truth now this is directly from the car the God reveal need a whole Russia know human being composed is better now I believe you believe some people may say that that is not possible someone has written now all the disease the names of the air they're writing so how can you say that it is not by the human being exactly the same question is asking Burak shield why he is asking this question this is also he was not supposed to ask this question he could ask how are you going to get the liberation and these druggies but actually the sugar was quoting from the Punishers and so he challenged him maybe we can say he was trying to understand the root of it friends we will study that the 10th standard and 87th the parent 87 the attire Skanda means the book and every book is having so many chapters so obviously this is 1887 chapter the king is asking this question what is this question he's asking first he addressed the sugar brahmana brahmana see you at the new heart of Brahma you are the knower of the brahman so he was the best person to answer me - what is that Brahma you know the students are without Brahman means all-pervading consciousness in short you can say that all-pervading consciousness and you are the knower of that now you please tell me which is an unspeakable how the bigger could speak about it this is a very vital question to his brandman brahmani on in the show-me gooney goon attire cotton Gerald is retire Sasha sought a separate you are aware of this supreme Brahman sharp sure Romani the obviously disruption Romani which is an addition he wear a bra you are aware about it and this Brahmin new people have seen on this show what is this Ani bishop who cannot be defined or described well if you can describe or define anything it is not infinite it is finite if it is finite there's just a moment I was describing out the Hindu temple what is the where is the Hindu temple a place is there Cincinnati how is a Hindu temple this is this this when did I see LA yesterday so all these time space and causation so this three can express and what about the Brahma it has no time the no cause and everywhere so you cannot mention I saw the Brahmin such and such place I went to see the White House and there I saw the problem is possible from the Rizla on derricks of somebody else the nut brahmana brandman is completely so that is his telling you cannot define that why you are telling that Brahman is these and these need to name without the gunas again the students of Vedanta they know everything that we see is all mixture of the three gunas three qualities sattva Raja and Dhamma in Sanskrit the same subtle all the good qualities Raja mixture Golden Bear and Dhamma only bad and we all having these three qualities - sometimes I am good sub to prevail acting and also helpful but little egoistic hey I made the tea for you remember it like that you give the tea at the same time you are remember that I get the tea - like this so this is Roger and Dhamma if you are asking to give you a glass of water you'll see water what today I was asking that you know the air hostess the she came what do you want and this is still good in a Southwest they are serving you the coffee and little bit of snacks so what do you want the people who are asking this and that I usually take coffee and after the coffee I want to water dynami but yes that from the morning I didn't drink water so I need the water so and the glass of water then she said I don't know whether I will be able to bring the water or not coffee I'm sure they're going to give you and if I have time then I will bring the water of course it is only one hour in flight so they don't get the time so fast it was Roger and sitting I don't know whether I'd be able to give you the water otama same person so this way always you can judge this is a saturation and Thomas after a gentle constantly going on but Brandon no it is not having any such thing it's completely beyond and cetera Tama is comes under the prakruti and Tata tea is actually the power of that Brahman so I am controlling this and that cannot control me I am asking my people to do these and that but they cannot ask me to do this so this is called prakruti and such a submarine in America in India usually the elderly people will be patting the back of the juniors right when they come you put the back of them and here if you do that they'll also pat your back this is the problem I wanted to give the blessings but he also gave me this now just mean they cheated Archer this is the system of this country's okay so I don't patent anyone okay from distance so this is the way it could have it here it says the prakruti the nature is having these three qualities but he's doing that how can you say that you can tell it says such a submarine what is the satyr sir beyond religion cause an effect such a submarine the beyond the cause and effect that must be cause and the effect is there like this it is boom intact and it says gonna be useful to him now who is describing about this gonna be - yes - tyaga builders being constituted of words bidders are nothing but the words the suta means the thing that you have heard so what you have are those from home from your pool and now you have noted it down but anyway the only words how that can express reveal the brahman the very basic question and this in tourism depending on the Veda if the bidder is proved that it was composed by some people then it is going to lose everything so here we have to discuss Burak shield is asking this question why because he knew about the Brahmin why but he'll develop in the initial it says a bang Manasa go Jeremy ah means negative bomb and manasseh bank means the world Manasa means the mind cultural it is beyond the limit of the world that means the expression and the mind even the mind cannot consider mine cannot take any idea about it that is proven so what is Brahman all-pervading consciousness now someone told the Sharma ji we are drawing the Brahman program so you can draw yes so we are almost finishing that work because the 40 years we are reading only this if you can give me that drawing then the minute I can see Brahman and I know what is Brahman that will do over and for the last 40 42 years I am trying to know about it because it won't have any conception mind cannot have the conception so this is the problem we have to remember these points our mind even mind can conceive so many things so many now this moment you close your eyes if you look at the children's pictures and the children's movies the peculiar form or they are coming and talking and what does all those imagination only you can imagine anyway a huge elephant is having a dog say you can imagine what is a problem but here you cannot do that so upon Manasa Google Jeremy it is not understanding even and expression through words unthinkable beginning another's hoop initial it says na me- doctor dear Bob gotcha D but means again in a very practical way expressing the same idea the word cannot express no mana given the mind another Ganesha says you have to watch me Burton T of propia Manasa and coding from three different Upanishads and three different lines speaking the same thing what you express it through words and you cannot even think in the mind now sometimes some people they exaggerate and you have to understand oh you didn't eat that was such a wonderful thing that visa you must go as a savant they will be talking in such a way the creating the desire and you think oh if I can't eat that piece of pizza so my life is the best I must go and fetch it after that when you go if you say why I listen to that so this always this is the experience sometimes some people exaggerate but you can have some idea they can also express in a different way here you can express any way then how it is been expressed to punish you it says differently one negative and positive what is the negative way what is Brahman it says I'm sure really the function means the part this not that is having the part our body is having so many different parts I am one but even me having so many different parts Brahman is not like that it was a big discussion on that I am NOT entering into that we are the Alita without any action it never breathes he'd never think he'd never bleep know so no an action I know function functional part know Creole new action Bakara Sonia without to decay because a decaying is a beautiful building but after 20 years 40 years if you go so many decays anything you go decay everywhere but the Brahma nobody came fresh like that as it is and it is negative I'm sure atha cliath Iraheta Baqarah Sonia not positive it's a it is existence it is knowledge it is please what is existence or see then knowledge of party then please Priam so Sanskrit a Steve our team via this tree then water to spiders this is the Brahman and what are those breathers bidders can be considered as a man Shami we become the city it is not the book is the mass of knowledge there is a mass of knowledge if it has not been written are composed or saved it will be deal that knowledge is already there so mass of knowledge if all people forget the law of gravitation not reputation within before the discovery of the law of gravitation non-repetition was then the battle was falling all through only he thought why it is falling down a little let me research that's all it was there the same the mass of knowledge the Vedas are the maps through which we can reach to that goal now here the suffering truth did you like to know and the students are coming and asking about it third one third Upanishad Emporium preach army preach armies and asking about whom who punish them Bhushan the one about whom the tradition has described aponogeton Bhushan I am asking again it says shall we read yet predominantly I like to know that supreme about whom all the bathers are indicated so this is the way the people are coming and trying to understand it friends instead of going to the reply that our sukadeva gave I will ask you to understand about how we understand words this is a wonderful scientifical way our spiritual they have development how we understand Wordle what are these words the breeders are known as the shaft Brahma the Brahman that has been expressed through words Brahman expressed through words so chapter chapter means the world Brahman manifesting through words when we speak what actually we do we make some sound and speaking and making some song this sound may be known to some people unknown to some people because I'm speaking in English now the people who doesn't know the English you don't understand anything you will only hear a sound and nothing else so obviously some have been meaning the only it is having some effect otherwise not another long back in and among these we had a small temple but this the side of the scene we have been gone and the people whose to fish in the nighttime dish to come and lie down on the verandah and these two have the lot of drinks and even we could find the wine bottles rolling here in the air and almost two three people have to drag them out because they are all sleeping so we had to drag and then put them somewhere else to open the our temple gate and windus to get a dish to give me another choicest words there too but for me it was nothing why these two speaking Tamil and I know so I just look at they were smiling so they used to wonder why I am not angry because all the time they are speaking all the choices words just to shower on me but internal so there is only song sound is not sharp the shoved means it should have a meaning which is understandable of course tunnel people will know there was one Tonica when he came he was translating sharmaji he said this I don't translate otherwise I'm so this is the way we have to understand slowly slowly mother is a son and it is a meaning to will call it as but the sand Silver's mother the shafte becomes father when when it is a meaning otherwise somebody's whistling no meaning it is not a product bada means if it is meaning and some brothers together is a barky to shut up ba-da-ba kill the chapter is a song sung reading meaning his father and when some of the brothers are put together it becomes it back here her sentence every father or son every Parker of the sentence has meaning hence the father and Barker its meaning is ultra in Sanskrit they are all connected I am sorry I have to speak to suspect otherwise I won't be able to take you to the the place where we will understand what is this the chapter are the backyard it has a martyr that skull path chilly bajji means the earth but you means the meaning to what is bachi every sentence every words Abacha the meaning sharmaji the meaning someone who is a sharmaji so that is called the bathtub so it goes in this way the shaft article and in artha is means bocce we drink water this is a sentence and it is a meaning - and we know that what we are talking about but if we see we leave on water somebody art someone when Julie oh you don't know I am living on Chicago River how people in understand Chicago River you were living on water so immediately we understand now - the water he is on the soup shore of this river so that is the that means - differently we are understanding one is tied it another is a pre ending meaning the apprehension we are understanding this so most of the time I am living on the year and when somebody says like that how you will think most of the time I am living in the year maybe he is a pilot or aircrew living in the year so we know that this way he is not this describing something which we do not understand we understand it how understand the meaning in a different way so that is called luck Sharna and sorry friends because these are so many technical words is collection election and means I see something and you also understand it not the word I mean but the word not the word directly that the word is meaning something else like I live on the water means in the bank of the river I live in the year maybe I have a crew in the aircraft and similarly that is called dakshana this chapter are brother Ibaka is vulture or the heart election ah so these are all sound with the meaning and or a sentence with the meaning and the utter are the luck Sharna may be direct or indirect we all are related to this world of senses that this is one part of it now another part that I tell you to understand what is Veda when we are talking in this world we different way we give the expression and we understand that when you are talking how because the auditor may be direct meaning may be tied it oh I gaze that meaning and I understand it properly sometimes sign language what is the sign language suppose you have thirsty you show like this and like this immediately the people are understand so he wants to drink water so they will understand that - the sign language also we can understand this is all related to this worldly but what about the Veda when you say be the shut up Brahma Brahma in the word form is a completely different like Brahman this chapter also akshay been are sure a hitter on Rd look at it the moment you say that it is a chapter the sound the world this beta means up Shia undecaying with this - later world brahmana immediately undecaying undestructible without beginning and eternal immediately you understand in that way the brahman is expressed through Psalms which develop in four stages friends now you have to pay complete attention because we will be discussing about the very very basic place where the sound text of all how it it happens four different stages first is the Sanskrit word is / r PL re thrust stage is the Parag second stage is fashion D third Mitama and forth bakery I start from the end / up patiently madama bakery I will start from the below what is the bakery this what I am talking now the sounds that is going out and carrying some meaning to you that is going quickly but you before that is kalmyk Dhamma this is just before the manifested form of the song you to understand in this way a sound I am creating before the creation of the sound that was in me isn't it without that you won't be able to talk so when we learn a language the first thing the teacher will ask the develop as maximum possible the words or the sentences otherwise you'll be fumbling so when you go and look at the pound key you don't know what is this so what is this what is this so you have to know the world so before you are talking you are actually forming that sentence and then he was picking out so that is called mad gamma that is the condition and before the subtlest form of the world at this stage no difference between the sound and his meaning this is a meaning there is no sound but there is a sentence this is very peculiar we are reaching to the second or third the third is the question T and question T beyond that the beginning is the para only vibration and the baraja is the vibration you are going to see something before that vibration starts we are not aware of it we are not at all aware of the vibration second the person T it is a sentence but without any meaning of words but it is there taking the shape is like a childbirth slowly slowly taking the form and then comes the Mitama Bob you were bit specially qualified the Yogi's only can hear that is reachable by ordinary people and then comes the bakery when all this is over a finished product is coming out that is opaquely bakery is nothing but the worse why we are talking about this because the readers are the sounds that was created but before it came out to the reach of the people some people the Yogi's the reached over there understood it completely they expressed that's why it says it has not been done created by any human being or borussia now I will take you to some of the explanations so that we can explain it in better way one is hot to hurry those who have studied that the Sun spirit and the Vedanta you know this name but if you must name but clearly this but already he says by curry the most external level of language Martin on thinking level of the mind but shooty the finest level where there is no photo and the word is coming shorter the decision between the world and the meaning here in this version the label the Sutra was accepted by the Greeks the Greek philosophy this is Porter how this world world was created Spota and of sport became war for the Christians the Christians took it as a word and he will find that famous sentence from the Bible there was World War was with God and war became God this three level there was worth what was with God the misto different existence war became God we are also same the first is the photon add the sound without meaning and then it goes to another level deeper than all others is called para this body means from the unmanifest level of language only a movement begins to create a world a chakra he will many of them know that those who learn dancing Indian dancing so they'll be always many of the places having that shiva Tandava the shiva is dancing and they will say the green shiva is dancing the whole world was created how some so this is the para para means the sound is just vibration Patanjali he will understand this very clearly how Patanjali is expressing when you get cross the level of the bakery and Mitama do you remember the four stages for our members Shanti maxima and bakery victory is external back to the hell is the madam the circle question T then the subtlest is the power and autonomy steering the bakery the most expressed one and then beyond that madama doing the yoga reach over there they reach the push until a and yogi becomes one with absolute this is the point to be noted sad has recalled order saying that and the course in the legal codes this is the point to be noted said here this is the point to be not yet now the question was how the bather can be accepted because the Veda is speaking about the Brahmin and brahmana game cannot be spoken cannot be expressed how then you say the words of the bathers are truly the brahman itself shut up Ranma be the and nothing but the Brahmin so we are going back to the third level which is called question T and the great yogi Patanjali he is mentioning between the yogi crosses the bring curry then the man Tama then goes down to the question T and yogi becomes one with the absolute Brahma be Brahma Baba t and at that time whatever he speaks says it is not his own it is that original so this is the level Shankar Acharya so I am quoting from the birth to hurry and pattern jury and the Shankar Acharya shanku that says say imbue person T is the meeting point between the waking stage and pure consciousness the patient is very very important when you meditate we usually come from below to the above level but when we try to go down to the below through words and we are talking I have to stop talking then I go to the meaning of that world so we do take the initiation the Guru says don't alter the world then pronounce the world some people would say suppose I am alone can I knew much of when you were alone you can do that why the Guru says don't pronounce because you have to go back to win you are taking the name of God you are not pronouncing no bakery so you are going down to the next level and next level miss Mitama they are the sentence is there what is the meaning is also there after that you go again further instead of down I can say higher then it be good so if we go to the higher level that is called the Prashanti level here you find the meaning of it without the world and then he says the Patanjali says in that level the Prashanti level yogi becomes one with the absolute and the Harry says Brahma beat Brahma beep which means the new Arab government becomes Brahma so this is the level and Shankara he is explaining little better way history visible Junction is the meeting point of the waking and the conscious level the weekend and the conscious level Tundra also accept this all the time to accept he recognizes the for this for the stages level like this a bakery is in the throat because you are talking so bakery in the drone Marta mom is in the heart and then machete in the Navajo and voila is the Kundalini so I was going on telling down down down down means you go to the root the Kundalini and that is called bara anything that is happening so they say is a primal energy but what is the para is a primal energy the primal energy beings the tremendous power not manifested yet from the earth the power is rising up so from the the yogi when the meditate they always try to bring up that power but when you are going down to that valuable that means the Kundalini level you are transforming to that so this is what they say and that is why beta is known as the shock topology sound not created by any human being truth about the Brahman generated automatically from Brahman itself friends unfortunately I have not seen that great monk I could see because I was there at that time not as a monastic but I used to visit as a devotee the Swami was there he used to leave those who have visited balloon pot you know that just in front of the Swami Vivekananda's a double storey building there on the ground floor that shown is to live and he used to hear the own car all the time and when used to meditate his to hear that not only meditation all the and some people they went to talk to the Shawnee and that he was sitting quietly and the sound is so beautiful I mean so charming you don't like to listen to any other song you'd like to open your eyes also so constantly going over there and that is called the supreme joy that Swami that other people they have gone so he would open his eyes a do you hear that song but so many other sounds are there but who haven't what sound home car Hammacher own car are you listening but is there can't you listen that is the condition so that is the condition how old is it goes on giving so that is called living in the company of the Brahman the bloodmobile Brahma poverty so that is the condition so it says the slowly slowly we are speaking to the bakery when you speak what actually we use what are the parts first is the tongue second is the palate third is the lip then fourth is the teeth then throat then food on of are you a force that is helping you to send out those words this is in tourism just going to the temple and having some marks and then offering the banana Hindu guru go into a Ibaka Sakuma it it is not imprison the Hinduism is going to the root cause and so subtle sauce day go into the root cause so even wait I am speaking a world that also they have analyzed if this is not science than what is science this is the speciality and the moment we said meditation meditation even today someone was asking in the flight itself from he came to speak about some meditation he is our external so I spoke this ok but the meditation means to know what this going back without any sound without any more without any meaning going to the root of the world the here it says like this so truth about the brahman generated automatically so it is Brahman itself hence breathers are the revellers of the government the first vibration which is known this is a parabolic now let us summarize we're from the world car the vibration what is that vibration is the para in the para condition there is no form work out the meaning but that vibration is creating slowly that will take the word form and that vibration is own when the bara the vibration in hydrates is called ooh and Hindus is so fond of home everywhere didn't make the home and recently someone has published an article in the newspaper that I do not know in America NASA they bring to the writing that Mars and in the Mars there is a song and they discovered Oh NASA people can say I don't know but it was in published but does not son know what is all the scientists I don't know any sound is own but they always think that is why they see like that why the honker is so pure look above our God that his own God and this is the own color that brings all people together why it has no form actually without form but the perform meaning what is the meaning is the shakhter that is the world and found that world everything comes and it's the beginning of that chapter so the moment the Quran start vibrating that is the home this is called nada nada means sound and it is manifesting and it's object is eat is accepted as from month he is the Veda CE o ET brahma o ET Brahma what is drama whom is the brother otherwise how can we express how can you make you understand Oh me t Brahma media positions like the Prasanna kata Manduca lots of gita they accept the home car and you know the one with the Lawkeeper of the Hindus he also did Agra Akshara param brahma Inca Akshara only one later that is the supreme and that is own God and the Vishnu shall sternum these are all the pedantic and the treaty among the Hindus they are followers of the Vishnu Vishnu Shastra Dhamma one name of the visionaries Oh from God this is Maha Vishnu whom is the single later world but when analyzed we find three letters clubbed in it and mom this mom is that all - like this so the more means when you close your lips and pronounce that is the mom so ah so are and when comes together it becomes oh so cool oh and discuss general Bindu the last one that is Bindu and from there the first thing that start happening the before the Sam sound is acne and when the sound is there the first thing slowly slowly the production of the sound sucked then the Raja then the Tama first is those qualities are coming and from the chapter again read you some readers this unit area shatter a comma guna trail from all Oman is a leader then comes the qualities three qualities security Tama then comes mantra where is the mantra read human sama and from there loca loca means the place that is also three whereas the local Bupa and swap the three do girl boo means this world Swami is the heaven and Google in between heaven and the artists or subbu uber suave and then comes a bus or a jogger sadhna Susu t1 is waking state and there is dream stage and the beyond is - beyond this - called su su t dream Leslie there's also the stage where from where we come back and have the experience so these are the pravakara Supremes we came to know about I will take another three or four minutes I am explaining taking the help of the word glory Shankar Acharya no but the shuco they were he never cared to explain it because there was no time so what'd he say sugar simply say between Indian mana prana Jana oestrogen Prabhu mantra culture bottom up money Kalpana Raja Prabhu promised master the master he's the Lord of the created faculties what are those like the intellect the senses mind and the vital forces in the Cheevers first is the internet where the intellect which through which we can take the decision it's not mana is not the mind the of course English mind means the whole thing and in Sanskrit the four different compartments first is mana which cannot take decision dwindling then intellect booty it takes the decision Manama duty then chitter with the stool house it was a tree and lastly the power that is helping it to manifest and world hunger mana but the cheetah ahankara in English all this for called mind so the here we find the Lord has created the intellect booty then why the intellect so that he can take the decision then senses what are the senses of this file i then knows the year and dong cetera then the mind the mana or the mana total then vital forces all the Puranas but why God created sugar answer God created all this to him being Jeeva Jeeva mean being fine so that they can enjoy otherwise wife so they can enjoy this all this to the Saints contacts now in the business always they will calculate if I start shop over here mr. neighborhood nearby with the calm and purchase otherwise why should I open the crowd so everything is a calculation and those who are producing the cards and all that they produce in such a place where the labor is cheap electricity is cheap water availability so many things they will keep in mind then they will start now the God has already created the world after creation the flower the butterfly that the birds then the water so many good things but they don't want to see so the God thought of what is it I have already made so many beautiful things and it will be wasted if I am NOT creating so he created the human being the jeevers the jiva's with all the senses then they go and see also beautiful so they are enjoying if you are not visiting the park what is the part for the you go sit over there take the camera or your painting then those people who planned for the part there's a yes see now it is properly utilized it is all you you are the master so God created the Masters they will go and enjoy but everything good as a bad effect also now you know the sometimes the children mother will take them for the suing and the first time they won't go down to the water mother say nothing come with me the teacher will be there and once they get the joy of swimming they won't come out there's another problem the pretty in the beginning the father will help the baby the child to cycling the first do you cry no no no the moment he can balance and he can move now his father running after him a stop stop it is alright the same thing happened to go to he created the beautiful world then he created the being to enjoy and now the problem they started enjoying only forgetting the God so this is the problems what sorry don't forget me enjoy and come back to me No who are you now they started question who is God most of the people they will say now we are fine over here God let him be there wherever don't disturb us course what do you think disturb me is what okay dealing with the happiness he created misery also so you had so many beautiful myths weeds are there you go on eating then you have to go to doctor so these two things cyka cyka side by side who created God and who is actually enjoying him suffering who is enjoying and suffering the achiever who are the Chiba God Himself now God has created out of him this all these varieties now he was enjoying in a different way the father and the son if you relate in this way the father and the Son and the son then started misbehaving to what the father will do then the father will hide the punish or will go down to him and say see if you are doing these even suffer and that exactly what the Maharaja Bharata mom at monocle furniture and it says so so that they may enjoy the Saints contacts in this world and along with that we perform good beneficial work and gradually prepare themselves for the liberation from the samsara from the liberation from the samsara the God created that mother brought the child to swim his wing she spent money to learn the English son is not coming up then the mother forced him to come up and that is for the liberation surah etirsa saunders to ship t surpasseth Arctica maya namaha bother you even need my baby boo God a bit to my arm I'm quoting from the bhagavata is a rod stander at arts and the fifth job and this is 2015 26 verses here it says the Supreme God through Maya it is the material material ghazals the Maya part of God that becomes the material who pardon a column and conscious being that is the Brahma intellectual cause one is material cost another intellectual cause and also it needs the power the Shakti to mating the what is the Shakti Carla so these three things have only Brahman the Brahman is the shakti Brahman is the
