[Bhagavatam 059 : The Unique Reply](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g_FdXR7EOPg)

please repeat after me Shanta who Jerusalem but mana solution rishaad harem gagana attrition me the Barnum ship hung Lakshmi condom Kamala Jana you give the John Adam Young Bundy business bye Adam sorry [Music] so we're starting the part about them and we have entered into a beautiful the description where a famous king he was performing some rituals and when he found that a young boy a Brahmin and he entered physically strong and his face were showing that he is intelligent educated but he was not doing anything seeing that the king asked him if you don't mind self what is it that you were a young man educated it seems but you are not doing any work then in reply he said I am observing the nature and nature is my guru I'm learning from the nature and then he gave the description of his guru which is a bee or a snake or the bird like that twenty-four gurus he described and he is the abbot other this about who the story is a unique the wind the I would cover the famous devotee he came to the Krishna say Oh Krishna I cannot live without you well if you are dying let me allow me also to die along with you and if you are going somewhere else I will also follow you we go to you I cannot survive so he said like that and for that the Krishna Lord Krishna told him the story of the Avadhuta and you do you do the king and the Avadhuta they had a conversation krishna referred that why why you depending on me at this body it cannot return on us because it is made of five elements so naturally anything which is made of many other things is going to be destroyed so as because my body is made of five elements I am going to be dead someday this God even forward and you cannot follow me but what is your goal not to follow me not this Krishna but the emancipation liberation Mukti how do we get that so he was writing his devotees this is also the great quality of a guru the most of the guru ordinary gurus they want the followers and when all people are following here is a very happy they never have a cart you should only follow me you should only worship me you should only listen to me you should only practice what I say cart and he never thinks that whether that will be beneficial for his devotees or not this is bad type of gurus third great but the good gurus like the Krishna the he always wanted to help people to get liberation then he said I will tell you the story of a young man was getting the knowledge from the nature so he narrated that it begins like this way you do ooh gotcha we do is the king and from him he was the first person from him that you do clan the krishna was also born in that particular clan you do it is a function who to put the young brahmana go to su Bashara da young are Sugden of on Lok on with dumbs charity Bala but you're an educated person and strong in physically but you are roaming around like a child why isn't harvested of time so that was the question you have to remember this question and ultimately he will give the answer and wonderful answer then the Avatara does Avadhuta is telling walking from the nature I am learning and all my gurus at the air and this way he goes and he describes the different gurus then he finally said you know I have understood the secret of the creation secret of this world completed it with what he created it and how this creation is sustaining all haven't stood how by observing the spider will Navi look at it if we can understand the some people or painters when they say the Sun setting we also thought really painful we also see same color all those things but it never comes to her mind but he knows or she knows that they will be painting so beautifully and again we will go and purchase the same painting we're spending maybe thousands of dollars we went we saw but we could not depict that we could not understand that I appreciate that properly this is also Raghavan Salaam Krishna his life also he fine whatever he saw he utilized those knowledge as for his teaching and he saw in the villages in up in the whole time at particularly in the Indian villages they were husking the rice I wouldn't shut up think that's called a key I don't know other so this that way the wooden thing is coming and crashing well lady will be there just changing the rises and same lady is also talking with the buyers those who have come to buy the rights and other two ladies are going on giving the pressure in the rhythm and they'll be having a beautiful music will be singing and doing that these lady who is sitting over there was very careful at the same time she is also taking care of the baby lying on her lap and changing the house and also talking with the customers can you imagine three things she's doing but serum wish to observe her attention is on the hand right hand that she is using to change the husk Salaam additional looked at it and immediately say why can't you do that keep your mind always on God as a deity is having that mind on that she is also changing constant and she knows any mystic her fingers will be crushed so the same way if you can put the attention to God and they do all these things whatever you are trying to do so this is called observation Jesus also in many times in the parables through small stories and here we find our Avadhuta he said ya tornami retired unum son Dibakar Taha paya preheater gooiest and receptive beyond my ensure my sure are the one who is the lord of the Lord's maja he should mom is the great issue Allah is the Lord with the God so he is the Lord of all gods my angel and he is creating house he is creating from his home has the good Navi mr. spider as the spider sprayed his wave from his own and again solos it after playing some time it takes it back sometimes it leave but if you observe it comes down and if it doesn't find any food then goes bad and all the same thing also goes into death so same way the creation so God is the creator and God is also the material how the widget has been created and God is also sustaining and finally at the tang of destruction where all these things go back to God this is the beautiful and the best the way he understood the whole thing and that is Vedanta in the money shot also we find yet or novice reject a green nature yet have pretty beyond oxidized somehow like that he said it is all-natural way just it happened like that why God has created you are asking the question all people who has the ye goddess clinic and if he has created that why so many bad people why something wrong to use and some emotional people who say no no I don't accept this type of God the children are dying this thing are happening that thing happened anything we think everything should be very good but if you become the ruler you will understand is so difficult things are always even that even the parents can take grow their to 3 children as they they wanted no they grow in their own way not to sixteen years fourteen sixteen years is okay in America you cannot leave but I think below 16 or 17 hello the child should not be there in the home alone I went to Kannada and the younger girl she was taking lot time I - okay you were to stay wrong we are all leaving just to make her afraid then she told you can on this is against law after busy it gives law then I learned I was not knowing that so is it this is against law Monica she knows the law and she knew the parents won't be able to go away without her so she was taking time so like that if you know the truth there is no problem she knew the law that parents cannot lead me and she was at his very same way if you know this whole cliché is created by God and they're going back to God what will happen to you no honey no problem I'm going to enjoy this because someday I'm going back to God and this is not so easy of course and we have to understand how to do that so this is you have to understand how the creation creation this is the most important thing all philosophy all religion they always talking about the God the Creator and is universe the creation and the relation between the creator and the creation all these three only and nothing else but we know they're explaining that varies sometimes he will say like these intelligences like that and here that we say the religion differs now religion is same all people are trying to go back to God only so this here we find and then this young boy he said to the king okay now you think everything has come from God but this we are also God but we don't know that why because God has created some problem for us some games you have to solve that puzzle and then only you can come what is that process love and attachment for the created thing and when you like the children when they play on the seashore they'll be making so many toys out of the sand and then when the parent said okay now it is done let us go back they will start crying now I made the castle then there is at all then this thing what had happened to the doggy means that became the sand she made that but for hard it is real and she doesn't want to go away the children will be crying but the parents they forcefully take them back and after some time to forget we are all serving the same thing we are also crying when the Guru says they come back you know guru it is not possible I have mine why I have my children a lot of property I have to sell it and market rate is low I have to wait for that guru said What nonsense you are talking about nothing is there all made of sand hold my hand and come with me and as Jesus said well the motor to back and follow me same way the who can accept that call the gate liberation and what is that liberation create joy and without any fear constantly we are afraid over here we are driving the car in 72 suddenly there we saw the flash somewhere my god it must be foolish then again come down to sixty fear fear fear everywhere everywhere you were not and anywhere you go and you go to the office you're afraid of boss you come back to the home you're afraid of your wife so when it constantly fear fear and fear and this goes on one day you can go and tell hey boss will say what you say what you what mock they are you not joining the young I will be doing but I'm not afraid of you why I know the life is different this is all through the life abbulu the life is without fear he does everything he does everything but not under the pressure of anything this is about the life this is for Imam shall live and we are part of conscious and asana the ramakrishna mission sannyas is a paramhamsa sannyas paramahamsa means we only care for God and nothing else so that is the fearlessness this fearlessness come when you know the truth what is the truth I am God so this is and then he is telling to the team who are senior are so respectful the King at this young boy Avadhuta us telling lock dois Suliban Eden Bocuse of Avanti mansion our tadam Anita mapa de da this is the eleven secunda ninth chapter and 29 verse after bhagavata the supportive of Gita to none your theatre not pertain condiment to yogurt mr. er sorry shakalu surah Fateha a little difficult Sanskrit but it says o king having this real human birth loved was suitable because before that he said the God has created this universe and then afterwards he created the snake there are reptiles the burst we need many other bodies he gave the whole list so many different bodies but he was not satisfied God was not satisfied the we should have something who can understand it who can argue I can discriminate so he created human being and after creation of the human being God was very happy very satisfied it just liked me and the same also we find in the the Bible in the Christian tradition they say God created human being out of his own image this our own image means he can discriminate he can think he can judge they suppose you have four or five servants and whatever you say they always do now sit down over here and wait for me they will be sitting and waiting but suppose you have a son also why how long you are going to be there in this building that that time I can spend somewhere else and give me the time ah give me your number I will call him or you call me why should I have to split over here this is the day the Sun is different they he is not silent but he loves you that he will say okay whatever you say I am going to obey but he might wanna make sure they have to seat over here unnecessarily spot like that so obviously we do like that this someone like me you'll be talking with me and suppose you have a big dog and you go and talk to the darling no it happened this happened that happened and you be satisfied no if you have someone in the house can reciprocate and say that I heard about it a great prophecy and Sanskrit the scholar taught at a university and he was a very handsome looking person and he married a lady unfortunately she was not that good-looking and then sometimes on his frames is to ask him why you have married this lady you could marry a good-looking girl then he said when I come back from my class and I am composing something and I can share it this lady and she can help me the in composing the Sanskrit verses and when I say this is the word I don't understand the root of this particular word she can say that and I enjoyed that and suppose a beautiful lady and whenever I come back she'll be telling whenever going to market when you are going to purchase and if I say some Sanskrit words you know what you are talking about don't of all those nonsense then do you think I'd be happy no this is the thing that's why in Indians tradition that will always the matchmaking the marriage they will go and check with a boy and the girl of the same status then only it is good they can exchange and they can be happy they can understand each other that the God is also telling like this I created human being why I could get enjoyment but these human birth is very rare because this is the time when one can go back to the root that is God Godhead so love to us to do lappam edom focus on preventing after many many births after many many different bodies when you get this human body want to try to realize it so oking this real human body should quickly strive for liberation before death but you do not know to none yet they turn up attained aluminum - yagh worth anytime you can die oh let me enjoy this life after 80 years they don't go to the gamma you do not know what is going to happen so this is the wrong way so why we say that because we are not aware about this world this world is transitory so temporary it cannot be the one person got a job and he was so happy he came touched the food means respecting and then came and prayed to tackle thanks that how could I have got the job after one month he got a better job he left it so it goes on and on and on so this is so temporary whole life is so temporary wait we are going to understand that we are green fighting these that is going on why because all of us under this illusion sometimes some people say the religious people are really very literate people they can enjoy the life in the wrong we enjoy the eternal life you are going to enjoy the temporary life but we enjoy the eternal life how understanding the transitory nature of this world this cling to change is going to change so this he said o king the king you do ask that young do you remember the first question why don't you work what you are going like this then this is the answer he has given booking having these dispassion for these worldly things I don't want this dis passion for the world things with the light illumination eye room over the world free from attachment and equally ism free from attachment that is one thing and also free from egoism I don't have I sense oh I am doing this and roaming I don't care for the world nothing like that so be Geronimo him Etan move to some girl on a hum christy he he said I roam in the world moved the Sangha and not attached I talk to people I become framed but I'm not a test this is the beauty of the life I am with everyone I love I kill but at the same time I am NOT that test so our army muy muy he means this world pitcher ami I go around a town Mook the Sangha without attachment on a hungry te and without any ego if you had the ego if you go to the friend's house that perhaps if the frame cannot recognize you you feel hard and now he is not recognizing me as because I happy to be mom I don't have money and when I was having the money they were just nothing like that you're completely free along with the story of the birth of the Lord explained about the art man and the specific practices to realize the Hartman this is the beauty of the bhagavata the Bhagavata though it is a personal god Krishna and before Krishna it Bishnu to the mainly Bishnu from first chapter to nine chapter and then on the tenth chapter particularly the Krishna and afterwards some conversation with the Krishna so bhagavata is a personal God but this personal God this Krishna how he is giving the teaching that we have to understand the he'll he said first a one who is blindly following him who dollar he likes him so much and he said I want to be with you if you are going to die allow me to tell also that much that for that type of follower and then the Lord is telling look at it don't depend on me Buddha also said the same thing to honor them Don under was crying the Buddha without you what you will do you say the same thing to depend on me so this don't depend on me means this body to depend on this particular body I am always there everywhere so it did he say the story of the uber Tata I just mentioned one or two first this person he was observing the nature and learned from the nature of the truths all the truth still there and from there and then he said I roam around enjoy the life not that oh this world is transitory let me go and commit suicide know what I should be here I don't have any problem but the thing is when you go to some of the parks you see so many things temporary is nothing like that and you're just roaming and enjoying and coming back to solve so this is the way you should live in this world and there's a marriage ceremony people are going attending laughing dancing singing good enjoy but same time when you come turn back them out of that forget it Phil that is all temporary you now it is their life let them this is the thing it goes so this is the way we have to understand sometimes the young people they get entangled and mostly that love and all that and they are suffering they will educated will stablished drink good world but somehow the emotion of whom and where he will go or she will go so sometimes they call me and say show me what shall I do this is the thing I always say this cell on suppose if you think this is the only thing in your life we doubt him or how you are going to do wrong that would be someone else you can love you can enjoy the life so wait and see you try it's okay if not don't get emotional and don't make any wrong decision so this is the thing in the life the scripture is teaching us you should also do now the very important thing the Lord is introducing us and he is telling in this life only one thing you should be very very careful Lord that is true our mom in the bhagavata said you're the duty that you have accepted so our Dharma that means your duty and responsibility so means you so you have accepted the life of the householder you have accepted the job of a doctor or job of an at least greater and naturally your job needs to be there for long long hours you cannot say my neighbor his ghost office at 8 o clock and comes back for five I will also do like that no doctors of anytime you movie called you have to go you have to attain it cannot close your phone put off the phone and then you you have to be all the time attentive that is your job you have accepted - other but that is the southern I made one army person then I was asking how much salary you get and what are other benefits they were stealing I don't know good there's a lot of benefits then Xiaomi you know it is like that that they are going on feeding in in the country that they will be feeding a goat and the goat will become very fatty and then they would slaughter so they are feeding me so that we need a little bit all on the border they won't call him don't call anyone else that's right so many days we failed you now you go and I'm and I have to go it is like this he understood the truth and he said I have accepted it so I am ready any time I will never stop back for my wife or children I know I will miss them but still Duty is duty disgust Adama this Adama your own responsibility that you have accepted the one Krishna not only in the bhagavad-gita but here also in the bhagavata me say you should perform your personal responsibility perfectly then he saved Maya would eat the issue about hitters other big issues mother say aha is the eleven scandal and taint chapter the whole chapter the krishna is talking about this and the very first verse he says that this I have created the different type of responsibilities I have given and as we know in the bhagavad-gita he said chart or burn we are system the four different categories I have made what one is intellectuals another is mentoree Anthony's business community and the the labor this chart will burn on four different types if you are deer as a laborer you should not invade a doctor the intellectual one or the scientist they're different category do your duty and be happy perform your duty happening so Charton were none she said Maya would et issue a volatile Saddam issue matter hysteria if you want to take me as a refuge Oh would cover what the war was talking and whatever you have to perform your own responsibilities duties then only you can come and how you will do and Strutter mainly tonometry in bhagavad-gita is saying it is better to die in one's own duty than to try to follow the other do other things this is of no use when you find that someone has got the Nobel Prize novel or deity has become and it's so much of respect and all that why the economics oh I also know economics I can also try to and it will be in vestige of time but you may know a little but that level to get that is not possible what he with the responsibility that you have accepted be happy with it too sometimes some people they come and say I am actually a born Christian Catholic I didn't like that and then I went to a Muslim fold and then I thought it lets me try with the booties and I was therefore three four years now I have come to be dunder and I said the next wear your green ultimately again will go back to the Christianity because only four five religions are there so if you go on changing like this you'll be one day you will see again you have gone back to the one so this is not to be that's all about Swami Vivekananda said then you might not to change your religion you have to change your attitude that's all you may need to change your religion jeans that I teach you mine only is the best and all others are bad wrong attitude mine is a good one because I have chosen it but at the same time I consider everyone else also going to the same God there so so you are free from anxiety free from anger free from egoism and that helps you ultimately to all will go to the same goal we have to understand this then the Lord is telling the seed the four different types of caster there are four different different responsibilities whatever you are now whatever you have accepted you must follow that and perform that then he said how the Karma the world action generator good or bad result the question will come you are asking us to do them perform the duties but the Hindus believe any action mentally physically and through the war whatever the action that you were doing it has a result so it will bind me either good or bad what about that then the Lord is telling me Brickton karma say beta problem he said you should perform unselfish work and give up the selfish work if you give up the selfish work and accept the unselfish one day in there with no problem and that is why this is the point most of the Hindu they will understand only 100 years before only hundred years is a civilization of ten thousand years and only hundred years before they understood that we can perform the monks also can do some duties they were not aware of it why it went on the court went on in this way the if you perform any work the result will bind you and the marks will they will give up the whole things and they will become only mom and won't do anything and then it really became the whole society started becoming mom but the Buddha talking the Buddha was followed by sixteen thousand people sixty thousand people like that is to move where he will go to naturally used to go to the stretch teas on rich people and rich people they are feeding sixty thousand you can imagine so much not only feeding even the clothings and I need many other things the whole society money is going into that world just consumption and after that what they are doing meditating and that is their personal benefit what about the society society is becoming weak economically and then the spread the message that this whole world is illusionary dokkan dokkan sarvam the everything is full of misery misery then the person who is helping you giving you food and clothing spending money and he'll be thinking oh my girls look at these they're only holy people we are all sinners so thief is also mentally they become weak the society become weak because of a wrong conception the Hindus also used to do like that the Buddhists also came they propagated like that it is only Chandi vivekanandan scientists can imagine it is only in 19th century then he said see Ramakrishna say if you can see God by closing your eyes can't you see God with open arms God is everywhere God is everything and he were reading that you are understanding that you are trying to realize that and why he thing you are closing your eyes why don't you go and serve the living gods and goddesses if you go and offer the food to a picture or an image or an idol whether that food fruits tasty or not he will never say anything when you will take the pro-shah day this is not this day at all the garden say anything but suppose you go and serve the same thing to a living God a homeless a poor he will throw it before you hey man what you are giving is not good not at all thirsty if that is the thing every time you go to serve the Living God you're equally scratched and you are becoming pure pure and fuel this is the beauty you have to control your emotions anger and he go oh I purchased this food with my own money and I prepared all those things and this man is telling me doesn't like it no that is not the service you have to give something that will he will appreciate so this is called the karma so what is the Karma here in the bhagavata the krishna is telling you should do unselfish work I get really appreciated you know that we have purchased a property in the Chicago it's a church or church as because this is this month the Christian society they come there and keep something for the poor as so many boxes and the things will be there every day at our the door now the person who is over there he has mentioned so we we cannot accept all this please don't give it over here so so nice they will come and bring some food and kill I was reading in the newspaper that one lady she observed in in her neighborhood the delivery boys are coming and they are giving everything to be different doors but they are hungry they don't have anything to drink so she purchased some food some candies and and those things and also some cold drinks and kept it outside and it is written free feel free to pick it up this boy is the car the delivery boys and they're so happy unselfish work the lady is not over there to say you know my name is so and so and I have Spain hundred dollar to purchase these you come and take it and thank me she is not telling that so this is : selfish world I have seen people feeding the birds and also helping others just for that you don't want that it should be published in the newspapers or anything but also we have noticed that some of the famous cinema actor and actresses they go to help the poor people and they will go along with the reporters if the reporters are not there that program will be cancelled for the next day when the reporters are there generally they will go and then they lift a child or Savior and that will be a premiere in the world in the media selfish world same thing they are also helping but 14 so God's saying if you are doing it then you won't get the mind or get the purified then he said my devotee should practice Yama and niyama this is the traditional in the way if you like to realize God these are the two things you must practice one is called Yama why a a me another is MIA ni so this niyama what are that it says Yama first his limbs are non-violence second destructive truth third austere non-stealing fourth brahmacarya self-restraint and up oracle not accepting excess the excess money that they take all the time people the Exedy is that excess money it is not necessary but enmity even at a time of the when there is a second world war people started the thing that they were selling in one dollar they started selling in hundred dollar excess you are taking its a scene so they say that non-violence truth non-stealing self-restraint and non accepting existing you must accept whatever is another 24th the people who bring so many things and they will keep over there they keep the mention about their romneyís then xiaomi PA like that and next day morning but homage is excited you will go and spend oh these three backpacks for me and two for you like that is good that is good then when you open and see the same thing was with me I always give it to somebody else it's not necessary I am already having why to have this so they I am going to accept your gift but it is excess so obviously I can give it to somebody else so that is called Oprah Club another is jnana that is called suture cleanliness the clumpiness this is very very important sometimes people they win the team that to realize god you have to constantly meditate and it not to clean the room ROM when the new monastery started and the new voice started coming all the Brahma cherries shaii be vacant and unannounced is to go and enter into their rooms in one room there will be two three private islands just to share the room and his to go and see whether every bed is properly kept and the clothings are also properly the room is clean then only you can meditate and every day you should take part and then in the fresh clothes should come with the body and mind is clean - that's called soldier and along with the body and mind you should also mind body the mind also should be purified out by taking the name of God by praying every time the Shogun santosha containment this is very very essential containment whatever happens is okay good for me that containment should be there top of austerity now sometimes you're successful sometimes you are not you have to accept that happily and pray to God all the time I could not make a success because you didn't like it perhaps so please guide me how I can get that success so this is called tapa SWAT the higher every day at least few pages of a holy book one should drink that's called swatter attire that means reading but SWAT tie means reading the holy book and this holy book written by the holy people are maybe is a collection of the teachings of the holy people and when you read two three pages that will give you impetus inspiration skull satire and then finally issue upon a Donna meditation and you should perform that niyama is the soldier santosha tapa swatter issue Ramadan that means cleanliness containment austerity spiritual scriptural study and meditation so the young Yama and niyama then the Krishna is telling this man would ever wanted to follow him and he's very clear if you follow me and serve me give me a glass of water I may try to place you and pray for you but if you want God realization then you have to strive you know how he saved Amani Amata Daksha need brahma dealers overeat aha he must be free from pride the god what is God realization this Sunday morning everywhere in all the churches and all the temples and all the productive societies talks are given then the millions of people they have only the spiritual paths are they developing their character that is the question the gold is attained the masses but after that what so theses the thing we have to understand that I have come upon here in the began to society to understand religion and what is this religion changing your mind changing your attitude changing your thought and how you can do that first is Shri Krishna say in this paga bottom you must practice Yama and niyama and then he is telling in the sixth verse of the tenth chapter we say you must be free from pride God if you have the ego you can never realize God whoever it may be waiver even the topmost person in the religious the status if he's having the ego you won't realize God so first is Amani the free from pride a mother a free from jealousy also somebody is doing good you should not feel jealousy why because God is manifesting within him the God is manifesting within him so if I feel jealousy then it is wrong because I go away from the truth the chord is in that and then conduction able one must be capable to do many things that's called touch evil they should be able to do it otherwise it is of no use need mama without attachment and tilde so little firmly devoted to the pool this is also very very important did her so Rita firmly devoted to the Guru Guru is your tight guru is your friend who is the one who adopts even thank you and then he is the person so much concern to help you in developing spiritual life so sometimes is harsh sometimes it is not so one must be completely devoted to the Guru I am reminding her to remembering that story that I heard from a senior monk long back that there was a rich man and he used to come and give a good donation and that time ramakrishna mission the formation pinion and the general secretary was the direct disciple of Avanza Ramakrishna Saravanan touching the small room is there and used to Sita birthday like this this man came and he saw some of the ordinary people religious perhaps they came they were chatting with the Swami ji he came and he said hey go go away from here I like to talk to the Swami the Swami was his guru he took initiation from the death Swami Chidananda see but because of his richness he was surprised he came in front of his guru he showed that it said go away go away I'd like to talk to the good then saddam's immediately said go away from me I don't like to see your face these people should remain here I would like to talk to them you better go she became so much insulted you know in those days Calcutta a rich man is called a wind or a landlord and he was insulted before this but many people is it ok I will see and then you went out and started planning how to inserts of the Knology he went on planning planning man could not do anything this story is saved to our Swami's when you know two of our from is they went to visit Kashi bananas and they did going to take the lunch in a devotees house then the devotee of the great humbleness he said Swamiji will you please visit my neighbor he came to know that you people will be coming from ramakrishna mission he is constantly requesting me to take you there and he is bedridden you won't be able to come in Swami she said sure we will go so they wind obtain this gentleman told you know I am that sinner who tried to insert my guru but then I have understood the greatness of my guru I never could meditate on guru neither could concentrate my mind on guru but when I started thinking that I should insert and I could not forget him even for a moment from then onwards I am going on thinking about this that figure and now without any if effort I can meditate on him and meditating on my guru I get so much peace and I can feel he insulted me with a purpose so that I can concentrate I can meditate on guru this is girl constantly trying to help and he is telling that you must be like that and again he said Trust is free from pride if you like to realize God free from pride free from jealousy and he should be able deduction the self confidence should be there I'm going to realize God someday nail mama without attachment and dinner so read AHA firmly devoted to the Guru then comes or subdora don't BST one person came he is also my disciple he said sharmaji is a Hindi speaking person he said I may look tired some couch or carom a mother which any prefer the I am thinking that after leaving everything I should go back to him Allah are you wearing him Allah it Adam Allah is not that old Amana where everything was all calm and quiet if you go
