[Bhagavatam 072 : God and His Miraculous Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dyVyICqxglo)

good morning dear devotees and Friends the the outset I'd like to congratulate all the fathers past present and future for the the beautiful the day that has been declared as the International Father's Day in Sanskrit they say pita salga pita Dharma pita he paramon tapa so this is the he is the as pure as the heaven and he is our the goal that is the Dharma bottarga pita Dharma pita he para mom tapa and serving the father helping the father who being the father is the greatest apostle charity so that is how the the traditional Indian culture they are fold the father then this International Father's Day I congratulate all the fathers who were in the past and who are present now and also who will become the responsible as father because the greatest responsibility in the human society lies on the fathers and today also international yoga day the today morning I was giving a talk on the small and all of the whole world that can their meeting so different people from different parts of the world they were speaking they're showing the yoga the yoga ms hata yoga this hata yoga when they were practicing and in fact the researching to find out who is the creator and in the process as because they were researching their own mind so obviously the two things were essential first to seat for a long time in one particular posture so that one can control the mind and the second to control the breathing so by this to process the hata yoga developed and in the Vyasa in his country he has given the names of so many varieties of the asanas sometimes they'll be sitting on their knees sometimes this posture that posture and Shankaracharya also for the Yogi's for those who like to meditate those who like to control the mind the yoga the posture is very essential at the same time controlling the breathing and when they were controlling the body and also the vital forces they developed another branch of knowledge that is Aveda this Iowa they again was wonderful that health so why all this one goal to find out who is the creator then asana pranayama pratyahara dharana dhyana samadhi the pretty hard on dharna that also comes in the process of meditation and Samadhi today when we will study the very bottom we will find how our Lord Krishna he is teaching the meditation to the hood dhaba so we will come to that before that let us chant this mantra and once again congratulation for the Father's Day congratulation for the world yoga D let us now chant this mantra Shanta Karim puja gursha unum but the mana Judaism Vishwa harem Gurgaon Assad regime mingi shabanam Lakshmi contem Kamala jnanam you give e dr naga Miam Bondi Beach gnam bah-bah-bah harem Sara below friends many of you who are following this our haveta this is the main source one of the sources of the liberation liberation means Mukti Mukti means going beyond the six changes jo t st birthday t be prohibitive epoch co t like that from one this goes on changing all the six changes the last Sunday the June 14th we have heard the reply of the Supreme Being who appeared before the Brahma and his four sons except for last two days we were reading that particular portion sanaka sananda sanatana and sanat-kumara they are known as sons the son means this the four saw they are the mind born son of the Brahma now these people can imagine they were troubled with one problem what is that attachment of the mind with the same subjects which every day we are also finding so they got attached with the different objects of this world and naturally if you are attached to that what you can do you behave like a slave recently I was reading in the newspaper it happened in India that a young boy very young hardly 20 24 like that and he loved a girl but the girl ultimately it didn't continue and angry because of that break he took a gun and way to that girl's house and shot her not only that to make sure that she's dying stabbed her many times and then now arrested by the police his life is also gone then the girl also did for why just because thinking that if I am NOT getting that girl as my wife I'm going to suffer just thinking maybe it was completely different he could be happy the boy could be happy but no why more what is that maja complete delusion what is this delusion we forget all everything and pause and cons the positive negative all thought goes away there's a muga infatuation attachment to the object I just saw that girl developed some friendship and then roaming around started thinking that she will be mine that's all just because of that this heinous deed he did and now he himself will suffer his family will suffer girl's family will suffer so many people in suffer because of this so where from it came attachment attachment to what Rupa and we're from the Rupa came the eyes went and saw and brought it back to the mind can you imagine how difficult it is and that is the reason in the beginning of the civilization we can save when only the supreme beings mind born the firstborn Brahma chatter mukham because he was having the for Veda the knowledge so the they imagined that he was having four heads how one hate can contain so much of knowledge but in reality it may be that drama was not having four it's just imagining so he is too much of knowledge for Veda rickshaw Miyagi Iturbide whole thing why the Lord has given that knowledge to Brahma and then the Ark's the Brahma you must create that he was creating in the beginning he created the seven Rishi's then the other manu's then this four sons now these four sons they came and then told father can you please teach us the secret of yoga today's the international yoga day now what is this yoga at the art McGee oka the basic yoga is hata yoga asana pranayama to keep the body fit sharira martim Kalu Dharma siddhanam with this body only one can perform the religion body is necessary the health is necessary so obviously to keep this health the body healthy they develop this type of things so this hata yoga thing withdrawing the mind from the same subjects protaras a hara collection and then refusing to collect aha doesn't mean only eating through the mouth ah Hara means collection and that goes with the five senses since organs so obviously is a very difficult hence these four they came and requested their father we have already read that and the Brahma thought why not I asked this question to my Creator the Supreme Being so he prayed to the Supreme Being can you please come because you have created the mind of a being as a human being intelligent and you have created the objects the Supreme Being has created the objects Brahma considered himself just as a machine the supreme being whatever he wanted he did it through Brahma so Brahma was very humble and he said sir can you please come Raghavan can you please come and keep the answer and the Supreme Being as because you all know is the consciousness all pervading so it we do not know exactly how it is so we can imagine it must be the consciousness that much but Vogon see Ramakrishna said you cannot end by saying this is like this so we are not so only at this moment we know that this is their consciousness and consciousness all pervading so he came in the form of his so on this for including the Brahma their father he was taken aback because they never saw the form of that Supreme Being then it are easy like the so on so obviously the first question Kok Bhuvana who are you sir we know and naturally the Supreme Being started playing with them hey you cannot ask this question because except me there is nothing how can you ask this question and if you are asking these the form the so on then the body means the combination of so many things so this particular way that you are asking is a grammatically wrong that it should be plural like that then after world when all those things were done he gave them the training the teaching the knowledge and the process that guiana which is also known as samkhya and the yoga the process so we can say Lord Vishnu is the fast and the only guru who is a guru the one who is giving the knowledge and then removing the dirt nests of Gianna Timmy Rhonda Shear Gianna Angela Shailaja is bringing the light the torch of that knowledge and so the ignorin sees going away that is the Guru the Vishnu Lord Vishnu is the Guru and he declared himself that Supreme Being we never knew who he was he said Janet Imam Agathon yaga yaga VII Vishnu Yoga means Vishnu anything that you do for the betterment of others without expecting any return it is FD a-- and yagya means Vishnu so he said in the Bhagavad Aarti in chapter 38 verse I'm quoting only the last few words Jonny Tama our Gotham young young know me that I am the Vishnu and who is this Vishnu that which is everywhere so the definition come arthur yet be she tohe Bertie that Vishnu bhavati another explanation that which is everywhere is Vishnu again it says that which is free from fetters and bondage that is again Vishnu without bondage we are all bound by so many things but the Bishnu is not bound we why we are bound because we have the desire that's why we are bound the Vishnu is not bound because he is not having any desire what is the difference between the Vishnu and me what is the difference between the creator and the creation only desire and nothing else then Hindi that many those who know the in detail they know there's a beautiful couplet and it says cha cha he Jamari to need it in each matter should dramatic tune out the beach which means in between I was in reality shoot the Brahma the pure Brahmin pure knowledge but only you came in between the cha he cha he means jihad desire and you differ separated me from that knowledge that purity so you worked the charm are you at the lowest of the low because of that denouncing that so that is the way the spiritual seeker will constantly keep an eye on the desire what type of desire is rising within my mind so these are very very important as a process of withdrawing the mind from the same subjects the Vishnu advised the sanaka brothers that if they concentrate their mind on Vishnu then automatically their minds will be detached from the same subjects what was the problem how to detach the mind so Bishnu taught them the you better concentrate on me the Vishnu and who is Vishnu all-pervading consciousness he is all-pervading everywhere without fetters without bondage that is Vishnu beasts are a de busines how the Vishnu came in a separate form that will come afterwards but at the same time the Vishnu is all-pervading sometimes those who are following the path of the Vishnu are called Vaishnava but this we should keep in my in the bush Nava Tantra and Vedanta are not having any differences only explanation that's all and nothing else all are the same the Vishnu is all-pervading and the goal of the Vedanta a brahmana all-pervading so obviously it is this is only one without to that without bondages so now the eleventh the Concord or 14 chapter the first verse 14 chapter first verse would ever arks three Krishna referring Cerebrus news declaration what is the declaration johann yoga SIA some question so testy Ritter sir DJ sir puranam this puranam and the highest soup in gold puranam para para means all is higher now I am the highest and Ayana enemies the goal the path and the highest path para IANA piranhas and of what he said some Casilla of the knowledge you Garcia of the activities the practice stratosphere the truth returns here the straightness is plethora leadership in the energy everything we what we need the truth truthfulness in the practice of spirituality truthfulness is the must and if we are not practicing truthfulness we become hypocrite but in the world those who are in the society they are to some extent is for them it is allowed in the Hinduism and that sanatana dharma the very broad so they have allowed the sometimes you can tell lies like queen are talking with your wife just for the fun you can tell lies so husband wife that is permitted at the time of giving the marriage to your daughter if you say naturally the parents the father will say arranged marriage so the father will say oh you don't know my daughter she can cook so well she can sing so well it is not real but the people they also understand and I she knows little bit of cooking little bit of music a jockey so that that is the way it is all allowed when you are in danger people have come to kill you you can tell lies when you are in problem that some people are trying to snatch away take away your the wealth money you can tell lies these are all allowed for the householders those who are living in the house but for the sannyasins but those who have left the heart and home and dedicated 100% for this realization not a single thing should be there when the one of the direct disciple Suburbans ramakrishna swami brahmananda he came to Bhagwan see Ramakrishna you see ramakrishna could read the mind he saw him and told hey today you have committed a sin something wrong I can look at your face tell me what you have done he couldn't remember anything I didn't do anything I don't know then suddenly he remembered the while reaching back he met some of his friends and jokingly told some the false things maybe they were asking where you were going and he told something and came to here so the false he uttered Salaam Krishna told him you are going to go for you realize God even as a play as a game as a you should not say anything that is not truth hold strict to truth that is for the monks but in the society it is allowed to some extent so this set theory today sir I am the goal I am puranam this is the first verse that the three Bishnu who declared that Supreme Being who came in the form of a swan and then introduced himself as a Vishnu he said referring to that the would double he said o Krishna the teachers of the Brahmin teaches various means to attain the supreme are all of them important or only one of them is the foremost that's the very that that is the would ever in in the bhagavad-gita we found Krishna is Arjuna is asking and in the Bhagavata we find the would Dava is asking so and we get the wonderful reply he said Vedanta Krishna 3mc bikuni Brahma ba-da-da those who were practicing the spirituality they say that there are many ways to reach God daeum be culpa prytaneum Guto aho e komo kata are all of them are correct or there is only one which we should follow Muruga o Krishna you have given importance on bhakti-yoga for the path of liberation in this he say then Babu da Buddha ratash wha mean he is addressing the Krishna though he was considered as a friend of Krishna but now he is addressing him as a schwa mean Bharata Oh dr. schwa mean so the King may be a friend King may be an husband or father but the when the king is on the throne and he should be considered as king and all these relations should not be considered at that time the here the would double though he's a frame he's not addressing Krishna as a frame consider him as a frame rather you are the master so he said schwa mean so this is the way we should understand we should learn how to behave in the society that is very very important very very important we make mistakes it should be very very important we know him we can talk to him in a friendly way we can pat we can hold his hand we can embrace that is a friendly way it can go bad when he is sitting on the throne is the king and every respect should be given accordingly so this is the way says Parvati would our Rita SWA mean bhakti-yoga on a pig schita and you have given importance on the bhakti-yoga Oh Lord nearest ER said bata Sangam inna 3rb she ate manna ha and promised that there will remain only one attachment for the devotee and that is you it is only one attachment problem attachment with what all the objects and how many objects millions and billions and trillions so obviously how many paths there are many varieties of paths are there everyone is claiming that my paths is the right one that so everyone Salaam Krishna said everyone says my watch is going in the correct giving the correct time in those days now it is the course so naturally almost every time it is all watches are giving the same timing in the same John time John but that time you have to give another the spring was there the sometime spring has loose that the timing will be different different timing is to give so if he the ceramic richness eight but everyone they will say my watch is giving the right time and you have to follow my time that there was always that fighting and he says here who Dawa is telling there are so many varieties of paths but oh Lord the Bishnu also said and he were also telling that we must withdraw our mind and give it to you why is this the only path they tell that this is the only path then the Krishna started telling him giving him the history now one creation it is created then one Brahma will come and again he will create all these beings then the whole circle will continue then afterwards it will go away and it go back to the the same form before the creation so the creation sustenance and dissolution this circle is over a new circle has began that he's telling Lord Vishnu said to put mine to him you actually attached mind with you teachers are suggesting that is a problem Shri Krishna they inherited from the third to ninth verses how the knowledge at the time of dissolution pralaya the cessation of the creation God dissolved I am not reading I'm not quoting those that those who are interested can read that is in that this is the thirteen chapter and sorry it is a fourteen chapter third to ninth chapter fourteen 11th book as Conda and from third to nine verses again in the beginning of the another creation the Srishti he the god the supreme gave the knowledge to brahma that we find in the 14 the third verse my Otto brahmani prokta who is telling Shri Krishna the who is disree Krishna he's telling I created this and in the beginning of the creation is a new creation and in this new creation I give the knowledge to the Brahma that my god o brahmana prokta the third verse it says like this Tina prokta sua Putra mana be he that Brahma then disclosed that knowledge to his son Shyam boom Manu Manu is the beginning from Manu chapter II she the sub-30 we all know the Bhagwan see Ramakrishna he says the Shama Vivekananda is one of the saptrishi the destructor is she what are the names Bhrigu Merici a tree on ghee dosa pool hasta pool AHA and - they are also the forms of the gota all the Hindus are having the go through a clan what is this gota the teachings of a particular teacher who are the teachers mostly this chapter Isha's what is the speciality of the chapter he sees their knowledge is so supreme that's why they could retain their individuality even where nothing remained only one consciousness brahman there in that situation also they could and still they are having their own personality so that's called subtly she usually the Hindu astrologers they will point to the seven stars of deities of the Rishi these are the names so the slowly generations are changing first Brahma who told the Supreme Being now at present in the form of Shri Krishna that Supreme Being which is Brahman which is Vishnu he gave the knowledge to Brahma the firstborn in this creation the last creation is over in this creation second the Brahma taught to samba manu then manu gave to seven Rishi's like this it is coming these seven dishes again distributed that knowledge to different beings according to a predominant qualities shutter age otama what are the gunas quality satrajit Amma according to the qualities this Rishi's they gave them the knowledge suppose in the school that few are very intelligent so the teachers will take special classes are for them so that they know they will understand so very quickly and they will get the good result there are media occurs for them another type of teaching they will understand they will also but they are little slow in understanding the things there are very slow learners they will learn but you have to give lot of attentions and there are some special students they need a different way to learn so the grades are there to hear SATA Raja and Tama this satrajit Amma these three qualities according to their capacity of understanding they gave this different knowledge to what type of knowledge they taught Sam the Haven is the ultimate goal the my bang shaka they understand that in this life you are suffering for food you have to work hard for these on that but if you go to heaven everything is free and everything is easily available and you can enjoy the lie in all religion the heaven is there some Jan not they say and then it'll be the heaven then swerg something like that that is one second suggest a fame another group the kabhi they said the fame is the only thing for a human being in this world you must be known to but everyone the people should know you that mainframe will be like this so that is called the fame that is the ultimate goal and third is the control of the mind they are Yogi's they say no our only goal is to control the mind we are detaching them or our sense objects so now it sends organs from the sense objects controlling the mind then and others are there there the splendor or the world there but sionis another group saints enjoyment only and nothing else because you have got this human body and you have the test just enjoy because you do not know when you will die and after death what will happen don't bother about that don't waste time they are called char because they have the philosophies and like that many others are there so the who devar is asking this question then what will happen of course the three - wha me he has explained this in different time at the time of Krishna whether these people at the aeronaut but in the bhagavad-gita when we get the mention about the charvaka Charu body like that so they were also there these fellows of you were known so with our new so this is the question different ways are there so it is better why the different ways have come according to their taste according to react Ettore according to their understanding now when we go to other places we talk about the doit ism and then we say that you must pray because that is a good thing for them they are the spiritual learners the beginners and the beginning itself people say like the Osterberg crusade to his disciple the Janaka that you are that Supreme Being Janak understood because Janaka was ready so that is the reason we find that they always say the Advaita Vedanta Adhikari Adhikari means he has already understood all the knowledge of the Veda be tpod edita Vedanta minge and manage and monitor eva in this life or in the past life you must have to have the knowledge of the Veda so like this this along the who is an addict Adi who is a real student who can be the quality of a student so in the wood table was asking the Krishna there are so many different ways how this waste came and if there are so many which one we should follow krishna is giving the answer in this new circle the knowledge I gave to Brahma Brahma gave it to Manu Manu gave it to the seven the Rishi's seven Rishi's again gave this knowledge distributed this knowledge to all people according to their gunas according to their qualities so the never-ending some people they are satisfied with the serger so that is okay for them look this way then eleven book 14 chapter verses 12 through 28 Raghavan shri krishna advocated pure devotion as the best part to realize peace in this present age this is the bhakti marg now we are studying the bhagavata for the last I think two years and every Sunday we are discussing about this bhagavata majority of the time we are discussing about the knowledge the time now here in this part we find that the Sri Krishna himself is advocating the devotion what type of devotion and if you practice the devotion what will be the result all will come in in our next courses in the kilt verse he says ma Arpita at Manasa pure neither pictures Chester Davitt AHA Maya at mana Sukanya that cut Assad Bashar art manam sub y sub Deniz my friend one who has understood once mine or who has surrendered one's mind to me the God the supreme being indifferent to all objects of the world will surely achieve my nature what is that nature blissful dance so how I will know that I am making progress in my spiritual life joy blissfulness Ananda from inside sometimes some people they always ask this question how I will know that I am making progress in the spiritual life joy will come happiness will come and that happiness that joy doesn't depend on the other objects the frame the relative good food are many other things no it is from with him tag the joy always come up my heartbeat Oh at mana Supriya oh my friend my are Maya or pita at mana one who has dedicated surrendered completely his mind at mono means mind to me and near apeksha sarvatah and he is not interested in anything outside this world so naturally what he will get he'll get sukham and in the 27 verse again it says if a person thinks same subjects get attached to that but those who remember me all the time marching me the god alone the process is very simple the option has given to you you like to go to the world all you like to go to God the world has been created by God himself but God is separate from the world what is this world was the imagination so you go you play then ultimately you find oh this is gonna be when a person becomes young with a beautiful body intellect then he is going on enjoying things in this whole world he thinks that I am going to enjoy it permanently after 10 20 30 years no then that feeling comes I'm going to lose everything so that is constantly but the next generation again will come again the same mistake they will do they will think that we are going to be permanent enjoying the permanent thing again at the age of 50 60 70 they'll all know this is all so they will go for the holy people and religious houses so like that the third or fourth generation after generation goes on making this mistake why the great Maya Weaver comes to that age the jerk calm then well now we are strong we are beautiful we like to enjoy this life let us drink let us Dance let us make merry so they geek go on giving like that at that moment if one can control his mind and step out of that line and say well my grandpa my father everyone did the same thing but I have seen them they have repented they said there is no joy in this life I shall I do the same thing again why to repeat the result will be the same I am NOT going to so that stepping out people are very few but they understand religion ultimately they turn their mind away from the same subjects and where they will give give to the God and what is God joy Anand IVA kallu imani bhutani jayante the under the blissfulness to the brahmana what is the proof the God is their joy is the proof blissfulness is the proof and that joy that blissfulness never depends on anything else it comes from the reading that proves that there is something which is more interesting more joyful than anything else in this world so it says in that way we show on the hiatus chittim which is you bashar jetty but if you are meditating on the objects of this same subjects of this world your mind will go to their mom honest Murata Cheatham my neighbor probability and if you were meditating on me you will entered into me again just as a reminder with me supreme god with supreme god source of joy so anything that you can take you can make yourself become more yourself and we are modding yourself destroying yourself if you are going to the creation of god and even making yourself if you go towards the god but this is your choice so therefore oh dear would double in 28 versus the small therefore I advise you assert avi dhanam Hitler mooing some artists were monomyth Bob of Hobbiton I didn't code the whole sloka I took a little bit of it is a four-line sloka i took only two lines give up the unreal thing purify your mind with devotion to me and cons concentrate how to purify the mind again we can remember the famous word of the Jesus the blessed that those who are pure in heart what is the purification not thinking of the objects of the world first second thinking always God that is purification in the Viveka chudamani also the Shankara is telling the concentration the purification of the mind purification is necessary how by concentrating the mind on God that is called purification here also he'd find that the Sri Krishna in the Bhagavata he says assert Avedon on it wha give up that Assad Assad means that is temporary such an assert here always the in sanskrit assert means temporary anything that is temporary and his body is also temporary and associated with this body our family our society our country everything is temporary so we have to understand that some people they cut jokes Oh everything is temporary so we should not do anything no we should do it as long as I am living in this body so I must try to leave as comfortably as possible but at the same time in the core of my mind will know that this is not permanent and that is called tapasya the two things parallely we are doing and that is why in the sanatana dharma they said what is Dharma the both things advancement of the worldly comfort only things an advancement of the spirituality both things should be equally developed if you don't find food don't find shelter and in tremendous cold or heat you are suffering how can you control your mind how can you think of God that is not possible then the only way that you have to commit suicide and if you are committing suicide what is happening your this body the gross body will go away but the subtle body with the desire and fulfillment they'll go on rotating over here again go and take another body so no that is not the thing we should leave and leave comfortably and happily friendly way so that we can put our mind towards the main object that is the God the moment the Lord Krishna mentioned about meditation the intelligent would ever immediately asked him to explain it can you please explain what is this meditation you are talking about how to meditate with the was asking the three different wafer crystal or Krishna how to meditate second in what aspect and third in what form what should if the aspect aspect means some objects should be there or without object if the object is there then what for my shooting think so three this one question in three par how to meditate and what is the aspect whether with a wheat farmer without form and if it is with form what form so these are the three questions in answers Krishna explain our sana and pranayama see here also in the bhagavata we find the combination of the yoga the knowledge Gianna and work T and of course karma because the Karma is the main trait if you are not performing he was only sitting one one place Oh asana asana yes I had to do the asana so that is why always and everything the last avatar that we have found here in India that is this Pokemon Sri Krishna and he is the avatar of the combination of all the four yoga's gianna bhakti yoga and karma all the four together the krishna is explaining the asana and pranayama there are so many varieties of asana the in different posture but the only object that you can see it in one posture for a long time so there was one Swami he's still there meaning long for long live long so this Shani is from from the Muslim background so he has joined and become a monk in the monk what is the great devotion for Ganga and then hardly morning you will go and bathe and come and see it before Raghavan see ramakrishna and meditate for hours together but you know how he is to see it as because the Muslim background used to sit on his knees so folding the knees his Archana was dead but we by birth Hindu we always learn how to sit scratching so the Arsenal's are different he was comfortable on he on that posture and we were comfortable in our posture that is no problem and both are meditating on the same God practicing so asana in different if you are interested you can read thirty second at - 33 34 and 35 this five versus if you read from the fourteenth chapter different Arsenal's and Khurana llaman hearsay now the pranayama you are taking the breathing and then holding it and then slowly releasing it again taking holding release dates well pranayama and there another two differences there in the pranayama it says so a Garba pranayama when you are inhaling if you go on imagining that own Carter is entering into your body and covering right from the head to the toe whole body is covered with small small ankara bright on cara's and whole body is becoming purified this called Sagara Sagara pranayama and just taking the breathe the ear and then releasing it is also pranayama it says all Garba army's negative algarve of pranayama and so algarve a pranayama so this two type of pranayama and the asanas and he taught some impression tamsui muqam did go Charu chatter ooh Boojum he BAM Baram gonna show Mom three but sir three makea tanum - 38 and 39 verse I've taken one one line so he's the what was the question meditation then what is the aspect of meditation how we will see it how we will do he has said that then whether we take any form to meditate yes and what is that for he's a explaining meditate on me who is serene of a benign face with four long beautiful arms wearing a golden colour cloth complexion of a dark cloud with the marks known as three but sir Severson means coldly here so a birth so sometimes some people they give the cough no there's a curly here that's called three boxer and three the goddess of wealth lakshmi the three is on the heart and also the three birth Sudha Curley here and this is who is this Vishnu Shankar Dada but not Hari Krishna so when you are imagining the Lord Vishnu he is having Shankar chakra gada a padma bonamana be bullshittin and the 40th verse begin encoding only one line to finish this chapter holding in his four different divine hands four symbols conch to call to call the soul the he is wind blowing the conch he is calling the soul in the Islam they call it a John giving the call in the Christian tradition they will ring the bell in the church calling the people the faithful the devotees you come now this time and the Hindus they blow the conch to call the the Vishnu is holding the conch and then release the teeth Sudarshana this chakra the constantly moving why everything is moving in this world everything is changing now sometimes we think that he is only fighting with the Sudarshan chakra name is Sudarshana Sudarshana beautiful-looking their self chakra is a symbol of life is constantly rotating everything is changing so be careful don't waste time then Lotus is the symbol of devotion and amines that is go da-da-da-da-da our Salam o Krishna nickname is go dadada so what is that God odd means that if you are not following the righteous path you are going to get the pain punishment suffering so that is the symbol and also he is having Bona mala givethem that means the whole this prakruti that you see that is my nature the beauty in this nature now in Chicago and many places where it snows if you at this time of the snow if you come you won't get that beauty of the greeneries here it's so lavish green now everywhere but again slowly when the snow will fall the trees will leave there the leaves and slowly slowly they will be dry that is the another beauty and the green sobhana mala that is prakruti I belong to the property I belong to the nature I belong to this beauty so bonamana is the symbol of the nature so we should not hurt the animals of the birds reptiles that is developing the love for nature the dc's our vishnu shankar chakra god ah but not re-bond amala be the beautiful for hands and also the beautiful face behind the eyes Raghavan see Ramakrishna said when you are making the image of God it should be beautiful why the one should look at it because we are human being humble we are very much interested to see the beauty if the face of God is not beautiful you won't be able to meditate on that but if it is a beautiful face I don't know why but in different afterwards in different way it all changed and now I just quickly I will read out from here in the verses from 42 to 46 Shri Krishna expressed the process of meditation this is a very interesting and very important chapter the meditation on my beautiful form only first meditation on my smile faced only friends we will explain it in our next class because some of the questions are their real answer the first is meditation on me so he described all the beautiful father then meditation on my face only third the smiling face first is the whole body then only the smiling face and you are making it very small and one pointed the third step you forget that face also you see the light and in place of the light you also belong so you and that object of meditation the God are one the teachings of meditation the step by step sit properly then regulate the breathing and then concentrate the mind on God's beautiful form forget the whole body and face only you should remember then change the meditation from form to without form by seeing the divine light instead of the form and march into that divine light and forget you are meditating become one with supreme self what happens when one become perfect in meditation then the chapter begins the fifteenth chapter and he says various supernatural power come to that yogi who has controlled his Saints this is very interesting the topic so those who are interested you have to come next time the next Sunday so very interesting and one should be very very careful we are practicing meditation we are praying and we are doing worship only to realize God not his power but as a as a result it comes so we will discuss that in our next class so please give me the question the freeness the Shamir Babu Swami Chatterjee he is asking this question how to be free from this stress because of the presented situation if these challenges are always there for the human being always remember that when there is nothing the primitive the prehistoric days that time the human being they found all around the huge animals dinosaurs a terrible even that challenge also the human society who overcome and then slowly slowly one after another if you go to the pages of the history there was not a single that era where there was no challenges in the present day as because the world is so closely connected to anything happening any corner of the world immediately spreading happiness or unhappiness both we have to share so that is there now the challenge what we should do our great minds the scientists all over the world trying their best to find out the remedy the medicine till they become successful they have given us observing the problem that we should remain as maximum possible inside the room detached from away from other people this is the only and clean now we are becoming stressed because we are not having the friends and the life that we are enjoying a little change of our practices now why don't you develop your spiritual power this is the moment you can do that and if you can develop that as we are reading this bhagavatam and if possible you can contact the Swami also personally and get the guidance and then develop spiritual power if you develop meditation in this it's not that the great thing and once you control your senses whatever happens all around you're completely free from all stresses whatever may be the challenges you know it is everything is temporary today or tomorrow I'm going to die so why should I go on beating my head on the wall oh I'm going to die I'm going to die if I cry whether the date will say okay okay okay don't cry I won't take you well be very brave then think whatever will happen to me I am going to follow the restrictions that has been given by the scientists and the doctors as best possible and I'm controlling my senses my mind through meditation and becoming happy myself it is possible thank you show me Babu show Nach Babu's a very good question the Amin's taking the name of God and meditation means marching with dad God this is the difference tapa a japa means taking the name of God but if you have not taken the name of God from a particular person with a guru that may create problem you know the because some day will like Kali some day will like Krishna so the energy flatters so you have to go to the guru and then you can say the said I love this particular aspect of God will you please give me the mantra there are some mantras the technique technical way developed and believe it if we can perfectly pronounce that mantra if it is sure to come they have not come to deceive us Raghavan serum Krishna never accepted any gift then why he said I am chef telling you my children there is God and you can talk to God you can see God it is possible so that taking the name of God with devotion is called japa repetition of the gods name her meditation whatever the god or goddess or the object of meditation when he were marching into that your personality goes into that that is called meditation japa and meditation and you better as per if you have taken the mantra from a guru he must have the guru master blue directed you instructed you followed that what he can do that is finish your job fast and in meditate that will be good and slowly when you are meditating you'll find unconsciously your mind is going on taking that Holy Name on on whom you are meditating this is also possible in this way thank you for the wonderful questions and friends let us conclude with this chanting yum Brahma Varun Indra route Rama ruta stew non TDP stubby BD song pada gramo Upanishad aji guarantee yum Sam they are novice Teta
