[Bhagavatam 011 - A Guide to Liberation: Scion Of The Mighty Pandavas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvH0bouXHTY)

the subject that we'll be discussing today the father of Adam and today's the cycle of the mighty pond worse but we may take one or two classes to complete the whole chapter at least begin with this Shanta would you go share now but the MA solution Vishwa our governess attrition me her father known shuhang Lakshmi condom c'mon Ayanna you give it D on Bundy I am server locally in Hinduism the conception that God is all pervading God can never have any form but at the same time understanding the condition of different - the people who won't be able to understand that subtlety the conception and vision has come the Vishnu is also a lady which starring the Mishnah the Vishnu is all-pervading at the same time he's an informed and you just described that form and so it is possible for us to concentrate our mind on that that is the beauty of the Hinduism all the time in different ways and different fashion different manner different words trying us to lead to lead to that path whoever however it is possible you love the form it is for you you don't like it's okay and for you so this wings a pristine there's a person even if bring and beam should try to reach to God however them do basically to state the book of love but now handing the knowledge stating and that knowledge which we find in the Builder we have already studying some portion and today we will study the cycle of the Barnabas we know the Bhishma the great-grandfather is a great knowledge that he was having he gave that knowledge to the Yudhisthira and this also I will say in the language of the law may be not a point to be noted so the knowledge transmitting what is knowledge knowledge is the combination of five actions first is observation second discrimination third utilization for preservation field transmission the animals and birds they also do it they also observed also discriminate they also utilize but the last two reservation and transmission they can't do that way for him and he can do and that is the reason all the knowledge that a person has occurred it gives it to the next generation who the Purusha wouldn't evolution the next generation he is handing them over Sabri Sh'ma also and who inspired Krishnan he to leave it and go and learn from him krishna could say but now he wants that the devotee should be getting these great names the ratio is a learned person what knowledge knowledge and who is the god Krishna but there were others that who has come in the form of Krishna he is not telling anything he's rather rusting yudhisthira to go and listen from the Bhishma and Bhishma give that knowledge and he gave it discourse on Dharma artha kama and Moksa in the mahabharata we find that Dharma artha kama Moksa complete i give a retreat on this for that a Martin Domino share because our life human life is in the frame with this form and also the merits of charity is separately is telling the merits of charity why this is very very important what we are having if we can give it to others and when we are giving it without resolving anything that is also a great thing without anything preserving when we give that is called the done but the important thing is when you giving it to whom you are giving it why you are giving it that also should be considered otherwise the ganas effect will be completely different so this bischmann knew so he because judiciary had the habit of giving the things are supposed to give so that was the economic uses to get money from the subjects and again they have to give it back to them so this way the whole now also the same thing is happening so that is the method of judging duties of Kings and various others matters this is important why because if the king is not just if he makes any mistakes then the whole the population is suffered is a one man decision but the suffering for the whole so there's a king should be perfect and nowadays the ministers who are choosing the people the people are choosing them so this should also understand this but this is the knowledge otherwise who is suffering people so you have to understand this and that's why the Bhishma sees that and other matters to King Yudhisthira stayed with great earnestness I do dedicate on to the feet of the Lord which when stealing now after finishing his job why he say because Bushman do and who is Krishna is Easter Davida but Krishna in that form was not registered a with our a Bhishma it was Vishnu but through his spiritual practices which you could see the Vishnu Vishnu very much present in the form of Krishna so he great that peaceful should come before my dead Krishna game and if you did when I'm living my body my Easterday mother should be with me standing and Krishna was standing over there now you see what he is doing the great Bhishma this is to learn from the scripture I do dedicate on to the feet of the Lord even merciful the prime being Shri Krishna he knows exactly me but this is in the form of Shri Krishna I dedicate myself then what he did suta who was expounding the hosts whole story described the great moment in the life of vishwas a Bhishma concentrated his mind speech and sight upon sleep Krishna his mind his speech and sight upon Shri Krishna he concentrated that is the last moment if we can't do that that is the great practice whole life we are practicing but for what because this moment will come the wind the clutches of death comes and we forget everything is so painful and the cloth of the date is so powerful we cannot go beyond that and this moment which my concentrating is mine and speech he is not telling anything the mind is not thinking anything except depression except the god [Music] so we must learn this point there are so many stories and they're long stories of the bhagavata but now you see the last moment of the Bhishma what he is doing but what has been told again in the giving bhagavad-gita and also by Sri Ramakrishna you must get ready for this particular deal concentrating the mind that means he is not thinking anything except each to the evidence introduced each that means he's not telling anything except the name of the Easter day with God and he is not seeing anything except that Great Lord so the sight upon Krishna that this should be the training and at the last moment training on seeing the great-grandfather merging into the Brahman indescribable Brahman he was looking at the Krishna but the Sutra and the Rishi's and the holy people who were all around they don't see that he is merging with the Krishna they saw his merging with the Brahman the all present became silent that is the way we always respect the dead not be crying not by shouting but by silence why because immediately our mind is also be drawn and we are happy that it should go and March there is a there are a group of people after the dead they'll be singing and dancing and beating the drums why well sometimes is really very but a peculiar to see that the person is is dead and why these people are dancing the philosophy is now he is free from this gauge of the body and now he has gone back to the source in the bhagavad-gita fourth chapter nine verse we know that Krishna himself is telling general karma germanium you even you did tell me the Krishna I am NOT the as you see me this is the mystery of the avatar when you see the Avatar he is also eating sleeping chatting just normal like the human but at the same time something very very special in his life and that proves that he doesn't belong to us though he is so close to us as if janma karma my birth and my board d lybien this is divine the purpose the whole purpose is divine you even you the doctor the one who has understood these correctly what happens tactic - ah the impunity gentleman after the death he never comes back it gives the monkey that or the Yamuna janma naiti mam eti soldier nam and he comes to me and the me means the God marches with the God and that is the ultimate of the giba thus Jeeva is travelling and that the soul ultimately marches into the source that is what sponsor Ramakrishna said he said that he sure loved minutiae Cheverny food dish the God realization is the goal of every human being and how Islamic is to say it is very easy if you can understand the divine purpose of an avatar if you see an avatar you see the car not Jesus also say those who have seen the silencing the father so these avatars they have the image of God all this is over with the death of the Bhishma in this period and began a new era before leaving front work of Shri Krishna perform two works one protecting the Parikh shield in his mother's womb saved from extinction of the clan of the Guru's because he promised I will save you protect you so that is the Krishna he did and that is his divine power and seeking establishing Yudhisthira as the king to rule the kingdom widely second is so important because Yudhisthira was not at all interested to take the responsibility of the team miss constantly he was thinking the life is all this much so I had to leave and I had to practice meditation I have to practice spirituality sector now this man was the best person to become a king why not attached the those who are constantly eager to grab the power we have to be careful about them because to keep the power they can do anything but those who are just for the sake of the people the good of the people they are taking the power they will be the game great Kings Yudhisthira he was not at all interested but the Krishna told no so we find there in the book the one and the chapter 10 and verse 2 function guru function Novotny little tom son grew into a bubble Pavan re he knew very shy the nearer Archer is shallow you teach didn't read the mana Babu Baja and he's really happy now Krishna why pre the mother he is very happy I have performed my duty and his duty was to establish the Yudhisthira and that is also very important otherwise the whole human society will breakdown if the administration is not proper it constantly the problems are going on all the model values will break down so that is the reason and because his mission was fulfilled he is now going back to Dwarka you digitally was just king during his rule his subjects were free from the worries and diseases and also they were free from the troubles caused by supernatural causes they always say the India the others thing if the leader is good because of his good behavior and also the good character everything will be good the deaths that is the reason they are all as it happens I was in a flight in India it was an intern model and everybody was a free rinse some untoward from which is here with us where you are afraid and now I'm not so great but anyway but together we can pray but the people they were always thing and that is the wonderful thing we need were some holy people at there because people are there not that all the times and using in the household also so many good people are there so the earth presence comes to the result of that goodness percolates to all people and that is why when we were choosing the leader we have to choose a good one whose character is good at the good manner good behavior and good character person will be excellent leader maybe they're he's cannot speak properly or these and that doesn't matter decisions will be perfect whatever decisions he will take that will be perfect and this is the training we gave and to the great joy of the King Yudhisthira and his brothers at an auspicious moment when all the planets stood in the favorable position who'd rather the widow queen of the Arjuna son of him anew give birth of a baby boy the learned brahmanas who were present said O king since fish tuna prohibition on binocular taya a shallow haataja the most powerful Vishnu in contemplation to you give this boy as a gift rata means gift Prabha Vishnu means the great powerful who the Vishnu the smart Vishnu righto et nom nom locally shitty let the boy been named as Vishnu rata that means the gifted Vishnu you can also remember this to give the name of the baby Vishnu daughter sometimes some people that require it way they request somebody can you give a good name of the child and if I give this name they won't take it which is rather now it is too complicated so this fish soon after is a wonderful meaning there's a gift of the Lord Vishnu and why in the rishis is so happy it says the auspicious moment what is the auspicious moment all the planets stood in favorable position you know that horoscope some of the people so perfectly they can say so perfectly they can calculate but you have to give the exact time of your birth and the date and the position of your birth even in Chicago there are so many positions the I was born in Chicago on health he took it the specific position and the date and the time they can calculate just stood some people at the end that something happened in my life when were I was a very young boy I was in the standard of I think one or two and that a very small King I came back from the school and I was just crossing that small coat here of our house the one gentleman who was sitting over there with the other see me I was just running after all the children they do it was running with the pack full of books and all and I was hungry and after that I have to go who have played all those things that man saw me that running and say this guy is not going to be married and the whole family start to go what will happen to you then I came to know that they are discussing about that this man is boy is not going to I don't having to do something so it started crying why everybody is going to Miriam why should I not that is my mom better looking okay that will take care you do not to it is after another 25 years a long time so we will manage but look at it really it happen in my life just actually he commented something is there we can just deny J or no it is all false so most of the people they do not know the drama calculate and sometimes they'll be telling something which is not correct that is the way and that is the reason we lose is our respect for this particular science but in those days the Rishi's were very very capable and he is telling like this that afterwards he the Lord protecting the child from the file of the Asha Tamas weapon and link comes Misurata is well known as brick schita we don't know that much about the Vishnu daughter but we all know brick sheet anyone associated with the Indian Scripture they know per egg sheet the tympanic shield why why this name Rishi while in the womb in his of his mother 13 months and Scott as he were stand by the friday braum master of the chateau ma that infant behold a being of the dimension of a thumb the infant could not forget that be the infant he was not born yet in the room observed that a divine beings also many smokers our dear aunties and describing the trace and arm are and all those things and it was there protecting the baby and baby was observing in the womb after the birth he would go on searching for that person examining each and everyone saw initial ok baccata / if she'd ET he was doing the padishah he was constantly observing is this a man is this the man I saw insist that and he was not satisfied when he was going on examining each and every one when he was a small baby and then a young boy the people to ruie every time is examining pariksha so his name became but exceeded so this is the pollak shield while pariksit was growing up many different things started happening first Petera came back we know the medulla the great soul and though is born he was born in a sutra is a down in our and the cost is there in that that the mother was not high caste but still he was a very respected person this vigilant and here's a very close relative of the Pandavas he came back after a long undisclosed pilgrimage now witness the great war was over the many people who are doing anything bitter are secretly left everyone and he started going to the bull images now when's that estava happen the people they always tried to get the soldiers now the whole story started with some of the hundreds of the Rishi's they came into a forest and they were practicing austerity then the heart a person is singing beautifully describing some Stoney they went over there and told who are you and the wonderful stories that you were singing can you please tell us so the whole bhagavata started this is a suitor in here also we find this particular person Vidura without telling anyone he left and he was dream on searching for the peace why this happened why this happened so he was going on then ultimately he made my player a very learning Rishi he started staying with him afterwards it disclosed and he started staying over there Yudhisthira and others they were thinking that he is no more the so many people died maybe he has also been fasting that way or killed somewhere but we did he weigh he got training and not only that he was already dream so when he went inside with the Maitreya dear he realized the brandman Arabic Gianna after the realization after having that Rutledge Gianna Danny field I cannot leave my body because my the purpose of my life is over but what will happen to my family and people so he came back and how he is helping we live here the Petera that pious man he came back and the first stunned at the book 13 chapter and 15 verse very clearly mentioned that we do the was in reality Yama the king of depth so this is also very interesting to learn this was the module though he was born a low caste family of course it was the son of a great person but why it happened because of a curse the view of Yama he took that birth he was born as a human for hundred years due to the curse of the sage Monica Pier so one of them at that the stories is very difficult to control because so many stories the goes on this way and that way and very interesting stories I'm naturally the curiosities they take us to at all these different stories those who are interested you can learn this the even the children's book at there from there also in general the like the Yama and the window this is beautiful beautiful books in the air the LaMarche apart me Yama he was shot he was cursed the Monteverde sheep the random Parisi he gave that cars but she Chatham Harbor should drift on the bar what is this shoot again and again this wizard is not the task is a culture the deer are considered as a low cultured people the way we are going and meeting some people how you are talking your voice and the picture requires your movement your dress everything deeds whether you are from the shooter or from the higher caste so that is the culture one should understand when Shami me begun the team over here his salad was totally different the most of the Americans they were wondering but this man works like a king because of his family and also the self-confidence hitch to work in such a way people used to wander in France when he was entering into a water the gentleman standing at the door and the gate he saluted him and said O king from which Kingdom you are living under Stockton sir I have not the king rather I have a bigger and a sannyasi don't say that sir I know I have seen so many kings the Indian Kings used to come to the Europe so I have seen so many kings I know that you are he is mind an interval because of the way is to be he and here the Monde appear he is living the shopper the curse to the Vidura that you should be considered as a shoot through tsunamis uncultured but because he was also the god Amun his behavior was excellent everyone accepted him but why this curse the story goes in this way the Yama is supposed to be a giving the punishment then what it happened in this way that a few people they were taking some goals and they came and stopped in the the Monty Puri she the in the cottage of the mandala regime and apology was no development he was practicing hostility in the night and these people were there the Kings people came they arrested the two took away the mandatory she also but the King didn't think in that way the whether they are good people are not didn't he didn't judge what happened these are the things whatever the report he got immediately say put them on the shoulder another very sharp and thing the people is to be forcefully sitting on that and they slowly slowly died very painful depth this mandatory she was also got the same punishment without a new heart so he was sitting up at the but with the other people they target wonderful was perfect not only that he was going on chanting the name of God and giving the discourses and me the hearing that many Rishi's they came over there and every 90s to sit over there to listen the discus from the Wonder Wheel this is really mysterious he could control and he could seat over there in that way and he can talk to the people then the news which to the king and he came came and told this is my fault Arushi I never knew that you are also in that group I am so sorry then the manticore didn't say anything but he went to the Yama he told why you give me so much of punishment you know that right into anything you want to know it was written that we were six or eight years old boy you've tortured the one insect so that is the reason then you see eight year six is eight years boy and I was not having any idea by just as a bad mistake I did and for that this much punishment you are not fit to be a Yama laying the Man Repeller gave the curse no yo-yo ma you are not filled so this is this was the power of the Rishi's the tremendous power that these two constantly keep the balance he was lower the Yemen he was not taking the power but he had the power to control these people the human told I'm sorry and monitored were told then afterwards if the boy is not attending the 16 years whatever the wrong he does should not be taken so seriously even then in our modern society they always say like that sometimes those who have not reached the 18 if they commit some mistake their punishment is very less the same under pure truth is coming down this is the story but none indeed can overcome the sway of time the death is inevitable so color that this was one day the bhatoora he went and made the UT still a truth the rostra the trustor he was living very comfortably with the help or the support whether you distill and this old man he was the cause of everything after losing everything still he was thinking that I should survive he was the born 9 he made so many mistakes and so many people were killed just because of him the one man take a wrong decision and millions to suffer do you think they should not get the punishment the will to deter after he suffered in that way and afterwards he went and saved the trust because it was his brother who bad times our evade leave home and positions the time spirit yama is fast approaching now we should know Vidura was the Yemen the badula he has realized the self the death scene power has come back to him the I think the cars was over now Buda understood that these people where many brothers I should go and help them so how by telling them the truth so a shrug on Karla salvation Samara gotta know na means us so there's the Bhagwan Dada if he is coming because the young he is coming and the tale he is approaching the trading there's sometimes some people the same the fast the gray here comes over here near to the ear not of the healed directly and that as if responding to her ear time is up time is up get ready so that is very very important so we must know when we should do what but we go on clinching to the light we go on changing our thing this thing and that thing and go on thinking I am going to leave - Neil so that is wrong so a Chicago bond cavada the Raghavan column is the yama salvation into each and every one now somehow guitarra he is coming for each and every one we do have understood that that the roster was very much attached to the worldly pleasure and to cut his born bitterest slash team builder with strong words he reminded him his misdeeds and how shamelessly he was surviving he told him look at yourself your father brothers son frames all have been killed and you have also become very old Petrie parties rebooted Petoskey because my are our homage Jerry are conduc Naja means you also Jiraiya mr. Perotti he was a saying and you are now living in somebody's house and who is there somebody you know who is to come to give the food Bhima and even neighbor like him yudhisthira he was a very kind-hearted person used to come and is to talk to that old man they must come and throw the food to him with that like that that was the insert everyday he managed to do to him and when we do the lamented oho - agent old GE Dasha the Raghavan who wonder of wonders how strong people strange into life the people don't like to they're constantly cringing but they will learn they will die if we understand that true many things can be solved attachment will go I have done my job whatever came before me I perform perfectly now I am withdrawing my mind but you don't practice how to withdraw the mind so example we only practice right from our bird how to go and grab how to enjoy the worldly things now at the age of 70 80 when the body is not giving that strength when the mind is also not that much alert but in the subconscious mind the desire to enjoy still survive because we do not know anything that is the reason one should practice spirituality Winnie's young or she's very wrongly people say why you are going to the estranja you are not yet fifty but after fifty when you can go I don't know who can help so this happened because the physically and mentally wanted to be strong to understand these this is very subtle and so strong to cut the bondage so the brother has come to help the brother it is B Judah he's reminding the Yudhisthira his sinfulness you should not live in this way this is disrespectful for you when the Sri Ramakrishna passed away he told master Adama TV maybe some other people My devotees will take into their house and ask you to stay don't go you should leave into my room your husband's room and you have the F breathe I think over there is yours do not stretch your hand to receive anything that was that rise do not stretch your hand to receive anything from anyone rather impossible put the hand like this to key so he was showing you should not put the hand in this way rather you put the hand in this way so that he can give some respect if a human being loses the same respect with just animal so that is exact inward very strong words Battuta he said and he said that you were you and your son's persecuted the Pandavas in so many ways setting fire to the house poisoning them humiliating their wife wrongfully / Devi their Kingdom and and now you are living with their support asou be killed why to live like this asou be killed why live like this then the regular scene yes sir God but a to be Java Nevada at Mabon critical to occur in Jihad proper cheats America tomorrow he is in the 13 chapter 27 verse he says he is the wisdom of the men who having installed read the guard in his heart leave all bondages and endured the life of renunciation and self-control the renunciation and self-control what I am renouncing my ego and ego is the attachment and what I am doing practicing self-control so these are other two practices from the very beginning one should do I have seen the parents not knowingly but as a and the custom and in a civilization like that they will never allow the children to I have the bucket full of candies the children they find is very interesting they like to grab the letter T but the immediate disappearance will say no one on the you can t and I said before that you should take the permission of the Swamiji and if you take all then what others will take so we learn as a human being and what is that we are learning self-control this self-control we learn from the beginning not that way that this is self-control then the fortress is you cannot just go like this and there because you have to control yourself and suppose somebody is behaving very peculiarly you should not react because you have to have the self-control the self-control we are all the time we are having practicing the one who is versed in it we call him very good person a cultured man subcontrol person but at the same thing you have the renunciation renunciation of world renunciation of ego if I keep my ego it's someone coming to us and said this is very difficult you know if you are doing like this it will be really harmful to many people I reduced only long back into reader digest there's a president of America and he the fight was going on then this in on some desk someone he saw that the president has given some suggestion transitions and he commented over there on the file itself this man has not in capacity to even to run the grocery shop was the president the others sorrow now if we fired he would get the punishment but now when the president saw that immediately called in and said can you please tell me what what else we can do and he said if we do it this way to be the the benefit of our citizens for the benefit of the taxpayers we can do like this we can do like this he accepted all the solutions it will by not because his suggestions is going to be very good at the society and the society will give me all credit but only in between he family egoistic whatever I have thought that is the last and not going to accept in views so that what happened so we have to understand that also per diem give heart that we are giving the mind that you go where it'll go III are you ready to go we cannot simply say whoever it is not it will be there from the birth it is there - how - so we say I am the servant of God I am the son of God I am the devotee of God so I give that read that God within my soul in my heart and I give up the evening and also practice self-control realizing the folly of the mundane life now that the rostra entered into the jungle this bhatoora acted as a guru what the Guru does this only he goes and tell these are the things which you should not continue because this is the heart for Deva being slowly snow deworming if you read the stories of Ramakrishna the parables of Saddam Edition are very funny but very interesting stories are there but that way slowly one should withdraw the mind and inspired with the words and understanding the folly of life there datura strain turned into the jungle and he was followed by whom who followed the Rudra who can say Gandhi Gandhi was a wonderful character and she was married to the did roster but when she was married a young lady she was coming from Gandhara Gandhara that now is the middle is not the same from there because the India was our dad so he she came from the Gondar the kingdom Gonzales daughter and she was thinking I am going to a very many a very powerful king and the king of the Singapore the Delhi she came with great oh and her brother also came along with her Shakuni but after coming she understood there her husband is a blind person and at the same time he is not the real king he is just ruling on behalf of his brother but even then she said okay this is my fate God has given me this I will also and I should not have the eye and from then onwards all through her life she closed her eyes she never opened it only once or twice for some special reason and practiced followed the disaster just like a shadow Dom me in every step she was there and followed by heart Queen and spend the rest of his life in prayer and meditation hearing this the news of the passing of a Judas today became very part of friends will conclude after this this is a very interesting way Narada another great sage he will tell and here we learn a very good teaching Narada gave him a wonderful reputation he was telling who sent him there so he was angry with the Pedulla exeter exeter he was emotional the novel came and told secretion without our let's the animals at the foot of the creatures with us the human fearless fearless being that with the visitation at the foot of the four footed creatures the animals the smallest creatures are the food of the creatures with arms the field lesbians meditation at the foot of the four hooded creatures smaller preachers or smaller preaches of the food of the bigger one Nature has made ample arrangement for food for all you need not to be anxious about you relatives so it is obvious that is exactly what was going to tell not in the gaming this way a Hassani Sabbah star nom Abaddon shahtoosh padam Fellini tatra madam Jeeva Jeeva Jeeva Jeeva Jeeva Jeeva and it goes on constantly in this way that is the system that the Lord has given God has given that means death is inevitable so naturally we think oh what will happen to us if death is inevitable etc etc and why we suffer some people they'll be emotional they will say why we should eat these kill these these and network sometimes they didn't talk like that now he's giving an answer to that then are the explicit truth that edom Raghavan Rajan eat Varma atmanam SWA drink under under under party but Shaitan Maya Rudolph so unintel the party partially down maja Garuda now we're all this now so painful the the the people are eating the animals and animals are eating the grasses and the bigger one killing the smaller bar it goes on what a picture terrible but actually who have all those this is the truth here it says all of this universe is the Lord's alone where we find all these it's only not alone and nothing else he is the soul of all souls the self riveting spirit needs no other revealer his soil regard his what shines as a redeem and without and he has become as meaning by his mysterious power Maya Tom Maya Goethe he has become meaning with the power of the Maya exactly the Vedanta we are studying a book of devotion father Adam but we find the teaching of the Narada is nothing but the highest Vedanta what actually we see so many ways so the varieties leaves and formed and nothing but expressions of the same consciousness saying Brahman so here we came today and the bhagavata through the stories and these are all not only stories fractures it is also the history the Ramayana Mahabharata have ever done these are all the histories of India the Indian people the key in the history which I am NOT that follows the subjects and the chapters giving all details of the kings and their their ancestors and the predecessors midlist and also the geography from the king is going from here to there where was this kingdom that work when was that Kingdom so geography the history the sociology the economy and also the spirituality and religion all combined together Ramayana Mahabharata and bhagavata too sometimes people they confused and thinking these are all spiritual group of course in the spiritual group but this is also the history and here we find that all Hindus they always sing whatever we see is nothing but the Brahmin and that's why we cannot eat anyone we cannot eat anyone being a Hindu with the others are doing because their knowledge is not counted up to this level but after these if we go on repeat the same mistake following the steps of there other people who are making the mistake then wire will go our greatest call Vasudha Eva could have become that is the Judaism the whole universe is your own your gudumba you relatives from here we understand these that God has become everything so we should also try to understand and try to live our life accordingly so this is the excellent philosophy that is coming the human society and slowly slowly human being should understand this and there will be no differences with the differences thank you very much let us join this mantra and we conclude young brahma ha who need - nandi deeply stop i'ii be the song but the grump initially guy Andy young saga they are now versatile nicotine ominous our version DeYoung me you know yes yawn Dona be do Sudarsan the buyer this mean in the beginning the first Walker we were thinking in fall of that supreme knowledge and the second verse we conclude that he is everywhere without any form and the whole gamut is Hinduism sanatana-dharma
