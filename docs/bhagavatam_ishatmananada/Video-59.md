[Bhagavatam 043 : Topic: How to Overcome Maya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sVmOv5_OPY)

[Music] me [Music] you PVD on a commune Monday [Music] last week we have discussed about the minor the power that D losses and compel US forces to accept it in which it is not so that is that Maya we in details we discussed last time 30 now we have to think how to overcome this mile how to cut the bond of this mile so this under the spilled of this Maya we are bound and to know the way out the Great King nimi is asking this question yet have a dumb wish in my on too strong a guitar maybe 13 Audion student he Maharshi be done with Japan it says in the beginning that last time we discussed the same those who are very intelligent they understand it and they can go beyond the Maya it'll-it'll mean spiritually intelligent so they understand what this Maya now Mimi is asking okay about the intelligence okay but those the ordinary people who are never do because they don't have the capacity to judge in that way so he is asking that we share Maya o great sage Marcia who great sage kindly tell me with chat on how even an ordinary person stood here the booty that he stolen please think so they won't be able to understand many other things so how they can quickly overcome parity quickly overcome this power of the Supreme Lord is Shari my arm is Shari my arm the power of the Supreme Lord how they can overcome now this is a great question and the answer that he is given is very very excellent so here we find this question was answered by pregunta the 4th brother of the now a yogi now the Prophet is telling to get freedom from Maya spell one should under the guidance of a proper guru spiritual teacher practice some spiritual disciplines these instructions have been enlisted in 23rd through 28 verses of the 3rd chapter 11 book dadada he begins Sanford o manasa a Sangam Ardo shangkun gisado shoes they are my dream prescient Archer who teased you at the torch eaten very simple Sanskriti is mentioning in the beginning are do he should learn to give up the attachment to the objects attachment to the objects Alberto Manasa or Sunderland a Sangha means attachment not at the attached with that our Sangha Sangha means the company our Sangha just opposite or Sangha what the senses and the same subjects so this is the first teaching of the parable here I will take you to the BBA to Romani which is the book of the parenting the pretty proud of the Vedanta not has been proud of eventually what the villager when he speaks about it chantara chharia he also says Mukesh Aakansha you deeply table are c TR g RT too loud fish on fish on media table is there any difference the bhagavata book of devotion be with Germany the book of knowledge district the same thing if you want to get liberation the very first thing that you should do you must detach yourself from these things objects this is the first thing to want them telling those who want to get rid of the bondage of Maya and that spirituality is a completely different thing religion that gives us a beautiful life moral life so the religion is good for the society a model with the values that they'll be part at the same time if you want to realize that Brahman the supreme the God and to get out of this content apart under for them this asana you have to be completely detached the Ambu Shiva tosia daya Shama r.java Prashanthi etc all these qualities and culture history they are forgiveness the compassion the kindness Shama forgiveness art even truthfulness straightforwardness Prashanti peacefulness all these qualities and we will tell you and I will request your patience because this being least he is going on given and what is that very month what is that the way to go beyond the Maya so it begins with this if you want to go beyond the Maya you have to give up the attachment to the objects of the senses and develop love for holy company you have to develop the love only company a game you have to understand what is the holy company if you go to our country and there are many holy people will be there and if you go the first thing they will offer you the ganja and to smoke and then nicely you sit over there then you forget the whole world and why do you have experience to purgatory er the supreme joy to go on smoking abruptly so that it will be the body company then ultimately you'll be Ruby so one must be very clear that understanding should be there what is holiness training's what I have understood holiness is only two qualities love and unselfishness and nothing else love and unselfishness these are the two qualities which make you completely holy pure here it says holy company so we have to find out those people those who love others and also to some extent they are helping others you cannot get 100% pure there are about others but those who are at least in this measurement they are good we should have the company of those people and cultivate now that is begins kindness friendliness the most of the time the moment we think that we are going to become the holy and disassociate with all people and slowly I become alone lonely and in that loneliness I cannot understand the my own thoughts are taking me to completely wrong directions because I am not having any conversation with anyone so I do not like to talk to those people I don't like to mix with those people I had to be all alone and we think I was a great soul he can't live all alone no he's a man so that is the reason one should understand friendliness I can exchange my views I can understand your standpoint so that is called the friendliness some people may be exactly opposite but still I can understand them accept them and that develops the mind so kindness they are friendliness humility this is also a very good quality to develop spirituality if all the time the ego is activated I am I'm I'm I know will never learn so this humility and purity of body and mind how do the body and mind the body can be purified by building and mine can be purified by taking the name of God so purification of the mind means going on repeating the name of God the God's name with the we understand amount but the card name that slowly slowly purify our mind so that's why the Guru says only in the morning and in the evening just take the name and then do whatever your dream so that purifies the mine and what is the purification again that he will generate love it will generate understand iljin your mind will be brought in so this is the purity of the mind perform your duties deserve Parvati is telling you must perform duties properly I do not know from all this 15 in our society you need not do anything go and sit in a temple and go on singing the name of love now you have to perform your duties some people who have left the heart and home they have accepted the sannyasa or they have become the branding that is their profession to do the yeah and with that there are D all other people should do their own duties are money otherwise society will crumble down all are going and sitting in the temple and Prashad building and we give the Prashad over here Prashad means more food and to cook the food you need ingredients and somebody is supplying the ingredients somebody is spending money for you and you were thinking oh the Lord's pressure don't freaking now it is now you must have to work that's why here it says perform duties whatever the duties that you have accepted you must and patience right here drei vier the idea you have to have a lot of patience otherwise it's very difficult to realize God then it says avoid big dogs the sometimes we go on talking we just know nothing it will know well we are reaching unnecessarily we are going on chatting talking and then you speak so much of time then afterwards physically mentally we are exhausted we won't be able to concentrate our mind so being Turks know there must be something some idea which we will discuss otherwise not and then it says study scriptures studying spirituals and sometimes some of the books we read is okay but spiritual reading is very very essential you know why the Bhagavad Gita that we chant in the morning or we read bhagavad-gita that was really patient that was read by sri ramakrishna shall we be because this to carry that book so naturally all these thoughts and ideas that is there in every world whether you understand it or not the moment you were watering reading hearing you are getting the effect of that so this call of you must study scripture and spiritually were slowly noting very certain thoughts most of the people they know about religion you go to any temple there will be hundreds and thousands of people and particularly Saturday Sun news if the oceans are available and before eating the dosha they will do little exercise they will go upstair working and then dropping down then and you ask them about the religion they know everything but we unfortunate they don't know and what it's a religion spirituality and if you ask people to sit and study scripture they don't have patience some other books even the simple gospel of the Ramakrishna so many stories in every page their story even then people say oh it goes out or it can understand look at it that is the mind is in turmoil they can't concentrate they can get the idea so this is very serious condition of the mind so study scripture we must have to and we straight forward whatever you like to say you must say this straightforward observe countenance practice harmlessness the sometimes to a physical gesture sometimes through our words we harm people sometimes people are afraid particularly the children when they come you notice that they are pretty much afraid why because they cannot identify whether this person will be my friend or not so obviously the people who are coming to you they do not know you have to be friendly you have to understand his position and can you have to talk to them so practice powerlessness but the people that come to you they should feel I can talk to him there's no problem no harm in it so that is sometimes we develop a personality no one can approach me now that is not good for the spiritual life spiritual life is always but is loving that I have seen our senior Swami's the presidents and you can imagine the so many moms and grandmas earnings and the devotees and the precision means he is above almost 80 so naturally physically also the problem for still dares to talk to us all the time and we're talking smiling and sometimes cutting jokes and making fun with the Brahma cherries and all that as a promoter is very heavy rich tall and heavy used to come like this this President March the we were all there sitting then precision emergency ghatotkach here tell if the music cotton cards if you'd like to fail falen that side not decide the Phantom Cobra beside they need us which side is the Corrib side no not like that this all is - laughing all jokes one used to have why because we could straight remove our personality and open our mind that should be that it you the that is the otherwise the harmlessness that should come out of from your personality but that man this person is very intelligent but Rico operatively friendly and then steady mind enjoy and soul sometimes the waves are coming that is the life sometime happiness sometimes solo but we should have to have a steady mind and feeling the presence of God all the time feeling the presence of God all the time you know my office is here and my room is the residences there so that's a good thing previous left to think how the so far but now I enjoy whenever I go through this way I always from DeLand Kia from the top coolest looking at me so I go without making any sound without disturbing him and then others the takutai I'm going to that side and then again I'm sorry I try I'm disturbing you maybe sometimes I feel they're liking that I am going over here like this I feel the presence of God all the time wherever you go wherever you are constantly feel the presence of God and sometimes live in solitude alone without anything sometimes one should live in solitude faith in the scriptures the spiritual safe that you can realize God we must have the field when it says that means I can do that and no criticism to others pictures this is very very important and I am quoting from the bhagavata and it says no criticism to other scriptures the eleventh skander third chapter twenty third verse is gives this the twenty third twenty four twenty it goes like that you should not criticize others pictures see the training that is in tourism and sometimes we hold that scripture don't touch don't why you have kept this book while that is wrong you will not a Hindu if you're talking like that because our scriptures our God the honesty you have faith in your own scripture but should not others because that is also manifested because of God's will but some people in that way you need not to bother about that control of mind and speech this is also very very essential control of mind and speech practice silence then one gentleman was stating in his before this lecture please go to all your mobile in your husband more with his husband's our outlets provide the poor people can't speak so he has developed at her husband mode instead of silence so so like the head we have to before sometimes we have to be very silent and this silence means not the time not talking about going on thinking oh why he has come here why is doing like this anger talking but going on looking here and there and thinking that is not silence silence is meditation the one group of people they came and they're subject to a stopping or silenced meditation but they wanted six microphones at you with silent meditation six microphone and then with talking meditation what you learn so this silence means is not like I'm thinking we don't thinking different things and at the same time I'm not talking no it is not silent meeting thing means you have to do we tell your mind from the Bob ships and constantly thinking of God it's almost a meditation there's God silence desireless the slogan is not enough to give up the desire the desirous and truthful that is the main two sticks of the spiritual person he will never tell lies and here Todd and we detailed on Lord constantly go on hearing talking about God and meditate on God and also dedicate all actions to be whatever we do it the Radovich gita it is yet to Russia yet us now see Juho see the tarsier yet tapas SE County Turkish scimitar burnham in the bhagavad-gita the same teaching again encoding the data means a parenting book why I say because people have the conception the bhagavata is emotional book and deeper and others deserve a parenting book see what is the teaching teaching these days and it seems like this way that you must dedicate all action to him why didn't be no ego who decide after the whole of this world when everything is finished then you just mentally returned to God whatever possible I have done and I dedicate to you just in the fish is not me is the great disciple of ramakrishna chamois brahmananda he is stating that when you reach dogfish see the picture of the God and pray God I am here to work for you in between sometimes we are the key in the picture and when you complete the whole fish world then you say whatever I have done they offered to you just practice and it says that will give you the spiritual innovation charity and Jabbar charity why in every religion charity is there because whatever we are to give dad it means a broaden of the mind unless and until you are having a broad mind you cannot give your own money so this charity always observes then sometimes the parents will teach the children then we need to candies and say go and give that one candy to that boy a matter of his own age so by that way they learn to give to share I am having - now I will give one to someone so that also develops this habit of charity then the Jaffa constantly going on taking the name of God good conduct good behavior this is very very important and we have a dear nearby even the neighbors would say oh you are so good people that is the development of spirituality and in the offices all your colleagues will say we'll missing when you're leaving that is used development the good conduct whether we can understand people we can talk to them in that way so that is also helping us to go beyond the bondage of Maya we are giving the wrong list as a helping us to go beyond the bondage of Maya and it says friendship with holy men holy men taking pressure with holy men it's not that iris it - it's okay but there should be a friendly approach so I can talk to them it will bring some problem so that is the friendship with the holy man this is also necessary and love to talk with God's devotees when the people they come they talk about the God and once you feel joy to talk to them the one of our shaman he visited mother's and he was in ICU the doctors told him not to talk and actually are these shape-ups they were also asking devotees are the Swami's not to go near to him in the noon time I went I used that time in on the one I wish to go there late I wait some are sleeping and from the class I was trying to look at him he noticed me immediately he called me like this I noticed that no one around I opened the door a editor and he took a from where you are coming how is Anna man what of the work at all she did toward you should not talk did you not know when I talk I feel joy so they are thinking if I am NOT talking that I am getting the rest no talking with the devotees the holy people taking dinner sometimes some of our strongest video they are bedridden even they live in us whatever work you were doing in Chicago what how many devotees are coming over there what type of devotees having all the Linkwood why this is the course work is going on the he will never come to Chicago but still he is showing interest in the work of the Chicago because this is not an ordinary thing that we are doing we are constantly trying to change the mind of people and we are trying to change our own mind elevating our own mind purifying our own mind at the same time helping others to do the same so that's why the holiest thing that love God with the God's devotee developing teens joy this is also wonderful teaching intense joy all the time you are having you look at the children there are always happening whatever happens I was noticing it actually that published in the newspaper somewhere in the Middle East the after the bombardment all the thirty people they're crying they're doing this and they're but two three young boys they're playing over there they got opportunity the compartment is over now the got the bus they're playing because there is no tension in the mind the God will take care they think my father will take care so that is the thing God will take care why should I be all the time thinking in what is going to happen these and that that is developed in teens joy satisfaction and finally again it began with detachment and it concludes with detachment it says the develop the Indians joy satisfaction and detachment this detachment is very very essential why even I tried to Clare I won't be that this is the nature if I grab something and I'd like to go along with there it is not if you perhaps many of you have seen in China and also in Cairo I saw in China with the king will die he will take Allah with him his queen whom he used to love most now when the King was alive the other Queens is to think oh he is loving that Queen so much but after the death they are safe and immediately The ministers will come and say now lady get ready because he used to love you and in heaven also he needs your company alive to boot that lady with the tea not only there all the southern stood also should die to accompany the king there's a wrong conception but he came if you go so many people they are dead because of one man so this is the same now detachment I was a king is okay but when it is all over was over that detachment is religion the detachment is spirituality and it concludes that promote the who was giving the answer practice of all these qualities are known as bhagavata-dharma abhyasa bhagavata-dharma obvious you have to practice all these qualities this qualities can break the bond of Maya so the question was how to break the bond of Maya and a very ordinary person who cannot discriminate so all these things is a mile so I should not like that so slowly slowly all these practices helping that particular mind to develop in a height of a Brahman County now that now yogi brothers sometimes they mention about the supreme Brahman Paramatma and also used the word Narayana so naturally the King nimi wanted to get it clarified nur Aldin is a personal God and other is absolute how you are mentioning the two names at a time so they are asking like this he also requested to clarify the process of the Karma will come to dare not on a big domicile brahmana or a Marvin are missed on our earth no book tune ooh yummy drum movie due tomorrow Brahma beat hood Tama the gradation the sometimes some people say the moment one has realized God so how I said no drama B drama B Parrish deberían Brahma be very stir Brahma be good Tama our traditions are there that they have realized that Brahma they realized the God but at the same time they have differences of realization understanding it says from abhidhamma he is asking that you are the greatest you are a Brahmin please tell me otherwise you won't be able to tell please tell me the difference what are the difference in the Brahman which is infinite for a madman which is the supreme supreme spirit and Narayana the divine person what is the difference why is asking this question because sometimes we think that Brahman is completely different than God now the best way to a tournament reports say and Nagas ramakrishna really got it clearly he said whom I call as Brahman in Vedanta I call that McCauley why because the same quality the what is called the quality so he says like this then people iron the field of the novel yogi Brothers he is telling this in four verses I will give the gist of the four verses he says in the food versus and it is very very difficult to answer this question why what is Brahman what is Paramatma is very difficult to answer the Brahman is beyond the time space and causation so naturally we cannot explain it through words not only that one cannot think in mind also mind cannot conceive that idea the moment the mind can conceive the idea have the right ear immediately to be limited it won't be the infinite so this baka Munna a Teta it is beyond the party and Warner it is some of the punishes very nicely political weeks is all they are coming back the word it goes to express but cannot it comes back I was to see what canard comes back so like that one after another our inner ears was so powerful we can express everything but about the Brahmin they cannot why because that is the substrate how can you express about direct I sometimes give the example the computer can answer everything but if you ask the computer who has created you if that information is not put over their computer the same is your question is not matching sorry because it is not there the similarly God has given us wonderful internet but at the same time he is hiding and not giving the answer to that question what is God what is Brahman what is Brahman ma what is Narayana sufficient he sees this as the sparks they're coming out of the fire but they cannot even in the fire they cannot show you a little I can show you the fire now from the fire the sparks are coming out but the sparks are not having the head power to speak or to show what to explain about the trial similarly from that brahmana a protein has come from the supreme truth the basis of the origin of everything and pieces of the sustenance and also the distribution of the universe though itself is caused lives and even naturally the question will come who has created that God no there is no cause effect means creation the effect is the creation and there must be a cause and because and effect these are the two things that is having everywhere there is no cause there's no reason so we cannot see why that Brahman is there so this is very subtle thought to understand so it's green know as the Brahman and Paramatma that supreme truth he says like this the supreme truth the ultimate truth which is the basis of everything but it being caused las' and changeless its greeting out of itself is not very confusing something which is creating out of itself but at the same time changed lives may be a litre of milk out of that we are creating the yogurt but there won't be any middle left because the whole milk has started to yoghurt it has taken another shape some similarly from God from Brahman this universe has been created but again it says nothing has changed that Paramatma it remains as it is this is the difficult points understand so how the creation comes then they say also doing the same thing as because you the human being particularly the best creation of God the goddess even if the intellect to understand you were also doing the same thing every day are you not we are also creating how we are creating today morning I was in the company of some moms so we were chatting and all that I was creating there is no one in the dream in our dehorning dream I saw some bombs have come we are talking with them and these things of devotees are bringing food I am creating that was my world creation in the dream but the point they woke up where that thing went has so many people so many characters so many things were happening but in a flash nothing was there so who was the basis of all that creation of my dream mean my mind was the basis of my dream and what was the creation so many other things when it dissolved into my mind again to see we the Brahman is creating and that's why they say it is not creation it is the projection because the tree we don't create we project my thought is taking the form so that way it is projecting so this is the again in the one person is taking the LAV is dreaming and in the dream she's seen that a prince has come and taking hard so now that lady is asking in the dream itself oh my dreams very for taking me then the prince is telling you know better because you were trading not me because that is the same way also we know our board a sing the here says be shooter open up better art madam is in the 40th mercy says when the heart is purified the truth of the Hockman shines in it dreams again we are in a difficult situation what is this purity when your heart is purified let's say that those who are pure in heart for they shall see God Jesus told but he didn't explain who are actually the blessed one he explained if you are working in this way your heart will become purified and you can see God the ceramic history is also showing them that God yes I can show you the God but the truth that you have to make your mind purified young boys sixteen seventeen years Narendra not came to Salaam Tichenor it will sell can you show me God yes I have seen God I can show you God but the condition is you have to make your mind purified here also it says shoulda be shooter perfectly beautiful who pull apart-er you can realize what our product on you can realize the arm adapter and how this notification can be achieved again by growing delight in the service of the Supreme Lord that he is giving another revision friends we have already got so many big list of qualities that we should develop and here it gives only one line and say this by serving God silly how he says how to purify that he says body growing didn't I would notice this way by great delight in the service of Supreme Lord some of us we are working in the Osterman but we don't grow tonight do me some people they are coming and helping us in everywhere in all Islamic not only remote distribution all the prevail who are telling us the devotees they can't the hell the donate they saw him to everything but ultimately after working over there for twenty years as a volunteer didn't grow who in delight there's no joy in working rather who we where the world people used to come over here last 20 years we are working now the new general are coming now the Shawnee started looking at all these jealousies coming all the twenty years service I am sorry to say lost twenty years of your services so this is the reason one should study scripture how the spirit helpers by guiding this way so it says we should develop at the heart mother tongue you can realize the Artman by purifying your mind how to purify the mind once again the same question an answer is very simple in one line he says by growing delight in the service of the Supreme Lord then powerful devotion develops powerful devotion develops and destroy the impurities of the heart when I'm coming to one ideology and I'm loving that God and when I'm serving that God I am feeling light and bling joy and then ultimately what happens the strong bond comes I can remember way to your drama chariots just odd integers even our lavish Novation when a young man is joining then he has to live for three years then he will go for the training center for two years after that they same order Ramachari after five years then his name will be in our record and before that you just really practicing so this award in grammar after dad we were very happy find the words our friends we were going to Venice to see holy monk he was the disciple of marshal of the money Devi and he was bit at that time we all waked and set by his side and then we are the sharmaji we have seen these we have seen that the feeble employees he was asking again and again but that time we couldn't understand after was idealized he was asking did you feel that was the Britta and he went from different Nostrum but all different you know so when he went there he was asking did you feel that this place belong to talk you up on both Hollow and big earliest upon both although did you feel that it belongs to you we couldn't understand how it can be ours because I am coming from on Twitter and he is coming from DC when we have come to visit this astronaut they are good oh yeah authority just casually but that was not the proper answer much afterwards we understood when we started reading this book what is that you should feel love and when you were talking for God say something is left over here that's the you are picking it up and throwing you feel joy not unhappiness whitest people they do like this they're making it dirty not like that the devotion who I got the opportunity to clean this there are other people also pass through that but God didn't give him the opportunity or thank you God I this I don't do this that is called the green strong born and coming to disaster going to that place going to that place everywhere and nowhere you have the route well no we're just floating not that it will be wrong not that nothing is going to achieve everywhere you and keep going and you were collecting information that will help you but you all should be in one place now I asked about Swamiji the shoddy cheese suppose and it out comes what will happen he said I have added curved my boat in the name of of the on Saddam Krishna whatever happened I am NOT going to leave I'll be here whether idea has God or not whether I go to hell or not I am with the Amish so you have to have that and I gave that name dying our devotees dtt God DHD so this is the means one I - not yet dead and I must go through this I think joy the more actions are taking place and he sees the intelligent King dinasty again taking up the blue he wanted to know the secret of the karma he said there by doing the Karma so the king is asking and how to do this work by which we can get TT karmayoga putana kirusha ena sounds data we do of partial karmani nice calm on being the day Purim so Sam the Sanskrit in bhagavad-gita is a different time and Sanskrit in father God is also good but in a little different way so here it is not so melodious but still it gives the beautiful explanation karma and nice Karma these are the two karma and karma karma means action nice karma without action when we are not doing any work quietly sitting can be see that aren't we Mishka I have achieved much that one can know just one mind is thinking physically I am between but mind is going on thinking so it says you have to learn so now another brother has taken up this question and giving the answer we will explain it in our next discourse this a yogi of it Jota Jota he explained this and he says carmoza three tires karma akarma and vikarma karma karma and because these are the three different types of karma one karma is important by the scripture of karma there is a heinous type of work that one should not do those who are trying to realize God should not do that and become mom they know what is good karma but they won't do it one person came and he told actually from fighting and coming home premiered by one neighborhood at who you living over here and you didn't come here I'm here first Gnostics is like to see you know we know everything I guess our house was just near to the middle Martina so I know everything that's why I didn't come I told you know everything so can you tell me what is God what have you people know but I do believe what is there so they're very funny what he is country is that he knows everything as because it was born in that vicinity of the well not this is because he knows that sean is at there he knows the God is there he knows the camp is there he knows that one should go maybe even come there and go and worship he knows everything but you do and that is called big karma so friends we will discuss in details and about the Karma and akarma and vikarma thank you very much let us chant this mantra young Brahma both need [Music] stun dee dee please be the song but the drama punishes a guy Andy young sama God they are now a sitter that did the demoness bhishan DeYoung yogino yes young dumb knobby dude Sudha Sudha the buyer dismayed Shaundi shanti shanti [Music] hurry you
