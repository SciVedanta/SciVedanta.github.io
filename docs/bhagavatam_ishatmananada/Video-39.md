[Bhagavatam 081 : What We Learn From Bhagavatam?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9UvDeomltM)

good morning dear devotees friends today we are going to conclude the bhagavatam the bhagavatam we started on the march 4th 2018 to almost the whole year of 1819 and now we are going to conclude it on august 30th 2020. maybe we could read the last part but i don't know whether it will be interesting or not because most the the major the 12th chapter is giving the description of the the families and also very interestingly of course those who are interested you can read what is going to happen who is going to rule to all those things are recorded in the bhagavata so we mainly focused on the philosophy so now we will try to do that also over here today i am beginning with the the last verse because now we are offering all our puja all our work at the feet of that great lord and mainly what we learn from the bhagavata that is a very very very interesting thing the great vyasha with the inspiration of the devasta began the most famous purana by describing the truth it's a story it goes the bhagavata we those who are following the bhagavata you know there it is a purana and there are 18 main puranas with bhagavata is the most important puranas and just something you have written and that will be called as purana no the purana it has characteristics and we are having all those in our youtube and also they have developed some other devices i will announce that at the end so everything in the bhagavata is there so you can open the book or you can listen to that all the different points that to be covered then only it will be considered as a purana it has been covered by the bhagavata so this bhagavata is a purana but in the beginning itself the great rishi vyasa who also composed the other puranas and the mahabharata the he and then divided organized the veda that great rishi the mobishalla buddhi about him it is said he is a very very intelligent person vishal buddha but even then his mind was not at peace that is this it seems like that then the narada came and he asked the narada why this should be like this the whole life i spend on these spiritual practices but i am not getting the peace then the naruto told that you have not given to the people that particular thing by which they can develop their own spiritual life so why don't you develop the life of sri krishna so the krishna that is the god and but with the inspiration of the narada the vyasa he started but how he started he says he from whom the creation sustenance dissolution take place and he who is both material and instrumental cause sattham param dhimahi on that supreme truth we meditate it's a personal god but that personal god is nothing but the impersonal all pervading the consciousness which is known as the brahman so this is the specialty of the hinduism i say again and again so if one can understand this you will find the hindu temple full with so many varieties of gods and goddesses and the people will be researching on that is it a pantheism pananthism and so many way but the real hindu they know the god is only one and he is all pervading without any attribute he is nothing but the consciousness and that has been turned by the veda as brahman atman the self so this brahman the atman this as it is here in the bhagavata very much present at the same time we find a personified god and then we will find the sri krishna the god of the bhagavata is the vishnu and from vishnu is coming rama and krishna we will come to that slowly and this personified god is helping us to develop the spirituality the essence of the bhagavata is the supreme brahman and the bhagavata is the book of pure knowledge taught through the divine life of sri krishna and the bhagavata was narrated now some people they say that they claim the bhagavata is the holy book of the bushnabbers only and there is a many people they think in that way bhagavatam means vaisnava but if we look at the history of the bhagavata the bhagavata this purana and we know that the guru's guru the guru father when he is writing and there he is mentioning about the bhagavata and also his disciple then finally comes the shankara and from there shukhadeva the shukhadeva then shankara so this tradition is coming down the first is that veda vyasa and then this one after another and they they always speak about the ultimate truth that is the knowledge and knowledge is nothing but the brahman now who is narrating this bhagavata the story the sukadeva as a pure soul as a no attachment for this worldly life that is sukkah to whom he is narrating the king the famous king the king parikshith who was waiting for his death you know that story parikshet made a mistake and then he was cursed by a brahmana boy that he will die within seven days so parikshit knew that i am surely going to die but he was a courageous man and very righteous person he told me okay i did the mistake and i have to suffer the problem i am not going to save myself but the seven days that is left over there i like to dedicate the completely concentrate on the god so he went by the side of a river and he was waiting there then the famous the monk the shukhadeva the son of via the vyasa brother biaser composed and he taught his son and the son went to the king to narrate the whole story by listening to those stories the parikshit mind was dedicated to the supreme god and that is the main gift of bhagavatam the bhagavata if one is interested to read or to listen then the bhagavata can help that person to take his mind to liberation though that is the wonderful scripture this is the bhagavatam the mind of the both those who are narrating or the one who is listening should be pure and who what is this purity how the mind can become pure the shankaracharya also in his uh viveka churamani he is mentioning 310 that is the verse of the viveka ramani i am quoting that particular word the heitu the cause the reason of the rebirth are the objects of the objects of this world and there are five objects rupa russia gandha there is the form the beauty and the smell the taste and like that the five and our five organs they are constantly going out and connecting with those objects bringing the information and deluding the mind so this is the whole process going on going back to god what should we do we stop this process and reverse the process that's all we are not going to enjoy these five objects the control of the mind so they teach meditation concentration and the whole of spiritual life is nothing but withdrawing the senses from the sense objects making the distance and that is sufficient the bishoya chintaya and there one after another shankaracharya explained how the mind can be purified so bhagavatam it teaches the brahman or the god how it proves the either brahman or the god just you are announcing but the hindu mind they always go with the scientific thought scientific the process that you have to prove it unless and until you can prove it then i am not going to accept it maybe that it is your emotional or maybe that you have realized something but it doesn't matter if i cannot realize the same thing if a scientist say i have discovered water in this process but no one else can discover it then this is not a science after the discovery he should disclose that this is the process that i have discovered this particular thing the same way the hindu they also think the religious realization revelation must go through a process and if that process is followed by another person he will also get and must get the same result when the buddha by practicing something the spiritual practices he realized the border the knowledge so gautama became buddha i too can become by following those things if it is not there is something wrong in the gautama's practices i am not going to accept it so this is then how you will prove then it says there are four ways of and the bhagavata it is also accepting this one is perception then inference scripture and tradition these are the four ways in the vedanta they also have the process of proving that the prathaksa anumana etc this pramana and all the philosophies they will take these are these are the processes the perception i can understand i can see i can talk i can feel i can touch that i know these that's why when a young boy went to bhagavan sirama krishna and the narendra nath he was a student of calcutta university and he asked that sirama krishna said have you seen god immediately he said yes i have seen god i talk to him and i can show you too that is the main thing i can show you too if you follow the process by which i have gone over there so this perception then the inference if god is not there so how all these things are that is now the scripture those who have realized when they say we have to accept that after the the globe taught her after traveling when they come and they give their traveler and they give them maps then the people they accept yes maybe a little you know the ordinary person he it may exaggerate or make some mistakes in explaining but those who have seen god the atman the pure self they will never make the mistake so the all those revelations are recorded in the veda in the upanishads those revelations are also there in the puranas they have they have also taken those so it is perception inference scripture and finally the tradition these are the four ways bhagavata we are learning from bhagavata that the god can have form and god can be without form friends today we are concluding we are closing so we are just trying to remember what we have learned from bhagavata the great knowledge that the bhagavata has given is this the god is immanent god is impersonal god is all-pervading and at the same time god is having the form god is having the qualities the formless attributeless all-pervading god can also be god with form and qualities that is exactly what bhagavan srirama krishna propagated again and again the formless god assumes different forms through his own power known as maya shakti now here comes the philosophical questions if the god has created this universe and you say so we don't have any problem to accept that but now you say the god is creating out of what we accept the god as an intellectual cause and he is doing it what is the material cause is there any other material already existing along with the god parallel with his existence no that cannot be the two existences cannot be if that is there then god become finite the infinite attitude of the god god is infinite and if it is infinite that means everywhere all pervading so obviously there cannot be any second object and if that is that then how god created out of what then the hindu is the answer all the veda and everything that god has created this universe out of his own the he is the material cause and he is the intellectual cause both okay even if we accept that the god is the intellectual cause and he is a material cause god himself is the carpenter and god himself is the wood and the carpenter and the wood they are making the furniture okay now when the god is the material and utilizing the material for his creation and he is creating varieties of things sentient and incentive leaving and not leaving then tell me the god is going to be exhausted sometime then the hindus will say no god cannot be exhausted if a materially used first making something else i am using the wood for making that wood carving the wood and then making the dolls then the time will come the wood will be exhausted and there will be the dolls only but no it is not like that then how it is possible the god is creating is it a permanent creation or a temporary creation then you say it is purely temporary creation then how he is creating there it comes with the answer his own power that is called maya so if we understand these then we can understand the hindu mind the maya is the power of god associated with god it comes from god and this maya is having three qualities satya raja and tama the good the mixture and the bad mixture of good and bad and the bad sattva raja and tama in sanskrit and this maya the power of god is having to power that is the covering and superimposing avarana big shaper these are the two sanskrit words avarana is covering and big shaper superimposing something else the only these five things are there in that power sattva raja tama and avarana biksheva now it is said is a continuous creation is going on no when that satya raja and tama are in equilibrium there is no movement there is no changes then if they say there is no creation and that is called dissolution that sometimes they say the doom day all closed etc praliya what is that pralaya this three goes back and they become completely inactive and how the creation starts bhagavata says the consciousness the master when it comes close to its own power and to explain these in the bhagavata we find another character that is called kapila and kapila has given the name of the god's power as prakrti the god is there and the prakrti so you should not be confused with the terminologies the god and the power and it says that when the god wishes activates the power and they'll sometimes explain as in the bhagavata we find that god is coming near to his power and because of his affinity closeness and there the power that is satya rajyathama these three qualities start moving and the one is getting mixed up with another so the permutation and the combination and that is called creation now there again they are explaining these all those things that you see is a temporary thing and what you see it is not true to explain that they say abharana bikshepa these are the two power the maya is having what is that abharana the great example they will be always giving that there is a rope and reality that is a rope but a person he comes and sees the rope as a snake all vedantin argument and when you see the rope as a snake and you don't see the rope you see the snake and naturally the reaction of seeing a snake so close to you all are present there you are perspiring you are crying for help all things goes on the all activities but on the basis of what a false knowledge false notion in sanskrit they say mitta is a mitta gyanam false knowledge it's a knowledge but not real knowledge so mitta gyana so this is the way they will explain the creation so how we are all afraid over here i am going to lose my property i am going to lose these i am going to have that so many things are going on in our mind the whole human life is nothing but it begins when you are six years old and then after ultimately at the end of your life constantly so many things you are superimposing and then you are thinking this is like this it goes on like this so constantly either we are thinking that we are enjoying but in reality we are suffering ultimately then when we suffer then we say oh no more this is enough so this way the experience goes on then ultimately we decide enough is enough i am not going to remain in this world anymore i don't need anything of this world anymore no name no fame no physical comfort nothing i want i want only peace i want only joy i want only happiness eternal happiness and that from there it begins the spiritual life and where the bhagavata comes to help you the bhagavata is giving you the dharma to protect the righteousness again the bhagavata concept that supreme god he takes the form human form different forms but mainly human form why after becoming a human only one can get the liberation among all the creations of the god the best creation is the human and this human creation why because human has the feeling he can understand he can judge and that is why in christianity they say god made man out of his own image it's not the the same looking no that cannot be the different looking people but the human has having that capacity to understand to judge bichar about thee is the concept of the discriminative faculty the cons that is that is there so that is the reason that god gave that wonderful gift to the human being to understand that this is temporary and this is permanent go for the permanent even when even all this when the majority of the people particularly the leaders of the society the spiritual leaders and the political leaders and the economic leaders if they are becoming the immoral what is this immorality they are accepting the worldly things as permanent and vying with each other competing with each other to get those things and that is called immorality dharma dharma and atharma and then when the dharma prevailed and the narada was very sad and in the story it is there the why narada why you are sad you are always happy you are singing the name of god and you are roaming around you are free why you are sad today then he said you know i traveled to this world and i saw all people almost all of them the thinking about their body they cannot think anything else except the body and that's why i am so sorry when this type of situation comes according to the sanskrit terminology adharma and prevails then that supreme god who created this universe and out of his own image the human being and when he sees the human being is making mistake almost all of them they are thinking this world is permanent then he comes as a teacher but in the form of a human being and we have seen that the lord vishnu in the bhagavata we have found the lost vishnu came in the form of his swan and then afterwards we find him in the form of sri ramachandra and again in the form of sri krishna and in the very modern time 1830 the same vishnu the same supreme god came and he became famous as a sri ramakrishna and all these three every time when is coming only one mission one purpose to establish the dharma and what is that dharma understand the truth the reality and go for that we will come to that the vishnu that he is coming here now in the bhagavata is second skanda it is having 12 skanda and each gandha is having so many chapters in the second skandha that's called book 10th chapter verse 13 it tells us how the the creation came the supreme god divided himself in three parts as if we have to always keep them in mind as if as if he divided and it says echo one to become many why a nation it desired nobody dictated there was no one else to tell anything but the the supreme god thought oh i will play and what to do i will make myself so many and eco nanatam or nitchan maya basri once i i was observing an actor he is learning and in his own room there are so many the meters on the top and also on the walls at the room of mirrors so he was in the middle and he was acting he was making the faces and and he looks his own image in this side and he turns to the next and behaving completely other way and then he looks up and he is so i was observing the same person and expression in this different characters and sometimes he's so good and sometimes his eyes his facial expression is so terrible from distance when you are looking at that so i was thinking he is thinking to become like that and he is becoming the man is thinking that i will be a villain and he is becoming a villain and he's thinking that i'll be a hero and i'll be a nice man he's becoming like that the same way that supreme being who was all pervading all alone constantly remaining in that piece just on nichon just thought i like to be mani the echo nanatam to become inanna nanatum what he did misrijad and he divided himself in three different parts how maya again friends i'll remind you this the maya means the power of god and that's the elusive power of god just like those mirrors it's not real but the meter was showing that he has transformed into a terrible person or a very good person so maya with the power of that god's power as if he divided into three parts what is that so majority of the time you will hear the the the saints of the hindu or the pujaris the holy people at the end of everything they will say shanti shanti shanti why three times this is from the nature the divine and all other human being and other beings and also the matter this body the problem comes through from these three the from the nature from the god from the divine or from the neighbors and the but there may be animals and reptiles all living around you or you are living among those things they should be friendly they should be helping you so that is the prayer and finally your own body so adi so this is the three now the maha vishnu that they as because as because all this time it was the all-pervading conscience and in the all-pervading consciousness there was no name or only brahman the brahman means the all-pervading consciousness and when from that a form is taken we have to give a name the name and the form otherwise how we will identify so that's why immediately we give a name to anything that we discover a star or some planets or maybe a new bird maybe a flower anything we should immediately give the name similarly when that supreme consciousness took the form we gave the name vishnu and maha the sanskrit word maha means supreme why this visnu vishnu the same the vishnu also is that same all pervading so vishnu visnu out of him created brahma it's not brahman it is brahma this brahma is the fast born how he was born the vishnu thought and this particular feature came brahma vishnu gave lord vishnu gave all knowledge to this particular creation brahma so immediately you know that hindus they're very symbolic that they made the brahma is four heads the four faces the that means he is having the veda the veda is divided into four so that just to show that the four faces brahma his color is red why he is active that's why his body is read and brahma shakti is the sharashvati why knowledge so that is the way and brahma's carrier is a swan why because brahma is not attached to anything though he is creating he is the creator he is so activated all the time active but not attached to anything so these are the symbols so if we can explain the symbol understand the symbol we understand the truth so brahma was created now again the brahman divided himself into two parts and that is called or the narishwara means half nari is a lady woman and then another half is a man so that is the god artanari swara and this ardhan arishara he created sayambhu and shattar rupa the lady form was shatter rupa the name because any form must have a name otherwise we won't be able to identify and the man form was shayambu shayambu satarupa this shayamba shaturupa their daughter is devahuti and brahma again created another son out of his mind he thought and and that is a great ascetic kardama those who are following my classes regularly you are now habituated with all these names and you know these characters this kardama and the kardama wanted to practice the austerity spiritual austerity he never wanted to become involved in this world but his father his creator the brahma told no you have to marry and the lord vishnu himself told i will become your son so please marry and he married devaki the daughter of sayambu and satyarupa and we can say that was the first marriage ceremony and this kardama and the devahuti their son is lord kapila this kapila the great expounder of the shankar the bhagavata we learn that who is a shadhu so this is the creation and in the form of the bhagavata and bhagavata is teaching us who is a real good person a sadhu a holy person why because you have to be guided you must go to a holy person to get his guidance i am starting the journey i want to know so obviously i will go to a teacher who has already completed in that particular subject so the sadhu is that who has already realized he has already traveled in the path of righteousness so this sadhu who we will know so very clearly because this is the time we can make mistake and if we make the mistake then again we are diverted instead of going to a particular person who knows if we go to a wrong person he will show us a completely wrong direction so one must be very very careful about choosing a guide spiritual guide a guru what are the qualities bhagavata tells us the first and foremost is the bhagavata the third skander 25th chapter 21 words it says it should be frost and foremost patient the sadhu a good person a holy person should have lot of patience he must be kind-hearted if he is not kind-hearted then he can never become very friendly to each and every one what is the friend he feels for others and stand by his side when it is necessary so that friendliness and peaceful himself he's not parted he's not disturbed and then free from enmity so these are the qualities of the holy person we learn from the bhagavata bhagavata through kopil muni teaches us what is true devotion so these are the things we learn from bhagavata what is the devotion bhagavata taught us how a illustrious son kapila taught his mother devaki the teaching of having liberation and this is the first time the mother is learning from the sun and what she is asking give me liberation oh my son i know you are not ordinary i know that you have that capacity to guide me so please give me liberation this is a big chapter and the very wonderful the conversation between the mother and the son and the ultimately over there you will find from the duality coming the non-duality from the dweta the expressions of the advaitha and we where there you will find that the kapila the son is telling his mother you are making a mistake mother by going to the temple and worshiping the images whereas i the god is all around the temple outside the temple why don't you go and worship me who are outside the temple so we the human being we construct temple the synagogue the churches the mosque we built and with all the things that we are having the bricks and mortars and all then we think that is the most holy place and then we kill others those who come near that isn't it is god only into that building no that why we create why we construct the temple and the holy places because it helps us laboratory why people they create the laboratory because it helps us to go and research over there all apparatuses and all other things are there the people are trained into the the same way if you go to a temple the trained people are there they are called pandits they're supposed to guide you they're supposed to teach you and when you go over there there is nothing else but the god and you so your concentration will be there and they will say that you have to share so that is the same way but when in the name of the temple we go and killing people then the kapila is telling that is nuisance you are going against god and when you sell in the name of god oh if you donate this much money you will go to heaven and if you are not then you are going to hell who are you to know that do you know your own the destination where you are going over there so these are the things that we have to understand we learn from bhagavata and this is true religion the people they are criticizing religion the modern generation they don't like religion because you know why because we have created the problem and we express in such a way that religion means so many complications no not at all religions means a development the human mind is developing to a divine so that should be the guide so that through devotion it is possible and how it is yoga shalakshanam he is telling the sun is telling to the mother i will tell you how to develop devotion how to transform your the lower senses lower mind lower thoughts to a divine thought how swa dharma aacharanam shakta bidhar just perform your own duties without attachment just perform your own duties without attachment when you are a student when you are a learner you must learn and don't get attached to anything else if a student is getting involved into the other things then he won't be able to learn so the focus will be that then he has become a householder the responsibility to develop the house because from the house from the family children are born and they are again going out to the human society so obviously my children should be the worthy to live in the human society they should help the human society and they should not create any problem in the human society so each and every married couple that is their swa dharma they should go on teaching their children and not only that all around people in the society the schooling in the schools also they should be careful to teach that young mind how to grow a real a personality human person so that is the way which society grows that's called swadharma then again it's telling second grammar dharma moksha dharma ratio what is that gramma dharma grammar dharma means those things that takes our mind to the attachment to the worldly things that's called grammar and don't discuss all these useless things and major part of our energy goes in talking about discussing about the things which are of no use for us so that is called grammar so grammar dharma nibirth we should give up the grammar dharma that is the selfish way of thinking and performing moksha dharmarati what is the moksha dharma practice the bachara discrimination practice detachment and also practice concentration to god so we learn this from the bhagavata the seekers of liberation must adopt bhagava bhagavata is teaching that is again the third the book 28th chapter and eight words brahmacharya archana mona and dhyana so these are the teachings we find from the bhagavata we learn the teachings of this spiritual practices from the bhagavata and what are those we find the conversation between the king prithu and the kumaras this is a very interesting conversation the kumara you all know by this time they are also famous as sun the sanat sananda sanatana sanat kumar they're all four kumaras they are unmarried and young brahm means and good qualities these four brothers they'll be roaming here and they're free and because they were not having any attachment so they used to go wherever there is good thing they are there they'll be sitting they'll be listening they'll be enjoying and they'll be taking part in the conversation and they were just if you withdraw your mind from the worldly things your mind becomes pure the moment your mind becomes pure immediately the revelation of god and when the revelation of god is there knowledge and peace are almost they always there so this is this simple way instead of telling i don't believe in god why don't you practice this is always i say instead of telling that i don't believe in god i don't believe in the existence of god there is no god instead of that why don't you practice this much non-attachment and just concentration to the supreme peace these two things you are there not that you have to stop eating sleeping nothing like that only don't become attached to do anything in the society is it possible for you and then if you can concentrate your mind on something higher and that is called peace joy happiness if we can do that then the revelation of god will be there and for sure that is exactly it says it is a scientific religion why because if you practice you get the result and result for sure and what is that god that is love and unselfishness so we learned from these the king prithu and that also bhagavata teaches us that in the olden tradition in india the kings there they were very just kings very good kings and in their kingdom people are so happy so you need not to go out all the time the fighting and sometimes when you read and see the movies then majority everywhere we see in the europe and all other asiatic countries also the kings major time they are going out and fighting their only one work was to kill and to enjoy that's all then when they will develop themselves when they will help the whole the country to develop and the development of the human society cannot be just food is intellect is the knowledge so ancient india picture that we gave from the pages of the bhagavata it shows as it tells us the kings were very learned people and at this at the same time very good administrators so people are so happy and look at it this king inviting the holy people and asking the philosophical questions the dialogue between the prithu and the kumaras dialogue between the neemi and the nine brothers naba yogi so learn about the bhagavata dharma from the naba yogi is a wonderful i have given a uh in advertising last time when i went i gave of course in i think it is in bengali is in bengali so this naba yogi sanity in the company of the nava yogi nine brothers and this again a king neemi he was asking nine questions they asked and all are very highly spiritual christians we learn that even the person who is donating if he is egoistic god doesn't like it so when we are doing anything we should be humble the ego that makes us all this trouble the if there is ego then there is the problem what is that ego and we find like this that bali is a great donor but he used to boast that i only can donate and whoever comes to me whatever they want i can donate so the god came to help him he was a good man and a donation is a charity is a considered as a very high spiritual practice because i am earning money wealth and then i am giving it to somebody else it needs the broad mind so the charity is a very high spiritual practice but if it is done with the ego it never takes us anywhere so this man was very righteous man but egoistic person this is righteousness and the ego doesn't go together so the god came to his health he came in the form of a brahmana in the sanskrit word vamana means dwarf and bali the king bali was there and he was telling whatever you want just ask i will give it to you and you know that wonderful story the little person the bamana he said i want only three steps of land from your country and he must have laughed and he said three steps you're such a small person what three steps he will take but then when he agreed what happened the small little form became lord visnu all pervading huge in the first tape he took almost everything then second step the swarga and then third step he lifted and told hey bali where i am going to put it because swarga martha and pathala already it is covered and there is no nothing left in this world and story goes like this the devoted bali understood his fully he understood because of his ego the god has come in this form to crash his ego so he sat and told why my head is here you can place your holy feet on these so that still it is there and we can we can accept i can understand that the god is there to teach us that we must be humble even when we are doing the good work if we do with our ego then we make the mistake so we are learning so many things and finally friends even in the last few classes in the discourses we were listening how the great friend and the follower of sri krishna uttaba was asking questions to sri krishna and that has been the name it says the last message of sri krishna the sri krishna was giving in the reply the yodu banksa though the king was born in that clan there is another thing we should remember the god was born into that clan but when the majority of the people of that clan became egoistic god left them and the individual person the bali because of his ego god taught him helped him but by killing him and here we find yadhu-banksa they should have been so wonderful that the god is advented into that god was there all the successes were because of the god but they forgot it can you imagine when the god takes the form in a clan in a society they should be aware of it they should be humble they should try to learn but that it didn't the yadu-vansa was completely destroyed and god never lifted his finger to stop it see krishna you observe that these own people are dying why because the egoistic and ego separates us from god and then god will never be there so egoistic person is not getting the blessings of god the support of god that is that we learn and then one or two person like the uttaba he came and he told and he was utthawa we appreciate he was concerned oh lord you are leaving now he decided that krishna that i should now leave this world what will happen to the future generation look at it now i am all right i will go along with god no he was not that selfish the uddhava the great mind he was thinking about the posterity about the future of the people what will happen so he went on asking question what is dharma what is the way and then he said the swadharma the varna and the astrama the burna and the asthma at least this part i will request all hindus to learn because we are confused and the other the whole world is complaining about the hinduism because of this and among the hindus some people are there boast fully they are trying to protect the burner and the asthma particularly the burner not knowing what is these burners are what is the real cause so that if we learn and this is the great teachings of the bhagavata all these days we were learning and in that the finally the krishna is telling us the swadharma you should practice friends i'd like to conclude by quoting about with the words of bhagavan sri ramakrishna what is this bhagavata and he says sweet as a cake fried in the barter of wisdom and soaked in the honey of love i will repeat these words so this bhagavata according to bhagavan sri ramakrishna is a sweet as a cake because some wonderful stories stories of the dhruva and if you read you won't be able to stop and it goes on reading and reading so sweet as cake fried in the batter of wisdom and then a soaked in the honey of love may this gayana bhakti the knowledge and devotion that comes to us and makes our human life a great success may all be happy thank you very much the first first question is from nagobati thank you for your wisdom and making the knowledge understandable according to hinduism what is the first movement of creation what is first created the first movement of movement if you ask nita first movement is the wish of god the god with formless all pervading the brahman or the atman whatever you may call and a wish came a desire came i am one i like to be many and in sanskrit they say again and again i am alone i want to be many and this and then first came that the vishnu the maha vishnu the next question is from how to practice non-attachment yeah yes very very very important question how to practice non-attachment you know they always say discrimination and detachment it goes hand in hand and if we constantly think now i have seen the the mothers the newborn babes or the very young child that so so attached of course the mother should be and when the child is moving left and right constantly eyes are moving the great attachment but if the mother is continuing that in the beginning it's okay but if he's continuing and the child will become 21 22 30 40 if the mother goes on looking like that where the baby is going child is going then what will happen suffering because that grown-up person will go to somewhere else he will settle or she will settle in his own way so mother has to understand one day this baby who is now lying on my lap cannot move do anything without me is going to leave me if that thought is there just similarly many other things so we we purchase a huge building then afterwards the one day we have to leave we know that it is not possible to for me to take the whole building and this is the way each and everything in our life the object of our life when we get a job we become so happy then we know there is a retirement day for me waiting and if you know that then you are not suffering and that is exactly called detachment thank you for a good question the next question also from is it important to count japan or is it enough if i keep note of time that is if i stand for one hour without keeping count of jakka also i meditate on the form of god while in japan is it okay the tanya if you have taken the initiation you should follow the instruction of your guru or otherwise in general we can say that in the beginning one should count the japan and you know that in one hour you can at least do three thousand three thousand in one hour three thousand okay so by 20 minutes uh 20 minutes in one one thousand so three thousand then you need not to count you can simply go on doing and meditating on the form of the god whose name you are repeating is a very good if you can develop that habit is a very good habit the next question is from means that goes from here to there are not babies all means negative so that means one pointed devotion that is called a baby charini the baby chari in the personal life also people don't like in the society uh that you are from this life to another life you are going choosing this man or that person this that so that people don't like don't accept similarly in the devotion also if you choose one god or goddess and that is your chosen deity hundred percent mind should go to that that is called abhavi charini bhakti the next question is from shrima is asking tell the process of detachment being a mother this is only every day you have to develop that this child that is growing up with me is going to be separated from me that's for sure so that is the thing that i told my mother you knew that i won't be with you all through your life and even if i stay back can you give me the word that you will not die before me so you will die someday so obviously i'll be left alone so give me that that is the discrimination you know that is the discrimination that is the way of thinking that if you constantly think that as i was telling the i am in this job but that is a limited time is there retirement date is of course there i am in this life but there is the date of death is also there for me and i will die someday and all these family members i should do my sadharma as a father as a mother what best i can give i should give but i know that it cannot continue all through it is not possible by that way detachment it's not that so we love my families we love the people but we are not at dust and if you are at us then it's a really really painful you know very very painful so the next question he has a very weird name top 10 or something he's here so he's asking in the path of knowledge is it said that without the knowledge of separation between body and athman salvation is not possible then how is it related to the path of devotion in the path of devotion it is plus in the path of knowledge it is minus the when you are path of knowledge will teach you that your atman your body are completely different so you have to separate your atman from your body minus but in the path of devotion exactly they will say your body and your soul is god your god is enshrined within your body within your heart so that is the way they think they don't think that this is my body they think this is the temple of my god this is the way they get the liberation so the next question is from madhumita maharaja i like to yes yes some books are there so you know that i think in our book store also it is available so the story of the dhruva story of the pralada and the narada and so many and you know the bhagavata if you want the conversation between the kapila and his mother it is not for the children if you want the conversation between the uddhava and the krishna it is not for the children but the stories of the bhagavata are different stories that is of course with the picture it is available if you write to us and you can go to our website also and it is possible it is there the next question is to whom god actually helps ah god helps those who help themselves as swami vivekananda said so if i am helping myself and in a righteous way then the blessings of god come so and surely it will come the one should not you know that sometimes the young people they lose the the faith and then they commit suicide or some do some mistakes and get frustrated one should not i have something to achieve and i'm going to achieve it don't compare with others the moment you compare then naturally you are going to get the under the uh suffering why oh that man has done so sometimes the speakers nowadays it has become a very difficult then they will say oh his listeners are 14 000 the talk that he has given 14 000 people are listening and you have given the talk only four people are listening i have four people are there at least four are there so that way we have to be satisfied you know either four or fourteen thousand all are same they are not going to leave but it is not the matter so this you please remember you have some capacity and according to those capacities you are going to achieve something and you have to be satisfied with that the god helps those lots of other questions on may i know
