[Bhagavatam 048 : Avadhuta Gita: Experience In the State Of infinite](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IG8_Dit_lI8)

good morning it is begin with this total this repeat after me Shanta god you jerk Hashanah but Mona solution we shouid governess attrition me [Music] shuhang Lakshmi condom Garmadon Ayane you the Annika Mia Bundy Vishnu sir Rivaldo Greek [Music] the great master here the creator the sustainer and also dissolver is named as Vishnu the Vishnu the word means who is everywhere beasts are and additional we start everywhere now this Vishnu as because he is everywhere he is not supposed to have any form how can it be but still is because we cannot have any idea God which is all-pervading we have given third the form and this is a beautiful description of that for machine and as we are starting the bhagavata this is dedicated to the vision so mostly we listen about that a part of the bhagavata that we are studying now is the about hood eita the top tree about the Dattatreya he was in the forestry area of india and he was a very special type of person he never took initiation from anyone but very intelligent so he started Tunisia and the last time in our gospel is course we concluded the dr. trio he was expressing his great joy of realization in this week beta no Luca no surah now Yong Yong but Nostrum neighbor colyn majority then he mentioned not tomorrow not just dipti margo brahma guru pumper heart attack dome this builder there is no leader for me at the christians they follow bible they always say the Bible is our guide Muslim the Quran but this Tripitaka Hindus read and this is a teacher of Hindu but he says for me Nevada I don't care for the Veda this is very peculiar and he said also that there is no caste no stage of life no family no birth or me but if the cooler and when we listen to these little what actually is talking about he he says that I don't have any cash Turner Hindus they have the divided on the basis of the world they have divided the four brahmana Kshatriya Vaishya and shudra I don't belong to stages Hindus they have divided the famine the social life in two stages Frosty's brahmacarya student god is householder bond oppressed a retired person then sannyasa completely free from the worldly attachment he said I don't belong to any of it then he says I don't have any family family visa me and mine this is mine this is my thing neither so no family and no Bart he is talking and he's talking to the people was it I don't have any birth and then finally since there is neither the path of smoke not the path of light we will with the last time someone asked please explain things after the date when we go and who goes because my body is over here who goes this is a very interestingly the bhagavata is explaining and also some of the Puranas and who punishes also Rigby the also mentioned these two words again and again that is it says the path of smoke and a better light per good eater that also cement mention about this we will touch it about this particular aspect after death who goes my body is here so what actually leaving me you know the Hindus they say there's a consciousness within us and because of the consciousness everything we can do we are thinking we are blinking we are performing anything and everything that we can do because of that particular consciousness sometimes people the term is our life here is the life that is this is the consciousness with consciousness nothing can add who attended yesterday stop the server create explaining without the consciousness nothing is there our eyes it cannot see without the consciousness and none of our senses will work without the consciousness and when someone is dead his body is their eyes nose and everything is there but they are not functional is not working at all why what has left that particular body so body is not important so the Hindus they rained on analyzing what is happening what is this and they found that consciousness which is the main source over that fight covers that there one of the other the first cover is this body and they turned is as on pneumonia portion coach I'm insane it covered on pneumonia what is the dannemeyer because without food and water this body cannot survive so the turn is under his foot so annamaya kosha then inside this energy they turned that as pranamaya kosha the prana the breathing and taking and I'm surviving some time yawning and all this then people when they feel sleepy and the less oxygen they'll be warning again so this is the main problem and this is also proved that energy is there when energy is less this type of yawning it's coming so it's primarily mono the mind we all know my mind is sometimes happy sometimes with the unhappy and all those things are going on happening in the mind so monomial tena we like to know so many things now in creating the the scientists they have developed and that is the Google anything and everything just to Google go to opal and you get knowledge immediately previously we used to have so many dictionaries and go and search over the air is not they're not just send it to Google anything and all the Sanskrit terminologies is somebody has recorded there and thanks to him that this this is called the big annamaya kosha knowledge and after all these ultimately the human being wants on enjoy happiness the yesterday we went over there in Chicago to see that the exercise that they were doing air and water the evening and everybody was shouting when the two flight is coming down almost loading each other then they're green and it is so fast what they did they give the smoke one is reading on it's blue so we could understand who has crossed water and like this like that so the all excitement what is that excitement joy and otherwise people will never go suppose the original the real airfreight is going on we will go to see yes everybody to behind that bunker is there or maybe a bunker is there at all they will go but there so we go into anything and everything only for the joy so that is called anandamaya kosha but the ananda also cannot be if the self is not there so what happens after the depth now it says only body in this cross body this our unaware culture that had leaves but pranamaya mono via beyond oomiya and anandamaya that they have - - they have clubbed pranamaya and mono vehicle subtle body this is gross body and this is subtle god inside this body very subtle but that is prana and mana is - and causal body beyond away on and on and the mayor so there are three bodies gross body then subtle body and causal body the prose body only this body and then it comes the subtle body prana and mana and began a non and these four they leave the body or it has become whole that something has happened let us go so they will go where they will go now the question comes so they see their toes it is all how they are directed because of the Karma the direction in case from the word the Karma and this karma is very certain sometimes some people apparently will come and ask hey how are you I find that you are here in the taking rest is it okay for you is there want to know whether you have cost you a job or not they are not interested no I thought you didn't want interested to know that job the moment there is you say that I have lost the job you will never look at you immediately phone because so many people are there to inform so do you think they are really having a happy know the terrible be mentality sadist mentality somebody is suffering and I enjoy is it not work I didn't go and slapped or did any physical thing I do no harm with the harsh words also very polite to gentle in credits but at the back of doors what is there to only do insert and get the joy of the suffering of the person so this is called Karma but we are not aware of those Karma we always think that I'm not hurting anyone I'm not beating anyone I'm not cheating anyone like this like that we think but what about your thoughts and when you are again spreading that heart among the many people nowadays is so easy you just put on what's the call what's up or something immediately so many will be there and by that way you are creating problems of karma and there is someone who is very intelligent I do not know where he stays where is the operation but each and every being whatever they are doing everything is recorded whether you believe it or not accept it or not it is there it is that karma is the guiding force those who are worshipper of this the Saguna Brahma Brahma Brahma all-pervading consciousness we cannot understand that so we bring it down and make it according to our way so different type of pictures will be their simples will be their images will fit their like that only it is easy for us the God is everywhere but still we go to the church we go to the mosque we go to the synagogue go to Temple because we feel God is here why in some place some symbol some photos of email to ego and we do that so that is cost saw guna Brahma Saguna means with qualities with qualities God is gracious God can give the blessings if God is angry then he can give the curses also so one must be careful all these gunas qualities we worship that and after the death these people they travel to the day we honor the division Ahmad Deva means divine so they travel to that it says shukla mark our dictum on the path of God are the bright path so when they die what happens would try on the bright half of the year would that I usually die in the brighter so this called hood trial induction I'll put the iron of the year and go to the brahmaloka as a brahmaloka and still here till the end of the Brahma and by that way they are there so apparently those who are worshipping the God would fall and they are doing a good work not harming anyone mentally physically intellectually they are always doing good for others so that's why the Guru the Hindu gurus we were taught in this way before you start the meditation you must pray for the all beings everywhere let there be good to each and everyone will just pray but psychologically mentally through thoughts you are getting purified right because you are thinking about others and what is seeing selfishness what is purity not thinking about yourself for thinking the betterment of others that is purity so purity and seen when I am everyday thinking for the others betterment praying for them not that I can go and give them food and these are that but I can pray for them and before my prayer I said God can you please help them can I please help those people and please look at me - it's okay and some people will never do that - even if I suffer no problem but please help those they go through the dianna mark the path that the God travels that good people that travel to go through that man and that path is lighted there are some example some people to see when they died immediately they waded into the slumber and the blackness was that they couldn't see anything so they were there frustrated for some time then the tavern and they made suddenly someone in the Midway and he guided them to a place and that is those who are doing the bad work or selfish were thinking about them certainly they go through Triana now first is the Breanna our Shukla markleham is the bright and they go to the brahmaloka and there they remain till the Brahmas period is over now question is how many years is a promise period don't blame me I have not calculated again this is what you find in the hour these speeches 689 trillions 164 billion and 18 million human years this minute have had such a long long long time they will be there so they say they are muta they are liberated but in reality the we'll have to come back to after such a long period there's a little Rami was a very excellent exponent of this Vedic literature he mentioned this is also a temporary thing this is also temporary though it is so trillion million and billion so even then they will have to come back and the second people pick Triana because Krishna Marga the dark part do no martyrs will with smoke they travel through that why who are these people mostly the people like us so we do good things and we are also thinking mostly 8090 percent for us for our self whatever we do first me and then if something is extra good okay I will think about my fillet tips very rich person I can do you like to give some donation or no for me I have to calculate say that the money for my own people might son daughter then for my relatives then for my villagers and eat something still there then I will so this way constantly they are thinking that I should do why they do something for the villages but they will remember me after my death they put her in a plaque over there so and so constructed this school so like this and they're all selfish ideas so this is these people they're good people but at the same time they go for victory jana mark where this victory that means they will go and meet the father those who have passed away before they will meet them they will go over the earth back some people they like it so they will go over there and but not for long again and again they will take birth maybe after one year two years maybe after a few days they will come back why desire also many desires unsatisfied desires the attack will bring them down what actually we are doing everything that we do because of what desires each child because of the desire we are running here there and everywhere you have come over here to attain this under discourse designed to listen to some of the holy talks or the Indian Way how the discuss how they say desire and if you don't have the desire will never come and sometimes myself and my friend first time we're going to asama he was a communist and he said you are going to a holy place or no I never go look at a holy place good place so we decided that we will go to the our sama for some time and then I will go along with him and he was interested to go and see a factory what is there in the factory producing this and that was it but this is the thing he used my friend very close to discuss certain things but his basic design was a varieties design each child so he was hiding any good discussion any good book reading and all these things by the grace of God I was having very strong desire to go to the temple to listen to the monks Priya what the desire but the by the grace of God is a good design so it goes in this way with Triana and Krishna market they come back again and again there's a third path Hina John and our scripture never mention about it Hina means the disgusting way they were traveling and due to very very bad karma those who are killing the people unnecessarily or for the money or for name and fame these people after death did they go to the lower region of the animals birds reptiles that is called very very very low species of snake or dead bird and from there they start now whose karma Paulo will be recorded there's a again there's a beautiful stories at the earth those dogs bars animals and they are not having any karma that is accumulated whatever the Karma of the action they did for that to death birth and their burning their past Karma's that's all it will give the chance to become a human being and among the human beings also those who are intellectuals those were educated those who have the capacity to understand and to judge their work is very very important suppose an ordinary villager uneducated Interzone mistake his result and the king who is supposed to be intelligent who is supposed to be knowing everything does the same mistake punishment will be much more to the king than the others that's why in the Rig Veda we find again and again they are asking requesting the Kings be careful be careful so this is the will of course now we have become and this is a really really very very spacious very very special this life we must utilize it so this is the way it goes and the fourth one fourth one is just like our the our daughter this is built on a no connoisseur on a young young varnasrama named Coulomb Marathi naturo Mardan Dipti martyr why because I am the Brahmin I I am consciousness and for me there is nothing so that is exactly so sometimes some people they are going the traveling now the king is also traveling 40 everything is available for the ordinary people you have to go in the line and to get the ticket then only you can travel all the things are there but the King I think so these people the other daughters they are their spiritual kings they can do anything they can have anything for them no other rules are any other Karma facts but the realization he says the Battuta is free from doership and this is where we are stuck I am doing and after dreaming I wait whether people are appreciating it or not so after the song if people are not clapping the single say what happened why they are not clapping it with all day you'll be asking have you heard my song that so this is the appreciation and what is this oppression to worship I am doing I am doing I am thinking I have done this to worship is a bondage and if you don't have the tour ship you're free this much only the tour ship and not that I must do whatever the responsibilities will be given to me perfectly as best as possible the best of my capacity but after that I should say I have not done anything God give me the intellect God give me the energy God give me all this opportunity and I have done that this much the moment you do that you become a guru they're completely free so this he said that patita Onaga tongue karma Berta madam Pattie batch's this is a jota very bold statements now corona nikunj aha me et me miss chellamma t as a last the yesterday morning we were listening the Shankaracharya the five times he is telling this is my firm conviction about jota much before the Shankara he said this is my initial almaty from conviction what is disc upon conviction mine neither i perfer nor i enjoy the past present future actions does it mean that he is not working iy's he is working but there is no to worship I don't have the past action and also the future action present action no question are not doing anything so this is called the ultimate way to get the liberation the pedantic way liberation means completely getting free from the bondage of birth and death but those who enjoy the life this is not for them this is not for them and those who have understood this life is a misery in the beginning it is so sweet and then slowly slowly it becomes to the relationship and these and that so many things goes on happening and ultimately we are exhausted and we become accustomed you know when this somebody is suffering and slowly becomes accustomed it's okay we are like that we have become accustomed to this type of pain taking birth pain and suffering pain and they see because of the Karma so we can understand part of the action of this problem and it was misunderstood again for many many years thousands of years oh because of the action we are bound and we are suffering because of the Karma so don't do the color and in Hindi they say nor a Abbas nap achieve capacity but so it means the flute if it is no bamboo there is no flute and if there is no fluid nobody is going to play so not airing Abbas Nebojsa Gabbar sorry wrong thing you cannot quietly seat and say I am not doing anything your thoughts how about that your thoughts are out there so obviously we cannot control so what is the secret what is the way out do the work with great intention only you see I am NOT doing whatever the knowledge and capacity God has given to me I am doing that that's all and nothing else so this is the way one should understand and is our duty in a very beautiful way when you decree is mentioning being that they mean that the Nahum untrim channel deduction am not in a heap Antrim samurai-sama no Tabata puta probably to meet Rama Avadhuta really but it is Chanda and you people how can one learn the spiritual knowledge it says to the chanting usually we do so Bingman that they pinned a duty naina he mantra very nicely we chant the mantras my neighbor to death what is mantra whose mantra I'm not going to do that Chun dilutional nahi nahi tantrum tantrum is the action you have seen the today morning some of the devotees who are here that in the morning we chanted from the hog about Gita and also mother and then our prematurely he said and did his thunder Tantra means the action today he is doing there - action the same thing you will be doing and covering flower some system developed so that is called contra mantra and Tantra I don't do anything why because I am liberated some other stuff some Reza means they are thrilled the qualities are there one of the three qualities sector Roger and Tamil so this is called rasa this is also the rasa when it is equilibrium there is no activity and naturally I am always in that equilibrium Sutter Roger and Tama these three types of one is very calm and composed receptor the active Roger and completely opposite to the center Tama I am not having anything so I am all in the same way this is that his weight but how he learned this is question you have to learn otherwise how can you practice each and every one and sometime he must have learned how about you to learn the spiritual knowledge friends we know in the bhagavad-gita we find two ways to learn spiritual knowledge in the bhagavad-gita fourth chapter xxxiv percy sees that bt pranipatena you must learn bt bt means knowing that that what is that spiritual knowledge pranipatena pariprasnena sevaya three ways you can learn first is bony bod humble behavior is a humble behavior is not there you cannot learn that a spiritual knowledge is not possible and in the modern times the universities they're charging so much so the students they go and never care for the teachers wiebe and they are getting this salary they must come and teach so they sit like these and then not being any respect to the teachers when the teachers they come and teachers also who somehow have to that give this message and teaching then let me go no relationship the knowledge should develop with love so the mother how lovingly teaching their child father how carefully handling the child so slowly slowly here in the spiritual level also first and foremost these humbleness they will never speak loudly before the Guru they will never seat on the same level before the guinta guru they will always sit at the feet of the guru and they will never say anything unless he is apt to speak all this control I know but still I should not speak because that control so this is called that bit deeper any party in a body part means humble behavior we didn't know but at the same time is very humble then very press Nina you have to ask a question if you can't ask the proper question you won't learn the proper question this is my subject and I like to know it and I have to clarify this he's asking the question the pre-press now and then say about Shiva means the personal help should go and do something for the guru say buyer who put its entity yharnam giannina dr. Sheena then only didn't give advices from those dr. Johnny the new one of the self David only talk to you when there are stories at there and someone going to learn the Sanskrit drama and also some of the scripture the teacher saved see though I'm already all the so many students at the a whole day I'm teaching and there is no chance for you to come and join them but only one occasion when I am bathing if you sit outside the bathroom from the arrogant talkative that's the only time I'm happy and he said okay said that will be sufficient for me he went with his book and all the teacher is bathing and then he is asking the question from there he is giving the answer he is noting it down that we also they learned one approach from eg you learn without the by this way so the this is the humbleness humble behavior should be there then you have to ask the Father Christian and how can you ask our Christian if you are not already studied that if you don't know how can I ask the question and finally serve this to the teacher they do lot of things for the teachers they'll be in those days the teachers used to be inside the jungle these to collect the fakirs to try moon and then also go to the cities and collect them rise and other things but the teacher and they'll be looking after the cows will be also developing their vegetable everything only to learn for some this big anta so this is the way so the Peter says these three things are there by which you can learn another words they say that is not so much physical but it is intellectual and mental surf table on Lavater yharnam psychologically you have to be prepared what does that serve table on this truth table is a word the shunning we become they gain and again he said structure means respect the complete faith in the words of the Guru and also and the teachings of the Vedas concerta and Sirte Bala body Ganon he will only learn that paratha that produce energetic and if he is not energetic immediately I have heard something immediately I should note it then I should ponder over it then I will develop the any doubts at their next year I have to ask the question so this will that para some he attained real India's enough there are five India's orders we see there are six actually but five main because it goes and get the knowledge despite India census check show karna Nashik ax Juba and tuck this five the Ghulam color we have to control that if he cannot control you won't be able to learn so years together you have to control there is a Katya Baba I think you don't know the Katia baba is a very famous person in Bengal he went to his guru in Himalaya and guru say I don't have space inside the King rules to live inside the King to stay if you like outside the cave is so-called second guru every die if you help don't help me I didn't even ask you to come since you have come it is your problem so by that we some mom he stayed for two three days then the Guru understood know he has intention to stay ok then he gives up the and liked it and you seat by the sight of the fire and go on chanting the name of God looking at the pile but the young boy not not much food and no water somehow in the night he was spilling asleep and the moment guru was inside the cave the moment he was putting a speck on suddenly guru will write while he was sleeping only two for sleeping here come over here go away from here then again he will get up again in practice it was going on friends try to understand to realize God how much trouble the people will take then as because he goes all the time feeling sleepy another he gave a band of food wooden the guru himself made that there is a bento Guttenberg you cannot let me down and also that the pant was in that way their coping are the same so he couldn't do that so he was constantly sitting sitting and sitting on his knees and going on repeating the god and he realized God over there so this is called the Torah the Torah means activity you have to perform unless you perform then how you will achieve you read the book and then so so many people they're coming and listening to the lectures they're appreciating and they're oh I have learned so this many lectures and all that I follow this man that man he's good but how much you follow nothing and if you don't follow so what happens is a shot of another spiritual entertainment and nothing else so I heart so great speaker and so wonderfully he's told and we are all Brahmin we need not to do anything you know from one at the same time you are running for office next morning how can you do that if you have brown one if you are free at the same time you run into your office it's not going together so you have to perform something which is according to your standard and slowly slowly you have to develop yourself then only it will be beneficial otherwise not otherwise nothing so he said sir table on lava Teyana that fora some here the in Rio is a control of the senses and what happens after the spiritual knowledge what is that Rama Jana what is that issue a lava got realization what happens Jana loved wha after having acknowledged ROM shun theme and the supreme peace supreme happiness achieve in Erdogan chatty and he find that from this guru the aesthetic of DDC so if you can there then it is possible and here also we find in the Bhagavad Gita 6th chapter it says young not torture opera album one dirty adhikam Tata Young loved wah after having that operon lava greater than anything of that nominative in everything's after realization of the car oh if I could get something more no it I thought will never come a completely follow completely satisfied and that is the end of it there'll be no desire even for the higher thing of tap know if you have that desire that means you have not realized oh this will only we have to understand and then I should conclude quickly with antic teachers the givers another this example their teachings this week this is Ravana mana mythic - we are discussing how to get the spiritual knowledge so Peter gave us six ideas one three are physical and three mental or psychological so by that way only we will get their realization so it is psychologically shred table para control of the senses this we can get and here in the pedantic teaching takes a three Strabo na ma Nana Medici asana - this - Robin listening now we are listening what we have learned the karma is a great thing formula and whatever I am doing physically or mentally intellectually all are getting the result if it is good then it's good that I will travel to in the path of the Devers and that too in the booth Tirana when the Sun is traveling to the northern side and if I don't do that I will go to the the place of the mains be three local and if I do something wrong maybe that I'll be safe from the Polish and they won't be able to know that I'm doing this but that because of that garden of Allah I will go down make me be born as a animal bars all reptiles and something like that so these are the dream this is ID then we have to learn this is the struggle now we have heard it learned it and it knows then what should we do mana what should we do because we have so many responsibilities we have the family we have the other things we have to go on thinking in this way act in this way so how to develop that now here Swamiji was telling we must do everything attentively but without attachment without the to our environment like that apparently you must say otherwise people they won't understand you you must see apparently so whatever is there this mind or should not action like this that's okay but inside you must feel God has given me the intellect govern God has given me the energy to understand him to perform and I am doing because God has asked me to do that's all and there will be no anger there we know other things so slowly slowly you mind will be purified just Ravana listening mononym contemplating on that and you are developing your own course how I will travel needed there's not transforming what is the transformation complete peace and joy and happiness so many people are having so many other things I don't care I am happy this is to be so we don't have the desire at least I don't have to become the president of America so we there will be even the correct the desert there is no chance for me but anyway so if you are not having the desire to become the president of America you don't care when there will be election and who are going to help you how you will get the part and you won't feel sorry if somebody becomes a president nothing why I don't have desired same way if I don't have the desire to become these that I am satisfied God you have give me this thing I am very satisfied so who is enjoying me this is my life I should be happy I should be satisfied this is the learning Shabana Madonna knitted tea arsenal this is the very positive way to utilize the spiritual teachings but guitar trio this way is very unique what he did he learned from the nature we know 24 gurus and what those gurus he observed the activities of the different beings and things and studying those in a very unique way he discovered the drug teachings completely different way he was not having the Guru he was looking at the sky he was the oldest look at the sky and the birds and the flowers and the bees and the reptiles and the person who is making the evolution of concentrated but this is his job we must finish so he is working so hard from there he was going on learning so he was learning in his own way he was getting the knowledge he was learning the material RG nowadays they also do the same thing isn't it the meteorology or the climatology the climate they're also observing that there are some people the moment they will see that the ants are coming out in great numbers and running here and there immediately they will understand something is going to happen in this place maybe an earthquake or maybe the volcanic eruption so immediately how observing the nation and understanding that it is possible so the turtle did the same thing not something that it is not possible it is possible there are people so they will be looking at the sky and the condition of the flowers didn't say pre-screened ring how it was possible to study that this from the experiences I have seen in India some people they judged from looking at the from the top to say if you dig God here you can find the drinking water no machine they would only go and really very poor illiterate person they will go and they would sit over the loop and maybe that they are looking at the glasses and the wheel itself and from there you see if you are digging over here you get the water how they can do that the total learned in that way that that we observed and then he learned and that he developed in his own life what is those things if you are having possessing something all will chase you and if you are not possessing anything you agree nobody will chase you free so that is what the doctor Tracy and then he said that we were maybe they should have this in the second chapter at the avadhuta gita that we are studying he said one should not consider the quality of scholarship of the guru but a true spiritual seeker should recognize on his spirituality the essence that he says i will tell you this show me Swami Vivekananda you know he was a great great orator divine knowledge and he's very close friend these two study in the same school when they are young this Swami Ramananda t-that of the second one from it Ramananda and his son Brahmin analogy he was a person exactly opposite to Vivekananda he never liked to talk he had speeches no person interval but he'll be sitting like that constantly and not talking with the people people never understand that he may be the Guru Swami we began the saint here is a person with more higher in spirituality than all of us he should be the president he should become the Guru Brahman and the G so the top three are when he sees we can understand it doesn't mean that guru is a very good speaker a good writer great organizer and then only he'll be good not like that good is the person who has transformed all this spiritual knowledge in his own personal life and that is the Abarth Kahuna not to change the new gray hub varam guna bata Kalu sada Eva on the only sadhus are the essence what is the essence spiritual essence what is the spiritual essence love and unselfishness only love and unselfishness is the essence of the whole spirituality Raghavan's ramakrishna when he was the year there was a great speaker even didn't the Queen Victoria invited him gave him a lot of respect and he used to speak so firing with intention way thousands of people just to follow him and he came to Salaam o Krishna they have out on the Gordon and sedan busines little stammering only village Bengali and sometimes used to say thank you that is the only English word he knew so he would say thank you and that was but that great soul and also be waken under the whole came at his feet so this is when the auto dimension we can understand yes when you have to choose a guru this must be the quality then only we should choose the good thank you frames will continue with the auto Tokita in the next classes the adult another unique way is giving us the instructions let us conclude by chanting this mantra young buna in the - nandi DP stubby be the song but the drama Upanishad a guy Andy Young Saeng God that did the neenah menasha question tianyu you know yes young Tommy do Sudha Sudha gonna devour the Samina ma boo Chandi Shawn DS chandi early [Music]
