today we will witness we can say mentally the fast arranged marriage the human society in the whole world as a unique the description that has been given over here but can close your eyes and transport yourself to the naimisharanya where all the Rishi's have assembled and they are listening to that suitor the great exponent grace Fraga who dress rava he was eager to listen that's why his name was saba listening who girl he was eager so he was that person who memorized everything the conversation between the king pariksit and the great sage sugar and we were continuously studying reading and pondering over the beautiful teaching here we know that the Supreme God he created the Brahma out of himself giving the knowledge all the four Vedas and then this Brahma he gave him also the materials and hug him now you create so Brahma you are supposed to create now these people they were very much eager to listen to what happened actually how Brahma started work the creation so they are asking the DOE Marshall the suitor can you please tell me and the suitor now what he heard from sukadeva the sukadeva again was narrating the conversation between the medulla and the white tree if you can't remember these names no problem but these are the great people of the ancient Indian now the Vidura we know is a very famous personality in Mahabharata Mike there was a great rishi and material listened all these things and he witnessed this miter he was giving the reply to the medulla and whatever he said that was hard by our Vasudeva recorded and then he told to his son sukadeva and the sugar dealer when he was narrating to that king who was waiting for the death rate British shield and there this hour he was also present who grassed Abba know who Graceffa is taking what has happened now we have heard in the conclusion of our last discussion how that supreme god from one from his one he created many why because of the desire eco non-pom on Nietzsche and Nietzsche means the desire that is the creation and the creation explained in the position of a way because the main supreme god is Vishnu and the followers are known as the british nervous and here this bhagavata is the scripture of the bush numbers of course is the scripture of the hindus but the main leader main source of the book for the believers and who is the supreme court the bishop and what the Vishnu did that the Supreme God is not the - even before that eco one non attempt to become many unbeaten Maya through the supreme power Maya bath frigid Rita he then divided himself in three what is that one is divine another human and this voters are the motors all these things that we see now this is very important to note that we the human being and nothing but the bottom person of the Supreme God who divided himself as a divine the neighbors and also the human and also all this material theme that we know the creation began and in this my Germany is telling the Supreme God created the brandsmart a for face at one Brahma the for face at white for face because of the knowledge what is the knowledge Eric champion you Iturbide this has the big total Zubaydah in the four parts so for phase and from the fourth phase he was going on telling this Vader with that knowledge he was creating in the third book through the Iskander 12th chapter 37 verse with the reply of Sri Maitreya Moonie he said Rika Yahoo sama Iturbide I can be done good body the increasing now East the news as we say any W is the similarly the north east west and south all the teachers all these things was covered by the Vedas with the knowledge so the food phase most of us we are are not accustomed to see the image or the picture of Brahma is only in pushkar the Brahma is having a temple the most of the people they go and bathe in ishka and only one temple of the Brahma and there's a story in all that this Brahma is only over there so you don't know Hindus they don't know about the Brahma but for face and red color and Wow because he is constantly working so that's why the Roger and for face this gunas and he was going on telling Rick Sam heughan Iturbide from east west north and south faces and then the functions of the priests the whole drill chapter and the top of the third book is going on giving the description how all these things brahma was going on creating creating and creating using his full face Brahma created I will Veda now I just quoted a little portion of it why why from this knowledge came this I'll read the knowledge of Medicine there are so many doctors then where from this knowledge came from that Brahma he created the first knowledge of the medicine do not be the weaponary and also art and culture by the ceremonies and Gonzaga Veda the Nevada Ayurveda and stop it together and also the architectural knowledge all that came now why it is the very food so many things he created but these are the very unique way they are explaining this knowledge gate also coming from the God and the in that 41 verse he says be Tia Donham the certain Dharma UT Pathan teacher awesome um stir guitar song Qian ostrich aha with TB now he is giving this knowledge first is spiritual knowledge and then people are mean so many people's are here so they also need to support themselves how they will support them so so many different type of knowledge ease the medicinal veterinary our culture then this architectural technologist all these things he has given then he is giving the Vidya the food parts of Dharma means we did they are learning what is the Dharma there is full parts of Dharma also everything four four four because four phases so he is going on giving first is the video learning second is Donham charity then was charity and truthfulness Satya these are the four media donna tapa certain see immediately after the vidya dumpster done why please remember when the Brahma is creating this particular knowledge he never wanted any money when we are talking you may feel this person's going to organize in September some fundraising so he's talking over to Dan no not like that here the Donna link in the pre where why this Donna Donna means whatever I have armed I am ready to give without expecting anything it's not so easy is very very difficult very difficult you have armed you have collected now you are sharing it with someone whom you don't know and we don't expecting anything so that is very divine one who can do that surely the rising in the ladder of spirituality that's why again Donna Donna and how you will develop that capacity because of the knowledge what is that knowledge I am from man I am God myself God created me and the part and personal of God only found by some ignorance I will come up there's no problem the one gentleman came so he's suffering in Lord but I liked his enthusiasm he is using and that to walk it is so difficult in Alderson you can see from his the feature that he suffering but he said no problem framesi had alright within few days he'll come and join in the volunteer force I really liked it I do not know what the faith but he was so confident I am going to overcome now in this life also we are suffering in this world we are bound so many desires are there but when you go and stand before the God and say no problem I am going to solve it all my desires I will give up I am going to be free I'm going to come back to you God how it comes because of the knowledge so this is called be there immediately up to the beat there comes Dhanam what we are giving my ego whatever those things are there the devil as my ego I have a very good car I have a very good house I have a very good job I have a good position in the society all actually Fanning the ego and that I am giving up how can I keep that I always give that offer to the God at the feet of God economists to that's all the intellect that he was given to me go god it is you sasses that you have given to me oh god it is you so when we are going on thinking in that way there will be no ego within us so that is called Dhanam then tapa butts just thinking on - you need a lot of practices your mind will go and you have to withdraw some people you could find that they are criticizing you and you can retaliate back immediately but you say no I am NOT going to do that you are controlling yourself immediately nowadays it is so easy immediately you just text and then thousand people will know it and if you're famous there immediately the media also take up and even retaliating for everything anywhere anyone is doing immediately your eternity now that is not that so the top of the control and that's certain what is this Saturday's truthfulness that truthfulness I know what is my condition what is my position so why should I behave like this so this is okay for me and the moment is that sucked here you can't practice your mind will be tranquil and these are the Dharma UT but are mature these are the steps so the four steps he first gave then practice of the continents a thermistor guitar sangkum a switcher cerebral tve so for a streamers the customers what at the hostel position so they have made the fourth division in Europe or in our human life and they call it a steamer as because you are residing in that particular condition so Austria you are having that condition so a Strama there's a for gram Acharya studentship goddess family life vanaprastha return life and sannyasa renounce in life the life of renouncers now again in the bond brahmacharya we know the brahmacharya countenance but here it says there are four different types of Brahma Jerry I thought it is interesting to know the one is so Victor saw Victor it is only to practice for three days or four days sometimes some people they will go to some temple so they will restrain they won't eat the food that the love they won't sleep on the bed Hector love and they won't wear those dresses that they love and they'll all sacrifice and the control their mind no other thought except God and three days will continue there in India in every different places things are going on in that way they are carrying the holy water and then going to some temple everywhere in India the practice and all those days are supposed to be destroying their brahmacari but anyway nowadays everybody is angry so any little thing they will be immediately breaking and all these things are coming so these very mature ins they are creating problem nowadays but homogenous sub the strain whatever happening no reaction this from a sub trust is only for three days and sometimes the brahmanas is the twice-born if we are having the otaku bit and they had that saboteur second is Prajapati they will observe for the whole one year 365 days I am going to control that is the top of practice and continuously deliver the third is Brahma the Brahma means observing till the end of the study so from the very beginning of the study till the end after I became a doctor or an engineer or a professional till I complete my study and go into the job or start earning I am going to maintain this discipline and that is called Brahma and Bri Hut tests for the holy life there's a whole life even the premature Nia is also having this fall but the 3-4 days short period then for one year then for a long time till I complete my study and go into the next ass rama that is garça I will maintain this and then comprehend this whole life and the householder there are four different types of householders they're also living in the houses they are also maintaining their families but how they are maintaining there are four types one is part of you did not do you remember this just idea the bathtub they are actually agriculturist and also working in the industry or developing all this economic that we see and my dad way they are surviving is called Berta this is the main structure of the society second calm Sanjaya and this Sanjaya through teaching our bristly hood the teachers professors whatever they learn now they're selling that knowledge utilizing that knowledge and they're earning that is called that particular professions called sanchez lincoln charlene charlene means livelihood without begging many different type of livelihood but no biggie so that is called charlene and see don't cha the Sullinger usually the moms they to practice with all the patties if they cut down and take away the small small grains here and there that would be on the field they go and collect it and on that day survive like the birds the birds will also go to the field when all the the grains they have taken away but still some things will be there scattered all over they will go and collect that is the ultimate livelihood of the householders but these people usually in the household who are going and collecting and surviving they cannot be considered as a good to sit householder the first is the best part are and also the second son jail then Barnum Krista there are four different types of bone a pristine retired people and for different types what is that one is Buchanan's cleaving whatever the gate on that that's Galvan a pristine the model ballot process there is a totally different they are returned but they have their own this is necessary because of the society industries the society was different whoever is there inside the jungle all the prehistory is this to go and give them the food and not many other things because the bond of prestige they will leave all hearth and home and go inside the jungle and secluded these people is to help them still there are some systems are there if you go to track on there there you will find small small cottages this is maintained by some of the trust and if you just go to the office and say I want to stay over here to see ok no problem they will alert you one small cottage you have to clean it you have to steal but there nothing is there just flow or you do and then you have to go and collect food there are some places are there these people call chapter this chattri they are giving their dolls the health all these people go collect their food and calm and stay there you need not to be anything just practice spirituality so that is also at the air but now in the old times this to say bike honest way Conners means leading on whatever they get then Bala Quila they would accumulate anything and they will go stress their two palms and whatever you give they eat over there and worried must think survive under very difficult life and they will never even carry the water most of the models that we can in their drinking water and that also the own carry if they give the water is good if they don't get they will survive in that so that is the difficult garlic pain after the retirement then Oberer Odom bother me he will get up in the morning and after practice practicing spiritual law all the disciplines then he will come out of the cottage and look to any direction his mind wants to go he will go and he continue going till he finds some fruits for some food for you how many of you are ready the last one I didn't say these are very comfortable all the doctors nurses medicine then this is our voltage home and we are now they were staying in the old-age home being a huge sum of money and they'll say now we are in panic president this is vanaprastha with not a single burner anywhere and but anyway this is not possible in the modern time it is mentally we should do it's not that we have to get up and go any direction if we find the food or not we'll continue continue if you like to eat you have to continue to collect the food and the final one called Fianna fáil not these three numbers they will go and see if the fruit has fallen that they will correct anything otherwise they won't eat anything they all take help from others and don't be encouraged with all these things it is not to be practiced not nowadays it's very difficult so majority of the forest that you see there is no the fruit bearing trees so you won't get this so don't don't make this mess Eruptor to solve the people of their emotions so I again and again until these are the stages in those days the people dip good because the lifestyle was completely different from the beginning itself they were so controlled so they could do now comes the four different types of Sonia now here you know the first thing the same turbine press the four steps of this life that is learning charity austerity and truthfulness then comes a sermon in the autumn again for vanaprastha god ray bram acharya then goddess the bonnet Presta the last Ostrom is called sannyasa austin now we need grow now the young people they don't bother about the philosophy bother about God only the parents they will be guiding them no no this is good from their experience they will be guiding them the children please come please sit please listen please do please dad so that is you know yesterday one young boy came his mother was telling see this is a great Rami my guru go and touch his feet he said you can't touch it is your guru then the father told the no you should also go then he looked a father and mother and he could understand there is okay if I go and touch his feet then whole problem will be solved he came touched my feet and sat on that wheelchair and then started rooting he was enjoying sitting over there this is the nature when the young never care for anything all his cute ears so they take up different type of things that we cannot think of why because of the knowledge because of the experience so this is the reason this is a one time but afterwards that young boy will be matured and he will say to his son go and touch the field of the holy person again the same thing goes on so the brahmacarya grhastha vanaprastha is totally we draw mine in this country I find so many people will the people learn it people they could leave their life in totally different way but really really they are leaving one apostolate they'll be going to different temple they'll be attending different discourses they'll be reading so much your books and that way that is the bond approach to life they are didi sometimes they will say our children are coming to visitors all we are going to visit our children and majority of the time the practice days this is the third stage practice and getting ready for sannyasa but many other countries that are visited they can't think of it each and everyone is working toward something like that the survival here because of that Laxmi this we should utilize this situation issue utilize and utilize this wonderful place and then finally the Sonia what type of sannyasa one is a teacher girl they leave in one place and practice the spiritual discipline this called ichika selamat each dimension could teach a can borobudur then Emily's father hold up and sometimes Abajo Boadicea beholder Boadicea means water and the man who is travelling to different places and drinking the water from different sources is pehota that means he is traveling sannyasin but in one place only practicing spirituality not going to any one or any place and in the other moves in different places they are mainly dedicated to knowledge to teach others are mainly dedicated to define type of rituals so they have a God are denoting they will get up they have to offer food to God say they cannot move who else is there to take up that we have to attend to that so that way is all the time they are attending the temple or the shrine or their God and biology that is they constantly practice knowledge and not so much bound by the ritualistic thing so they go to different places to collect knowledge third is hamsa this hamsa established in the practice of Guiana second one he is searching for knowledge third one convinced about the knowledge that is called himself why hamsa Swan what is that Swan they are actually leaving even if they go to that water water cannot wait their body did this come up and then there's no water in the body so the lumps this hamsa swans are like that they have the pure knowledge what is that knowledge I am pure and I am Brahman doing this moment living in this body that is hamsa and the fourth one is called this Kriya this mystery I will never do anything that is one who has realized the Hartman and goes beyond our duties and responsibilities goes beyond the duties and responsibilities they won't do anything sometimes we feel like that why these people are not doing actually they don't feel like are you like that doing why because they see everything that is going on for the betterment of those people suffering our enjoyment you think they can see when you go and see it and observe a theater a movie so many people some are suffering some are enjoying summer drink these some are doing that we are not affected where the movie is over the theater is over we come out and that's all why because we know all these things that are going on are actually very very temporary they're just showing to us singing we wait we look at this world and we see that things are happening all the slowly small little child is coming maybe one month old please play same the baby and we are blessing and then five months please put the first rice and okay they're slowly growing up going to the school thinking now we know what is going to happen to him he will be like these days thinking whether it will be successful or not that this moment we cannot see but we know the life will go like this and so we are not that we afraid or drink anything it will automatically to eat Ector and similarly these nish peers they're completely withdrawn so these are the four now Brahman was going on greeting and forming the systems as Rama and the Satya all this creation is Brahma but the problem the God extinct to make the whole world populated Brahman into that brother created psaltery she's the great receives nine very powerful regimes but the moment Alicia's were created they went and sat for meditation because they don't know we can see this world is temporary much woody unnecessarily waste our time in this I am NOT going to do that you know the Middle East they have the system as long as you were working under some company or the contract you are free you can do anything you can purchase a house the plot of land and the car and all those things enjoy but the deal your job is over contract is over within one month we have to leave so no one there working for coming from outside don't purchase any house because that is a problem and all are all people they know that their contract job contract is over they bring to sell the house I wanna purchase almost you have to give in a meadow nation so they don't purchase the house but they're in a rented condos big wonderful controls are there tell me they they'll purchase a big nice car and the moment they understand they will sell it or they will take on the least like the tractor why the local people they are constantly searching for construction these now behind our house because they are there and if you feel that in this world I am completely temporary if you can constantly remember mona Charen eg Nikita knee some sort of initial petition vision Ramu cannot currently as a famous song that death Mirinda nada were from him awakened the sand before sea Ramakrishna oh my mind this old world is complete emperor you come to visit this place so don't be entangled with all this let us go back to some people they went to visit some country there was a flood the local people are thinking how to save the property and the visitors they were going on contacting their own M ambassadors go back let us go back they don't bother about other thing someone if we can go back to our own place we are safe in this world also the spiritual people they always thing I have come over here as a visitor now I am in Temple I have lost my passport somehow able to get back that pass wouldn't go they had to my own aboard and that is gone miss clear the sannyas of the last stage is that this fear now I am NOT going to stay here the brahmana he created the Rishi's and he created his own mind God born sons and they are very famous their names are sonic sananda sanatana sanat-kumara these are the four sons they the senior goddess sonic and they are known as kumaras many of the times in the bhagavata find the kumaras very powerful spiritually and they started without their knowledge helping the God for different type of Incan incarnations and divine games this sunup sananda sanatana and sanat-kumara now brahma after all this creation he created the vedas he created this Rishi's and his own children but no one was listening to him in one day he was lamenting how or Putin either me happy to see apne tada no he he don t bridge on unum deum ACTRA big article he slinging this is really surprising but brutal this is surprising I the Brahma constantly trying to expand the creation bar the number of offspring the bridge are are not increasing his Providence de bomb against me big article sometimes when you try and not successful you say oh the Providence the day ba is not in favor and he's also thinking in that way what will happen to me I am trying so much but look at this my children Sonic Salon de ferrol and they they call achillea there all this the children they are not attached to anything it tremendous spiritual knowledge but they are not listening to when the braum are told you have to go and develop the progeny what is that father we don't bother about that and the Rishi's the moment they were created they gave me food ran away from Rama because they knew that he is going to hurt them something to do but they don't like to do so they will go away in the knowing we were very young Rama journeys in volute North we knew that one of our trustees we never even see a prematurely I used to study a lot but at the same time after that a lot of work also used to do but the moment you see that we are walking or sitting by the side of the Ganga you would run hey we were not in any doing anything come to my operation do this so this is if we saw that he is coming we knew that he must be incurring to collect some working hands so which to hide ourselves do to go away so like that the Swami who was supposed to come for here to give the top on 26th of August and do we booked to all the whole etc and we were the friends and he was the main the moment you will see it trustee used to sit a trustee trustee little height little high now he himself became a trustee and also the assistant secretary then I one day when I was talking with him before I turn now you read trustee and also assistant secretary then how you were hiding yourself and I go and see in the mirror and then I come out from there like I am hiding from myself the girls just joking so that way the sad that he passed away and we had to cancel the program so anyway this is the wheel we need but the Brahma he was going to do his created being Rishi's knows and knows it is not possible for us and even go and meditate everybody is meditating and Brahma the implementing and thinking there must be something wrong in me that's why that God is not helping when he was thinking in that way what happened you know that is the supreme being and working to the grecian three being an app's need for the creation and I have not been able whatever he has given I have utilized that haven't make the whole thing ready but there is only will be somebody should be leaving and created this beautiful house AC everything is ready but there is no one to leave what will happen to me and Brahma is afraid with the Supreme Being he will punish him so what to do when he was thinking in that way a very special thing happened tada that time Tasya this Brahmin Brahma Kavya is not cursing god commies Brahma so the SIA Kashia Ruben his figure odd wouldn't Drita yet Khayyam of each other they have broken those so that you can understand Dada at that time he's mr. Boddy Ruben got it I get 3 ha in two pieces into power higher innocence critical tire what is it tire why this name what kaya has come love giving all this information so many varieties those are interesting they can read the one over there and mainly there are some of the very waters giving the footnotes kaya because horn is Brahma and from the call this body has come whose body in the 53rd verse once again it takes us to the syndrome direction of the Hinduism 1 become meaning and the 53rd verse of that third scandal parts for book and it says Brahma divided himself into two parts one man and the other part become a woman with deformed man and woman the form came they needed the name cause without the name we cannot identify what will happen it says yes to Tantra come on so a boot Manu star moves her art and sitting in stria RC shuttle rupa her name became shuttle Rupa Alka Manisha Mahatma na 53rd verse he says like this that D now the same stories there in all other religions also the God created a man and the woman the man was named what in the vital Adam but God created him man in Hindu now what is his name so I am woman on the field alone but all they know about Adam and he are Adam and in the Islamic the conception Adam in haha because they are from the same locality so Adam is the common name for the boys so Adam and in the Islamic tradition it is hawa and they happy but here in Indian tradition rezaian boomer knew his name is shyamu and then manu and at the same time his the second part shuttle rupa God in the Christian tradition of the Islamic tradition we don't give the clear understanding well form God created how the world God created the man and woman here very clearly we find the Brahma his making his to part even the tradition of the sky writes he will find in the Bombay if you go elephant a cave there is that same wonderful image so do some of the the invaders they tried to break the Z major are Denari shuara Arta nari issue the hard part is mal another part is a female so there is no difference between man and woman they both are same both are created from the holy body of the Brahma yes to dr.panchabhootham Onew cyan blue answer are what the Sirat means inborn knowledge because for the creation and the maintenance because that he will be the first king of the whole world so obviously he means knowledge and there is no time to give you knowledge we will be there to teach him so sir art he became his own teacher is and then his wife is Satoru power she heading upon these the SONA curve now he remember the SONA kalasa forgotten and sure the SONA curve the Rishi the who was actually spearheading the lot of Rishi's they were listened to in the Navy Chirag Nia they were listening to that soup Souta what is going on typical very much curious now previously they were asking what Brahma is doing how he is creating the ring they came to know the Brahma has created the to one man and one immediately they are asking what Manos I am booty to bring out into manifestation of all the jeevers now the first creation is the samba manu and satrupa and the suitor then quoted Sri Maitreya my cleaner the Rishi who was having the conversation with Mathura so it is not possible for many of you to remember those names because it goes in an advanced stitcher and traditional way because the stories of the stories but anyway the bhatoora the wonderful character of mahabharata and my trio of the bhagavata we find when my trail was very knowledgeable person so Pedro is asking what happened and now these Rishi's they are trying to listen it wrong the suitor and suit is narrating so this story coming down to us and Sutra is coating the Vidura yoga SWA bar Jaya so Arjuna with his own wife Sartain Giotto Scion go manu primarily relative read that one Edom of our shuttle a large of the means he said portion of our shooter he addressed to whom be the kerubim these are the very wonderful words this as theta one is used the dimension Brahma now he said be the durable and sometimes chatter mu come to same person so this be the double means full of northern with immense knowledge the full of knowledge who the brahmana what he did after being born as a man and the woman both of them the wind and the bow down to the Creator that is the fast teaching humble and that great humbleness this deer in the man and the woman they winked to the creator and sealed Tomica sulphate are now generally Britta da vida you are the creator and the nourisher of all being I'm not forgetting that River Sorata the world he was already having all knowledge he knew what was his duty and what is his responsibility and how much power he is possessing everything in you but still he is going to his father and that father is Rama from where they came and moving down and telling he was the creator and the nourisher of all beings you are the father yet what ways could your children serve you and that is the first time now in the whole creation process the old man Brahma was so happy this the first time he laughed and he will express his joy and meaning the better Pasha is giving the expression in many smokers Brahma was so happy the people should get children like you you are so powerful so knowledgeable and everything that you are having still he was so humble that you are coming to me the Father let each and every one get this type of children so the parents it is so happy when the children are coming you can imagine at the Brahma all children should be like you Josiah both of the Roopa you go and give birth to many children like you and help in the creation of the Supreme Being this is but service you can do to me and then he said the inner controller of all also be pleased with you the inner controller of all Brahma he is also created who created someone else and that completely new born adjourned Oh Jimmy's never born one whom these people the vegetables they called Vishnu and the be daunting the car what brahmana this not Brahma as Brahman the all consciousness this he said Papa Rishi Keyshia oh no - shitty even that God he'll be very happy you are helping him to spread this message what was that particular mission to make the progeny so there now if you look at different countries they are bringing some of the people from different places and giving them the land why because they have so much of land and no population that means some those places should be populated otherwise lot of trees and snow and mountain what we are going to do it that we need some people we need some population so they are bringing so they are getting that and slowly slowly if you go to those places then there will be don't cut the trees and all that now it's full of tree these people go and cut the tree and stir started the cities again the demand will come no treason isn't so if this goes in circle here also be fine yeah now meditating of the Supreme Being the shyamu manu and satrupa they gave birth to five children two sons and three daughters they became known as priyavrata put down a bother these are the two sons of the Samba Manu and our booty is the daughter diva booty the second daughter and prasuti the third daughter now the daughters grew up and as the parents they always think particularly in the eastern countries all arranged marriage so naturally this is the responsibility of the parents to go and find good match a husband for the daughter the same ways I am new and subtle Rupa they started travelling different places and this time they were taking their second daughter devotee to find out a good match a husband and where they were going to all the hostels why than astronauts because these people were highly educated people they will not reach but educated people and who was the same the lord of the whole universe he was having lot of money so it was not follow problem for him to give some property and the money to his their son-in-law so he went down and he was searching the meantime what happened to know all these dishes there was so much charged with the other denunciation none of them were men ultimately Lord Vishnu had to come the matchmaker what to do the poor man he wants to see the whole world filled up people now him which you must be very happy so much population this Fishman he came to one Rishi his name was cardem and he told karna you must obey me curtam says the eva my lord he please tell what I have to you have to marry curtain almost choked Manny why this order why you are asking me to marry now this is my wish and he said day after tomorrow the two are coming to visit you with their daughter they're great people and the way I am NOT giving you the whole description the way the Lord Vishnu was describing to impress that you are going to be related with a great family this rainbow is a great person he's the king of the whole world and under all this things Chateau Koopa you cannot imagine and then their daughter table what is so wonderful beauty you will never find this type of dog for you so many curtain tour okay when the curtain told in the healer Cardinal said I have one condition what is that condition after when I have some children when they were with you will be satisfied then please you have to allow me to go back once again for meditative life can you imagine and that's who I am Sami become the same we are the descendants of the Rishi's and these are the great people not for the physical pleasure but only to perform the duties of a householder so that Putra so this they came and
