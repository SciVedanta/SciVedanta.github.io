it is being Shanta would you go Shannon but Amana sudeesh be shod Adams [Music] governess attrition me governor shuhang [Music] Lakshmi calm down c'mon IANA you give me the on Adhamiya bundy bish [Music] sorrowful ho quicker the devotees friends happy Navratri from today as a series of nine nine nine days the Hindus they will worship the power of the Lord that is the God but someone rang me and told why there is no class of Santa karo on the Santa Santa actually this is the class that's a bhagavata is a 3ds is going on and it is for the liberation and right this moment we are studying in bhagavata that is about Auto gita complete philosophy - Safiya be done but they remember that every Sunday there should be some Takara method good that is nothing wrong that this vibration some taqaddum is not happening it will happen today it covers because previously we were having some other programs and our banquet and next Sunday it was first one Sunday for banquet Knicks and a retreat and all those things Shanta karim today and this the beginning is because it is a Navaratri i was thinking to discuss with you see that Navaratri that der god resolves around Shiva so we will study this first Navaratri and the very auspicious days because yesterday we observe victory function so these are all in the right ideas at the last day of the dark nights and now that is completely pop shell that is the picture the time of the mains so other ancestors so the Hindus will go river because river is a flowing so that is the symbol of the line that constantly flowing and again they will take little water and pour it in the water itself the river itself and they'll be beautifully will be chanting the mantra under the guidance of the pure ears so if you read this mantra you will understand the philosophy and the psychology of the Hindus what is the philosophy that broadness universality how it is I will just quote from the Tarpon a mantra purpura means the offering that one means offering and when we are offering what actually you are thinking that comes out in the form of they call mantra but eat the poo routine are the millions of the power Flyers the in the beliefs that they born again and again so a Teta hula Cortina Kula means family this one we think that this only the company know the millions of family we have already had and they were in the past ot tabula goatee nam sucked to the universe in arms up the deeper deeper means that this island and previously the olden days days to think and the whole world is having seven islands so naturally separated by the water the seven islands a softer deeper the whole world not only India sucked to deepen Abbasi Nam to all over the world those who are dear bondable those who are friendly among the worst chamber those were not friendly no unknown mandawa around ever the known and unknown e1 Rajan mone bang Guevara and my previous birth those who wear my friends on no Germany banda baja the cripton Aquila me on to let they be completely satisfied the triptan Aquila column is completely let them be happy look at it when we are offering they are not telling that mean we have the own please bless me so that I that I will be happy no they are not praying in that way for my ancestors whoever they're please dress me so the I should be happy I should prosper no they are not playing like that this is the beauty of the Hinduism this broadness if it goes away there will even remain knowing realism then this the Hindu should understand otherwise it will be and sectarian we are moving the life and that never brings the happiness and cannot generate happiness - for the others say they see each of a smart - you Kanchana ha the those who are asking for these poverty I don't know millions and millions of previous verse that I was having the families I remember them and secondly not only here subsidy ponyville asana because we believe we may bought here there everywhere in different lives we do not know where we were born not that every time we'll be in India only not every time in America it may be anywhere so wherever subsidy pas de gar√ßa naam then there may be friends there will be known unknown people bond about a bond the worst era 1 million money won the bar and those who every close to me in my previous births they trip Tim McCullough began to eat you're smart - you Kanchana so Tim be completely satisfied let them be happy that is my prayer and I'll offer to them so this is the great way they always pray I do not know those who go I mean India almost all the rivers yesterday it was completely full there was no place so many millions of people that be going and offering know whether they understand the meaning of the mantra or not of course because of the pressure so many people those who are performing there they had no time to analyze this mantra also to tell them the meaning of the mantras is because in suspect most of the people don't understand and there again they say Maya 13 - inna the water that I am giving tip unto one trium the second line it was only for the world softer deeper old world now he says circa Martha and potala this tree this tree wherever whoever is there in the struggle mainly the gods the celestial beings those who have done good work so they devotee this world will we know and then the Potala those who have done very bad work Helius people so they go over there and suffer but team also here breathe this is the real in the mind so our promised Ahmedabad gentle tip on - ah Brahma stumble Brahman is the firstborn come on so there's a firstborn and then stumble a clump of grass waiting order eating so all these in between the waiver whatever is there let them be happy so prayer for the happiness prayer for the peace prayer for the progress if I elongate peace happiness progress is it possible all other people are crying all other people are hungry and I'm the only satisfied it cannot be so we have to understand these we have to make everyone progress and exactly opposite we do why because we do not have to understand they are happy means I am also happy if they are not happy I cannot enjoy my happiness even so this step all the time they say this world mark the path Allah and then comes immediately after that yesterday it was that upon us they were remembering and nowadays people are having that smartphone and any occasion we'll be sending happy it's our pond of the anarchic way I am not dead yet so what only those who are dead then you can send a happiness the Toki I don't have the river nearby and even the American River they don't allow to go down and do that our planet is very cold also okay through smartphone you are sending them something that is also okay but those who not to me but in exchanging each other happy this is the problem it comes with unless we know the meaning and the significance of it but it's not their fault in our fault it is our fault we didn't tell them we didn't explain them so josh is a machine they follow all the systems of the society they are following the system to to society as because not name the meaning the significance of it that dream but of no reserve so this we say and then come immediately after that when the dirt is over past is over ancestors are over we come for the present and that begins with 9/9 novel lottery this number are three you know the story begins with the city the city that story most of you know and some of the children's books are there that gives the beautiful with the picture of the stories this is the pure honest stories but that was also having the Piranha is not all imaginary piranhas are also have truth and with the truth they make that word is a nice way it becomes piranha so in that story they say Prajapati Daksha duck shadi again you know it was the he was performing dreamed sacrifice and that was destroyed by the Shiva's followers and why because Daksha Prajapati she was the great protector of the beam Prajapati he was the master of the beams the priority there are many break abilities one of the projected ease is duck chef and his daughter was sati and City one day she went to bathe in the Ganga and sewed up in the other side one person is bathing the white like snow Sheba the Sheba was crazy and some person and should he decided to marry him but Shiva was not having any much that's called the property in the kingdom nothing was there he was just a mendicant but he was having with a lot of followers and what those followers just like him those who are not having any status in the society poor in later a downtrodden all these to follow Sheba okay I am also wondering you also follow me no problem on me so you can understand a group of two step of people how the father who is a king not only the king he is the supreme King Prajapati can say okay you marry my daughter and then is very beloved daughter sati was she used to love us so much he became angry he started criticizing Shiva and organised a program without inviting the Shiva but should he merit in those days that was the system if the girl wanted and she can maybe she won't see this is my condition I don't know what I will feed you I don't know where I will keep you but still if you like to you can come no problem so they became married and shut he came to visit her and there she heard everybody stood aside and Sheba are all other gods and goddesses they are also sitting there and father in that assembly in a very strong term she was criticizing it is very difficult for Assateague so that term is sati and in India this is the greater the why completely devoted to the husband called sati the thirty means remembering that Satya it's not that sometimes in between in the society some bad system came and they told if the husband is dead you know all ignorance a husband is dead and he used to cook for the husband used to serve the husband who will do that when he's in the heaven you also go along with him so this is to put our on the pyre also sati da that is the wrong thing a little bit of those things people then started Leo the great no no no nothing is there no system was there and some people they started as a bad system now almost nothing is there now this city she burned herself killed herself because she was listening there too much and she was thinking what to do I cannot go and tell my father the children are not supposed to go and oppose the father because of the respect at the same time bearing all the criticism that they are having for my husband that is also Imperial so what she could do she burnt herself in that fire the fire turtle so that was the shotty then after that what happened but she was in great love for the Shiba how she can be separated so he took birth again in the house of another king who was Himalaya the king of the mountains he mother he was the deer Shetty was born and she was named as Shayla put three Shayla means the mountain put three means the daughter Shayla put three so she became the Shimla poetry and in the Hindus how they worship particularly this Navaratri the Gujarati people any Indian all Hindus the observe all this but some of the groups some places especially do it and in that way they develop the culture also they develop the economy also like the Bengalis very fond of Durga Puja number three is there but they are not that way interested in Navaratri but they are very much interested in to God which already but they with regard they'll be driving for three hours four hours to at least and so one day they will go over there and that develops the culture when their the big Ali's they'll be songs that we dances they'll be dramas and they will prepare it for the months together and feast don't talk about that so what your food they eat and the traces good very tasty food I like that and and not only that they'll be the traces they'll be exchanging the gifts and the children when we were all small children we used to get gift from everyone uncle on these there's so many people then used to go and count how many we have got or five parents and six yards and like that so like this we used to have that every children they were going very proudly they will tell their friends you know how many sustained roosters and when she is already is going to wear or nobody knows and like that exchanging the dresses and clothes culture is developing economies developing and by that way this puja in Bengal Durga Puja and if you go to Gujarat number are three every night we will worship one goddess now where are three every night even and in the center they will put that goddess and they will dance all around the correct undi the condi the two small small pieces of wood the beautiful sound beautiful song beautiful rhythm you will feel like joining that if you have the capacity of course if you are having the pain in the knee don't try because they will be dancing all around them like this the beautifully our culture they develop food also and economic so he thinks this Navaratri that way and the first is Sri LaHood three and say laputan is daughter and / TC pro to Mathura god Tommy they knew the shayla fruit trees the Durga so the preneur mantra they see retama durga plongee he was the first durga bubble soccer sorry Neil Hindus they are having the festivity but at the same time they know why we are doing it what is that power Zara these world that this is nothing but like emotion the ocean we have to cross so what is the ocean ocean of this life and death life and death life ended every time we are taking birth and every time the time and we do not know what type of karma whatever what we are doing whatever thoughts we are thinking and effects are like these is also like this oh my mother please take us from here to the other Shore when's the mother show that is the spiritual ultimate so they say procurement due regard to Amma here guru God is a meaning one who give moves away all the miseries from the lives of the people do you believe nos Neil ducati means misery so that then I Wasaga a tyranny powers are God as long as I am living I need some money I need some comfort that also their prey they're very clever Donna we should jump the ie and suppose I am going to live for 80 years like it be good no mother provide all those things and I like to leave nice me Donna we should jump I mean things they say say they put three pranayam and offering my respect to you o fast Durga don't forget that I like to cross this ocean of samsara though samsara means that which is constantly changing I'd like to go to the permanent that is brahman the Hartman but as long as in the body in the society I should be somebody so that second is Ramachari me look at it the mother is a daughter first second she is practicing the penances Ramachari knee not wearing the shoes not eating the good food only drinking the water and going on taking the name of God Shiva Shiva Shiva Shiva she's constantly and that is come from majority practicing austerity then Chandra under Chandra Kanta means marriage with the Shiva again degree marriage with the Shiva and in like the Shiva as a crescent so she is also having dad as a bell this person does it the Chandra is the moon as a bell so Chandigarh done then khushu Honda the son living in our that me she is pregnant the first is the daughter Jane she's practicing austerity to get the Shiva the Lord of speciousness so then after that she gave that as her husband in Hinduism in different ways you can approach God so I love God as my beloved that is also there so she got that a husband then naturally she is going to be the mother and Commander that she is becoming pregnant and I see the son is living within our so the the brightness and all over a person then scan the Mata Skanda means that son of Shiva and the son of Shiva this is kartikeya the in the eastern part and the western part is take Kartikeya and in Bengali pronunciation Kartik the last part we don't pronounce as maximum possible make it short so Kartikeya wider - the adult Karthik so and you will love you for nothing golly you'll make it more shortened but very sweetly they will call tattoo instead of fastest it is the actually Kartikeya they shorted make it Karthik then more shot and great love and affection this it but it is how the same good guy on the guy and that is Karthikeya the son was born and mother is very happy then cut the iine this colony she was the destroyer of Mohan Mahesh are sure a surah mushara the form was like a buffalo so there's a militia should a very bad person so now she is going to punish that as the Sun is still very young so the mother is taking and why not Sheba this is the question the mother is the power of Sheba we will come to their Shiva NeighborWorks there's nothing sometimes you do open your eyes and you see what is going around what are you doing happening what you okay you're going to kill that or shouldn't go Shiva is completely untouched thus nothing actually and that is the reason in one concert they say Shiva is a Chaba Shaba means the dead body sir shiva is just like a dead body and the mother is working with that power of Shiva so this another concept it comes the cat tyranny she is the daughter now the sage cut rocket on such a tiny muchacha then color our tree this colored artery she destroyed the show and assume the Colorado and that is the darkest night if you literally translate Karla Rodri but the column is time the one who can stop the time if you can stop the time you can imagine there is no thristy no sweetie no pralaya there is no creation no sustenance and no destruction also because no time the caller are three so that is the reason sometimes some people so they'll be going on doing the tapasya austerity day and ninety and nine if you go and ask them what is that it's a date tree they won't be able to see because the owners ever had waited and sometimes some of the people they could not recognize the day and night also that had happened in the time ceramic Krishna's life ceramic Krishna was in deep meditation when he came down she he was asking the other devotees is it day or night because that time the association with the time was not there so it could not understand one person was nearby he was not believing all these things Oh light is burning and you can't understand that this is night this it is not possible because it is all associated with the mind if the mind is not attached naturally the caller are three he is stopping the call of the time so that is called caller are three and utters called mehar Tori when there is a completely cessation then again begins the creation the color are through the cessation of everything then again begin the creation so maha golde golde means very very fair so fear there's all baha go lean and finally the nine is the shifty dolly after the all these things that will be shifted are three she is sitting like this and giving the blessings to each and everyone you can go across to the mother and can ask anything you like I like to be successful in this worldly life so please help me mother will be there and I like to know my own self I need to realize God I like to realize Brahman model is it okay so both you can ask both you can pray a different type of people that's why they go when the monks they worship Durga and in the first stotra in the Chandi group on the Sunday he the shooting and give me the beauty give me the success give me these and they're not only that in that at least going on praying to mother fasting prayer and the prayer full list mother we are going to worship you but you know why this is the least first time giving to you you act very well from wherever after the five days on the third day you have to give it to me to success that that is what is that success dear one is there as because the milk is to worship is to say partying or among the mono breathy Anusha Harini that give me that type of why who will remember long with me because the wife is thinking in a different way it was very difficult to continue in the life that samsara life the world why should be constantly prodding the husband her John moon or among the day according to my thinking so that is also prayer what is wrong wrong to do but we are also doing the durga puja please come on that day the next Sunday six from Team two one o'clock almost like that Durga Puja and we are observing the only ostomy this is Abaddon to society we don't have that there and that was infrastructure to do all the five days so there was to meet which I we do and how the monks can do because you have to pray to goddess you know what we do we shankel you have to make mother I am worshipping you only for this purpose so they will do that and we do in the name of the divine mother master of the money daily they go you see that good god and the mother is their martial data the mantle is the mother of all and ultimately whatever after the puja all the blessings that comes we offer it for the betterment of each and every one we don't think so that's why all those things are for the betterment of the people that if we did do the seat did our tree but oh everything is going on round the Sheba this is one type of in reason the Hindus the nine days didn't be fasting you know nine days they are fasting so many ladies at the earth nine days early morning or sometimes they were drinking milk curd like that and some fruits all day nothing and before going to be a little bit of that again fruits and milk like that 999 days they are doing why the blessings of the divine mother blessings of the Shiva and here in the Avadhuta see what about the process about the Shiva over the thirsty this is also Hinduism Animoto says guna big University never pinch it rattle we're at the beginner nail varnish for Punjab guna begin the beguine Umbria we should open Khatami happened a boma rupam shabam way this is the first verse of the car chapter about Jota Gita and Avadhuta Gita comes in the bhagavata the bhagavata is a book for the devotees and dear Nabu daughter is speaking about the highest form of realization he is telling the distinction of quality and absence of quality does not exist distinction of quality and absence of quality does not exist how should I worship Shiva the absolute who is devoid of quality and absence of quality who is devoid of attachment and detachment who is of the form of eater only only for beyond illusion and all-pervading how can I worship so this is the ugly the Vedanta when there is no to the moment you say it is lighted that means you have the conception of darkness otherwise you cannot say lighter done so this the problem happened to I think the wife of the Unison thing that king of the France because she was the very very rich lady and when the people who are crying for the brain she thought because she never knew what is hunger she throat they are not liking braid but instead ask them to heat the cakes the braid is not there were think of Kings so that is the way they say so they were very angry the conception of party is not there at all how can it a party the helix says the conception of good and bad is not there at all then conception of absence of the quality or the quality is there I can do that today say in this way how shall I worship Shiva this is the problem and second verse he says she tardy burner a little the Shiva is sweet a burner Shiva is white she thought burner a little Nathan Sebastian cordially karna Madame he param she was check even because it burrito Amala she was check SWAT man harmony Sumitra katana mommy Sumitra mean oh my friend how can I bow down to the Shiva Shiva the absolute is evil without white and other color we usually say the Shiva is the color the white color white color why because Chateau Cunha and Shiva is not having any gunas if there is shatter do not there must be a gentleman's so we have to understand in this way the moment we say that person is a shock to me that means maximum portion of the quality is softwa the good quality part some bad is also there Roger and drama with must be there but Shiva is beyond that so how can I worship Shiva this effect and God are also supreme Shiva effect and cause the cause then only the action if there is a cause the interaction will come and that there is no cause at all if I am on they'd only think about food if I'm not at all hungry if I'm thirsty I will think about the water if I'm not thirsty if I feel that I like to visit over there then only I will prepared to go if I am not willing to and not thinking about that so obviously each and everything depends on me the cause where this type of thought will first rise then only all the creation will come and if that duplication is not there what I will do and see you see Oh beloved friend how shall i bow to my own self what is this Shiva Shiva is not having any quality any color any existence any desire and naturally that is mine or serve and that Shiva which is my own self which is me how can I worship my self that is his problem and he is asking and the pure Shiva Shiva is auspiciousness now this auspiciousness what is this auspiciousness the purity and impurity what is that so it says impurity means that which is constantly changing impurity is there which is constantly changing purity is that which never changes this much the Advaitic pedantic terminology is so complicated unless you are in int studying it and living in it is very difficult to understand so majority of the people they understand English so when the 20s and there dualism is there that is good and slowly slowly when you understand all this otherwise in the beginning itself people go over there there's a chance to misunderstand and you will lose the devotion you will never gain the knowledge also you are in between but there is a story one person came to meet proving the not a very famous person so this man went to meet him and he went with the European trace with a court and Calcutta the heart is even then he was having that three pieces and all that and he went to meet him and he was trying to talk to the window not in English I have not read her heart only I do not know story colour not and not understood that he is not telling the English properly so what did you speak in Bengali I can understand being only you are also a Bengali Oh Tigger I was almost in a month I was in London I have forgotten being all you know sarcastically saved you have forgotten your mother tongue and you have not learned the foreign language also what will happen to you what you will communicate because you can't speak Bengali you can't speak English then what will happen to you it is like this so if we are not understanding the proper way that we to be the hunter there create chances with Miss understandable religion so with the slowly soothe the developing of the thought process is necessary otherwise if they say the great for standard for a boy if he goes to the University and start sitting over there and just like the others he is taking the notes he will lose everything he will never get any education so this is the we must understand understanding that there is the philosophy which is really supreme what is the philosophy just now we were talking about the to the guard the God's power and then me these are the two things at the end but none we're thinking I am that Shiva I am that supreme Shiva when you can see that but once the dumpee snake in and again he has given the caution unless and until you are really prepared you should not do what is the preparation again I will give you that example when nor endure now is 16 17 years old boy young boy came from Calcutta his father was a very rich man you can understand that from that family he is coming but never cared for his dreams are they here and he came but hai is is constantly seeking for the truth Saddam Krishna observe it and immediately said such a shock to me the ultimate quality the best quality lives in Calcutta the Calcutta people are all the time go for the do you feel so much Eco will be clashing petrm they have this voice coming so he started giving him that Ramakrishna started giving that Naren Advaita Vedanta knowledge but not others all the other show me is he said no it is not for you and we think that we are capable to understand on Twitter so we have to understand it but nothing wrong in reading it but practicing one must be very careful reading understanding and practicing three different things but the practice nine this nine Navaratri why don't you start the taking the name of 9,000 times today's the first day 1000 I didn't do the job and tomorrow second in two thousand nine thousand and then the - every day ten thousand I will complete and then only I will take complete food at the right a little deferred just to survive that is the way you should beautify yourself the purification is necessary I would do to made himself completely pure he was not having any body consciousness so when he says how can I swap man heart money submit their cattle Navami na ma meme is how can I worship when I bow down to me why because the Shiva that you are talking about is being I am not having any other concept any other thing the day-night white flag existence non-existence nothing remains in being now if you close your eyes and try to understand nothing around can it's very difficult I am NOT there this body this mind this mean this personality I simply forget and nothing is there not only me the chair on which I am sitting and the room in which I am sitting and all the surroundings nothing remains so unless the mind is prepared and if we try to meditate on that there are chances that we'll lose our mental balance the one should not do that first second when I am saying that I am the Sheba but at the same time I am going to join in the coffee or ting money going to the market purchasing provisions this is hypocrisy you cannot do that when you say I am NOT the body mind and that soul then you should not go for anything no hypocrisy should be there so this is says the guru to describe the self as neither distinct from phenomenal existence nor identical with it this phenomenal existence that is there in the beginning what we do we say need the in 1818 not this not this not this so this way we go many times in different occasions throughout Asia through different stories he tried to give this idea one person came to visit King and he was from the village he never knew so the first he came and in the first door itself there was a person standing and the beautiful dress I am very good looking she thought it must be the king he went said are you the king of nonsense I am only the doorkeeper go inside the second the third the fourth the field he was going on so like with the moon is approaching the more different type of people with more the wonderful dresses and ornaments all that was the the jeweler is so slowly slowly everyone said not me not me not me are you the King said are you the King said he was going on asking not me not me going going going afterwards when he crossed that the seventh one chapter Bhumika such the Bhumika that the last one he entered into that huge all on a throne marvelously decorated as a very confident personable City now this person who came to see to meet the king didn't ask him sir are you King never he immediately understood this is the king so that we when we are slowly slowly preparing ourselves and going towards the car how you preparing Navaratri how you have to bring all this type of different programs and help relocation our goal should be to develop more spirituality more spirituality more spirituality and what is the spirituality don't forget spirituality means that which is not worthy if you not describe the spirituality in that way so the spirituality is that which is not whirling now accept the world how can you go you are living in the world every day every moment and every single you go to the market to purchase it at all it is not the market and not also purchasing and you take the bag and coming out then you'll be arrested and it will be put into jail now I am practicing Vedanta so this is not the market this is also not the thing I am just lifting being a bit so know-it-all because you have to be practical this is the world the phenomena but suppose you do the exactly was Italy instead of giving up if you accept the phenomenon that is also possible so the possibility lasting I think last class the two different ways by eliminating and destroying the existence of the external world all accepting everything as divine if you go for the second one you were more be daunting than anyone else anything else that is exactly what Xiaomi will become the speed artisans so Swami Vivekananda says that if everything is nothing but God then why don't you think that you are all around god and goddesses only wherever you go the buildings that you see are the temples so naturally every moment when you are having the conversation with the person in a call is aware that I am talking with my god I must be very careful I should not hurt him or hard in any manner anyway because he or she is my god and goddess immediately your behavior will change and naturally you'll be able to move forward very quietly and steady very steadily you can move so that that this is this is the consciousness of oneness I am not reading any other verses and next time we will discuss and he is going on telling again and again that I am dead ghanem written summary awesome kikuno bomb governor HMDA I like all pervading and why because I am the knowledge how it is possible not physically not mentally not in thoughts but true realization how the realization came knowledge and when the knowledge storm so obviously you know when we took the sannyasa there are so much of temptations in the world and sannyasa means you were swimming against the current all people are going for dad and he was swimming against the current so obviously the people will look around you and what is it we are all going towards this the salmon fish if they have seen someone pieces goes against the current I went to see that and very strongly they will go and they will jump but of course wrongly they will be caught by the people standing there sometimes the Bears also they were there to get them but strongly against it needs tremendous energy the Falls and the determination courage to go against the current so you know what these two teachers only one thing don't forget you're a monk be proud that you were a monk be proud that you were dawning wearing that load the colour of which that Buddha used to have Shankara used to have I'm gonna Chania swami vivekananda used to have the hat is that the other that is you are a sannyasi don't forget and it constantly when you are let's call knowledge instantly when you are remembering that I am the monk I am the sannyasi I am supposed to look after all people and not other way but they are soul and naturally you are also concerned about yourself so I cannot deceive myself I should be so that is exactly what we do to his dealings I am the Shiva mind so how can I worship others how can I think that there is another thing and I have to worship in the life of a governs language to those who have great this pura to eat medalta about which these Avadhuta speaking here and he practiced that he went to worship goddess Kali and he said mother you want me to eat these fruits this sweets that I am going to have okay and the girl and he'll be putting on him than to the MA the model and the worshiper the goddess and the worshiper became one Pura Vida through the through duality becoming the pure operator so this tooth versus of the
