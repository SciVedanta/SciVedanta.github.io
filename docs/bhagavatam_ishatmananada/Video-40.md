[Bhagavatam 053 : Do We Die?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlovywuXMLQ)

in the morning the I was thinking that almost enough the heart that I was thinking my god is so late I got up from sleep the thing afterwards I realized no it is one hour we have dead just a cloud so friends this is the let us begin with the wonderful the words that we always chant chant our guru puja go share now but the moon of sireesha be sure Dharam [Music] governess attrition me the shoe hand [Music] Laxmi condom Kamala nyah now you give me the arnica myung-whun D Vishnu Bob Arum salaburu clicker now we paying our great respect to the Lord Vishnu but in the same haveta the bhagavata is the book dedicated to Lord Vishnu then in the only that tainted chapter is the Lord Vishnu's avatars that is the Rama and Krishna but in the Bhagavata we find the wonderful discussions of the knowledge the guiana and the last few days we were studying these the avadhuta gita who drew to geeta is the extreme point of the Vedanta here no compromise those who are attending the classes do you know now comprise at all no thinking of anything and in the fifth chapter 32 verse about water is a wonderfully he expressed bindi bindi Tina in a yatra channel optional naina Tatra summer Asha mock no Baba kaput Prajapati Tata piranhas Avadhuta being the tip in dirty 1980 etre when there is no chance opportunity to express in words you cannot tell we cannot express the Brahma why the Brahman is beyond time space and causation as because the beyond time space and causation how to express that through words because the moment we try to express it comes within this three it is beyond that so he says when there is no chance to express then Chan deduction and expressing that in beautiful words where from it is possible it's not possible so he says being the divinity when there is no chance to express naina yatra when there is no chance opportunity Kandalaksha 'no no in any Tatra there the expression cannot be then what will be summer Rajab Magna summer Russia means the same equilibrium and same Todd takes feeling of the oneness summer rasa Magna can I know if ifs person come to me and try to express about myself what I will feel am I going to learn anything from him if I was not lost some day then that is a different but the normal person suppose I go to you and say do you know where you were born and this is why suddenly you asking this question is everything all right with you because naturally I know everything about myself I am NOT going to learn anything from anywhere from anyone so same way when I realized I am Brahman all-pervading no question of describing it I Know Who am I the same way it says somewhere Assam Abner bar betta butta when your mind is that Russia Russia here it says the same idea that I am that consciousness and when you were thinking that you were one and there is no - and when you are thinking only about the spirituality the spiritual consciousness not about this world you become pure the purity and impurity what is the purity thinking about God what is the impurity thinking about the world when I am constantly thinking the what I should do and when I should purchase this plot and these do remove any different type of worldly thoughts it's coming this impure why it is impure but is it is temporary and when it is temporary you are going to suffer so that is the main way it always says the impurity means when your mind is attached with the worldly things attached with the worldly things and purity when your mind is attached to it spiritually this much but do you always think that if we go and take a bath in the Ganga we are pure it may be it depends on the thought and many of the Rishi's they told yes is a pure flow that's okay but at the same time if you go and think in this way as so many fishes are there in the ganga aarti hall pure art you're going to get the moksha it is not possible the same way the Great Sage they that lady and she told that path origins every million to my pupae are Meera Bai if you think that just a small piece of stone by worshipping that you can get God why small stone I will worship the whole hill so that is the idea we have to understand that the purity means thought of God impurity means just oppose it this here is a summer as a Magna I am constantly thinking that I am all-pervading consciousness it is not possible to describe the Brahman cannot be described Raghavan see Ramakrishna he also said no one can defy Brahman in took or Aegina no one can defy Brahman so this is a beautiful concept only you have to realize it slowly slowly you have to prepare your mind in such a way so that you can realize it and how we will know that someone has realised it there must be some example otherwise an abstract idea no example no application then why should you accept it the way you say if you go and eat the PISA that is very tasty No someone should say yes I have eaten the PISA and it's true then third four feet all people to say yes then only we can accept it otherwise how it is possible I can also browse said yes this is good because yesterday will here yet small piece so this is there we we have to understand there must be someone who will say yes it has been tested and whatever the formula the game it is true bhagavad-gita it says or Juno he is asking this question and this is the speciality of the Hinduism asking culture yeah I understand you are my guru your great person whatever you say it must true but I have every right to ask question and that's why they say when you are worshipping guru servicing giving the service to your guru how you can do that asking proper questions very pristine as a buyer Siva he was serving him how asking proper question so the here it says the Arjuna is asking steep approach just cerca Varsha in the second chapter 54 verse just before that Krishna was describing about the Brahmin and he said when a person knows about it realized the Brahmin then it becomes theta pranky planky amis his wisdom become completely steady you don't go anywhere else then he is asking this question Stata producer commercial his person of stating wisdom how he leaves how he expressed some artists education what is the symbol another burgeoning symbol how to understand some of these the circles over a man of Samadhi Singh state abruptly and Samadhi stop when a person is Samadhi ster means he is having the same idea his mind will never go here and there street OD improv are said three different words Arjuna has used first is theta pragna second samadhis the third theta D intellect is for yes this is this can you please tell me how the steady intellect steady wisdom and the man of Samadhi how he speak walk leave how will recognize is there anyone in the society and the Lord gives the wonderful answer most of you know in the bhagavad-gita 2nd chapter 55 verse is gold on giving that description the first verses says pressure ha ta da c'mon serve on barter monogatari servin come on Prajapati serve on each and every everything should be given up no desire should be there not a single desire the small little desire is there no you cannot get that idea but geezer means attachment to the worldly things so you won't get that in Hindi they say get up yaha Tom turning is wrong aha wrong doneghy come the kama means desired if you have no Rama no God it'll be there and if you have wrong there is no comma so this is the idea Prajapati yah come on serve on parthiman Oh God how we will understand that this this is a person centralized a God realized person first that he should not have any desire he is not having anything except love for people love for the being except that because why the love because he sees God in them that is the reason one person came to Raghavan see Ramakrishna and say hey what is it you are constantly thinking about the young boys oh how are they what they are doing they should do this oh you are thinking in this way you're the man of realization you should nothing Salaam o Krishna just like a young little little boy he was confused this man he's an educated person when he is telling like that there must be something and he ran to goddess Kali you know the relation of the goddess Kali and straight just like a mother in the Sun MA this man was telling I am thinking about Noreen about Rocco is it bad mother say something and the proud boy came back he said rascal I am NOT going to listen to you mother said I love those because they are having the God within them they are pure the mind is not attached to the world they are not selfish so I love them so this love is there but why because of this pressure hearty yada come on no desire at all and the same person's Ramakrishna in those days one businessman came to give him ten thousand rupees can you imagine in those days people who stored hardly five rupees or eight rupees and they were rich people earning eight rupees per month ten thousand rupees and Siham Tichenor he became why you have brought this money to me what I am going to do I can never accept it no desire at all press your hearty udara come on serve on parthiman oh god how it is possible art money but man are to stir state-approved constitutive Hartmann Eva Hartman ostrich death in under man when it was a very very poor condition you cannot imagine the poverty I lived you know right from the birth I never saw poverty and when I joined the ramakrishna mission that was the very good centers so no poverty at all but when they sent me to Adam on oh my god then I was face to face with the poverty everyday morning I used to and really now I feel how is to do I have to go and count how much money I am having there was a small the packet was there I kept my money every day I was spending 50 rupees and really so terrible condition in that condition suddenly one evening one car came a three box full of money and all thousand dollar not something like that they brought it and told Swamiji you keep it only for three days under your bed nobody is good to and then one full back we will give it to you too bad so you will take back I don't know you take back three all the three you take it back right now immediately I needed money but not in that fashion I prayed to mother mother give me some money fifty orphaned children are there I can't give them food no proper clothing we prayed we prayed to mother but not that black money but nearby there was a temple after a month I saw they suddenly they have become very rich they are also poor like us but suddenly so I understood okay one bag has come okay so this way it goes but you have to stick to why because spirituality why we will when we have become monk for God realization not for the appreciation of the society or the certification of the society no not like that so I must be individual must be very very careful what I am doing how I am doing why I am doing so that is very important so here it says when you can do that at the ultimately today we will conclude this historico the the Gita Sangeeta and we will see how ashtavakra is describing a holy man and will conclude like that again we find in the Ostrava press on Vita chapter tain three and four verse he says here drop away Krishna samsara mythical throbbing wherever there is a desire that is some sod what is samsara here true yet reverb it Trishna sums our amphitheater through by deserved means samsara and what is moksha again it says the taint chapter of the word gita 4th verse Trishna mantra curb actor tanaka moksha chatty very simple Trishna Matra butter he's bound who has the desire name fame these that so many varieties of desire the subtle desire is name and fame very certain desire the one Swami was a great show me president of over order and he was a very highly scholar then one person went and told when you talk is beautiful we explained why don't you write then he said no I have problem in the knee even me is the problem what about writing the book no after writing the book when publishing I have to go to sell it also the most of the writer immediately after the publication they will go on that is another problem hey I have published the book please purchase watch do to publish the book and you're asking me to part so this is the whole problem desire but writing the book and then forget about it that is a different thing that's why the Rishi's so many dishes there are so many big abusers if you read there are so many big abusers they all dedicate to one day the brothers are not that one with the better Road everything there is greed souls they wrote it and dedicated in the name of one with a pair can you imagine so that is called no desire not ownership moksha Shetty and we find our daughter in his own way he is describing the brahman in chapter 6 and Stoker tree we find the mind here he says the mind he used the word mind mana but means brahman is very supreme undivided all pervasive and devoid of largeness and smallness that this is the problem you cannot describe brahman but at the same time you have to say something about drama because our whole thing depending on brahman and you can neighbors anything to what they do almost all all the Reese's they always try to express the brahman in a different way they will take you very close to it and they say in this way the brahman is verily supreme this is one idea second it is undivided you cannot divide it third it is all pervasive and divided of largeness and smallness the moment you say all pervasive oh that means it is large the moment you say large an idea of largeness will come but is also small that's why in the pony should be fine on your own yarn motto mo Yeon art massey agent o- oh hayoung what is that it is my noticed at the same time it is all-pervading we're staying in your mind in your soul the soul that you see that is there the one young boy came to his father he was a teacher every time you say that is a cow that is a horse why can't you say this is Brahmin tell me in that fashion whenever I ask about Brahmin you go on telling these that this is Brahmin you know the answer that the father is a doer Brahmin now you go anything what part of me Brahmin so this way Brahman means you cannot express you can feel you can understand so that it says mano e Bernier antara sorry begotten he had the word minami's Brahmin near antara sorry begotten be shallow ably shall begin a Purim visually it is big at the same time is my noticed mana even Iran Tara server she bomb this Brahmin is the auspiciousness monotherapy cotton batches are jacket now when it is like these how can you think in your mind about Brahmin there's not possible and forget about expressing it through words so he says monosyllabic cotton how it is possible to think about Brahmin this is very tricky way the way you are thinking something that means you are separate and that is an object you are thinking isn't it some of the grandmothers may be here right this moment thinking about the grandchildren sitting ever here listening or Duta but thinking about the graduated is possible the love and when you are thinking that means they are separate you are separate isn't it otherwise you won't be able to think how many times you think about yourself mostly we don't because it is existence I am there all the time I will go before a meter oh I am like this okay I should not forget that I'm back do that do we do that no why because we know how we are is just like that it's a feeling and you need not to bother about anything whether it is a small one or the big one and it is an object no oh I have to think about Brahman how can you it is not object it's not separate from you how can you think about it friends now we have to imagine the brahmana Gianna means how difficult it is when our mind is also not able to think about it how to realize it then they say if you go on understanding it then the cover that is on that it is already there within you you are that only you have forgotten that sometimes the Alzheimer people they forget that the doctors they will give the medicine the treatment another thing slowly one day you'll say oh yes why I am sitting over here doctor what I am doing with you all right no ok you need not to sit before me now you're okay go there it is the moment you know that you are there you don't need anything guru shishya scripture temple god no nothing is necessary I am that I am and that is Barranca that is vedanta swami vivekananda he has given the be done in a very modern way he said art movie show so it's not ego but self-confidence I can do why I'm the son of God I can do it it is possible it's not ego but confidence I will do it I can do it so it says how can I certain narrating different aspects of the life mundane and spiritual about who to then emphasized that there is no duality and hence he declared a home Eva Shiva for our treaty I am that auspicious and that ultimate home Eva Shiva for our Tahiti encoding only one words almost the same way the different verses he is telling the same thing how me Eva Shiva very recently Shankar Acharya still means at least thousand years before that is Shankar Acharya also said the same thing he also said ma nobody ahankara Chetan are many of the beautiful voice singers they are singing and some one or two ladies also they have recorded that mono with thee I told him the song is good but what about the meaning do you think about the meaning if you think about the meaning recording the song will come why I am not the mind I am NOT the intellect and not this body I am NOT the senses Who am I shivoham shivoham this Shiva doesn't mean that the Lord Shiva little worship here is the auspiciousness and what is auspicious what is purity again God only there is no doubt there is not a Smith pinch of worldliness and what is worldliness desire and why the desire come selfishness so this is the way we never will be problem the some calamity is going to come within three days it will be very difficult no one will be able to go out you will see immediately all people will go and have whatever they can find all so that three days they should be fine of the food and these and that all the groceries unnecessary they'll go and grab do they think about other people I am taking so many things what will happen to the other people they never why trust is me that we survive then I will open my window and see if anybody is there or not so this is the selfishness why I like to survive this selfishness is natural with us and that's why we were bound and that is the reason we are bound when we can go beyond this what happened shivoham ooh Shiva so this is the way he says now comes who is actually getting the liberation who we are then the vedanta jivatma Jeeva Atma Chiba means individual being admin is the soul the individual being and it's so that's called jivatma when the Hindus they know these words mostly and they always say jivatma per mark massive military when the person is dead they will take him to the cremation ground and then then we say jivatma but Atma Paramatma simile today what is this jivatma actually here I find that the jivatma the individual self about it Shankar Acharya very wonderfully describing he says booty indriya tsardom sovereignty cut reduction ARA big Annamayya kosha I will explain but D this world we are familiar we know the intellect booty then India Sartre he again the other India India that is our ego and when it is associated with gun andreas it's called big annamaya kosha the knowledge seat but the determinative faculty is the booty and it's Brittany Brittany's modification that is the ego along with the organs of knowledge we know the organs of knowledge Chuck su karna Nausicaa Jumba and tuck these are the five Chuck sugar Nanashi cagiva and tuck the one lady she memorized the sand state words Chuck shook and inertia ketubah but she was not knowing which is which one is what so when I was showing the for a flashback it went to my mind am i also showing at the same way so he she was showing Chuck Shu and karna it will always be funny where you are showing that is it could be but it is not like that Chuck shook our Nanashi canoe and dug the sanga's sanskrit words means the either ear the nose the tongue and the scheme so through the touch these are the five beyond andreas only five only five and through these all that we learn through these only how the eye is learning no it's just a machine it goes and collect information and give it to the mind and mind immediately is very busy assaulting those thing or this shooter should take and issue it not necessary then it takes the final decision that is booty when the mind after all this examination takes a decision that part of the mind is called but the intellect on that intellect the reflection of the Paramatma is very special and that is why that booty starts feeling I and mine so I the ego the jivatma it comes from that it's not that the Hindu the philosophy that they don't say in this way they see it is the reflection it is not original reflection of the Hartmann reflection is not original but behaves like the original suppose the sunlight is reflecting on his water the water will also become warm the sunlight is warm the water will also become warm and the children they'll be playing with that what one type of the glasses and they'll be putting that glass reflecting the sunlight on a piece of paper and suddenly they'll catch fire how it is possible that particular piece of the glass is not having that power but still it is showing that it is having the power how it is possible reflection same way I am thinking that there is no god but who is thinking reflection only at the moment that original light will be off the reflection will be off then you'll say oh I can't think at all we are so proud to deny the existence of God no no no we are scientific people we don't accept God God means all villagers only did but if the God is not giving you the light where do you think they will go the Shankar Acharya says ganon 3r plus booty plus a hunka is from big G annamaya kosha knowledge seat you know the pipe seats are there it is the last one and these is they say I and mine ego is this one this big annamaya kosha knowledge see in reality it is inert it is inner it is not active but we feel it is active each and every one of us I am standing over here giving you the top explaining the Peduto gita but all that is happening with the help of the reflected knowledge reflected power reflected intellect so all reflected that is why a Buddha he is bringing the mind to that but due to the reflection of the Chaitanya due to the reflection of the consciousness the feeling I and this doership so the example is the mirror example is the water in the some of the people in the villages in the wintertime they don't have that money but they need some warm water you know what they will do are the morning they will put the bucket full of water outside from the morning till known that water will become work then they will be there also waiting in the warm water but how they are utilizing sun rays responsible that moment the moment we understand this this truth only we are free from me and mine we have free from ego our problem is our ego someone he has learned some read some books books means the knowledge of other people look at it he collected some information from the other people's knowledge from the books and then with that he has submitted his thesis then he became doctorate and I am a doctorate he becomes so proud with the help of art in the beginning you are taking help of so many people all their knowledge and then go little back and think about it when other people could not how you could suppose everybody becomes Nobel laureate who will be interested to become a Nobel laureate know why all not now all people are having like that so some special well other people are not I mean I am having dad tried but from this point we have to go back whose pride is this who says that I am having the Nobel Prize who says that intellectual mind what is this mind how we can do it so the bonanza says don't be proud of it become confident well it's good confident but don't be proud of it why you are not having this is the reflection of that supreme consciousness so become humble it's a reflection of the supreme consciousness and it says in this way when the ibadat are almost complete with all these is a I am that Sheba habiba Shiva but Martha et that is the truth when the sixth chapter completing with this how maybe she WA Perot martyt I am that supreme consciousness how can I say that when I remove that ego what remains only consciousness when that under booty the reflection is coming and I am so busy with the reflection now he stopped that and turned towards the original thing oh that is the Sun and the Sun is giving the reflection to me the eye it should become the Sun that is the desire God realization means I should become God that is should be the desire Barragan see ramakrishna is telling the goal of every human life is to god really shishun it should be god-realization how it is possible we are all sinners we are unlimited we are all these right this moment you were thinking in this way the moment you understand that I am also the same consciousness then all the bondages that is on me and the limitation that is on me it'll go away and what will come a tremendous self-confidence and with that self-confidence or desire we go away and when the desire gone then what happens you become a Luthor Buddha is telling you become Avadhuta and what is this about you tur he's explained giving that expression could be afraid of the outer thing he says rakta car portability Tekonsha Punia pune be Birgitta Ponte shoe negara teach to the nagano should turn Iran janesomm or a Samana that is about auto only in two lines is expressing wearing very ordinary dress and that to the tone clothes the people they draw of adutha will go and collect it and stitch it and then wear it you never purchase it don't be afraid oh my God if I have to do Deuter I have to do like that no it is only external those who have read the biography of the roundish do you know when and Abram of gyani came and he was eating the same food from a dog the insulin Krishna got scared and went to the mother mother shall I have to be like this and now that is all external so it says they're wearing very ordinary dress ratha kurata bitter cheetah contra in Bengali and some other Indian languages is a kata you know what is that car the whole clothes they will put in one place and they will teach in such a nice way that become very costly afterwards the country and the beautiful way this teach our ladies or mothers are so talented all this tuned clothes old clothes they'll wash it and make it a piece ma small pieces and then they will make it in such a nice way so many different ease of color then people will go and purchase it and they'll be so happy but what they are but they are old clothes only so when the only the Avadhuta is wearing no we are also adding that this is called wearing only ordinary closed mostly made of rags leave a free life without caring for merit or demerit virtue or vice never care for that why he is already dead we always go to the temple why not at least once in a week I should go to the temple to pray to God that they say hello to the boss now I am here please don't forget I am remembering you but as because I am so busy I cannot come up with this at least Sunday I will come passing somewhere going somewhere but they come look I am here I respect you God should not forget me not necessary at all why you are God yourself the second burst will say you are God yourself so it's it lives in beautiful way it is it not caring for the mehdi to demean it or are to arise about who is carefree mendicant leaves in a deserted place observed in pure place of government only wearing very ordinary dress living in a secluded place no sometimes the home place also doing the same thing they are all alone and all the one close at the last word he should remember he is living with what pure bliss a Brahman he's living at the pure bliss a Brahman externally on almost same a great monk and an ordinary person beggarman almost the same but no externally internally the monk is living in the breeze of Brahman and when he's living in the police of Brahman the what happens Dharma de moksha / jente needy Hazara bethubb Byam Katanga raga Barajas cha katrien T because Cheeta to the seventh fourteen verse he says Avadhuta never desire righteousness weld enjoyment or liberation scholars that therefore confused to understand them this type of people they don't want anything that's why the people are sometimes confused to understand them this is called a Buddha there's a movement came some people became disinterested in in the the religion and so-called religion which has a list of do's and don'ts so some young people said no we should go back to the normal so that was a turn towards the East the eastern religion they liked and they started accepting the eastern guru why we should leave the freeness but only leaving in the forest were wearing ordinary dresses that won't help you the main thing is your thought and when your thought is not pure understanding is not clear outside things on health so a Buddha says in this way then in the eighth chapter we are concluding in first and second verse he gives how you can understand this man has realized again you see it says that yatra barakatuh hatate in a beautiful way is explaining o brahmana I am sorry because I was going to the pilgrimage not knowing that you were everywhere I did a mistake by going on a pilgrimage to seek your blessings I have denied your omnipresence isn't it I have denied your omnipresence you were everywhere but not understanding that not knowing that I went to the pilgrimage and then I offered all those things to the God it says Todd acharya barakatuh hatate t be a pocket ah you are all-pervading fatah I have denied that is a scene that are committed I should know that God is everywhere anywhere God is there Donnie nachita paratha authority when I was meditating by meditating on you I have given you fall and denied the formlessness aspect of you whenever we are meditating we are meditating on the form of God and by that way o God that you are formless I'm denying this is also seen and the third - stood tortilla baka paratha etat II stood to Atia Barbara tohe Totti by chanting your glory I have denied your indescribable nature and this is about Sumida when the auditor says like this can you imagine the height of the spirituality the height of the mind which can imagine this I am not going anywhere because God is everywhere I am NOT going to chant the name of God because God cannot be described I am NOT going to meditate on God because God is formless but you always do that why we don't know not that we should stop it that is necessary to cling like that when a little boy going to school and when you say going to school is nothing you have to go to the University and then from the University you must learn and then give up the university too you must be a knowledgeable person people should come to you if he is not starting going to this school what will happen and if you say you need not to go to the school the baby the child will be very happy oh my father is telling not to go to the school very good father you must have to go so when we are talking these are the Abba Luther this is the ultimate condition of the spirituality when you have realized the God is all pervading then you can say how can I meditate on God how can I go on pilgrimage and if I am going on telling about God the God is like these and that then I'm actually making a mistake because God cannot be described Shanta karim booyakasha unum we are describing the he's form is like these he's sleeping on his knee all describing and the moment we are describing we are making it limited so he says no you cannot then he is telling this way calmly patottie when we are meditating when we are realising then our life is transforming how you will understand that to some people they say how you will know that we have realized God and we need not to ask that is the thing that automatically it will come new but friends if we notice the realization of God means transformation of the qualities the wonderful qualities that is manifest realization of God doesn't mean I have the power to walk on the water or fly without anything in the air not like that this means calmly uberta T is a completely desire free he is a Don to control mind marido is gentle his shoe cheap pure a king channel without position not greedy me the book and Shanta serene stick

see the monks means I always say we have taken some boughs and greens t means householder means you have taken some boughs particularly those who are married if you remember because that time you are so in great joy I don't remember what actually you are telling but you know if you listen to the father what he is telling or the priest what he is telling and try to understand the meaning of it you'll find you are promising I am responsible to protect my wife all through my life I will protect her this is the promise in the church and the temple same promise you must have - then after that you are taking care of your family why because all this society depends on you if you are not a good father and a good mother the children won't be good then the bad children means bad result of the society it's like the dirt we collect in our from the floor our own house and throw it in the garbage bin now it is not like that those children they will go on the society create problem in the society all the bad things that they are doing over all the bad result will come to you so this is the great responsibility of the parents and the monks do you know what type of promises we take our guru is sitting God is there Ganga water then the same fire and we touch that fire and the Ganga water in front of the Guru we promise we are not going to hurt anyone we are not going to go for me fame money and property No so that is God some others stood tall I am NOT going to love my own family separately and other separately No so that is called the promises if you break you can break
