[Bhagavatam 074 : In Which Form One Should Worship God ?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y90aVx8qzhU)

good morning dear devotees and frames let us begin our Sunday talk on the bhagavata and we are studying the Odawa gita is a conversation between the great devotee uddhava with lord krishna and it was the that particular situation when lord krishna was about to leave his body and go back to his divine aboard and that was the time when the you do the bump sure the whole clan of the you dues they were killing themselves the all around the confusion the people were not knowing what is happening what is doing going to do so at that time only the Odawa the great the devotee he came and met the Lord Krishna and he was asking some question so we have already you have heard those who were continuously following this the class you know it now we will continue the conversation between the Lord Krishna and the whatever but before that as usual laterz a chant this mantra Shanta karim pooja go sharanam but mana serration Rashad harem Gurgaon Assad regime mingi Birnam shabanam lakshmi contemn Kamala jnanam you give he dr naga Miam Bondi Beach gnam babu-bhaiya harem Ceravolo Creek is the dwell duality the God is giving the description of the guard many of you those who know the Sanskrit you know the meaning of it is a very famous sloka there is a description of the lord vishnu and how the Vishnu came that also those who are regularly following the fog about the cloud you know that when the son brothers the children of the Brahma they wanted to know the secret of yoga then the Lord the supreme lord he came in the form of a swan and then ultimately he then declared I am Bishnu the Vishnu means all-pervading Lord all-pervading consciousness so that this Vishnu though he used the word yangjia the yagya means Vishnu a missionary is all-pervading so the conception that is only one and there is no - but in the the last two classes I think we were discussing the God and his miraculous power so many miraculous power he was having so obviously he was going on telling if you do this you will have this and different type of power in the beginning itself they the god himself told about the eight different powers then anima Mahima laghima property proc amia he/she tois bashira kama passata and one can become a little just like an atom and also the immense figure and he can become very light all this in attainment a success in everything what everything's and capacity to influence and control anything and anybody all so issued to ABBA schita all this power it can't came the God himself said I have given this power and majority of the people those who are very big in a beginner in the spiritual life they like this they want this type of power and they think they'll be happy in this worldly life of course they'll be happy but ultimate thing is not the joy is not the happiness it's not the liberation why because with these power we are going to enjoy this world something of this world that's why they say those who are performing very good action practising severe austerities but having some desire to get some power they become the gods like the Indra Beruna etc the controller of the rain controller of the nature different but after that again they have to come down come back to this human life on this art again they have to analyze the whole thing whatever I wanted with it that was good that was all right no because of the experience they'll say no it is not necessary even the king of gods the Indra he is also dissatisfied he is also having the jealousy and there are so many stories in the Puranas though anyone practicing austerity Indra is afraid oh maybe that ultimately he will try to get my position the inner always try in that way there are so many stories but that we what is the benefit so they'll do all this power that the god is trying to give so only one thing that a true devotee a true practitioners of the spirituality will always say that I don't want anything of this when Bhagwan Sri Ramakrishna wanted to give this power to a young boy nor in there not he simply refused no I don't want all this what I am going to do with this so one who is studying the bhagavata one who is practicing spirituality the goal should be fixed and there should not be any ambiguity about the goal and the goal is not the power the goal is the peace the happiness joy that comes from within the peace that joy the the Blees doesn't depend on anything else external thing it is only within our mind within our soul that knowledge we should have so that is the reason we are studying the scriptures every Sunday we are reading the scripture so many different varieties we have store already studied and now we are going to almost complete the bhagavata and in the Bhagavata we find there are eight direct powers bestowed by the god and the Yogi's when they're practicing spirituality they also get another team powers not that the God is giving them but in the process they get all the same powers and to power to control the hunger and thirst and power to hear from distance Duras ravana and power to transport body at sea as swiftly as the mind the power to assume any form power to enter into anybody's body anyone's body for a chi approbation power to died according to one's own wish shot chenda myth to who the that is the way to go and power to enjoy the recreation of God's power to fulfill any wish yet a single positive power to see anything from distance do the darshan of that's why in India the TV his name is dura darshana the dura - inna means from distance you can see and power to command anyone anywhere without fail so we we find this this type of power that manifests and we find that is in the in the in the Lord Jesus life he acts the Nazareth to come out from the dead and another that came this is possible then for some to have five pity powers that also be discussed power to know the past present and future trickle up gear and power to avoid the effect of heat and cold power to read other starts Brigitte Adi a big guitar power to stop the effect of fire Sun poison the prologue Mirabai in their life divine they really they were given all this and nothing happened to them power to remain free from others influence so apologia so these are all the powers that we studied last time in that 15 chapter of the bhagavata 11th book 15 chapter of the bhagavata whole chapter is dedicated to tell you all these different type of powers and when that was the seed the Lord ultimately said these are nothing in fact the only 1% we can say of my being my power is manifest in this way then what the Lord will be only out of 100 only one and that is so much power then if we get God then what will happen that's why once the Ramakrishna said don't waste your time trying to equate the power there's a description we didn't read that but I suggested if you are interested you can go to those pages of the bhagavata then if you are practicing this method then this power will come if you are practicing in this way that power will come those who are interested to get the power they can try now ultimately what the God said that is interesting because we are the spiritual seeker what is their spirituality spirituality is the bliss divine bliss and how to get the divine please understanding and knowledge at wearing a knowledge and what is that knowledge knowledge of oneness it cannot remaining do whenever we are thinking about the gods power B booty in Sanskrit they say the booty the God's power the divine power is manifesting in so many different ways but they are not true why God has created through his power of Maya it cannot be true it cannot be permanent and if it is not permanent why should you go for after that so always the true gurus the advisors not to go after the power never care for the power you have to understand that God and God is manifesting in different forms in different way so here we find that the Lord is telling in this way that in the 31 verse o parsha Casilla mom even you go dharna yamuna sit here poor vaca Tita Oh Protestant the ashishot aha to the spiritualist parent who worship me through concentration acquire all cities all of the supernatural power so all this power if we want to get that if anyone interested to get those power then what the simplest way one power if you want to acquire so there is a process that you have to meditate in this way that way cetera but if you want to have the whole thing so you have to realize that Supreme God so that he says wash Akasha mommy bong yoga Daria that they should realize me otherwise you have to go individual same God he will worship but small small fraction the how to realize the God worships me through concentration that's all me the Lord the God through concentration who is this me the all-pervading consciousness and if we are not able to concentrate our mind without any form so to have the form Lord Vishnu ushanka chakra God our Padma dari that image he showed to the Mooney's to the Rishi's to the thinkers the holy minds the forehand beautiful form of the Supreme God and if you can consent it not that and maybe you are not able to visualize okay then we can go to Sri Ramachandra who is also the Vishnu in the human form our Sri Krishna who is giving us the teaching the same Bishnu in the human form sri ramakrishna saying vishnu in the human form so whatever it may be the meal includes all these great manifestation of the Lord Vishnu himself so it gives us the very easy way to concentrate our mind because we get a person before us and he's talking he's moving he's performing many things so obviously it becomes very easy for us to imagine oh this is this so for us we are the followers of Bhagwan see Ramakrishna we always like to listen to his talks and we read his biography his life and we get inspiration we can imagine that he's moving in this place and he's practicing austerity induction Isha our mind goes in that so concentrating the mind on me me the God maybe with form without form whatever you think is good for you so by that way if we can concentrate and what does it mean by concentration concentration means not thinking any other thing and that is the problem because not only in this life in this life so many impressions we are having the more we grow older the more the memories come back oh I did that I was there these people that people all memories crowded inside the mind and apart from that as because I have utilized this mind for many different things it has already become so naughty so out of control now if you say eh come and sit over here and concentrate it's not going to listen so it is a very hard task but nothing wrong in trying so slowly slowly we can withdraw and how do we draw there have different processes the first thing if I cannot forget these things all around the people my relatives my family my friends my nation my country to transform that as the manifestation of God and that is the easiest way ba governs the ramakrishna suggested the one lady came to him and she said Sal you asked me to concentrate my mind on Krishna but I loved my knees and so much so whenever I close my eyes that face comes before me see Ramakrishna said it is good the nephew or the knees even love okay no problem think that is your god and by that way only we draw your mind from other objects first point sometimes they say just think of a flame of a lamp a lamp then it is the flame and concentrate on the flame this by that way also analyzing your mind watching your mind varieties of suggestions are there so by that way only we have to withdraw the mind from different objects and then concentrate it the moment the concentration developed then put that concentrated one pointed mind to God and when that God how to put that in God and the Deuter Vaadin dwellest will give you a great help they will say imagine all the good qualities that God is having and imagine and you are imbibing those Golic qualities within you and by that way also you are concentrating so Varsha Kashima me from you Gagarin eHarmony signior Porou boca theta whatever have said before all those supernatural power will come to that person who is trying to concentrate his mind on me and then he said because I am the part of all that how they will get the power by concentrating on me sometimes some people will say it is me means Krishna alone dear is little narrowness it is not me only Krishna is the manifestation of the Supreme Lord Krishna in one form Rama in one form and different forms he has manifested the same God same power manifested in different form different time at different before different people and here as because we are reading the bhagavata the conversation between the Lord Krishna and the Odawa and Lord Krishna the me we can think of Lord Krishna but it was the only Krishna know that will be a narrowness it may be other gods also but that is a different thing if God is supreme power he can manifest God can manifest in different form we cannot say that now God cannot manifest anywhere except Krishna did that be blasphemy we are thinking God doesn't have the power to manifest in other forms no that cannot be so the Krishna and he says sir grass arm or pea siddhanam he to Perea hum prabhu who uh-hum you gosh assam christian that must subramani nam we have studied that the last verse of the 15 chapter 30 35 in 5th verse he says i am the lord of the powers for I am their cause and maintainer I am also the Lord of yoga of knowledge of religion and of the teachers of Brahma so this everything that you see is nothing but me I toured them I manifested them I am sustaining them everything I am doing so why you should unnecessarily go for only one little power that I have manifested and not come to me that will be a great mistake the king is having everything a huge Kingdom and in different parts of the kingdom different type of things are there so if you go and think oh this is the only thing one castle oh that is wonderful overlooking the sea I only loved these there's the only part of that but if you go to the king and you can have everything that the king is having that is the idea so here we find the statement that would double seed when the he said I am the yoga I am the power I am controlling everything actually only I am there and nothing else would ever is a very intelligent person he immediately asked the question you said that you have manifested in different forms now can you please tell me in which form what should one should worship you in which form one should worship you is there any one form so that they they can go and worship that here we find Krishna as he said in the question of the Krishna remembered Arjuna he said as you are asking this question the same question or Jun relaxed and I am going to give you the same answer what is the answer Prince I am NOT going to read all those the same the Gita is he says whatever wherever you see the greatest thing that is me I am the Himalaya of all the mountains that you see around I am the Himalaya of all the among all the horses I am this all the elephants I am this there we know in bhagavad-gita so he went on describing issue issue - babi issue dr. Tom para Marisha era who personal property some symptom that bothers me now we started the sixteen chapter 11 book 16 chapter I am quoting from the verse 3 here the Watauga is asking the can you please tell me is there any particular form or some other forms so that the devotees can consent it on their worship that and they will get the quick result quick result is the realization of you the God the supreme is there anything krishna didn't mention a single he said wherever you see the big booty everything is nothing but me hearing this would divers request the lord krishna as I was telling he remembered the another devotee Arjuna and there also he said these those who are interested they can read the whole 16 chapter and they will they can find almost the same words as he has said in the bhagavad-gita he said and then in the 38 verse Lord denied all duality that is important so I will take you to that particular part the 38 verse of the 16 chapter here he is denying all the dualities maya ash serena ji bina you Nina guna nabina sarvatma na appeal Serena ba Baba da ta catch it in a very simple way he is mentioning I alone manifest as the Ishwara and also the giba this is Hinduism again and again the Hindu will take you to this particular position where he will say God and also his manifestation and nothing but the one that's between the bar amoebic ananda he was introducing karma yoga in this modern age he said those who are serving the jeevers the individual souls they are actually worshiping the God gbem courage I John Shea John Shea which are those who are serving the manifested beings so DC's from the bhagavata and bhagavata says very clearly in the debt to give the answer to Dava Lord Krishna is telling I alone manifest as Ishwara so he manifested issue this is the very important point we should remember the God is not the Ishwara as he manifesting the Jeeva he manifests in the East Sheldon what is this issue Allah Ishwara God's one power weed out power without the guna when the God is there unmanifested he is Brahman and when he is manifesting working and according to Strabo Krishna is Kali and maybe in whatever but one the same God without action and same God wheat action and when that same Supreme Being instead of telling the God it is better to say Supreme Being he taking the form of God that is Ishwara and same issue is also Jeeva taking this point the baton teens they will say I and the God are one as the Lord Jesus said I could add him I and the father in heaven are one I and that Lord Ashura are one why because both are being created by that supreme consciousness so there are some processes the baton teens they always use so by that way one can reach over there here in the bhagavata in the 16 chapter xi book 38 verse also supporting the same thing Maya is shereena G bina I'm the sure and again I am the Jeeva and we always go to ishaara we always go to God it sure means God that supreme being manifested in that form and he is working through his power the shutter age otama and the Ali call it Maya the bee hunting they call it Maya is working like that we the jeevers we go and pray before that issue Allah because we are individual and that is the sum total so we go to him to pray the Ishwara and adroit about in cable our data they will say why should go and play because the issuer and me are not different well they will say like that here Lord is accepting the issuer and the giba are the same quality and the truth Kunene Guney na Saguna gunshot Arijit AMA and guna one who is utilizing those so quality and the truth that is also me as in dueling spirit and the bodies sir bahtman RP Serena survey in all these bodies that you see different names and forms inside the indwelling the spirit that Artman there's also me bodies also me and also indwelling Artman also me but that is the wonderful Vedanta in bhagavata the complete Vedanta says there cannot be two existence of two it is only one and that one has manifested the light and the darkness though the light and the darkness is completely different entities it cannot be together but that both the light and the darkness is from the God to give an example a good person and a bad person good qualities and the bad qualities all are from the same so that is the God and he sees the sarvatma na appears Aravena no baba with da ta catch it so that you must read out me nothing remains that's why the Lord Jesus he saved hit the scene not the sinner in the Bible hit the scene the activity that you are doing that is creating problem for the others so that you should not do that me that is the scene now whatever any work or thought that we do if that is hurting others that is seen and whatever we are thinking and performing if it is helping others that is Pune the purity so this way we can say that give up the action but the person who is now bad can become good the person you seek good now god forbid can become bad anything will happen because both are gods manifestation he just changed the position so that is the reason constantly we have to go and hold that Supreme Lord the God don't put me into your play take me away mana is share energy veena Kunene Guney novena sarvatma na o P Serena now probably dirty iike cheat so obviously accept me there remains nothing to impress this profound 'ti of his divine creation the lord said once again in the in the verse 36 it says maybe it is possible to count the atoms is very wonderfully it has been expressed the atoms the trillions trillions and trillions are atom the santiana para maana naam the numbers of the paramon of the atoms maybe it is possible for someone to count but it is impossible to keep record of my countless creation the so many creation creation after creation many people they always go for that we have to know these where from this has come weapon it is impossible to know it's good for the scientists to go on discovering but it is countless impossible to end it constant is going on and on and on creation and therefore vibrancy Ramakrishna he said in a very nice way you have come over here to eat mango eat mango why you are wasting your time by counting the figs and the branches and the leaves you're going on counting how many leaves in this mango tree it'll go D is for that it is better this is the time for the mango don't do it's time so we go and eat mango the Salam o Krishna he is giving the hint one should not waste his energy by doing the triple things like this rather he should take the Jews what is that God to the whole sixteenth chapter dedicated to explain and narrate the divine power of the Lord but at the end he said these powers are all manifestation of the mind not real so this is the point at the concluding the 41 verse of the sixteen chapter though the whole chapter was dedicated for but giving the complete description of the supernatural power the divine power of God now finally the same God is mentioning so this is the great teacher just like our dear teachers they will say see these are not the right answers and these are the right answers I am going to ask you some question I am teaching you this subject I am going to ask you the question and I am telling you these are the right answers not others even after that if we go for the wrong thing even the teacher cannot make us pass that class obviously this is the thing we have to understand eat asti give Titas serve our sonship inna be buddha yaja mano be karim EBT yatta watch our video in a different way as we speak like that watch our video in different form we are going on telling different things same way but it is not true it is completely mono B Karim just you are thinking you are having that power what you need to do with that what power you can have nothing that's why sometimes you will find some of the great people they become very popular among the devotees because the moment they are touching something is happening the moment they are doing these moment there so people run after them and they also become very happy I am having so many followers and among them there are some great followers so one after another if you can remember I'm not going to name the so many they came and they surfaced for some time and then went out in Oblivion no one remembered them so this is the way we end up that particular person he acquired some power through spiritual austerity but before reaching the goal he slipped down so one should not try to acquire the God's power one should put his whole body mind and soul to realize the God not the gods power that is the ideal sees it a secret it acerbic etheta all the power that we have heard his server everything Shang subpoena be booty aha all the beauties all the miracles miraculous power that I have seen and Shang subpoena and in a very small way we're not elaborately all manova karim these are all is a mines so one should not try being a true teacher so it krishna then taught the secret of the spirituality the success in realizing the spiritual goal so this is the beauty of the teachers our masters the great about Aras they come they say these are the things are there I'm not denying this world is there and this world is very attractive I have created that my creation the attractions are terrible attractions are there and naturally and we can feel the moment a boy or a girl reaches the age maybe 1516 terrible changes and everything they go on only concentrating on the body central on the body they are thinking they are so intelligent so clever making friendship with these friendship with that and then ultimately when they become old and they find some time to ponder whatever they have done then they will go on beating their head and say oh my god what I have done nothing so that is there that's why the one should start understanding religion practice religion when they are very young and sometimes some people they say the religion for the elder people know exactly opposite it should be from the very young age why they should understand what is Dharma and in the traditional way in the Hindu society they give that Dharma artha kama Moksa Dharma means understand the truth understand the reality and understanding that at least intellectual understanding should be there and then keeping that in your mind go in the world go in the field and then only you can save yourself or otherwise if you go continuously to satisfy your body you are going to stop so that we how to overcome how to conquer the Lord Krishna is advising us watch amateur Manu yet yet chapron on your indianature atmanam at mana yet you know booyah culpa see adonai yet chi means control yet cho bottom yet you control your tongue control your words because when you go on talking we go and we see so many things and by that way we tell the not truth just because we are going on telling something so we can't control our speech so watch um yet you the first thing you have to control your speech some people are good people just because they are talkative they can't concentrate their mind on God that is the thing Raghavan see Ramakrishna is also telling that you should be very calm and composed don't talk mushara the money Devi she also said in that locality you should know what is where who is who everything you should know but don't talk the control of the tongue that is very very important training and here we find in the sixteenth chapter 42 words Lords the Krishna he's asking control your tongue in the Tantra we see the image of Goddess Kali the Kali is biting her tongue it also the same thing why she's biting the tongue some people would say Oh out of modesty because she was standing on her husband so when she came to know about that she became very ashamed and as a symbol of that mainly the girls they bye their tongue to show that they are ashamed but it is not the actual thing is controlling the your tongue and controlling tongue means not only the words but also the food the minimum food that is necessary for your body that also you should take the control of the tongue and then because that is the main thing the test people become mad in that control the tongue and also should not say what you are not supposed to say that is the control of your mind mono yet chair then comes the next control the whole mind and the mind is the main thoughts they are all coming over there control over there your eyes are bringing some information was a beautiful thing over there do you like to go and see your mind says in no your ear is bringing some beautiful music that sound you should mind you'd say no I am NOT going to waste my time over there the smell the touch the taste mind sin no no to all this so that is the way you have to one of our ammiji the further funny thing one of our ammiji was telling the only exercise that the diabetic people should do to go on putting their head both side no no no no no food no these know that whenever the food comes that way you have to say no to the world whatever comes mono Yatta Yatta prana anya chained trionic that means total control what is the prana the breathing and what is the breathing is doing because you have to meditate when you are excited you are very quickly breathing when you are angry and we are going to fight when go to work to see taking the exercise running that breathing becomes fast you have to control by controlling the prana yet chip ran on this world the Lord said you should meditate you should control and your chin driana Chur ultimately all the five sense organs all those organs you should control not only that atmanam Atman Archer the two art mana in the bhagavad-gita the same Lord Krishna said would read Atman art ma-na-ma-na art Nabu sada eat you have to inspire your mind with your mind don't become frustrated eva whatever things happen go on telling oh this is God's play nothing is going to happen to me I am God's child I'm sitting on the lap of the garden nothing has happened to me I am not affected by all these things that is happening on around if you go on thinking like that as the children sitting on the lap of the mother and very happily they're sitting over there and observing the the things that is going around same way we have to see it on the lap of the Divine Mother and we have to say mother hold me don't let me go out and be safe and that is the control atmanam Atma Nagato our lower mind our lower tarz they will go on pulling you to go to the world and you have to go on telling that those thoughts are not mine I am NOT going to listen to it these are the secrets how to develop in spirituality it is only we and one can help even the Supreme Lord like Lord Krishna when he is giving advices if we don't practice it then who will help we have to do it Atmaram atman archer the lower mind should be controlled with the higher mind now booyah culpa see our journey then what happens if we can do it the control complete control then you are going beyond the circle of birth and death and that is the ultimate goal of the spiritual life we take this body we take the birth why because of the desire now when we are withdrawing whole senses there is no desire no desire to see no desire to listen no desire to talk so complete withdrawn then ultimately he will go to God only and if we go to God the source then all this game display are over so you are completely free these spiritual practices are most important for - parents the Lord therefore repeated these advice again by saying in the 44 verse the smart bacha mana pran on Nia cheat mad pariah Naha the smart therefore if you have understood me if you hurt me well if you have developed the desire to be free from the bondage of birth and death then what you should do the smart butcher mana pran on Nia cheat you should control your speech mind and senses we should talk not that we should not talk but the butcher here unnecessary Robbie's thing we are going on talking most of the time whenever we go in any party in a group of people what we actually discuss all nonsense LD is there this has no value so dear you should control they need not to waste your energy by talking on that rather go on repeating the name of God so that is the control of the butcher and mana prana that's just now we explained we were discussing on that the total mind and the prana the breathing vital energy we should control and then what for IANA where you are going to give your mind you'll become my devotee MOT Parana the love of God that helps because there is someone when we can go we can talk we can pray we can fight with him the God is there just like our father and mother as a children we can go to the father and mother we can argue with them we can demand so much Paria now it doesn't mean that constantly you have to go on telling oh god how good you are etc not like that just step that that's why Raghavan see Ramakrishna he's advising us why should I have to tell all the time oh god thank you you have given my daily bread you have given my DS and then God is our Creator he's our father and mother it is his responsibility to feed us to look after us to see that we are living and good and if the God is not doing we have every right to go and fight with and that is called love for God we cannot go to fight with the neighbours but we can go and show our anger to our mother and father why because we believe that they are so close to me they will understand me they will feel why I am talking like this why I am behaving like this they love their compassion will surely come on me so that is the way we have to think mud bog tu ta ba da da da police' ma potty and through your devotion to me to God it will complete your journey in the spiritual world their journey towards the spiritual world the end of the spiritual world is this we like to realize God we like to know God we imagine so many different way one should not do that only thing whatever has been advised to do go on following that that's all now what are the advices control your mind your senses and then we draw it and give it to the guard by that way you will be free the pure mind adhara he understood that lord krishna would leave his mortal body soon he could understand that lord is decided he will go so hints wanted to know the spiritual responsibilities of different categories of people the different categories of people so what are the different categories of people you know that in the indian society they have divided in four different groups brahmacarya grhastha vanaprastha sannyasa and the would have understood the eve the Lord is not giving the instruction for them then obviously who else can give good there was a great devotee of sri krishna and when he felt that he is leaving it happened to the disciples of the lord buddha alsa when the Buddha was almost in his deathbed and their Ananda his beloved disciple he came and said please say something to us so that we can follow the way otherwise what will follow then the Buddha told him Atma Depot Vava be your own teacher your light your mind will show the path be the your let your mind be the light so that is the Atma Depot over here also the hood table is coming and he is asking the Lord you have advised to put our minds with devotion to you but son do work but without devotion we have noticed the people are working without devotion what had happened to them moreover there are different types of duties in human society how by following their own responsibilities swadharma that is the word good they were used they will develop devotion to you and achieve liberation whatever the I will quote from here that is eleventh chapter and it is 17 chapter 11 book 17 chapter verse number 6 carta a betray provoked achi Baba Madhu sadhana whenever he is going to ask some question he is giving the example why I am asking the question because he was the Katra Carta of etre product achi Baba Tama do sadhana shri krishna has the madhu shooda noed ever said give her the only originator carta you are the defender of Ikra and you are the expounder Abdallah product Archer and expounder AB Dharma our planning to Lee and you are planning to leave this world soon then religion will also die with you O Lord whoo Oh Lord will then Roebuck shotty advises guiders to he is asking the Lord to guide friends will conclude over here and in our next class we will see how the Lord the three Krishna he is guiding our people and he will give all the swadharma what a brahmacari should do what he should do what is the bond of prestige should do and the sannyasi should do the very interesting way we will go through that in our next class you are you are talking about the cinema Krishna standing in the Samadhi so that picture you can show if it is possible then you can explain the that's a good question but not connected with our study today the Vagabond see Ramakrishna he went into Samadhi and in that position you can see that he is standing the left hand near the he near his heart and the right hand showing above the two fingers it may be that the two finger one is the Ishwara another is Jeeva they do apparently they look as two but in reality they are one if you have that knowledge the giba and the Ashura are one and you develop the knowledge of the oneness then your heart becomes full with joy please so when he is holding like the left hand that is the sign of bliss as if he is holding that a full cup of the Bliss in his hand so that is the explanation we heard from our senior Swami's and some where I started I read that there's a great dancer in India he was asked because in dancing they'll be showing particularly Bharat Natyam the different the eye and the finger hand the different way the symbols by that way they express many things when they are moving their hands like this that means that the water the waves like that so he also said that this is the symbol of joy when a dancer is holding the left hand near the chest that means it is the sign of joy and the right hand of course you can say it is not - it is one apparently it looks that the giba and the issuer are different but in reality it is one thank you mantra counting see if you are I don't know from whom you have taken the initiation but normally the ramakrishna mission tradition the mantras if you it takes 20 minutes to complete 1000 time so you can count like that in one hour you can count 3,000 so by that - 18,000 you can so the two hours means 6000 that way you can count the mantra counting will be possible right that way question is from Sonic Roy sonic is asking is advaitha preferred that depends on you shown the Advaita and the dualistic approach they're both they take to the same goal the chaitanya mahaprabhu said that Ramakrishna said that and it depends on your taste the if you like to practice the the gun of our ghee then don't is very very difficult but it is possible but when you were working in the office your mind is constantly thinking in something else in the world and you are in the in the family life so obviously your family means you have to responsible for so many things is difficult for them very difficult for them to practice the ganimard for them the bhakti the duality is good [Music] Bottari and the chiba according to the Advaita Vedanta there is no that giba our abode are the pure data cable up Drita no there is no other manifest and they will say the go to father he says no there is nothing unnecessarily you are thinking and Ostrava plus a meter maybe that there are you know in the YouTube you can find that I have given the whole Astra bakra and continuing so you can hear from them that nothing is there so completely non-dualistic approach of advaitha cable Advaita no there is no Avatara but from the dualistic point of view then there is avatar because God can take different form so Avatara they are not the ordinary jeevers they come to save the jeevers the g-wiz are individual soul and they are also having the good qualities the divine qualities but at the same time they're mesmerised with the Maya attraction of these worldly things to the God comes and like a loving mother put us on the same right track and sake don't go to these and that go straight and come back to me so that is the way you can think so to question a nun yeah so you are asking that how one should behave when to or someone who is hurting so another bhagavati Ramakrishna said the way you are in the samsara so you have to protect yourself and he said you must hiss but you should not bite but that is the way if you go on quietly accepting whatever though that that person is doing or the people are doing so they will go on doing like that so you have to hiss if you read the story of vagabond see Ramakrishna you will get it more clear so you should show in such a way that it was necessary you can fight back you can heart them back but at the same time you should pray for them because their mind is deluded they are getting joy by giving pain to you so obviously you should not behave like them rather you are showing apparently that you are very strong person and you can fight back but internally go on praying for them Oh God give them some positive idea positive view I'll remove them from my life this you can pray and taken question taking the name of God is japa you can take any name and you can count but it is better to take the name from a guru so that he the Guru will guide you how one should do and this a guru means in the ramakrishna mission or in the Sarada mission if you go you can get that guru and the guru will give you the gods name but that has a different word and that is very important i cannot tell you here and that is important with that world which comes down from the Guru parampara from the lineage of the gurus that helps and but that this answer will be simple repeating the name of God is japa all you see that in the Gyana yoga in ghana yoga what you are doing you are withdrawing the senses saying from the all the say from the sense objects and the sense organs you are controlling you are acting now naturally that is the work that you are doing maybe you are not going to feed the poor but you are fighting with your own senses and great activity goes on by that way and that is the yoga and also karma and then you are having a great faith on the self or the Brahman or the God that is devotion the same way all the four in the devotional way you are also having that activity your ding the sandal sandal wood and plucking the flower to give it to God are cooking for God are bathing to go to a temple all activities a singing bhajan taking the name of God all activities karma so devotion and Karma then you go and then forget all the people around and go and look at the eyes of the guard and pray to God please look at me so that is also the meditation at the same and these always go why should I go to God that is gana when you are discriminating when you are judging that is the gana so in every steps you will find all the fours are come together and that is the reason Xiaomi Vivekananda he gave the Ramakrishna mission the symbol of the all the four yoga's the Ramakrishna mission we follow practice all the four juggers in the same way but some Swami or some devotee may be interested in ghana our bhakti or karma or the yoga they may give much attention to that but all the four Yuga's we are supposed to practice and if you analyze the symbol of the ramakrishna mission and that is the combination of all the four yoga's [Music] [Music] good christian tanya selfless love for god how to develop so the practice makes a person perfect so you have to practice how you will practice simply all the time you have to go on praying to God and say I only want you and nothing else I don't want success in my life I don't want anything any comfort in my life I only and you oh my god so if you go on practicing that that this will make you the perfect but for that two things are necessary one is the complete faith in the existence of God the God is there though I cannot see God I cannot touch God I cannot hear God but hundred percent I believe there is God so then you are praying then you are doing everything you are cooking a good food and offering to God and say please taste it and be happy but you need not to bless me and if you like to bless me appear before me so like that constantly in everything if you can do the first is the tremendous faith in the existence of God that is called sirata the serta and then second is the idea the constant because after three days four days seven days to months you will feel tired oh what I am doing so you need some something tangible no because of the SIRT the God is there though I can't see but that God is listening to me he is looking at me he's seeing me with that faith continuously you have to go on praying praying and praying so the that mental strength is necessary to reach to this ultimate that pure love for God mmm okay it's not my job ah we're talking less will people judge you as a not very clear to me they let them talk that is that let them judge but they not that you are not talking but do that those talks which are fruitful beneficial that only you should do if you have read the right of your ceramic Krishna he went along with motor bubble to Kashi and motor uber who was a German des has a landlord wherever they go they will have the friends like that and they were discussing about the business if we purchase paddy from here and it is cheap then we can sell it in the Bengal so all this business talk was going on ceramic is not started crying mother where you have brought me and these people are constantly talking about the money so I was so happy when I was in dictionary so you have to decide that what type of talk you should have if you are sincere about God realization the major time you should talk to God or listen to God or if you have a good friend and the company then discuss about the God are some passages that you have read from a scripture then you can discuss among your friends so that is called the Bacchus young Yama not that constantly there keeping mom not is not not that not talking of the worldly things but suppose you are you have gone to market to purchase and your purchase potato tomato you have to talk to the the the Sailor hey how much it cost so be practical when we say the Box angam it doesn't mean that you have to be mom all the time but control your tongue so that it is not telling unnecessary things I think that much thank you there's a good questions and I thank all the to up those and particularly you are listening very seriously and I thank you for that let us conclude with this mantra young Bramha varuna indra root trauma root our student ID paystub i'ii
