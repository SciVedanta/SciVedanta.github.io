[Bhagavatam 062 : For the Soul there is neither Bondage nor Liberation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1I2_MyuewQ)

but as usual we will chant a mantra Shanta Karim puja gaerste annum but the mana solution Vishwa Dharam Goggin Assad regime me governor Nam shabanam Lakshmi contemn Kamala jnanam you give heed the Anakim Bundy Bishan 'm Bob Arum Sarah below quicken their devotees and frames it is a very special day and on this particular day will be discussing thus soul is neither bound not liberated this is the main theme of the bhagavata Raghavan Sri Krishna will be stressing on this particular knowledge those who were regularly following this class that you know that would dhaba the great devotee of sri krishna for his own clarification asked the Lord three questions which we have already discussed in our last discourse the first question was if we the Jeepers are born out of Maya's three qualities then it is obvious no one of us will be able to go beyond Maya's gunas then what is the way out to the very valid question so we know the the Lord the God he said we the G bizarre born out of Maya and Maya's power what is the power of Maya three gunas and one power is covering another power removing so these are the five things the mine is having this is associated with the god and the god power and we the hindus believe that through this power God has created this universe and it is very very rational why we will come to that afterwards and many a times the be daunting when they are discussing they always they discuss on this because this is a very vital question from where we have come so that is the source of the creation is very important science is also trying to understand it find it out in their from their own point of view how this world has come the book Big Bang Theory and all that now going on research is going on but the baton thing they have reached to that that will come but the now the question if we are out of my arse we are the product of the Maya we cannot go beyond Maya that this is very obvious what is the way out second question can there be two types of soul one is bound and another is liberated if yes how to distinguish between them so this is also the wonderfully placed how we will know the who is liberated and who is bound third question of the dubber is the same soul bound and free in a bound soul and the free soul are the same whatever being a true devotee wanted to know the tattwa reality of his beloved god now always we think that that realistic approach the bhakti marg the path of devotion is all emotional no not at all how that can be inshaa me we wake on the side in the ultimate the devotion and the knowledge of the same how can you say that because they both take us to the same goal what is the goal truth the reality and what is the reality the unchanging consciousness evil present this is the reality and approach to that to reach to that knowledge one is following the path of knowledge another or in the devotion here we find the mixture in the Bhagavata in the it will find the mixture and this tatata and truly if we don't understand then in the religion hypocrisy comes gob met ISM comes we're from the dogmatism comes because the person who is explaining that religion is himself is not very clear about it so he says whatever I say you must have to follow it or go away so this is we have to understand when we have realized the truth we have also realized that that can be reached through different ways different paths and there cannot be any contradictory the goal the that is the same when one is approaching the Mount Everest and it can start his journey from Nepal or from China from India may be many other so then slowly when there on the summit when there on the top of that experience would be the same so that is exactly what Bhagwan see Ramakrishna say now this hot water when you understand that that water in the bhagavad-gita also the Lord Krishna said you mam BT tatata the one who can to stand me in reality what is this God then marinus will never come God is all pervading God is all love God is all unselfishness how the narrowness will come but we find the some of the people some are the teachers I should say so-called teachers so they are constantly going on harping on this my path is the best our ways are the best that is for you no problem then we were criticizing others the Krishna is telling this knowing the essence the truth the reality of God and this creation that is called tucked water then the other ones Rakesh nough began his reply by saying in the bhagavatam we know but the Moktar it Ibaka do not owe me No vastu Taha goon asha Maya mullah Namie moksha no bond annum very simple Sanskrit do to understand they enjoy due to my gunas that is my power what are the gunas sattva Raja anthem on one sees the soul as bound or free the wane we see the world through the prism we see the world in different way and it is simple we can say suppose we are looking out to the field through a class which is tinted with Yolo what we will see everything is your know if it is green everything is green but actual reality is different it is not great it is not green it is not yellow we look through the glass and we find like that just like that the Maya we find it just like that and it says that butter and mocked up we find that we think that we are bound but the moment we you think that you are not bound you're not bound of course only thinking we won't do because that reaction will also come in your behavior slowly it will come and why this Maya mullet work because the prism because the glass through which we are looking at the world is Maya and because of that now today you know the devotees and friends you all know that this is a great day for the Christian and also for the Jewish community the Christians all over the world are celebrating Easter and the Jewish communities are celebrating Passover the Passover is a liberation and it was under the leadership of the Moses and the Easter is also liberation of the spirit demonstrated by Jesus Christ and look at it and today we are touching this because we are also talk about the liberation and bondage in a Christian whole world they are also celebrating the Easter because on that particular day the Jesus from his crucification he resurrected he again he came up and he went out so that is called the complete liberation and Passover is also in the Jewish community they were under the subjugation of the Romans and they were tormented the law Moses came and he took them out there's a story that called the Exodus and there it says the modak Moses guided them took them and ultimately on the Mount Sinai the Moses received he saw the godfest ways and received the Ten Commandments so they celebrate the Passover they eat nice food they invite the frames - that is Christianity also the same Good Friday when the Jesus was crucified as a Friday he was crucified they call it Good Friday and and that was the third day after the crucification that Jesus was resurrected 30 means Sunday so they call this Sunday is the Easter the celebration so this is the history on Thursday the day before his crucification Jesus observed Passover he was by birth the Jews so naturally he was celebrating the Passover with his disciples and he gave them he failed them which is famous as Last Supper during the feast Jesus took the bread broke it and gave it to his disciples saying this is my body is symbolic he is breaking the bread telling this is my body then he took the cup of wine and blessed it and gave to his fall were saying this is my blood even the Christians they take the small part of the braid and a little sip of wine thinking the body and blood what's the significance the body would be broken like the bread and the blood would be poured out like the wine that means he is going to die you knew it it was the Thursday evening supper and Jesus was eating with his disciple he knew that he is going to be arrested next day and he'll be crucified and he'll be again resurrected everything in new why that's why the Hindus they accept him as an avatar I am NOT entering into that discussion and then some other time we may but this avatar the conception of a Bottari the God Himself comes out and takes the form and here the conception of the Christendom and they think that is a son of God is not directly God but a part of God that he came and he was a beloved son and the God he sacrificed him so that he can come and guide the people and take their scene etc that is their theology that is their idea but from the Benanti point of view we will discuss you try to understand how it goes when the Jesus said the breaking the bread this is my body that means this is temporary it will die the breaking the bread is the symbolism of the temporariness of the body and second the blood is a part of the body Jesus clearly knew what would happen to him the next day and then why because he knew the body and the spirit of separate he was not afraid he was not afraid that he is going to die why because he knew that used the spirit free will quote from the the Bible that where he said that I am going going to again enjoying this food and drink with my father do you'll come to that no spirit shall me be weakened and also Harvard the same idea and in his language I will quote Jesus had no other thought except that he was a spirit again and again body and the period do we have to remember it we are very much aware of the body but not very much aware or some of the times we are not at all aware about our soul about the spirit he says Jesus at no other thought except that he was a spirit look at this sentence the Wayne we think that this is a body then I and mine that conception comes and this body is the cause of not only bondage the body is the cause of this some solder this samsara this bondage these all changes everything because of the conception of the body and Jesus was not at all having that no other thought that he was a spirit he said show me Vivekananda is mentioning don't think that you are tyrannize for within you is something that can never be troubled never be killed those who have read the bhagavad-gita and naturally will understand why in the second chapter raagh about Shri Krishna was the almost the same way to the original Arjuna was thinking that he is going to kill people he never thought that he is going to die he was a hero and he was thinking that he is going to kill but he was sorry why because those who were standing against him they were his kith and kin his relatives so he was thinking he is going to kill and the Krishna said no you cannot you are only going to destroy the body which is temporary even if you don't kill some date is going to be destroyed but in reality again the Tatra the reality they're all self self you cannot destroy Jesus himself thought constantly every moment that he is the spirit he never thought he is the body this is the highest realization of the spirituality second he also knew that all around him the people who were so much of afraid of death and that he said that you are not going to be killed he never talked of this world and of this life he wanted to get hold of the world as it is give it a push and drive it forward and onward until the whole world had reached the effulgent light of God until everyone had risk realized their spiritual nature until his death was vanquished so this is what shall maybe become the state about the Jesus Christ and it is in the complete works of xiaomi vivica and the fourth volume it is there and he said in this way because he was also the man of knowledge knowing that this world is nothing but the spirit because we don't understand that don't think that we are afraid of death and we are tormented of course the body will die either today or tomorrow but not the spirit so it understand that no death means no cessation no destruction of the Spirit so the first sentence he said the Jesus had no other thought except that he was a spirit body which is made of five elements get destroyed but the spirit remain unaffected the Hindus they always they are there in their explanation they say everything is made of five great elements punch abuta and the sponge abuta shitty are pottage Madrid Wilma that means the this art the water the ear the space and the fire so this five is making the whole world including our body and mind to so this is the conception of the Hindus of the creation the puncher booth and because it is the mixture of five is going to be destroyed because it is not one the mixture of five but obviously with the nature of the law it will be destroyed so it is going to be Bhagwan Shree Krishna taught this truth to Arjuna in the second chapter of the gita sloka 17 and 18 we get this idea very clearly in 17 he said Avinashi to todd bt inna Serban eden satin finish on a bias here now custard carton are a tea let me break it and explain it will be easy one is inna sarvam idam tatam inna that servin eden Tatem everything that we see around totem is a saturated pervaded that which is all-pervading inna sarvam idam tatam this pervading abena she to taught VT know for certain to be indestructible or banaji or means negative bernard means destruction so no destruction indestructible and what is that - Tod with D that about which I just said which is all pervading that is indestructible know it for certain should not have any doubt about it and then it says none has the power to destroy these abkhazia abaya means immutable and because it is the spirit and because it is the soul because it is the consciousness no one can destroy it but after diseases in the eighteenth verse anta Banta Madia NIT disrupt our chelina on our sheena a premier sia to smother you dear Shibata here he is inspiring the bharatas arjuna to fight to perform his his own responsibility his own religion swadharma but first he says 'i made aha these bodies anta bantha are said to have an end anta Bonta ma the half emedia these bodies santa banta art said to have it now we have to notice the spirit of the self is not undestructible but the body is destructible anta Banta it has an anta and aimed so unter Bunter ma they are this is the other end but the question is whose body very nicely it is very interesting nicosia eva changeless on our sheena indestructible a premium of premier SIA and then share Irina is the dweller illimitable a premiership you cannot it you cannot explain you cannot prove so that is a premiership Romina this pramana and a premier you cannot give any example or prove it why to prove you need another thing just like that otherwise it is impossible sometimes we say is a vast field like the sky field I am giving an example of the sky sky is also vast field is also very big so that way you need a second one separate something to give an example to prove it you need a place you need a time you need form name to prove but the art man the brahman the spirit has nothing of all those but it is enshrined in the body so these two things we must keep in mind again and again because it's little confusing the body is going to die it is destructible but the Spirit which is indwelling the body with the power of which we can talk we can see we can cognize we can think so many things that is the power but that is indestructible and changeless so hunter Bonta emedia NICTA sook Tasha reading aha oh no Sheena a premier Jie thus Margit the Shibboleth as a neat dear it is eternal changeless on our sheena indestructible and it has not no second one so that you can prove it you cannot prove now the prove if we go the bed ante again it says if there are three different ways we can prove so that is another is a big subject out how the knowledge can be reached through the you have to prove it otherwise how people will accept it just an imagination it is not possible but there are different ways there's a vast subject this inertia nap Romania so this self is in a structure which we call it body and body is temporary destructible but the soul not on this statement if it is Oracle question can be raised are there two existences body and the spirit so this is the Indian Way of thinking the moment you say there is only one he comes at okay there's only one reality then when you think that body is also there that means the body is a reality is an existence and self is also there so two realities two existences on the table of the Last Supper Jesus told breaking the braid this is my body which will break and offering the car this is my blood which will spill then he said this is what I meant then he said verily I say unto you I will drink no more of the fruit of the vine until that day that I drink it new in the kingdom of God his expression is a different way but what he said the body will break it will be destroyed but the Spirit which is there whose body Jesus body who is Jesus spirit so these two things we must have to understand whose cloth is this shirt is this this is shopman on this so now I am NOT the shirt I am only wearing the shirt that's all this body belongs to he shot Miranda but I'm not the body I'm only having this body for some work so these are the thing we will come to the finest point very subtle way to explain it and Raghavan Krishna in the bhagavata he will explain and this is what he said I am going to drink but not with this body a completely different in the kingdom of God that means eternally I'll be there and I will enjoy this the food and the drink that you are having now in this earth on this earth with his body that I am giving up now the resurrection sometimes it could be very easy that Jesus and on this particular Easter this resurrection the whole Christendom is based the Christianity founded on this particular day and with this action of Jesus the Jesus rose from the dead and then the story goes that he actually was resurrected with the body and they came and they didn't find any body over there in the cave where they kept it etc etcetera there may be a lot of questions led hours and explanation this is okay there's a different thing but for us with the Krishna was dead but at the same time Krishna is eternal Rama was dead at the same time Rama is eternal ceramic is 'nobody was burnt but at the same time Sadam Oh Krishna is eternal we cannot understand it very easily why the body is nothing but it covered but the spirit in that is completely different my body will be destroyed but my spirit is eternal that was the teaching on this particular day this Sunday the Easter from this point Hindus drag the idea to understand whether the body all this phenomenal world has existence then burger bun Tichenor says no it's not having any existence the 11th chapter begins with this answer due to Maya this body this world appears to be existing so we just read but the Mokpo ET baqia guna da minha bestowed aha do not on me my gunas not booze to taaha goon asha maya Molitor and the gunas at the Maya mula from the Maya only the boon has come Namie moksha no bandana now to understand these two lined words on Sura Bhagwan Shree Krishna we have to understand the God and his power the God is absolute and he has a power and with that power he is creating now sometimes some people will ask why is creating and when he is creating ours the people we are suffering most of the time we are suffering now look at the whole world each and every one from different part of the world the phone calls are coming Shami G what is the situation there how do you also look look down and they are closed and what about your food on all this I am also asking the same question each and every one all over the world now we are all inside the rooms and the buildings so one situation now this is a thing that is happening but it doesn't mean that we are unhappy why because we know that this is also temporary someday this will go so many things came and they go but the spirit if we can understand then we can become eternal why this happen because of the Maya who created this Maya God what is this Maya God's power and this God is creating creating out of himself and here comes the answer then this if we can understand the God has created us out of his own image as the Christians say the God has created from himself the either if you think that you are real your God and God is eternal you cannot die you cannot have this type of suffering so there must be something wrong what is that wrong idea because I am thinking this world which is the projection of the God's power we are thinking that these as real now when you go to the movie when we see the projected things on that the white screen if we take that as real then we'll suffer so the same way we are looking at this world and this is the understanding and no moksha no bandana and when it is not there no question of bondage no question of liberation so here we will come to this conclude in this way began take they talk about two realities with absolute reality another is empirical reality absolute reality is a param arctica satya empirical reality is the Babu erica's of T what is the absolute reality pairen articles idea that we are spirit what is the empirical reality Gowariker sathya that we are body and the spirit is within our this body to understand this we can think of the children's world this is a church a children's world and also the grown-ups world the children they can talk to their dolls they can hear the words of the dog dolls and the doll is crying dog is hungry I have to give him food the children are playing that and they are so much engaged in it for them it is completely truth we have also passed to that so we know a time was there when we used to think these are all true naima is of course our childhood days and not present as different because most of the children has right from their two years or three years they become so much advanced in the technology and all those things they may be different I don't know but still the child's world is different is the most on the imagination and when they are playing with their dolls still I saw the girls actually they're having their dolls and the teddy bears and all that they are sleeping with them talking with that so they are happy with all their association but the grown-up cannot be a grown-up cannot be happy with a doll and even have you seen the grown-up is holding a doll in his hand and going somewhere in the efficient no it cannot be so obviously the whole thing are different but both are you men the child is also human a grownup is also a human and one time a human is thinking all those dolls are talking that is also truth but the grown-up through his experience he understand no it is not true the are they two different they are but according to the situation both are real that's why xiaomi Vivekananda very uniquely mentioned we traveled from lower truth to upper truth lower truth to higher truth not from wrong to right or false to right lower truth there is also truth and that exactly what the Hindus they accept s Babu Hari curse Athiya empirical reality this body we are taking care of then I am giving this talk and I am Telling again and again that I am the spirit we are all spirit but at the same time I am taking care I am having the social distances washing my hand not going out as possible why I am following that fear of death unnecessarily why should I go and die like that so this is at the same time I am Telling something and behaving some other way no the Babu Harika Satya and param Arctica Satya one is empirical truth another is absolute truth in absolute truth I am the spirit and the self but at the same time right now I am not having that conception had I then I would have behaved completely different way as the Lord would the deed when he was entering into a jungle the people cautioned him told himself please don't go him there is a person very cruel he will kill you just was little thing that you were having with you and his name is angry mala the ungli mala Anjali means the finger so that person the Descartes is to kill and then is to cut the finger of that person that he killed to keep it count how many people he has killed but the Buddha knew that he can change so Buddha entered into that jungle and then he transformed the mind of that terrible person Angulimala so this is possible Jesus he knew that he is going to be captured tortured and will be crucified and they will put his body to death he knew it very well but at the same time in the Bible stories we all know but at the same time he was not afraid why he realized the truth the Shankaracharya when he came to the eastern part of india and there is in nowadays Assam the practice for our shaman are there is a beautiful temple then one person came he was chile's of Shankar's popularity he wanted to kill him and he came in at all you are a big Anton you don't believe in the existence of the body you're the spirit can you offer your body to me so that I will offer your aid at the feet of my goddess but that is the tantric away sacrificing Shankara without hesitation today why not if you think that killing me he will get the greatest benefit I am ready so this is possible this is possible Swami Vivekananda came over here and in his biography it is written he went to the Southern America and he was describing about the self and when he was telling the same way as we are discussing about the self a group of boys came the Cowboys at the same and they told you say that you were everywhere and you are not at all afraid of your death right he said yes immediately they took out the gun and started shooting all around him and the bullets were passing by his side over the hay but the schwa me was completely unperturbed he never moved he was not at all afraid so these people proves this truth that there is a part of mark Takai shot and also a babylonica shot here the show come on how you come to come dijo a party jamya where's the realized soul feel now the children can talk about with their dolls but the grown-up cannot but it doesn't mean the children's are completely wrong no that is a world and according to their knowledge that world is also true such Swami Vivekananda's world you should remember that there is a truth but lower truth the wind someone say this tree is a go of God or this symbol that's a cross the thing that if I am holding the cross the ghost cannot come no bad thing will happen why not that is also religion then some people are thinking about the other other way so this I am drinking this water the holy water and be cured so many faiths so many beliefs so many ways they are thinking Hindus accept everything this is the beauty of the Hindus the Hindus they accept everything and monotheism is there they only accept only one God and God with all form without name but at the same time the same Hindu they will accept if someone says showing a small piece of the stone this is my God why because they know God is all pervading and we are taking this form or the things only to concentrate our mind only to understand the truth so these children's world one day will break and we will stand in the reality with the knowledge so that is where they say show come uncle Xu come to come dig her apathy jamya grief and infatuation shoka and more home sue come and do come happiness and misery as well as ticking body are all due to Maya this the shoka and the more the grief and infatuation at the same time Shu come and do come the happiness and the misery a disease because of the body and because of the Maya the don't we should not misunderstand this happiness we always say anandhi Vakula imani bhutani jayante from the happiness only from the joy only everything has come the basis of all this is nothing but the happiness this joy so as a dream in a fiction of the mind so that transmigration is not a reality in them we find it over here that Shri Krishna he is mentioning the show come o house to come to come d hope with tamiya sadhna yatta like the dream now another example I was giving the example of the children's world and the grown-ups they have another the thought world that is Swapna if the Sapna is good that you are becoming rich and you are becoming successful in your endeavor how you will think you'll be happy and you will always say I saw this dream and in India they say if you see the dream in the early morning then that dream is going to be true the conception so obviously people those who are seeing the dream just before their their sleep breaks in the early morning and if it is a very positive dream they're so happy if it is negative then they will go to this man and that man this holy temple that holy temple please save me please save me is this true or not so this is the way we always goes the shortener also the even though it is a nothing but the friction of the mind but even then we take it as so seriously when we are dreaming but in reality it is not true in dream I found that I have been chased by a tiger and I was perspiring running shouting for help everything was going on that was true at that moment but when you break the dream and in the wiki waking stage what do you think think about it similarly the similarly the Vedanta says here the in the Bhagavata Raghavan Shri Krishna is telling this your shoka Mohar cyka cyka these are all from the Maya but this moment we are not understanding it you're just listening to it or reading trying to think oh how that is possible y'all life is nothing but the suka suka a time will come those who are pursuing the spiritual life and they will reach in a height a position like the Buddha like the Christ like the the vagabonds Sri Ramakrishna like the Moses from that point we can understand oh yes it is true this body it was only suffering this body it was only enjoying but I am eternal so it says in this way and then in the third verse beta a BT Mamata No badou debauchery Rinna moksha but Tucker e rd my eye on me we need BT we discuss in details in our next discourse so you have to continue the answer of Shri Krishna in our next class also why because it's a beautiful way giving different example he's going to give the answer of the three questions we will find out how he is giving the answers he is telling I have Maya and Maya as the good and the bad altar and the Maya as a power of superimposition and also removing it let's call a bit de Maya and bit de Maya orbit dia all means negative it is wrong knee science so when the orbit dia I am super imposing that which is God I see that this world I see this world as world I see this world as temporary I see this world as so many varieties as long as the Vedanta says as long as you see so many in variety in multiplicity then you are ignorant and the moment you see the one behind all these differences you are knowledge you have that knowledge so when this our master Marcia those who have read the biography of ceramic is new you know he is actually rude the conversation all the dialogue he recorded of course only for four years but that is a great source and this master Marcia mine Denard Gupta fast when he made ceramic is not asked him about this question the Ghani and Afghani and master mache was not knowing what is Gianna which is Organa and just like ours in ordinary people I don't have much knowledge about this lions are the mathematics or these or that that way he said my wife is good the good lady but ignorant because she never attended the schooling in those days that was very natural for the ladies in India and why India all over the world that was the same norm only but it is simply the ladies the god of the girls the god this opportunity to learn to get educated but adding those that he gave them and he used the word that he is ignorant immediately see Ramakrishna reviewed him scolded him saying and do you thing that you were a man of knowledge naturally he was confused too what is it and what was the answer of Sri Ramakrishna knowing meaning is ignorance and knowing one is knowledge and that is exactly world shri krishna is telling through my power one is bound how it is bound how the person is bound he sees meaning and through my power again the man is liberated how he sees one that is the whole thing so we will read it afterwards and the dream in the friction as we see of the mind that is also the transmigration again and again we are taking birth and we are dying all these thoughts only if we could go beyond this that is why they say that they become fearless and they become so happy so happy and Friends thank you and I congratulate both the Christian sisters and brothers and also the Jewish sisters and brothers in the celebration and this is the Hindu approach in the way of understanding the spirit the cell understanding the resurrection and also we can explain this we try to explain this with the help of our scripture which is bhagavata let us conclude with these words yum Brahm ha Varun drew tremor Ruta student ID be stably be the stronger pas de creme owe pana shadi ii guarantee um sama god Donna was dicta that the Catena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah yes yan thomna be due surah surah gana the Varia thus me namah om shanti shanti shanti he heard eeo [Music] let us pray to this Almighty God that the humanity be free from all the suffering that the humanity's passing through those who have succumbed to this suffering who have passed away we pray for their souls when you read the tears it comes to our eyes at the time of death they cannot see their near and dear ones after the death the body cannot be taken care by their relatives by his relatives of our relatives the so pathetic but the situation is so so we have to understand this and we have to accept it from the point of view of the Spirit we have to say no you are not suffering you are evil free like that Jesus was free so this is we should pray and pray to the Almighty God whatever the suffering you wanted to give to the unit the human being you have already given now please for forgive us and give us back the normal life give us back the happiness Oh Shanti Shanti Shanti
