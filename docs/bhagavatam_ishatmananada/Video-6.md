[Bhagavatam 010 - A Guide to Liberation: Last Advices Of Bheesma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oyfKxYAYrw)

and today we'll be discussing a beautiful and very important subject that is the advices of the Bhishma of course when we have seen how the flower they read us some advice last advice of the visions not one and one he has even so many advices advices of the Peshwa and before that let us begin with this sloka we will be daunting but Vedanta has three different schools one school it says you are that divine and seconds could say you're the part of the divine and the third could say God is different you are different you had to reach to God now when we are discussing the parameter we are discussing from that third point of view the God is different and we are different who is that God Shawn would you got Shia now but the Minar Solutions vishwanadham governess atresia me Capernaum shuhang let me calm down Kamala nayana you give me John Young Bundy Bishnu father hiya Adam server below Creek now this Vishnu is the master of all the locals of all the places that is the important thing the Vishnu is that God who is holding everything tourism the God is different I am different but in that same dwelling we find monism because God is one and he is all-pervading and he is holding the everything from him everything has come and what we are going to do going back to the source and in different ways that the Hindus they have given the broad idea you can go you can approach from different viewpoints that is the beauty of the Hinduism there's no narrowness if you think in this way that God is different from you proceed if you think that God is within you okay so that way we are now that have ever come that we are studying is the brain bucum love love of God and how to develop that love through different stories slowly slowly we are reaching towards that not today who you'll be reading and discussing about how the Richmond the great Edith who was lying on the weight of arrows and waiting for his God to come before leaving the body and he waited for a long period of time and not this we will discuss today and just for the reminder Bhishma when he saw Krishna Krishna was very young Bhishma was a very senior one but even then that time before death the priest Bhishma is praising Krishna why the Krishna is no other than the same Vishnu Krishna is that avatar this is a wonderful conception of the Hindus the Abu Taha accounts about the Hulman he's coming taking the human form and to help us to guide us that is the prisoner serve our mana who is that he is the soul of all serve our mana how can you be in a person but even then he is on powerful the god is all-powerful obviously God can any form he likes so that is the way is Delhi you are the sole and Sony is not having any form and he was the so the consciousness of each and every ping I know that but for me you are Bishop and the same Vishnu you have come before me as Krishna Sun God mana summitry show you are the same sighted there is no difference God can never make any difference because God is everything all that we have have it is created from God only God has created how the same person can say I differentiate even the father can say is son no I don't like you will go away from my house but the god in levels of that well he will go whose everything is nothing but the god suit easly summit ratio order yourself a hunk retail hardware no difference do we have to keep in mind the Richmond is worshiping a personal God Richmond is a symbol of the Hindus he is worshiping a personal God but what is that personal God how he is understanding the personal God accepting the personal God you are the soul of all and he was same sighted and without any difference and without any ego if anyone say I am the God and he is showing his ego he can never be the God or she can never be the goddess the ego is completely different thing that takes us completely in a different way and that is God original scene in the Christian methodologies with the Christian books they are telling that as a original scene we see that same thing as ego the ego is differentiating and God is completely free from evil dr. Eaton motivation Mira but dear sir naka steel in all work the God the soul of all the incited non-dual devoid of egoism and free from all tenants never failed humiliation or evasion he never failed humiliation the when we go and criticize God friends those who have read the biography of ceramic Krishna don't think that I am a follower of ceramic Krishna never eaten and coatings artist this is the example the Saran Tichenor was humiliated before everyone in the day life and in Calcutta by Greece Chandra Govich to say brain it is known and that serum is 'no never mind anything when the decision came and worshipping his feet that time also he was not related that is the quality of God so it says that God has no humiliation are in Asian Bhishma was crying and he was telling Arjuna he was telling the Judas tree actually four canes are in its the judicial he was telling did you notice just to fulfill my prayer my Lord has come to me in person as Krishna he do see that Krishna is my god is that my god has gone in person as Krishna he may take many other forms also so that is the beauty Bhishma is kind enjoy why he decided I am NOT going to leave this body till my God before me then only I believe so he waited waited and waited for a long time and then afterwards he came the toffee he can't the capitation assured the devotee they come under after twists constantly praying to God to see him to them after the devotee God Himself is coming can you imagine the compassion of God that he is crying and telling Obama can't beaten yet Asuna that Jada sasha fish national arbiter now afterwards in that 23rd snooker it sees is the ninth chapter this is baccarat chemin oh yes mean Bachar genomica time the urgent believer am a yoga which is a comical movie he's explaining about the darshan of God just before death if one can see God he's free from this bondage brain so we don't we don't truly understand this we are religious people and there is not a single person here in this world who won't say that I'm RELIGIOUS some people they say without the confirmation confusion they do not understand but the what is religion religion is going beyond the bondage because the Karma anything that we are thinking is a bondage karma and thinking son it gains someone I am thinking to destroy some something oh that karma is binding us we do not know so one should be very very careful dr. bishop the great Richmond is getting ready to leave his body and brain his the god to be present at the moment of his death why is convinced that if one died keeping his mind stand first on God and repeat his holy name then that after death becomes free from all desires what is the bondage what are the bondages desires there's so many varieties of desires full within our mind we go to Temple we offer some the some sweets and fruits to God we think we are religious person we are not hurting others we are not getting these than that that is only the beginning of religion and religion is realization what's wrong if you become the same so those who are really sincere we must understand these we enjoy about time any jams immediately we go out and be the good nothing wrong but afterwards again we'll come back to this world again we'll take some human form or other forms again we'll have to pass through how many times we will do it how many times that is the question in devout Hindu there's how many times very clean and again and again the anxiety and so many things goes on happening in the library even then if we think we are happy who had enjoy the world but if you are really thinking so the Bhishma is sitting like this the gate whoopty because no desire when there is no desire desire for the worldly things which are all temporary I want a wonderful body temporarily you will become more someday there is no other way richness something you have to leave all the your properties and then you are completely alone now what we will do allow it to previously some of the Kings particularly in China we saw the thousands of the sovereign states to kill after the death of the king who will serve the king so they kill the serpents and put their bodies also along with the Kings and any Queen that used to love the bad luck for our they will kill her and then it would out there this is all wrong conservation and party were so serious about it and so many years they practice this system why ignorance we are also doing so many things why ignorance no result at all rather opposed it result is coming so we have to understand the scripture from this life getting the hint that Fishman is going to leave his body and then remembering the advice of the Krishna go and learn from Bhishma because all these days you were fighting all these days you were preparing now you are going to be the king what should be the duty of the King King is the top man he is the head of the whole country if the king is just everyone will be happy if the king is not everything goes bad there so it's so much of importance has been given on the character of the Kings and in many other places also they have given who should be them what are the qualities of the great administrators the kingly duties Raja Dharma one of our great prime minister he used to say he mentioned again and again in India what is that Raja Dharma that you have to take care each and every one how as you children so that is the idea as you children southern Raja she was having the 100 1000 children the ought 1000 children King and you know that the Grateful Teamcenter is the end and the conjunction of the Ganga and the Bay of Bengal the Shah gurdy the whole came over the earth and that story goes in that way and it is 1000 suns of the key is it possible no they were not soldiers but the King used to look upon them have sleep they were his children so this is the that's why Krishna told look at it the God himself and advised the Judy student but he was not at this file then the God he didn't say all this thing he said you better go to Bhishma and learn from him why God wanted that his devotee should be accepted in that rag Bhishma was not only a great leader he could kill that a time thousands of people not that he was a great devotee he was a kyani with the karma yogi so for the Bhishma then the suitor remember their suitor who is telling the story of the world bhagavata that suitor the narrator of the story he is telling to all the Moonies who assembled over there Judas Tara that are karna after hearing that Acharya after hearing that Yudhisthira the King what he did he went to that person Bhishma shayana Harappa you're a sheriff Angela shut up Angela means on the bed of arrows why he is mentioning like that bit of arrows we can imagine imagine how painful it will be we don't try who at least one arrow you can just touch and see how it will be and Richmond was lying on the hundreds of the Toulouse and so nicely he was sleeping and there can you imagine the control of the mind and that Bhishma she was lying over there prepared himself to die ready to die because he has already seen his own God now this boy judicially is going to him and pitamaha oh my grandfather please teach me what are turnes a preacher he is asking dividend our Imam we determine different type of Dharma friends we have to remember the moment we said Alma immediately our mind goes to some type of ritualistic work the Dharma so the different type of rituals appear that of course Dharma but the revealer Dharma means varieties of duties that also has been addressed as thermal so this dividend Armand resina honest Renaud on Regina one swing town the Rishi's wear their heart fulfill you a delicious they were completely dedicated for research those who were researching must consider themselves regimes they're going on constantly thinking and developing a new thing different regions are there so this Regina they were all sitting over there why the new that the --brush 'mobile advised and is very very helpful so wherever the great people they are giving some discourses we must go and listen and learn from them so Rishi's aren't there why look at me this is the time of Mahabharata is not the time of Ramayana at a time of Ramayana Sri Ramachandra he never discussed about all this only between he and his guru the high Vedanta philosophy but here in the Mahabharata that time the society and already been fixed over here but even then in that society also we wanted some rules and regulations for the people what we should do and what we should not do and that way they are doing Rishi's are eager to learn from the Bhishma so Judas - da da Arcana what you distill apart the rich man is telling I am satisfied he heard about that and immediately decided oh my god Vishnu is going to give up his body I will never be able to know and Vishnu was lying down on the sharpen jury he was lying on the bed of arrows why the Sutra is mentioning that that is the beauty when you see the life of Bhagwan Ramakrishna is in great pain even then when the people are coming immediately he is telling them that you should do this you should not do this advices the great Souls they are so eager to guide the human being right tell my children and if they are not following these they will suffer so much of love for these people which miles in that condition he is telling that okay I will tell you the truth no I wish man but the Englishman the word has been used dr. Reid Bhishma the truth no one he knew the truth truth of everything about whom we find in the new sergeant barber dear Christian ceiling in the Mahabharata Russian Baba Bhavani bhai Saab read about the Bhishma Krishna is telling robbing you is versa predator weather during the words and a particular Indian words and the Hindi also the Haskalah low one lady was telling and who that was gusto that is in Hogwarts the most Roscoe it should be uncool instead of Monaco with respect and she was not knowing that the Hindi but wanted to tell the hindi anushka lay low and the boss looked at hard and frowning the manager immediately the other present of knowledge she does not be indeed don't take it so seriously so the language this is really heavy and sometimes some people will come they're learning Bengali to be Knollys but born over here not normal then they will come and tell me three bushel chicks are two years I'm sitting over here but up near Sachin that means with respect have you come so aren't coming like that not that she wanted to insert me but he had the word that is when you move on and we still in that Krishna the God the God is telling his own disciple and we just discussed the Bhishma so eagerly waiting to see the Krishna and without Krishna he has decided not to leave the body he is waiting in that condition that Krishna giving so much of respect why because the God is present within every why do you go and touch the feet of the seniors we are also God in that sense because when we go and touch the feet of the seniors in normal natural love and affection comes good for us here's a thought only but you are ignoring insulting your teachers your seniors and until bad thoughts will come pants will come we can say oh these young people now it is but that is not good for you so here we find in the Liu Shan Shan's barber the first word the Christian the God is using about his own pavan he is a preacher he were experienced person sudhi are Chara Madan Mitra and you are well versed in studied in the Veda and the archer also the application of the knowledge 'as the so many knowledge is there but Archer of how to utilize that how to use those knowledge 'as you are crucial and in again crucial Raja hermana even create in the administration salvation of her Harsha he each and every one respect you that was the Lucien forgot he see and hear the yuddhistir is approaching him and the moment I asked that question a preacher will be Don Ramon please tell me about all these responsibilities duties so that I can stablish a the wonderful country in wonderful state administration means giving some wonderful ideas of the people to follow according to their characteristics and nothing else so here the Yudhisthira wind and what the duties then the Bhishma told the duties of the main engine or what they should do then duties according to Bernal Virna means the caste Brahmin are Kshatriya Vaishya children then duties of the Asuma brahmacarya grhastha vanaprastha sannyasa this is the hindu society do you know you're in the we're in the what we know about in them so this is the thing that we should know these are the wonderful qualities that developed for thousands of years and some person come and thus just break it or misinterpreted and they miss utilize know the society is full of culture means the high moral values implemented that's why that society was accepted and in continued for such a long time and the code of conduct for worldly personality those who love the worldly things for them what they should do for the content for the spiritual salvation those who are pursuing for the spirituality salvation what did you do all these things then rules of charity you know the charity is a great Dharma but whom you are donating that is also very very important how that money is going to be utilized very very important we where to whom you are donating very important that's why in the Mahabharata time of which all the other advises separately Bhishma is giving the advice the rules of charity the Hana Herman de Cali path tree kala means in time the shape means the glazed and Patrick to whom some people the bad people they want to purchase their arms and then with the terms they are going to kill some innocent people they come and ask and you give the money all the killing that they will do all the scene that they will come in all will come to you we have to share that and he was sitting in a different place and you know told us a precise to the UNAM the Taurus oppressor with little money you were earning all day so what should be very very careful then the kingly duties douche Tadamon and sheesh the Parliament that is the kingly duties we'll discuss in details the duties of a seeker of liberation duties of the woman how a lady should do what of the lady should do the duty why do their mothers and the end of homemakers they are creating the whole family the man is going out and earning money and bringing it back of course in the present dis society economical different same so that is changing but when he go to the villages of India same thing is still there that's why if the lady of the house is car tears gentle and religious minded loving all those things the children and the members of that family will surely grow as a beautiful wonderful citizens responsible citizens but sure it called depends on the market but now unfortunately we always think oh they are pushing us down back in the and we are not getting any publicity on our mother senses disagreeing from the publicity so what the publicity and you go and join in the politics are these and that then afterwards we after the retirement there's no satisfaction it is not that binding the women is for the development of the society marriage is a great institution is a very holy act why because from the husband and the wife human society they are not reducing the cycles and the motorbikes and these and that they understand they are they are the creator of the human so that's right importance has been given and the large teaching of the Wishman is the duties of women when the earth that afterwards we find that the wish mom he was lying over there on 28 days till then 29th day the judiciary in to meet him imagine that how patiently he was waiting and who do to destroy what their priest himself the Christian or let us go to him and when they win all people also be judicially encouraged all hundreds of people they went and among the hundreds all the intelligent people respected people also they went over there to listen to Bhishma in reply to his questions Bhishma reply has been recorded in Mahabharata in the 56th chapter the shanty baba true 167 chapter of pollution Berber such a big and vast a chapter has been given so many chapters has been given only on that can we imagine the importance of that crisis but here in the Bhagavata that the subject that we are now dealing there it has been mentioning brief the richness message is not only yuddhistir Abad many Rishi's hard and they spreaded in this society and thus it became the social custom in India the general duties of men what are the job duties of men it says that the following the roots of the country is the first two general following the rules of the country and supporting the king when necessary and also being the taxes etc majority of the people they try to evade the taxes and thinking we are saving money no you're actually disturbing the whole administration how the institution will go without money and the taxes that we are paying how it is utilized by developing the infrastructure and all of the facilities for the society is only so we have to understand that this is the duty this is the duty of the taxpayers and they must we also aware what are the things these people are dreamed so this is a general duty of the civilians the main this daily they must follow the rule of the country most of the time in India we do not follow the rule why in a psychologically we were suppressed and appraised and ruled by for a long time whether foreign rulers now almost like 11th century to 18th century they were there and all those rules that the frame for the Indians only to subjugate the Indians so the psychological Indians within these rules we have to break it our great leader mark maganda he broke that the salt law lovin I mean bundle he broke that salt love why because that is India is surrounded by seas only but the British is still no you cannot produce salt these to take that and process in the London and has to bring back and this to sell it in a high cost do you know major time the origin ordinary Indian people they could not get the salt though there were so much of motion almost everywhere the oceans on me all the three science so the leader there Martin Lagonda he broke that law lovin I among a great movement the Indian history it is written in the golden letters thousands of people the way followed mothma Gandhi breathing the law are you doing it is the Dharma know that time it was necessary but now the problem is when the government plays a rule that you should do like this we find very happy to break that rule why because in the subconscious mind the oldest thing the rule means very surprising us so that is not so we have to understand main bhishma is telling in those days the general masses people that is Dharma duty is to follow the rule of the country second supporting the king when necessary and third paying the taxes then comes the duties according to the Varna the Varna the caste system it rules that in Mahavir at the time also caste systems were their prevailing very much but how it was it was in vogue our system and Varna is it will distribute according to the capacity and quality of the people now I will recite and I will explain from the bhagavad-gita 18 chapter 42 43 and 44 these three thus loker's they are also they have categorized what are the duties of the partners now the Sri Krishna is not the basement sweet Krishna himself a shaman dhamma tapa show chung shanti our java me mature guiana vahanam hasta con Bravo governments of our agenda now the serenity the brahmana's is not big bird but we're developing the quality the serenity calm and composed they are not agitated whenever there are some problems this brahmanas can solve it why they're calm and composed and that is the reason when a person is agitated he cannot solve any problem he will create another problem to decide the brahmanas they have the leaders day of the year the tinkers and in the Hindus you know that there is a another sloka is there from the huge body of the kirusha the all this cash scheme and brahmana came from the hail all brahmanas are proud we are from the game and should receive from the field according to the work only only Hayden field is known what are the world solidity control of the senses and austerity purity and stern fall forward Ness and they will never hesitate to tender feet before the face of the king and knowledge inside and faith in the Supreme Being God is there how many fast can raise our hand when you leave these qualities and say pull your ground how many of us how many qualities really we are having now we cannot say that we are brahmanas and majority of the people they are creating problem for the society thinking only nur and most of the other people they are pointing finger into that the Hindus and saying oh you have the bad cough systemic sit exit driver we do not know the gas system for the betterment of our society - is developed we are pointing to the Hindus all your caste religion society and a caste are so wonderful if you've got people who are having these qualities dear brahmana there were two brahmanas in the great brahmanas dronacharya kripacharya our junior they were teachers but they were working under the Kshatriyas the driven or brahmanas Deven got brahmanas no one respected them as a prominence even some of the time the do you that I he was rebuking them a you are a brahmana and working under me don't talk like that the brahmana means a highly respected person because of his qualities not by birth the brand one of son is a brahmana wrong conception we have to understand these Shamma Lamma tapas Oh German austerity this is the topper what is the topper anybody criticizing immediately cursing and trying to imply to punish that person which is not kappa and in the bhagavad-gita itself we find bocce tapasya monastic tapasya there is tapasya to control the words also erskyll watching the first in the mind you should not think against anyone the brahmana means almost the highest the rank the society means so close to the divinity so that is called the brahmana the show gym teacher 3t the auction duty GOP of Malayalam Donna is Sharapova Shoreham karma sahaja now the shifter years they were the kings and that's why the Donna Muskaan king is supposed to give otherwise how people survive the that is the showroom he was he must have a special quality to face and to solve the problem that powerful with you the skull Julien tu holiness treaty forty choose the option dexterity and also not flying from the battlefield that is the begin the generosity and sovereignty are the duties of the Kshatriyas and this is now our Kshatriyas means of a prime minister of a chief ministers they are now kshatriyas because they are ruling they may be a brahmana by birth but they are now acting old us we call the minister's here the senators there of all the Kshatriyas and this this Kshatriya karma these are the duties one should be bored enough to tell the truth before the others also this is the thing that we must and ultimately we wonderful thing to say Donald is sure about us whatever we are we should give it to the people that Donna I am going on a creating the property in the world and the money and then I am very rich you can't think yourself as rich but you are a killer Georgia karma is asking to say you're a teal you don't have any respect in the society and that was the society anything mistake that you were doing immediately whole society will shun and the people are controlled by that any wrong thing that you were doing the society is to disassociate from the earth we were a brahmana you are not following the the duties of the brahmana society when it is available phrase you know the human society distant animal society animals can survive anywhere anyway but the human society means constantly progressing Shami become the same that society is culture where the spirituality is more practiced what is the culture the songs the terms and these and that all culture that societies culture where the spirituality is more practiced and what are the spirituality these wonderful qualities wherever I am I must follow my duties that's all I am a brahmana I should follow my duties I am a Kshatriya why should I buy on the ground and I should not immediate the brahmana's I should do my duties bye daddy I will get all the blessings of God as the brahmanas are also getting the same way that is called swadharma is a great world the krishna has given the traditional is that introducing the word swadharma swaddle mean madonna Maria for the Dharma by our heart the one should even die practicing his own accepted responsibility that is better then following the steps of the others and that's why the human society is greening up and then agriculture cattle rearing and trade are the duties of the bushes in those days those are the things but now any business that the people that do that is the duty of the boys sure what they should do they should keep some money for their own maintenance that's called profit nail from the operative portion should be there to support to develop his own business third we should give back to the society through taxes or through donations maternity of the now the big companies there the government is rule is you have to spend some of the money for the society see the voice chuckerman all the companies a portion of the income now they are spending for the development of the societies so that is called Lucia karma whatever we did at the time of Mahabharata and before same thing here in the modern society they are carrying on in a new different terminologies but thing at the air and that's why why we are studying this why we're spending so much of time only discussing this because the human society is not an individual's family the human societies so many varieties of people together if we don't have the rules and regulations and the responsibilities and the feeling to practice that responsibility the human society will break down and we will suffer human itself if that is the reason religion doesn't mean that you have to go to the church and temple and do something and go back now all these qualities that is called religion and it has been addressed and given by the great Souls like Bhishma and Krishna so other things services they say service is the duty of the sutras for recharger mahkum karma should trust sharpy sahaja in the bhagavad-gita 18 chapter 34 sloka all details of the earth Shankar Acharya has a given de and the details on that explanation these are the four great teams now the duties of the Ozma in briefly registers this time is up what are the awesomest brahmacharya goddess vanaprastha and sannyasa why these because according to the age of the people when we are very young we are learning learning and learning and why we are learning so that technology can utilize too hard for myself to support myself and also I can support or help the society to data skull from Acharya at the time of brahmacharya they say chart Rana with Thailand and that is the reason when the great freedom open to us going on the personality like Gandhiji give the call to the students of India you stop your study and come out join in this movement that has fight against the Britishers a personality again by Rabindranath Tagore wrote a strong later protesting against this decision do not call the students for this we are here we will do it that the students learn don't disturb the institutions the schools colleges universities they are the create ask Thomas when the human being is growing up don't disturb them that is the speciality anything happened all students are going and shouting and look at the pictures of our students in India you won't find the student and then they are studying their faces their eyes their behavior the trace that will show is a learner but do you find a learner like the all the time street fighters and you're so happy what happened that university boys came and burned the fight crops and two bosses great informations are coming in the newspapers and society should and their ears in shame because we are freaking the Dharma who's Dharma brand acharya dharma the brahmacharya means complete attention to study and nowhere else the mind should not go anywhere from that young period young time one should learn to control the senses and that is the reason nowadays sometimes some people elderly people behaving very queerly why even the animals don't do like that but because there's no Dharma because there is no training because there is no understanding so that is the faster astana is Ramachari a stoma second is God wisdom it create a stoma this is the Astana this is the place where which actually helping all others bhana process and near sandra magelia all the depend on the goddess the greenness see is not only husband and wife husband and wife is the main by depending on the each and everyone so grievously how the grievously will survive practicing all the general rule are the duties of the Dharma's of the people as we were discussing all those things at the same time keeping good relations with the neighbors keeping good relations with the the friends and relatives and all honesty P and I all the people who are doing or trying to do good supporting them helping them and constantly aware about the duties and responsibilities about their own children am I going to keel a responsibility on the society a liability on the society that is the duty of the gray esteem my son is a doctor my son is the engineer good professionally but as a man is it thinking about others is he helping others feeling for others or just money earning machine that you have produced this is the responsibility of the parents so the greatest e is a drain and then it comes bond of pristine the wind that crystal period is over one should know one should learn that now it is time to wash my hand and say thank you I was with you now I have given everything which is possible as a parent to you now it is your own die leave a holy and self control useful life that is the advice of the pillars and what they should do they should concentrate their mind on two things using their knowledge for the development of the society and using their mind to concentrate on the higher spiritual values so Barnabas see these are the two duties they should do it'll be very easy human society also the king we could not discuss there may be in the next class that it is the responsibility of the king to see and utilize their knowledge --is after the retirement the person is not going to die and he's now not only educated but experienced and that experience should be utilized for the betterment of the society say religion doesn't mean some of the mantras Sanskrit chanting chanting religions means performing the responsibilities who do that you meant be how can he do that with the inspiration and knowledge that's why this regular discourses on the scriptures and from the point of view of the modern day society is very very essential there's no economy we began the same to the monks go to the villages teach them geography history sociology and then morality thousands and millions of monks at their he was addressing the Indian monks there every time they are every day of mourning four times they're eating they're using the clothes they are taking the medicine they're staying somewhere everything they are taking from the society what they are giving back so that is the sannyasa Dharma what is the sannyasa Dharma without any attachment loving caring serving the society that is the senior government Dharma Pollan Dharma Shiksha if the sannyasi is involved at us in any particular movement of the society he is not considered as of shenyang see why because that very moment he loses the some other seat world and welcome you come most of the time people realize even a sannyasi right yes where from you are coming to me in India there are many divisions of their so they like to know from which cost you belong the societies belong the province you belong which language you speak that is not the qualities of a sanyasin you have to observe a sannyasin whether he is following practicing the Dharma and what is the Dharma loved and untouched meant salaries an attached way if this is their mystical sannyasi and the societies of supporting because through him high moral values will spread over and have to ultimately help the human society so these are wonderful thoughts and shrine in these books and in different pages in different way through different stories their greenhorn telling so the poverty is so popular because of this on the basis of the bhagavata Mahabharata and also the sweeties the society has grown up our present-day intellectuals should understand this without being the highest they should try to understand and implement why is necessary now as from individual and indeed he implemented we are Sunnis in Syria we have leftover heart and home we are not mad at we are not having any family we don't have any interest then why we you are going on doing so many times in so many places we risk our life to do you know at least in mind I have seen I have seen some of the moms in create difficulties the some people were telling oh these people are theoretical they don't have the plan the practical knowledge they don't know at least the ramakrishna mission sharm is the practical knowledge what you have done you only are and he lived your life how much you have done for your society don't challenge the way we have lived there was nothing in the deep jungle for 12 long years giving education to those people who neighbors knowing what is civilization it's not only but after the theory that we are practicing and with really implemented the Vedanta in the real life and then we have seen now as a sannyasi what is his duty Dharmapala Dharma Shiksha may be
