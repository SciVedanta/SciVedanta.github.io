dear devotees today we will discuss in the light of para Buddha the what is this creation and why would you discuss that also it go to that on before that as usual let us charge this wonderful purse Shanta would you go sure now but sedation's we Swart our governess attrition me pongo Lakshmi condom c'mon anion you TV John Young Bundy he's everything his greed his deserving and already and again is taking the his creation within himself so thristy steady and purloin this is the manifestation of the same the spiritual highest all-pervading consciousness now we are studying thirteen station features of the bhagavata the last time we have discussed the twenty questions of the king who is awaiting his death and he asked this questions to a great personality sukadeva the Shakur his knowledge was unfathomable and his sugar dealer is answering these questions and the tenth chapter he starts giving this answer the greed divider of the Vedas Veda Vyasa is also the composer of the bed and sutras are the Brahma sutras we know it also those seventeen piranhas and then finally as his last work he took the essence of all his scriptures and he made this wonderful spiritual father Buddha he composed his father mother but is not a piranha is a  at the end of every chapter it is mentioning bhagavata is mentioning srimad poverty maha bua knee Parvati on some meta young boys are sick young exist it leaves Rhema ET means the end laughs of the chapter chapter of our 3-month poverty this is the great stitcher why streamer is a great respect is given to the writing 3-month is as holy as God Himself the scripture and this is the name of the scripture is bhagavata this Maharani and this Mahaprabhu bonemom share the Prabhavati is not only purana this is the highest rank of renounce renounce in search renouncers highest rank of renouncers what are the answers you know the monk they have different categories the highest category is the paramahamsa why that sometimes the moms they understand that this Wharton thing is binding him so he goes in a retreat and hides himself but the paramahamsa is a very powerful mom he lives in this world with everyone with everything but not bound by anything so that is called Paramahamsa we call Bhagwan see Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and this is their son neither this is we have a depression wrote it and then he taught it to his illustrious son sukadeva the great monk they dotted two other moms and Muniz white we are mentioning these because this sometimes some people that think that Parvati is only for some devoted people emotional people they'll be reading about the life of Krishna and every singing bhajans and most of our but the dietary teachers we can say who are narrating a libert√† all this gives this type of expression the bhagavata means you have to sing the name of God to dance I attended one function for earrings sheer Chicago and not that is a blend of knowledge and devotion bhagavata is containing the pure knowledge and along with the devotion and then the Karma that is also there and you have to strive the Jeepers the individual soul it is your responsibility you have to strive we have to understand that karma is also there Shama given the one solution I like to give the purest of the pure vedanta-sutra in the the citta of devotion and then fried it in karma then present it to the society so that even a child will also understand the highest and the subtlest intricacy of the madonna you are God it's not an ordinary world tuft wanna see is not an ordinary world just you listen and then as if you are listening some song or some poems and then you are forgetting not like that this is the truth ultimate truth and before that to understand that you have to prepare yourself so this goes in this way this ancient history automatically recorded by some excellent personalities known as suta and those who are reading the bhagavata again and again coming to the suta not that the suitors were all remains are there the Moonies not like that there are all ordinary people but highly intellectual they could memorize things just like a picture so that way the suitor the weather possessors of the very short memories they used to travel a lot and used to gather the different information including the kings and their kingdoms conditions of their subjects culture time etc so this is the suitor this year we find one suitor he's explaining where from he heart preferably learn from sukadeva and now this moment we are hearing it directly from the sugar because the suitor is telling but as Eve is just giving a graphic tradition that condition one king he was a very famous King but he did once only one little mistake and he was cursed by a very powerful brahmana is a young boy who was having a minute last hour as because the king insulted his father this young boy could not restrain immediately get the curse that you will die within seven days and the king was a great personality naturally he was not acting he was not taking to go for any remain revenge rather he thought this is an opportunity that I should withdraw myself he knew that this world is futile it's temporary whatever I tried to grab it is going to go out of my hand so I understood your English time and this is the pair of you when you read the bhagavad-gita same type of condition comes in the mind of the body junuh dysfunction see facing the death either I am going to kill them or they're going to kill me that is the condition or universe standing and then he was thinking the why not I give up the whole world can go crystal tilt or no through work only you will get the liberation and here also he find the king this is per tunas grandson he is also waiting for the death peacefully and he's asking spiritual questions usually the Puranas are having five features you know just any book cannot be pure on it should have five features poverty is having deal features - Amma the second book there's a scandal tenth chapter that attire and it begins with the first verse begin with three bar irony who Barger barbarian son that is our Yasha the Virgin's name was Mary and his son Badr irony it is the style of delicate mother irony uberta he said what he said otra salvo misirlou stannum bhushanam attire Manandhar he Shankara Neruda Mukti Austria these are the ten different features we will discuss battery and son is telling this what is that solar it is not having any pop Allah is Sodom on the saw and government server Sarah means the creation the creation this is thunder and swagger is the heaven so these are the little difference sada and souad occur the swab is w RF Allah is wind heaven on this earth is this creation is the saga creation so they'll be explaining about the creation this booth this bhagavata is going to explain about the creation the server what is this B server is a creation of various being by the brahmana drama you know that some of the people they always confuse and Hindus are also confused Brahman and Brahma homage to close the Brahman is the all-pervading consciousness and Bromham is the first ball who created in that all-pervading consciousness which is known as Vishnu B star a divisional let me see is all-pervading as because he is all-powerful he created the one to healthy for the creation and that is Brahma Brahma was created from the first one so this is Ramon now the promise responsibility was to create so he was creating that creation is visible and what is saga for depth supreme god supreme being without the help of anyone created that is server to server beside them then Stannah our city understand our city the same Lord's action to protect the world that is constantly astana this city preserve protection that the God will give we will discuss a little elaborately afterwards this is a loves action he may he may not but usually he gives this city then commotion emotional granting the protection he is making some system so that this creation is sustaining and in this creation among the created beings some are there but just like the babies they cannot do anything they depend on God and this God directly protecting that thing is commotion then come booty this booty is the karmic tendencies of the beings karmic tendencies karma there's the action always comes in the mind one after another where from it comes and where it goes ultimately it says that karmic tendency the booty then monitory montana is a tunnel now what is this world the whole world is time space and causation and nothing else and the own this time space and causation is the ultimate that is spirituality spiritual world to the mundane world and the spiritual world what is the difference the spiritual world is beyond time space and causation but the mundane world begins with the time without the time nothing is there so that God that Supreme Being he created man under why this man hunter we will come afterwards then each on guitar then after the creation now after this creation you have to come out of this creation so the god is again providing is radically doing it not through Brahma he is directly doing it he created all of this then how this jeepers is created beings they will come out of this he's telling each on guitar that is the stories of the incarnations are the stories are the thought about the god only through that one can go beyond this creation this is then last comes another to near over this nehru that means when the whole the creation is as they called last day is going to be destroyed it's not destroyed it goes back again in a form and wait over there to again manifest three is dropping the fruit and germinating over there waiting to come up again as a tree that is the period called prior the God creating and then sometimes going down again going back in this piston so a pristine form and ways again when the desire will comfort region again you do create and what will happen to the jeevers and suppose we are very clever and we will calculate when we are going to have the last day okay if the last day has come very close let us do anything that we like any important things because we are going to destroy it and after the destruction again the new creation and that time will go where we know no so let us do that know sometimes some people they give the example like the art art import now there are 10 pot breaking and it goes and marches in the art again the Porter will take the art and make an art important it may not be the same if you Jeeva same way after death or after the completely dissolution of this creation then in the next creation is fresh now that karmic theory even in that all your tendencies and your result of your karma it will potentially it will be there and where it will be within the body of the same supreme god it will merge in God but not as God but is separate raghavan cinema Krishna he gives that as a beautiful way he says when the this cultivation period is over then the lady of the house is collect all the seals and she will preserved in in different small small packets not mixing up keeping different scenes in different brackets and then he will keep it in another hearts in the villages he will keep it in a box and put it in the board somewhere in the art and wait for the big season to come and the next season again the rain comes again the tilting the land then she will bring down that particular box can take out one of them of the small small packet and will ask his people to go and start same way if a person if a beam is doing some bad karma it is not to start until you yourself is completing it so that is called Neruda that type of cessation is called near order it's not complete because you are still bound by your karma but this very moment sometimes some do some bad work and then we go out somewhere and the law of the land to reach to him and he thinks oh it is okay after 20 years we need things that everybody has forgotten now let me go back to mine and place my country the moment he will get down again from the computer his picture and all the details about my papa oh this is the man they will instill again and this happen again and again this is the Nero order and there is another stage result Mukti Mukti or liberation this is routine means you have completed your karma there is no other card of Allah and you are marching in that supreme self where from you came and that supreme self is known as Austria this Austria is Drummond at paramount man this is the Australia about this charger and we circle the Third Earth of the 10th chapter it says boot Amata in the ADEA janma Soraka Buddha Etowah brahmana guna by Xiang Yan wizard the Purusha Smita you know in sanskrit when they when they write we write one after another but in Sun skin depth sloka they'll be putting one part over here then another later over here and you have to take it and then make the proper meaning this is the speciality of the Sanskrit language and have to learn how to take this word and then add with the other one then the meaning is coming properly the origin of the various categories from Mahad Dr Mahathir to the Supreme Being to Maha Bua Maha Bua the gross elements will come to that slowly began now this is a very unique point began when the the equality equilibrium that broke in the property when the equilibrium broke in the property in the nature there's a primal energy due to the divine will why suddenly broke it was very calm and nothing was there severely as if some duster we came from nowhere and then met the ripples and waves on that water and the moment that he started then different type of creation when it was tranquil nothing was there it's all calm and composed I don't know whether he'd have gone to our go move the source of Ganga early morning if you go no water no Ganga is all frozen snow and if you go and make the sound because it is like a hollow and the top place tears all around and the monks they go and see and we walk on the Ganga because there was no other path it's all frozen hard only thing some people know where to walk where to place their feet because sometimes it is solved below there will be water but all the frozen you go sit over there wait for the Sun to come and if you have just hardening the home it goes on echoing so many times it was a beautiful but that moment there is no creation nothing is there only one that the world over the white snow and the no sound human is very high obviously you cannot see even the top of that glaze here only you can see a patch of sky and you are quietly sitting over there certainly there will be a sound the sound will be compared as a desire of God and why it is nobody knows who is going to ask the God why you desire in that way but the desire is you and then slowly slowly the suits are breaking and the water start falling from the air and we know also the flow start coming and then within almost no time there will be a river in front of you and if you make a mistake and sitting on the evil you'll be that will be the last experience so that's why those who are experienced even say sit here because that is a river it will become river within no time the moment the Sun rises everything start melting and he'll be sound they'll be activity and there will be waves there will be flow sea from nothing from no creation creation begins that is exactly it says that the butum are the original of these it begins from the each child desire why the moment the God desired then his nature is known as property his own power is known as property and property always creates that's why the Hindus they symbolizes property as a living and you see that God and we always considered the left side of the God remains guards prakruti the power that through the power God turned everything gods forward but given in this way so that is gravity the brahmana the green God guna is some yard and wind is the subtle Raja and Dhamma these are the three gunas those who are trying to understand Hindi into religion these three words they must remember Prez everything begins with these three chatter Roger and Tama when they are in the same number then equilibrium no creation the morning they are in different numbers and different forms and that time the creation begins sometimes very bad sometime in between sometimes very good shut up Roger and Dhamma the universe omnia breaking the equilibrium differences come but why the Librium breaking divine with dear no one can answer Shama Vivekananda when he was asked why and in the first time the creation began some each in his own way so Vivek and say Hindus are old enough to say we do not know because they do not reach after the creation only we can understand before that nobody can see anything now in the pedantically they see Eco common Bohus shall be eager how am i eager and one but I am not liking it I'd like to be mean how it mean from himself Boeotia a movie now one person used to leave all alone in a forest is it now the story I love this nature but I need some company 30 what we again go to the city and so many people then they'll be freezed and be any means they're big appreciation they're big criticism so many activities will begin when he was alone alone nothing was there the moment he comes then when he comes a desire what is the desire I want to be meaning here also now how the creation is coming cerca this Zelda is directly done by that Supreme Being we should understand this now sometimes there is parantha it says that you are not created at all Kim Hyun Kim Rosie's sake things under Shakthi insensitive to say why you were crying my friend sake he was the supreme power but that is all right this creation is not there in Hindi DC general team coming ie need to kill more optimistically Dinkelman even booka booka laguna ceja leo when you are hungry then where you go the person who says jagat is not in this world nothing is there no creation but do you sit quietly when you are hungry to go to the people you pay you eat where the action is there that means jacket is also there so we have to understand these that is exactly what some official is telling again and again you have to understand your whole position and from there you have to begin otherwise you're making a mistake I can't climb the 10 steps and if I decide to climb on the top of the hill Kamala what will happen maybe you may not be an information one line one fool tried to climb and that's all so that is the real that will happen so when we are trying to understand the self before that you have to understand our position and what is the position these because we are creative being we are taking the we are breathing we are touching we are seeing we are smiling and all these things are creating so many ripples in our mind sometimes good sometimes bad and sometimes nothing it goes on we cannot avoid that so we have to be very careful before you step into the house of pure Vedanta that is the goal that is the Australia but we thought that what is my position and that is why Haggadah is giving the complete idea about this world who created that supreme god what he created first mutiny and this mutiny how he created shitty means the art above the water teacher the fire marude the gear and the boom of the space these are the five only and Hindus are very fond of fighting the fight the first fight and this is if you know the first five they are shitty appertains Maru Vavoom and you look at that any Hindu temple you go and art that all the time the Hindu temple if you go to them on and you go and stand him to only show the light and they will be Prashad because there's no time but when the worshipping and then in the evening or the morning they are doing the party at that time they will take this five things only the ribbon representing the art they will take the flower representing the water they will take the conch of course the water is there ribbit presenting the teacher the fire they will show the fire and here that we have Fanny and view mother space even fine if they will take a piece of cloth and ring like this may be or may not be the person the project thus priest who is doing it doesn't know only going on doing as a traditionally these are the five things knowledge like that but if you understand you will understand that is the beginning and there is no other 16 or dad thing only combination permutation and combination of despite things and that is the creation then come Mart Ronnie what is that mantra smell the Gunder taste wrestle for Rupa Tom spa and sound chapter so these are the five things constantly we are enjoying the some people they cannot listen to the Sun some people don't have the taste anything if you give this alright the thing but a normal person will have all these fight things gunda Russia Rupa Scotia and chapter and then come indriyani but how I experience it then sir indriyani what's the Indus the God the Supreme God first creating these the shitty of cottage morogo then Google in job is creating the banging and Trust is giving this five senses and how do they enjoy the smell if you wrote up the knows how to enjoy the taste if you don't have the tongue so the God is giving Nausicaa there is you are then Jack shoe then tuck and karna knows Dan our skin in here so these are the five in the ER in Denise the senses and through that we are enjoying and after enjoying their just getting it now you go and to your chap shoe your I saw when you are driving a big game somewhere well that means McDonough to let me drive so what is that exceed - disability so I take that go to the mag donor so fast create it from where I and then we go to them and then we spread the hand give me their one and then testing so action is necessary we will do the action I can only see and give you the report that is a shot but you have to do the action then your bark Bonnie bother by pasta these are the 5 car main areas the senses of action so the how many comes fine Mahmoud fight tan Matra fire cannon Rhea feikin Andrea surviving for 20 then ultimately who is will enjoy hi I am going to eat I am going to see I am going to smell armed guard so this power of the Eagle allow it that mana booty and cheetah mana booty and cheetah the Mong mine actually can take decision but that is a Faculty of the mind Carmona but the distant decision I am going to do this and then finally cheetah that is the storehouse all these things are there in the store and these are the four anchor mana put the and cheetah the total 24 this is twenty four tattwas sa facto means this is the whole creation there is not any extra hundred twenty for this 24 Tatars if we can understand this 24 chapter is known as circle who created the Supreme Court Supreme Being himself then afterwards all the creation that comes they come combination and permutation with all these things who does Brahma and that is known as the server the server and the be server then comes the city the Supreme God in the bhagavata the orders take us to a guard named Narayana why not I am finished the god it was not having any form then slowly he started melting because the devotion came devotion is just like some dignity quit so not that is the water he created from his own being and he stayed inside that nada that's why his name became Narayana because Narayana who stayed inside the water and who created the water him who stayed he so Nara and Narayana this Narayana created the matter the stew and the being the Cheever and he has treated the system to protect them and that is called CD now pursue the object is their only object is there and no one to go and enjoy what is the use of that object so obviously now gold was the jewelry's were there in somewhere there are no matter the someone went found that then brought it and then they told other people this year this started going over there then some people started giving the decoration and the gold so many things that way the bus - that is the matter is taking shape and then it is giving me the importance through whom Jeeva if you don't have any interest then why these people will create so many things all people one day decided that we are not going to purchase anything to read this dot the factory and the marketing and all these things nothing will be there so this is our desire we want to have that so that is the reason the God created the object which was to and to enjoy that he created the Jiva achievable are very intellectual pain God gave the Internet to the jeevers so that they can go and hit lies it use it now this will the city how the God is giving the city one example we can give the young girl key stock attached to any baby if she goes she goes and sees that baby over it that much morning that VD curve because mother so much attachment for that baby she will sacrifice everything for the sake of the baby we her from this change come from God that is the protein that is the nature young man he was free fun loving and then he becomes the father the responsibility of the father comes no I have to earn money I have to look after my baby and every evening he is coming and taking that baby on his lap he's so happy where from these changes come just accident No so this we have to understand God has created this CD this CT is a great thing in our mind in the mind of the mouse it is not there and that's why the Hindu moms are not very auspicious in the marriage ceremony sometimes some people there sharmaji please come and rest we don't go we said no see that feeling is completely absent in our mind you will be able to pray for you after that you come being we prefer but before that is better not to invite us like that CD that particular thing is not our mind is full of totally we don't know they will care about their religion we don't care about the language or anything only then verses this must have to do something but all that comes in the mind of the moms again that God CD another sometimes the wrongs the practice each other everything you know that's very special the achiara means the Python it never goes for hunting it will be lying down in one place and anything coming before his mouth you simply suck it that's all and again lying down over there in not a thumb naginata so many pythons they've been able moving you can just go and pick it up and never do anything just like a row but the moment you go there to the mouth and if it is hungry dangerous so that call each other like right and big deal the tendency among we never over begging me Balu for asking he'll be sitting under a tree and completely dependent depending on the God you have created me it is your responsibility to give me food otherwise you will die you so people me if you want me to die I'm gonna do if you want me to survive sent word to be sitting over there and it guards it has it food comes so this is God the city then it rest on our devotion this not roasted portion for Shanna this means the Supreme God the gracious protection the time he sure I will give you just how the protection what beautiful incident happened in their generation where governments Ramakrishna was there and he himself narrated it you know in those days the land hostage to keep the powerful people the wrestlers particularly as the guards and sometimes the other wrestlers will come and challenge the first work and if he cannot defeat the Challenger then he lose his job the landlord will employ this man that'll man Italy like that the finisher the person who was never a long time and no one came to challenge him so naturally he forgot the practice of the wrestling and all that and we've seen the other people used to go to the temple he developed a devotion used to pray to the mother then certainly from and the place maybe from you be the UUP the always practiced this whereas playing a very powerful person came and challenged this man and he became terrified he came to sit down please know what I do this is our Krishna told you strive you try and also bring the good things you strive will try but also great so this man he must begin preparing for the wrestling competition but he has to go to the temple and cry before the mother mother he was here on the new protection for such a long time I've forgotten all those things and please help me you know the result I think I need not to announce it and this lean and team person who forgot almost all the practices of the wrestling he defeated that very powerful strong person in no time how would you as possible and sadhana Krishna was the among many he was also observing the wrestling competition and maybe his blessings and this lean and thin person the other person creating in Lord and there putting all the oil on his body and his daughter asleep and this person was going on even in the arena and he was little greedy - mother mother saved him he was you wounded wrestling game this is called potion special place potion is the special Greece there's a beautiful story and that is true in the bhagavata prelada most of the Indians didn't know and there are beautiful books nowadays for the children the prelada if he had not read please purchase and give it to your son and people your children they didn't know only through devotion protected by God his father the grandmother she do this completely against God and he tried to kill his own son so many times so many right this way every time the child was saved that's called potion - another story they say one thing was they're very devoted to Krishna and he had a time these two hours are not going to go anywhere whatever happens he was meditating and praying and that was known to his enemy this is the time when he'll be praying and you'll never come out let us go and attack him so naturally the people information and that particular time they attacked the soldiers were waiting for the command of the king he was meditating and what to do when the sound came he told his God I am NOT going to break my promise two hours I should be over here let them come and kill me but I have not been to break my promise afterwards Queen he got up after two hours he took his all soldiers all the way into the field and where and all the enemies are all dying over there and the team though of the opposition who attacked he was there and was playing and what happened to you pay me you're only one soldier and he wonderful color the blue color he came and won Lee one soldier he fought against about thousands and killed them him to one soldier Connie I never sent anyone I don't know anyone came back he found his own the wars still sweating and then he ran to the temple and he saw the blood stream in the the trace of the Krishna you understand in your own way I'm not going to explain but this is called potion and another is booty the booty visit the survivors UTI and that is the problem for the human being in the bhagavad-gita har chapter 37 verse kama Asia crota Asia Raj oh good Mahajan ha ha ha we didn't I hereby denounce those who are trying to realize God practicing spirituality these are the two words that you remember it's not other things nothing all the moment you become religious don't touch me you don't keep this food I am NOT going to go to them all these things goes that foolishness within your heart your enemies sitting what is that you desire , and when the desire is not fulfilled growth these are the two desires to do things mashallah Mahatma the amar the most seen greatest seen be careful about them the priest instilling to his friend Arjuna and here the addition on the desire means in sanskrit called Hashanah usually tree one is food regional is a progeny petitioner the world and locational prosperity a popularity concern local issue and Logan Hashanah is the last bondage of the spiritual people put traditional most of the moms they are not having be traditional because we know all our fun is there in the profits of our devotees with no problem how did the VD bank balance or any bank account any problem immediately send out a flyer we are ingredient trouble there is no water immediately people come so that is also good for the location arm that is the popularity allows the vein of spiritual people and majority they are bound by that the one should be very very careful but this booty the desire are having two times one good desire super deep and the bad desire discreetly what is the discreetly selfish egoistic work docility desire the desire is there he Chinese there but if it is for the selfish and egoistic that's called discreetly bounds but the security that is also a sauna there's also desire but I'd like to do good to others that is consumed today then comes the time this is a traditionally accepted that from the time of the great manu the founder of the book of law turkish Aastha the calculation of time began but moving is not the name of a person Nona is the position and from the beginning to earth now till now distill the news this sorry for 14 manos appear the first one who is saya muga saya mover is the first one and from that time the calculation of time started began and we know some of the manners one is structure that should govern our day Margot Robbie in the world in the time of the graph Yuja we know that duck share there is also a model another sovereignty sovereignty soldier Tamayo in the Chandy there's also the Manu and we wish Fattah in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna instilling I told this particular yoga to vapor there's also Manu this is the position if you practice them but is sincerely and want to control this world you will become unknown afterwards let me pray for that but I would suggest not to have any desire then how to go beyond these is Shankara now friends this is very important each on guitar discourses relating to God and His devotees each the monogatari she means God anakata discourses sometimes as Ramakrishna is also telling all the time repeat the holy name of God in Vedanta there is no deeksha that's why the Tantra another section of the spiritual practice the Tantra initiated diksha mantra diksha take the name of God from a very good person how do you know the good person his unselfish and not having any desire selfish desire there is a good person anyone anywhere these are the two criteria he's not having any desire for these worldly things and very unselfish he is a good person so that if you take that mantra God's name from me just go on repeating them and then believer there is an opportunity study the books are talking about God discuss about God listen about God that is called Hashanah kata what will happen all your thoughts which is creating desire will be stopped in one place because he were giving another force in your mind and that is the reason one gue should go on ceramic is nice telling repeating and singing the glory of God through the songs some people are there like the Ramprasad he only sang meerabhai only sang and he went on praying you are giving the Gershon to everyone why not to me she began crying and that is called Hashanah guitar Nero De Niro the MS dissolution weather in the dissolution the same Supreme God after having the game the divine plane of all this things suddenly he may think enough let me take rest again he was closed his eyes Germanotta that image you have seen all of you jagannatha he is the Supreme Lord of the universe but he is not having the eyelids never noticed he is having two big eyes but no idea why the moment that God will close his eyes and that is Nino the dissolution and that is the reason we don't know some painters will be painting with big eyes and all that and that God is not having hands that God is not having leaves and are not having the ayats also what is this juggle not but he's the master of the universe Jagat not not amidst the master Jared means the universe and how this master can go to his universe without leave because he's already reserved and how the master will work through will but the creation because he is looking the move in the hymen close available me road Nino the means completely cessation and ultimately comes Mukti Mukti is for the Jesus and properly understanding about this creation so while we're discussing about the creation because I just understand this creation so these are the things only Phi Phi prime prime like that and last for 24 things are there and these 24 things now are not interested I want to know the person the beam the God who created these 24 things and that is called Mukti the moment that desire will come that is called Mukti we doubt any other things any fraction of your mind thinking that if I could see the face of my grandchild before my death again be able to come back it's a good desire but this time that will go in the detail of this world for once in my next life once if I can enter into that White House and conceit in the Google how room I don't know what mixed like again you cease from somewhere you are computing and we are giving the ball so that we gain in the Oval house you will go so that is the way you have to have any desire that's why once Lama Krishna say if you have any desire to eat completely and if you have any desire to visit go and see and then tell your mind oh my these is this and then give it up once for all don't repeat it that is called the practice and where we're going to go last the tenth one Estrella Estrella is that supreme god now friends let me conclude this particular chapter by quoting the 30 words now here the devotion God
