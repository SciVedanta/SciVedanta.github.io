[Bhagavatam 065 : Responsibilities Of The Devotee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-5SNInj8lrg)

good morning dear devotees and friends let us start this one with the sloka shanta karam [Music] [Music] m we were studying the bhagavata bhagavata that for a long time we are studying almost the year is over and the last sunday we discussed who can be called a true sadhu that god the sri krishna he said that who can be recognized or we can accept him as a good sadhu and he gave so many qualities today we will be finding that he is telling about who can be called a true devotee so this responsibility of the devotees and who is a true devotee this is very interesting and this is called scriptural injunction sometimes you will find then in different places it has been mentioned you should perform things according to the scriptural injunction what is the scriptural injunction we'll find over here first a sadhu a highly the exalted spiritual soul how you will understand apparently there's no difference from an ordinary person as they always say the darkness and then excess light at the same you cannot see anything so that is the way when the sadhu is a very highly exalted spiritual personality and a completely opposite person and the tamasic person the both are almost same apparently you won't be able to understand so the lord has given the 28 qualities by which we can recognize a good sadhu here today we will study the same lord he is talking with his devotee and his friend is follower uddhava and he is telling how to understand a good devotee now what is the difference between a sadhu and a devotee we will come to know about it the sadhu has already realized and that is the reason all those good qualities unless he could achieve those good qualities it was not possible for the realization the realization is a conception and that you have to go beyond as they call always in the vedanta maya all these things are nothing but the illusory that that way you have to go and in the process as you call it sadhana when we are progressing towards that godhead we develop wonderful qualities that we have already read and devotee and let us the true devotee how the lord sri krishna is mentioning [Music] mata made the god himself his opinion bhakta tama he is the highest devotee who who do not clearly know about me gattwa agathwa just heard about god and god is there and god can help you god loves you this way just hypothetical they have they do not know exactly what is god and how to realize nothing like that god is supreme being and he is the self of all his existence knowledge please nothing they didn't know anything of it but worship me with full devotion bhajanti ananabhavina are in my opinion the best devotees so what we learn from this this is a complete faith and sometimes the young narendra not wish to come to suramar krishna is to say is a blind faith then sudama krishna immediately said either say faith or no faith what is blind faith it cannot be there cannot be a word like that the here we cannot say it is a blind faith no in the beginning he is depending on some words somebody's words okay a guru or the scripture or the expounder of a scripture he is listening to that and then he is moving accordingly having the faith in believing that god is there there's a beautiful story that bhagavan's rama krishna said the parables of suramar krishna is there to explain this way one gentleman as a brahman he used to expound the bhagavatam now at those days now also the people they believe that if you listen to the the bhagavata then your body and mind become purified so they used to go and listen to them and there will be some people that they explain the bhagavata they read from the bhagavata it is still there this tradition the one man is to do like that in a village but before that he used to drink a glass of milk and the milk used to be supplied by a milkmaid the lady used to come from the other bank of the river so if she was not getting the board fairy boat she used to be late and the brahmanas to get angry when i will go to my class i have to give the class and why you can you can't you have to bring them you should bring the milk then i will warm it then i will drink it how it is possible used to review one day the lady was too late at the time the gentleman that brahmana sat and started giving the class and this lady secretly was going and she knew she was very much afraid the brahmana will be very angry today that was his routine now today the routine has broken the she he could not drink the milk before going to the class so the lady was afraid and slowly she was coming and that time she heard the brahmana is explaining to the devotees by the god's grace one can cross the bhava sagara the ocean of this life so the lady was thinking the milkmaid was thinking oh if that is so if they can cross the sagara means ocean as a uneducated lady couldn't recognize the bhava sagara means this life it's not the ocean but she took it literally oh if the people by taking the name of god can cross the ocean walking on the water can't i do that it's a small river only next day morning she was before time then naturally the brahmana asked what is the matter how could you come today is the boat man was there and no boat man he's always late i just walked on the water they need to the naturally the brahman couldn't believe her how it is possible walking on the water yes that yesterday only you were telling that if you believe in god and you can cross the whole ocean bhava sagara baba sagar is a completely different thing and truly you walked on the water by sticking the name of god yeah i can show it to you come you can also do that the faith the lady took the brahmana on the bank of the river and oh god i have to cross the river and the boatman is not here please help me and she started walking on the water and not only that she asked the brahmana also to come because brahmana was the teacher but the brahmana was not having the faith the lady was having the faith that is exactly what bhagavan suramar krishna said the faith can take you an unbelievable way the gentleman who was expounded the bhagavata and he was telling the god as the supreme power and in that power through that power he can take you across the bhava sagara but he never believed it he only said it and this lady simply hearing believed it and if she followed and that is the way it happens yadrisha how i am what is my power they don't know anything of it but they have a tremendous faith since the scripture has said the god is there there must be god there is another story the that's called the uh pralhada now it is dhruva that dhruva and prahlada the two great characters they are two devotees the same lord vishnu says dhruva the mother told if you go and call god he will come just mother said what is god how does he look what is the quality what the god can do nothing that that young man never knew anything of it but the mother said god is there and if you sincerely call on god god will appear before you and whatever you say god will fulfill on that faith he entered into the forest and started simply calling oh vishnu where are you oh vishnu that was infested by the animals so naturally people they could not think of it but the child the he thought what is the problem god is there god will protect me i am calling god god is all-powerful mother told faith then you know the story many of you know the story that then the narada came and then guided narada became his guru he guided that this is the mantra you should chant you need not to roam around sit under the tree this will happen that will happen then the lord will come and the lord came faith he is the highest you know the one direct disciple the ramakrishna mission was formed on the first may 1897 by swami vivekananda they were the direct disciples of sri ramakrishna they lived with sirama krishna talked with sirama krishna they got the training from sirama krishna and then afterwards asarama krishna said that you should live together under the leadership of naren they lived in that way maharaja mani devi she was also present and she was also guiding them helping them now slowly slowly young men they started coming listening to through the different swamis about sirama krishna they never saw sirama krishna they never knew who is this ramakrishna they only heard about him through different lectures particularly from swami vivekananda and they started coming and joining from different family background different linguistic groups different religions they all started coming then one day the one direct disciple was telling another direct disciple see look at these boys they have never seen sidhama krishna they never lived with sirama krishna but still they love sirama krishna they are more blessed than us we lived with him we knew who is he we saw so many miracles and the miracles happened in our own lives but still these boys who has never gone through these experiences they are attracted to sirama krishna are they not more devotee than us then the other swami noted yes so this is the thing we are blessed so we are coming to that god without knowing just we read gattwa agathwa ata but it is applicable even today to all of us who are trying to realize god to love god to see god to develop the divine qualities within us bhajanti ananabhavina only knowing on do see so many hundreds of books we sell the ramakrishna mission publication so many thousands of the titles are there the one of the if you see look at that just bible the bible in millions they print and distribute majority of the bibles people don't purchase it is freely distributed but apart from that there's only one book bible apart from that varieties of the subjects if you see in the whole world i think it is the contribution of the ramakrishna mission at the time of swami vivekananda if you read the books written by the swami vivekananda's brother mahindranath he mentioned there was no religious books it was not available only a few people used to have and they used to copy it by hand bhagavan sirama krishna also copied he was having a very good handwriting and he also copied some portion of the holy book so like that they used to very few people used to have the scripture mostly this to listen from those people and today just go to any website and order the book it is immediately available so that is the way the great contribution so many people they are purchasing the books and they are reading it they are having some idea and some doubts this is going on but think of the so many devotees dedicating their whole life for this ideology now if you see that in the ramakrishna mission 163 or 65 centers in india almost all of them they are serving this corona the virus 19 that patients people are shunning they don't like to go didn't like to come out they're so much afraid even the whole locality the neighborhood has afraid that if there is someone suffering in that way and these people our swamis our brahmacharyans our devotees they are collecting fun and either cooking cooked food or the raw materials they are going and supplying to these people going so close to them and helping them without fearing for death so this why god will be happy sirama krishna will be happy mother will be happy that's all they have not seen him are they not great that is exactly what this sri krishna is telling i read again this verse this is the 11th skander 11 33 number verse gattwa agattwa atta now the bhakti is divided into different categories the worldly then scriptural the spiritual physical vocal mental the different type of devotion you can send namuda bhakti there's a traditional nine ways of devotion there we are not going to discuss today on on that there's a different topic but gatto agnathwa so this is the main thing have faith why sudan krishna said don't have any doubt about it with promise ramakrishna said god is there you can see god you can talk to god and why not believe it the great soul when he is telling that is there and it's truly we can see that god then the lord described the responsibilities of the devotees now the devotees have come to what they should do that what is the responsibility then he is telling in the 34 words worship archanam saab parichar jaya praise sutihi and salute my image praha guna karmanu kirtanam they should also do the same to my devoted devotees the sadhus sadhu he has said who is a good sadhu and the person who is having all those qualities and for him also almost like a living god the devotee should worship the sadhu what the devotee should do he should see god in the images in the picture in the photos and that way they can understand oh this is the god masala devi said about bhagavan si rama krishna that looking at his picture he's also seeing him and if you look at the picture of bhagavan's ramakrishna you see god this is a great statement of mother when we are looking at the picture immediately we can imagine i am looking at the god god in human form i can recognize it when the god comes in the form of vishnu shankarchakra padmadhari and it is assam conception is very difficult to accept because we are not habituated with the four hands and all those type of the description that has been given for the god no we are not but when you look at ramakrishna just like any of our family member an elderly person maybe my father my grandfather i can look at him i can talk to him there is nothing absurd in it and that's why the when the arjuna saw the the bishop rupa of the sri krishna he said krishna it is unbearable a man like arjuna he said krishna it is unbearable i cannot look at you in this way please come back to the normal form i like to see you in that form and here the god has come in a so humble simple form and when you look at it so he says darshana then spersana when you were cleaning the photo or the image this person archanam then we are worshiping there are methods that their systems are there it has been developed through ages and it is also available the the short worship of sri ramakrishna the what one should do and how to do everything is there so archanam and the best thing in sunam krishna tradition anyone can do the worship in the other places some of the people i do not know why they said only the person who is a brahmana who was born in a brahmana family is allowed to do the worship but in the iran krishna tradition it is not if you have devotion then you are capable to worship as the whether the lady or the gentleman nope no problem though you should have the faith and love for god so darshana sparshana and archanam worship paricarjaya then serving then when you are serving you are preparing a girl and then putting the girl in burning an incense sticks cleaning the whole temple area and also preparing food for god and this god in the human form they had some choices they liked some type of food so you prepare those things as best as possible and prepare in a great with great care that it should not be touched by anything else then you are offering it in the whole process your whole mind is thinking of god and the more you are thinking of god more your mind is purified again and again as we said that i mainly mentioned as i say i believe that there are only two things the world and god the god who is the creator and the world is his creation now if we go to god we have to leave his creation but after the realization of the god if god wills he can send back to this creation and you can enjoy the same creation too like the avatars so this is the way we have to then preacher just means here salute me and they they always say particularly the vishnu tradition the devotional tradition they say one should lie down on his chest and stretch his hand touch the forehead on the floor and the hand both the palms are touching the floor and the whole body should touch the floor and so that you are ashtanga all eight parts of your body touching that and then you are giving that including your mind so that is the way you should why i'm humble sad when the arjuna was you know the bhagavad-gita the arjuna in the he was going on giving the argument the lord was very quietly listening he never commented but the wind arjuna said shishasi ham sadhi mom tuam prapandam i am your disciple and i beg your mercy i am totally confused i cannot take any decision please guide me then the flow of mercy and the god's grace started coming to arjuna through buddhi that we know here also when we show that we are humble then the grace of god they come so first one should look at the god see god and that is the reason bhagavan sinama krishna he's the god himself so he is telling that one should make the idol an image of god in such a way so that people love to see that beautiful image sometimes we make somehow and then the eyes are not properly there it is an image only you are making we do not know whether god is just like that or not through that particular image we are trying to go to god why don't you make the image nicely the god is durga sometimes some people they make the image in such a way so fears fear that maybe outsiders are doing but the devotee should see a very loving face of mother the krishna so attractive krishna the eyes are so beautiful once you look at those eyes you won't be able to turn it off from there the god's image should be very attractive very beautiful wherever we do we must keep in mind the gods first thing is attraction and krishna is attracting and beautiful image so you look at that image and you like to see that image you like to meditate on that image you like to keep that image within your heart that is the way first darshana the first thing is first you see and then lava's love at first sight the moment you are looking at that beautiful image you started loving that god then sparshana you become close to that god then you go and touch the feet of the god and slowly you are touching his body cleaning that and you are thinking i am touching the god's body many people in different temples hindu temples thousands of temples millions of images are there and thousands of worshipers are also there but they don't do all those things with devotion why because you have to read the scripture the scripture will guide you so when you are touching you should feel i am touching the god sometimes we put the chandana on the forehead of the god and it goes to the eye of the god on the eye of the god now you think if the chandana is rolling on the eye of the of you will you feel comfortable immediately will go wash and splash same thing with god because he is leaving and my beloved only so one should be very very careful when you are decorating the god and by that way oh this is only a picture is nothing no not like that you should think that this is the god before me and when we are crossing we must be very humbly crossed before this is the temple the god is sitting we are just crossing in front without caring what god is sitting there no one should not this is not a devotee devotee will never do like that you will be humble as if the lord god is sitting over there and with the folded hands he should cross so darshana archanam worship whatever way you like to worship you can worship only thing you have to go on telling you from pouring your heart to god and tell him everything and also as you feel hungry offer food to god as you feel thirsty offer water to god like that that is called archanam then preacher john stutihi parichar just this is the reason we chant the saudra the great souls they compose this thing see suppose there was no nothing was there to chant how it would be so that is the great contribution that our the predecessors they have composed swami vivekananda has composed a beautiful aratrika song kandana bhava bandhana jaga bandhana bhanditovai if you understand the meaning of it automatically your whole mind will be concentrated majority of the people they only sing and they don't particularly know what are the words they're uttering and even if they know they don't understand the meaning but even then they are doing but if you can understand not only clearly the words and also the meaning of it your whole soul your whole mind is becoming concentrated with every word of it that is called archana and this paricharja we are serving the god serving the god means that is exactly where swami vivekananda said service to man is service to god why is this vivekananda because he was an emotional person he said like that no we will come to that and for that we have to go quickly of course and this different verses are there we will find how the god is telling each and everything is nothing but me whomever you serve it comes to me so this is the 34 verse in 35th verse he says with faith they should listen about me when you were reading the biography of ramakrishna or masharada or reading the bhagavata tenth skandha tenth chapter the idea about the krishna sridha with complete faith and when we are reading that book we have to transport our mind into that situation that condition forget about everything only suppose you are reading five pages and it will take hardly 10 minutes and when you are reading just you read like this no it is not a novel it's not a story book it is something that you are going to visualize and swami turiya nanduji said today's imagination tomorrow's realization you are imagining that you are standing before so every time when we chant the bhagavad-gita and that all those things we chant this is the gita dhyana fast sloka and the fifth verse if time is there the whole gita dhana can be chanted but first and fifth is all right when you are just chanting om parthaya prathibodhitam and you imagine that the lord god sri krishna is standing there and he is in the battlefield so many thousands of people waiting to kill each other and there the calm and composed sri krishna is giving the wonderful lesson to arjuna arjuna the powerful man is sitting at the feet of the krishna imagine that and then there is a person who is noting down all the conversation vyasa vyasay nagartitam purana monina mahabharatam the gita is nothing but the highest advaita and that is flow is coming and you are going to receive that there is only one existence and nothing else the thousands and millions of soldiers who are there each and every one is so eager to kill other and each and everyone is so egoistic thinking that i am going to kill someone but i will be surviving that is the situation and there you are thinking completely ego free completely dedicated to god so the this complicated situation you are putting your mind swami vivekananda said if you can meditate in the hostels and basels of new york then only i can appreciate anyone can go in a corner and a silent place whether he will meditate or not but in the hustles and bustles all around in the and that to new york even at the time of swami vivekananda new york was so busy city and now unthinkable manhattan my god you cannot move so there if you can completely think all these things and nothing but the the pictures just movie only one god is there consciousness is there so that is telling then and he should also do the same to my devoted devotees meditating what will happen if you give the wholeheartedly the and you serve very humbly and by with a devoted mind cerebral lob offer everything oh i am doing this because i will get back these i have done this many the pujas and so i am going to gain these no nothing like that majority of the people they come and they come to the eastern religion particularly hindu religion thinking there must be something miraculous power is there and if we follow that we will achieve that they'll try to meditate and then they can control this man that man nothing like that if you have those of course the result is there power is there if you have those you are not going to get the blessings of god so that in the 35th verse it says with a great devotion they should listen to my words and they should meditate also on me sariba lava upoharanam offer me wholeheartedly anything they have achieved yet karoshi yadashnazi hosi dadasiyat in the bhagavad gita same krishna is telling whatever you are doing whatever just give it to me offer it to me so that way and serve like a humble servant when we are cleaning oh i am cleaning this nobody is doing it no i got the opportunity to do it and i should do it and when you are doing it humbly you should do sometimes some people cleaning the temple creating the sound and dragging the chair they are not actually serving god they are cleaning but the devotee will never make any sound in the temple the god is sitting i cannot make that like that but unfortunately if you go to the hindu temple i don't know why the bhagavata they read but why they don't understand that god loves cleanliness but the majority of the temple there will be so so much of water and the old flowers they are walking on that and whole area is so dirty you cannot go and sit under that then they are burning the the lambs the oil is also spilling on that oh god so that there they have kept the guard and then do think that god will be very happy never the god loves cleanliness and in the christian tradition they nicely say cleanliness is next to the godliness so that is the very clean you should be physically also so that you have to and server haranam darshana with the humbleness they should dedicate mata janma karma kathanam everything the god is dictating god is telling you this is the way you should do they should discuss about my life and divine actions janma karma janma the birth and karma the action that the god has done they should do that what is the bible and the life of jesus if you don't know and if you try to get his teachings you don't go that way well to the person you can read only the teachings but if you know the dedication contribution of the jesus his whole life lord buddha his whole life sirama krishna his whole life the great master is a very authentic biography of sri ramakrishna written by a direct disciple of sir krishna if you read you will find oh yes and the life of sri swami vivekananda mother then only you can appreciate what they are telling they lived those things you should understand you should listen the birth the divine birth of god very humbled birth look at lord that that buddha he was a king son mother was a queen and she was a princess and she was going as is the tradition in india the child birth should be in the maternal house so the lady she was going to go to her father's place but the god the divine god who was to incarnate as buddha he never liked it so she had to stop and give birth to the divine baby in a jungle and that jungle of course afterwards it has become a great pilgrimage center but in a jungle she that boy was born this diseases in a very humble birth and the siddha krishna in a very humble birth so that is the way we have to understand how in the sri krishna himself his parents were in the prison and he was born manifested over there in the prison still it is there in india mathura so this is the way the janma karma the kathanam muma parba onum and they should organize programs they should organize the programs the the divine programs with the music song dance and the celebrate in my temple so that is the reason in all temple they are organizing this this is the scriptural injunction instruction by the sri krishna directly yatra they should have the pilgrimage they should go to different holy places offering of worship and you will find all the time the either the the fruits and sweets and clothings and with some cash the money they will offer it to god so that because those people who are serving over there they will eat those things as a prasada and they also distribute on all special day of the year special day of the year sometimes in akshaya special day kali puja special day navaratri is a special day similarly in all religion the traditions are there special day tradition so that way they should follow and then baidi ka tantrika diksha initiation is a must for making the spiritual development most of the people they think no i understand this so i will have this way no initiation is necessary and here the lord is mentioning not that the vaishnava we know the diksa he is telling tantriki diksha the bahidi ki diksha means is a is an initiation with knowledge tantriki diksha knowledge clubbed with action and devotion so that is called tantra ki diksha ramakrishna mission they combine this by diki and tantriki they both tradition is there knowledge is there action means karma puja is there worship is there and repetition of the lord's name as the tradition of the tantra that is also there so bharadiki tantriki and sometimes you have to take the wow what is that now i am going to fast on this particular day and going to take ten thousand names of god today like this brata dharanam navarathri the nine nights all the devotee they will follow that fasting the whole day and then taking the lord's name like the different way they will be observing and sometimes they will have the upper vasa uber washer means fasting so that is the way one should continue with so look at it how specifically he is mentioning mentioning my images should be installed with faith the god's images we'll come to that what are the images he said my images should be installed with great faith with eagerness if possible by the self at the devotee if he is capable he should make a temple and put the guard individual if not collect fund from the public and install that with the help of the other and that is the endeavor udtama when you have thinking that i should start a temple and but i don't have much money and then you go to different people and approach them uddama you have to go every time every time and then only slowly slowly you can collect the fund and can start a temple and along with that you must construct garden so when a person is going to the temple there should be a small garden with the flower so the mind is changing if you go to bellarmort they've nicely planned in that way now because of the tremendous pressure and the space is not more so construction they are making for feeding 10 000 people at a time where they will feed so the buildings are coming up but mostly it is all ground green grasses trees bars are there like that flowers lot of flowers the moment when going to the temple mind should change so that is fast orchard should be there and akira playgrounds are the children are coming they are not very much interested to go to the temple their parents will go and the children should have the place to play over there so the playgrounds and pura mandira karmani residents and the temple where the residents the devotee is coming from far where they will go this is lord krishna is telling thousands of years before so the guest houses should be there when the people coming from the distance can come and rest over there almost all the temple everywhere in india they will have a one part for the guest coming from different place and they're staying over there so this is the way says then he is telling some marjana cleaning temple should be clean every nook and corner should be clean because two things that way in the ancient hindus they are very very careful about the hygiene then afterwards like many other things these have also been destroyed but the hindus were very hygienic society was there and this hygiene in because in the temple is a common place different people are coming if there is some something wrong then it will be affected the people who are coming they will be affected they should not so some margin i'm cleaning that means you should color it coloring is also very important but the temple means very clean and it must be properly colored and see ka mandala bhartanam watering and also drawing the different painting should be there in different places and sufficient water means different people are coming there that toilet system should be there water should be there when the person is coming from distance those who are worshipping the god in the temple it is their responsibility because you have constructed the temple the devotees who are coming should not feel the any problem after reaching over there it is our responsibility so those who are living in the temple or in the society they it is their responsibility to look after service of my temple service of my temple mayhem my temple how we should do dasabath oh we are only doing these people are not doing i am only doing this duty others are not doing there should not be any grumbling that's why again and again our seniors they used to say always think that you are blessed that you have got this opportunity god's work anyone can do anytime anyone can come and do it but this is my blessedness i have been chosen for this particular duty i am doing it swami vivekananda worked and imagined he used to deliver eight to ten lectures every day and there was no microphone almost shouting and 10 lectures and every time new ideas new subject and when he where he used to speak before the americans who never heard about india as a country and there swami vivekananda used to tell them about indian culture and religion vedanta can you imagine but he never said why god is taking so much of why not the other devotee other brother disciples he never said like that he went over there he walked this is i am blessed the god has given me this any cleaning and this i am in the kitchen or i'm cleaning the floors or i'm in the hospital or in the school wherever i am i am blessed that god has chosen me for this job harmly very harmly one should do again and again i say particularly in the american situation there only devotees are working and the other devotees who are coming in they see a volunteer but they will never consider there is a separate person they will consider that man as a representative of this society this vedanta society if that young man make a mistake they will go and put in the comment oh these people don't don't know how to behave and then all the time the bad names will be there bad names to whom to god if they come and see the cob waves here and there immediately they will go and tell see i went to that temple they are not clean at all it's terrible it is better not to go there so they came to god that because of my fault i the servant over here i forgot that i am the servant i forgot that i am a humble servant of god so that is why it is great responsibility those who are working for the organization at this center it is not a club it is a temple it is a spiritual society so whoever comes should be treated in a great like our honored guest without hankering for name and fame then when we are working without anchoring for name and fame or dambittam free from the ego kritasya or parikhitanam not proprigating about one's own work i have done this i am that this i am one should not do that so if i go on trumpeting beating the drum about my i did this good work that is very bad opi then he gives an example when you are offering you are burning a lamp and offered that to god should not use the lamb the light of the lamb for your own purpose that is also not nami upo junjat nivedhanam even the light of the lamb offered to me should not be used for your personal purpose in the 41 verse it says what is most convertible to people and whatever is very dear to one those should be offered to me the whatever extra is there i'm offering to god not like that the best thing that i like i should offer to god you know there is a system in india that the people they go a particular pilgrim place is there and suppose you like to eat apple of all fruits you should offer the apple over there to god and say no god i am not going to eat apple i dedicate why to control the senses that is the way but here the god is telling whatever you think best for you you love that you should offer that you should offer ya ishta tamam loki i love this thing i should offer that is the reason when i am purchasing anything for me at least some portion i should purchase first for god not that i purchased something and then took it from there and give it to god no no no no people should understand this that is not the system friends let me conclude now it is almost time that who are the images of god now the temple is there and different things are there we are now ready but what is the god image on whom we can worship i will tell you that small story incident that happened in suramar krishna's life the ceramic krishna was in calcutta for treatment and that is called shampoo shampoo is a locality and that was the kali puja night sriram krishna the worshiper got his kali she asks the devotee to worship kali all the items they
