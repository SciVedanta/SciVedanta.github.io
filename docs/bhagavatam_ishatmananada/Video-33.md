[Bhagavatam 056 : Argument Of a Devotee](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S5LVJbOWn0)

booyakasha now but mana solution be schwa our governess attrition me governor shuhang Lakshmi condom Kamala jnanam you the Anakim bond additional papaya harem serve aloo quicker today we will see how the devotee is arguing with the God so that is today's discussion we are actually going through following the discussion between the lava a great devotee of Krishna and a frame to and he was the minister of the Krishna so that would have a he will be putting the arguments very interesting arguments and the Krishna will be giving the answer we don't know whether we'll be able to reach to that or not but it will continue so today is the arguments of the devotees because of the presence of God in the form of Krishna this Java clan became invincible they became so powerful wherever used to goal is to conquer no one could defeat them so obviously we could understand we can understand that they be giving a mystic whenever the success comes that brings the ego but we forget the success is coming because of the presence of God blessings of God this is a very peculiar thing when we are not successful we always go to God and go to Temple we go to only people we always pray to them but the moment you become successful we forget and you start thinking that is because of me same thing happened to the other a plan they became very powerful and obviously they were rich and arrogant these are the things automatically comes they forgot the reason of their success that the presence of the God among them rather they became egoistic and ego makes a person away from God always this is the thickness of organs Lama Krishna said you have to remove the ego and in Bengali he said army male coochie and Josh all problem will be solved if you can remove the ego so this ego they took them away with God every effort becomes successful without God every effort become failure whatever the effort we may do but we need the blessings of God that's where in the last verse of the bhagavad-gita it is said that you have to strive you have to try but you ensure a Krishna but at the same time the blessings of God is also necessary otherwise it is not possible sometimes a very intelligent student and he has written the answer so perfectly unfortunately it goes in the hands of a teacher who never read the justice to that he was angry never ate that properly he gave them marks and you have nothing to do so it goes in this way why and you know particularly when we are going for the American visa American people don't understand what India knows when you go for the American visa is all depends on luck one couple wait they said oh you are elderly couple now if you go and you will stay back we won't give you perdition another couple wind almost the same age without any question gifted so how can we explain this this is very peculiar so this is what our ancestors are telling you must must pray to God why this God is so we have to Brahma and other gods they all came the last time we read and we discussed they all came and they observe the egoistic behavior of this clan the other clan and they understood that that these are coming to end because the God himself took birth in that he manifested in that clan and he was leading that plan they were successful how come they became good still so obviously the gods understood oh now the divine play is going to be completed so they all came they all came that and - they understood that Shri Krishna is going to separate himself so they came and the Brahma Saint not naughty Alcala are deep Acharya Bishu shittim coulombs a big brush up in not the prime of Buddhism Oh God the support of the universe God is the support of the universe isn't it because God is the only thing now the problem comes when we try to explain God through science science is external it can explain only those things which we can touch can smell can feel Exeter but what about the internal that is the main that is called the philosophy and the religion here you can never now suppose someone ask you can you measure the love of your mother you can go and check maybe it will be jumping like this and all mother love me so much is just jumping in the monitor that is not the way you feel and someone loves you you need to talk about that you will feel it even the animals also can feel if you love the dog the dog he loves understand it how it is possible because the communication it is very subtle and if you don't like God dogs they also understand they were working all the time why this person here how it is possible so same here also the God was there everything was positive God is not there slowly he's disassociating from the clan so the Brahma and other gods they came and he said he's you know that in a very respectfully you are the support of the universe you do not have any world to perform you're all this work is done and your clan in which you have advented the yada bar is at the point of destruction due to the brahmanas cars if the last class those who have attended you know how that course was the Shambo was the son of Krishna his name was Shambo is a very famous personality and this Shambo the son of Lord Krishna you know sometimes the father's the parents they come and say we could not make up our children properly we tried so much but they went indeed even the Krishna his son Shambo what he did with all his friends they are all young people they drank a lot and they were roaming on the streets and then they found that after the holy performances Rishi's are returning back and I found oh these are the people let us go and have some fun with them so Samba he dressed like a pregnant woman lady and he went and frames their ask sad can you please tell what the wait is this person is I mean the dating is going to give birth of a girl or a son Rishi's could see they could understand they became angry they never expected that insert and they said we give you the curves that he is going to give birth of a mashallah mashallah almost like you know the javelin very sharp and strong iron made and truly Shanga they produced that from his body and after that they understood oh my god it was a mistake and these young people they tried to break it they broke it in a small small pieces threw it in the water in the river but even the Rishi's curse the holy man's curse so that that's why I should not make the holy man angry if you don't make them happy at least don't make them angry ok so this is the way always it happens and this mashallah purpose this commercial of perversion is that that we eat wind the Brahma also said to the law so that was the curse that the Brahma was mentioning the Lord if you wish please go back to your own abode that the Brahma he is the manager you know they the Brahma was created by God himself but he is the manager shirt after he is managing everything so he came and told God all people are behaving like this you have to do something so God took the human form he took birth as a Krishna and he settled all those things then that Brahma came and told you have done whatever we supposed to do now if you like I cannot ask you go back so if you like said you can go back history Tata so Dharma but among wishes were a demoness a Yeti Manasa is a Sanskrit word if you think you demon you say you can go back to sword Hama in your own world and the sugar he is giving the description and he described the condition of the yadavas and the unique behavior of lord krishna who completely unheard so we have to learn from the behavior of the lord krishna his own clan his own son his own family and he himself made all these things but you know what he withdrew this is the important thing in the spiritual life we can do many things but we have the power to withdraw ourselves no we'd get so much attached it is almost impossible and there the differences what is the difference with spirituality and worldly mentality worldly mentality is already attached with anything they like and spirituality spiritual person they like it the limited but when necessary they can withdraw their mind from it that is worth there's a krishna deed and he said that's what harm then suka is the Pavan aha the God is telling you do with dance a market on so now it says like this way you do Britain the brigde means the elderly people and the from the the clan of the adduce all young people they were killed except the women and the girls no when one survived so they killed each other that was the terrible thing only the people who were not in that who were close to Krishna they all gathered around Krishna and Raghavan that God himself aha told them to whom you do Britain some market on the teams God didn't go to them to tell but when he came and requested for the advice then the God is telling go to probe Martha privacy is another place now this Krishna established a wonderful another Kingdom in the western part of India it's still there it's Gujarat nominated a good round and if one small part of Gujarat is controversial it's also very very holy place go to prom harsha the holy place immediately leaving that to our car the main place where the krishna stablished his kingdom to ARCA so to our table still there and there is a way to work up and another place is not named like bed were cut and people the girls till the goal but original the worker they say it went into the water still they are submerged under the ocean then the Krishna is telling you better go to prove our right now those who are surviving better go leave right now don't wait and after go to that place and bathe in that holy water and after bathing offer puja and offer the to the gods and give gifts to the holy people and does you'll be free from scenes this in 30 people didn't do anything only the younger generation they were making like that the pranks and then the curses came but this is the problem in this xiety if someone is doing bad then all are affected no one can be saved so this is the way it always goes and that is the reason it is the responsibility of the elders to take care of the junior people guide them properly so that they grow with the sensible mind what we are doing we should be careful because this is going to affect others all elders of the other birds who survived the curse and factory side of war the death from the hands of their own people they came to meet the Krishna and Krishna set like this go to the prakasha ET we somewhat parta could teach disturb at the hub a table some good food pata hood bottom is the calamity that has come on us in with her moon right now Papa's channel coolest Hadid cool Ostia are sealed Brahman impure to retire because the curse that has been given by the Rishi's the brahmanas they are not mentioning rishi they are mentioning brahman about the brahmana those who are realized Souls those who have realized the Brahman the all-pervading consciousness whom we in a simple language called God those who have realized God their words that is not me they curse that all the other words will die those who are here so you are also other words though you didn't do anything but you will be also under that in better leave run right now and it says again and again Christian is telling right now you should leave and the road under this Shambo now let me give you a little information about this you know the Samba that particular son of three Krishna who played that prize he developed leprosy and as a terrible disease in those days and you know the in the Jesus life the leprosy people the he develop it Prince he developed the leprosy what will happen he went to bed Dwarka and started worshipping the Sun God so they say they described in this way he understood the his mistake then he went to the wait worker and sat over there D is after days worshipping the Sun the moment the Sun is rising he is looking at it and getting all that Sun dream and slowly this is the sunlight therapy he was pure in the present day Jamnagar still got cities the air represented Gujarat India is having Ranjit Institute of poly radial therapy many of you must be knowing this was built by Ranjit Singh before the world war ii the slowly revolving towers provides full day long sunlight for the treatment of skin diseases the the shunga he is worshipping the Sun though the language is there worshipping the Sun in reality he was having the sunray therapy this is very very essential here also the people they say from here all the time here in the room you must go out at least for 20-25 minutes the sunray is essential in this country so like that it is not for the skin disease or bitumen deism so these skin disease is still there today we are curing through the sunray so this the chambre D D and it says papatuanuku la RC brahmana via the they are Lord and say if we wish to live we must go to professor here the say Krishna he is telling them if we is including himself though that God is not having any debt or anything and he changed but is a we we must go to prahara impossible to deal and should prayed in that holy water which cured Chandra from the car subtraction again another small incident story of goals so when you are reading the this book you should be ready to the other they are giving a beautiful way all advices now and then they will be taking you to different incidents so you never feel bored reading this book that is this wonderful way to say and always it is connecting with a scientific truth this chandra chandra means the moon it is sees the light chandra we shall also become pure and then offer our respect to our ancestors and be happy again so we can overcome what happened to Chandra here we should understand that astronomy and the metrology coming that is Prajapati Daksha he was having 27 daughters and Chandra the most beautiful of all the celestial being he married all the 27 daughters of the duction now the duck share the Prajapati the king he said not my son you are marrying all my daughters no problem but you should be attentive to all of them equally no partiality Chandra told okay that will be done and then he said if you miss make the mistake then I will curse you I will give you the punishment the Chandra our sacred is okay 27 and you know that lunar system the lunar month the Hindus they follow both lunar month and also the solar month and that's why you will find in the Almanac of the Hindus there are all differences this time one Almanac will say this holy day is on this particular date and another will say no after two days how they are calculating this lunar month and the solar month so that is the difference so this way it goes and according to the lunar month which the Muslims are always following and that's why they will never ever change their dates and you know that they all depend on the moon not on Sun the Muslims they always work so that their calculation is always on the moon and if they can't see the moon in that proper time their fasting will continue unless and until so what they do now adidas has become very helpful anywhere in the world if they see the moon they will inform all over the world and all the Muslims they will then break their fasting one month fasting they follow according to the moon and if they can't see that moon and on that particular day the first thing will continue but suppose there are a lot of clouds and they won't be able to see what will happen so they are nowadays and internationally they are calculating this is Chandra you know how many stars are there who are the daughters of the Prajapati Daksha starts and there are 27 stars and their names few names I can tell you the Indians has big names Swati slatina chakra many of you know but once the Ramakrishna said at the time of the Swati nakshatra when the moon will be near to this particular star which is sateen and even that particular time any rain falls in that rain falls in some oyster and then the oyster goes down and to all this calculation in the story loved ones languish now and here this Watty nakshatra then hostile action and then another star is called a star the Swami Vivekananda was born in that particular nutshell when the moment he was born that time the moon was read as thoughts that's why they calculate the Indian the moment that a baby is born immediately they will take the that particular moment they will recall the timing and the place he is born as it all changes suppose on one particular day first March a baby is born in America in Chicago first mark a baby is born in India Delhi will be different so when they are calculating their future it will be completely different because the change of this doctor we are not going to in details of those things but really interesting now here these 27 Chandler's that they're the stars so they are moving another is ro Heaney and you know this is the nakshatra and the Shri Krishna was born another nakshatra another star name is kuba at Rapada governments Ram Krishna was born in that and like this oh boy bada bada bada a shiny pulp of al-ghani under balcony Beshara bona so many names at there 27 names so these is are these are the stars the moon is traveling now the pool man there are seven stars Twenty twenty seven stars but that these are twenty eight days so what he will do and if you notice every day the moon is moving to one star and it is then the last one that is called Rohini the brightest one and they see the moon and the way they describe it is not the human thing it was all celestial ZV he start loving the roni because of her beauty more than the others so he started spending two days with Rohini and one one day with the other stars other stars became angry all the 26 of them they went and complained to their father and the father duck sure he told Chandra I told you you should not do it but general what do you do 28 days he has to travel like that so that is that the way they always present so it is it becomes very interesting for the people to read but in reality it is all celestial thing and the Chandra main thing is the beauty Chandra is beautiful most beautiful and the Dutch accost him slowly slowly you will lose your beauty and what the Chandra will do he went to the propulsion and he paid in that holy water and then he prayed to the God and once again it came back that is a world story and this way and the Shri Krishna mentioning the story methodological story and telling let us also go to pravara and bead in that in every religion there will be a holy place holy water and they will always allow them or ask them to go and bathe in that and particularly the Islam which developed in the Middle East waters scarcity and very easy and a will all jump John and the will water decide is very very pure why because that is the only water source people should not make dirty so they say D system the God law if you dig the water and drink and babe it will be purified Ganga the same way ganga jamuna the diversity all these rivers is the holy river only river widens every day but because the people immediately the owner this is a holy river you know the most of the people before touching the water with the name they will touch with the hand sprinkle on the aid then only they will go to the water otherwise not but the moment you go and try to tell them to the science they say what is that the water pollution who is making nothing like they will never listen to you but if you tell them through the religion they'll follow it so this is the way they protected and this water so they all went referring to that the Krishna is telling yet trust not wha - apart grito Hashanah would to hard wood to rot means the moon be mocked til me shot said to be G who you collude am friends those who are reading the bhagavad-gita you can understand the difference of the sign language this language same Sanskrit but little different than the bhagavad-gita whether what interest language is very simple so it become very popular most of the people they will be reading the Sanskrit in the bhagavad-gita this is eardrops not dois so bathing in which the chandra got cured from the curse yet trust not to Daksha shabad the curse of the duction now suka who was narrating those incident - king brick-shaped inform him that the other burst made necessary arrangement go we should not forget those who are regularly attending this bother of the class and you know that main character of his role is the sugar and sugar learnt it from his father the archer then the sugar came to a king who was again getting ready for his death on the bank of a river so this is all the study goes they were not afraid of death the moment they understood that I am going to die was a young man he was again that's curse so he went and he was waiting for the death on the bank of the river he was a nice King is a very good King he was a relation of the original so obviously many people came and he was saved before he was born by Krishna and when once again he is cursed I'm going to get made the dead all people came to see another miracle so something is surely going to happen less time to Krishna may come and protect him so all came and together and that time this sugar he's the purest of the pure why he was not body consciousness so what is the difference between purity and impurity ego the more you are egoistic the more the body consciousness comes how people will look at me all this cinema artist the movie artist they are all careful about their look how people look at me how is my trace how is these how is that they're spending millions on that why because there's so much attached to the body and the body is the only capital if the body is not there then what they will do the poor fellows they can't eat evil and look at me I don't care about partying I go and eat then you can just moment you see a big game just enter and have some nice food but those who are care all about the body and he will never do it now that it is bad but this is very good thing but here in the spiritual like they say the moment the body consciousness comes that is you are separate from the God so they are very much concerned about their own life so they were preparing the forgot what the God is going to do now this is the point the God the Sri Krishna was sitting over there he observed the calamity and he saw all his clan they are dying people are dying killing each other the terrible thing was going on he could stop it but he didn't do he was simply waiting according to your karma fella you should have to suffer his son he was cursed and he developed the leprosy kushner didn't do anything you did the wrong thing you have to be punished and this is called religion the religion is completely neutral oh this is my family this is my Y this is my person so I will protect them name wherever that's why the religious people mostly they don't marry right no attitude completely Jesus Shankar Acharya Laputa not like that so this is the way they're always the same so here all people are living now this person the shuka table he is telling again to that King is narrating the story and from that only we are getting somebody recorded and the game and he said you know what happened another Java all well afraid they all were leaving only one person he came and he came and kept his head on the field of selfishness and he said pranam ma she raza Pardo pran Jenny Tom Oh Harshit aha Harshit ah addressed and he saved and who is this food double whatever was also a double but this is the difference that this person that would double he was not fleeing going away from there he heard how Krishna is here how can he live no we should not what is the devotee he didn't know wherever God is there is safety so then make no difference to the hood Taba was growing up along with the Krishna he played with him he did everything as the in the same age the children they do everything they were doing the playing thinking bathing together going and eating together everything same just like the brain but he knew Krishna is nothing but the god supreme in that human form so he came at this moment and prana mashiro sabado he kept his aide on the feet of the holy Krishna and a versatile David official Yuji sure who knows Rabbinical Tana some retweeted coulomb Newnham locums untouchable bond be brush sharpen summer topi Prytania dich whare is telling in the 11th book sixth chapter 42 verse he is mentioning Deva Deva Asia with many addressing the Krishna you are the god of all gods Ayesha Ayesha means the God sometimes they translate as Lord that these gods are G capital and G small the small G's means they are also very powerful but they are not the Supreme God goddess G capital and he is everywhere so did you are the Asia Asia means the God of all the gods and he was the supreme god you were the yoga yoga Asia again those who are attaching themselves or in unity with the God you were again the Lord of that yoga we know the yoga the yoga nowadays the the word yoga is very popular but that is for physical exercise but another Yoga is the union with God the sometimes you will find the people are sitting over here closing their eyes meditation what is this meditation making the union with God how forgetting mind myself that's all the way you forget yourself what remains consciousness and what is that consciousness God so what is meditation forget yourself you have to forget that you are there is all people around so that he said you are the location who knows Ravana Keerthana and if the people are listening to your words and if they are singing your name if they are reading about you and that is the only thing the most of the Indian people you'll find early morning they will bathe and the Ganga they will see go to the temple they will see it and chant the name of God sometimes they will meditate and take the name of God silently that's called japa then they will open the book and read from the holy book ramakrishna mission shown is they always believed that all paths are leading to the same goal so they have no distinction I follow the Hindu path and I follow be daunted that is one thing but I am NOT going to criticize others too I respect them too there was a very famous Swami in Brindavan Bend our bond is not the holy place of the the fish naver's so in Brindavan history and he was very old when I made him and he used to go to the temple in the early morning and with a Quran a Bible at repeater and bhagavad-gita this for books used to take he could not carry his assistant used to K so he'll be sitting then he will meditate for some time and he will open a book and read from the Quran he will read few pages then again you'd meditate after some time you'll open another book like that morning 7:00 to 11:00 11:30 he was to practice every day then he'll be coming back and taking the lunch taking little rest that was his routine he was the direct disciple of marshal domine TV all our monks they used to have the great respect for him and I also went and took his blessings so this person what he did what is the holy activity that he did reading the holy books and sometimes some Hindus will be reading only their books but sometimes the Vedanta they read only without the book and never other books and if the art which novels they will read only bhagavata and nothing else and even in the bhagavata if there is a discussion of the giana they will not read that part so this is not good the narrowness friends after some time today I am going to address as gathering in the church in the Methodist Church they are going to introduce me to their congregation because with the grace of the mother and the taku we are going to purchase that property in the Methodist Church maybe with within two three days so those people they invited me to introduce to their gathering what type of religious people we are they do not know we are going to meet them this is the thing I am going to tell them that we are following my bad but at the same time we have the respect for you too but the only thing we should be good people in the name of religion we should not cheat others and in the name of religion we should not create problem in the society no we should not if we cannot realize God okay that is up to me but don't go on telling that other gods are all false God don't believe them if necessary go and fight with them this is not religion so now it is time the modern times so this we have to understand so he is telling oh you are the god of gods you could protect your family but you didn't do that the Buddha was telling you have the power to protect your family but you didn't do that I don't know why you are the issue you are the all-powerful you could protect it summer thought appeal even though you are capable you didn't do I don't know why you did it it is up to you so this is the devotee they don't go and ask the God why you are not doing it they'll never do it why the mother there must be a purpose complete faith in God's actions that is the devotion what is devotion complete faith in God's action the moment I'm happy oh god is good the moment I'm unhappy there is no God I don't believe in God is this a devotee no he's a another in the market only so he is going and even good in getting dessert no this is not so they should not be like that I believe in God means in all action of God I don't have any doubt and I am NOT going to first change so that he is telling I knew God you are all-powerful and you could protect this your own clan but you didn't do that because you have this - Quint I don't have any problem in that Oh Lord I don't have anything to say about your decision my problem is now the argument of the devotee he easily my problem is Nahum Taba UNK Rika malam Shanna Dharma op Acacia bar tab - sonata Hinata sua Tama now your mama P my problem woke a Chaba even for half a moment I dare not leave you this is the love the love is I cannot leave you even for a second no I cannot leave this is my problem you are not doing these dad that is your problem you do whatever we but when you are living for you citta mama what will happen to me I am NOT going to leave you I cannot so he said in this way that please take me also with you to your own abode then is okay I want to be with you this is the love of God I don't want name I don't want Fame I don't want physical comfort I don't want anything except your company Oh God and that is called the love of God cut off mom Priam atmanam Byam bhakta stagy mahi in other when they say they always respectfully they said by um by means we always plural never Singler III the Indian tradition listen now this is bad so Allah say bye am we writing here I learned you are signing the later why you are mentioning we what do we so he must be you hi so this is so a tradition is no we we means humble like me many other people is not I only your devotee like me any other people at the end how shall we your devotee leave without you this is the argument of a devotee to God you are our most beloved you are always present in our mind when you were sleeping sitting walking leaving bathing sporting eating you are present and this is called devotion practice of the presence of God every moment this is called devotion I just beat one day and I go to the temple and offer the best apple to the God and God notice it was very costly epilim given to you so you should not forget my face and whenever I ask something you must grant that immediately is this love is this devotion this is only and then as Fromme is he say that's why jesus he took up a stick in his hand and then started chasing the people in the synagogue it's not a church in the synagogue and you are shouting don't make my father's house a business house a business place and that is got business oh if you give me this much money then I will give you this thing God will protect you this is a business who are you to keep promise on behalf of the God you are not supposed to if the God comes to me and say that is different but who are you but most of the people you do and most of us lottery people because we are afraid we do not love God if we love God then we go and claim to him why you should not give it to me you have given me the birth and being my father being my mother you are supposed to protect me to look after me you must give me the one lady was telling can I ask something for me and why not otherwise where we will go who else is there the one bigger came to a great king shamrock birth he was the great and then the they asked wait the other is praying after his prayer he will grant you so there he was listening to our God is praying Oh God Almighty give me more power give me more wealth give me more then this man got up and here's were going out Alber noticed it and say what is it wait let me finish my prayer no no no I don't take anything from another bigger what do you mean I'm the king of this place no you are begging to God I will bring to God only directly what it through you I will go to God so that is called the failed and that is called love and that is devotion we talk about devotion this is devotion so your sonatine astana na na kriya Sanada shoe in sanskrit is mentioning in every time everywhere when I am sleeping I see you within my heart when I am playing you are it means each and every time and then he is mentioning this devotion is not mere emotional it is based on knowledge of your real self sometimes out of emotion we do and that is the dangerous thing devotion without knowledge is bigotry this very narrow dangerous power not only for him the person also got the society dangerous to acknowledge I mean devotional acknowledge that is the only thing so devotion without knowledge takes us to bondage and suffering for the society devotion to acknowledge that gives us mukthi and he is telling I know Oh God would teach the Bahji know Darcis double mayim chayim he coating from the half of the words when we take even though Chester the food that God has taken that's why even fine particularly Catholics and the Hindus Buddhists also do nowadays so we offer food what is that most of the people they say Prashad known that is the poor girl that we offer win before the God is that food is called puga we are offering that and after how the God is eating Marshall domani Devi say if you are praying sincerely a light comes and it touches the food it becomes holy and if you take that that's called prasada the boga becomes prasada after God is touching it it is true and that prasada this is good for others so sister Majnu does a stubble Miami omae by eating you Prashad we can overcome the Maya which is the cause of the bondage the moment the would double is mentioning the Maya that means in the path of knowledge I knew it then he is telling just remembering your action smaran de courten Tosti pathani guitar nature goody-goody woman's words and this is called in the internal puja external to internal puja in the internal puja you are listening to God all alone sitting and then you are talking to God listening to God and you are listening from others also you go to the places where they talk about the God and you listen that and you become very happy because I love and when somebody is talking about my beloved naturally I gave joy and that is the sign of devotion friends I think we should stop over here and please pray for me that everything goes well because it is a big big venture that turning 50 and very new type of thing so I am going to bring all the different type of religious groups in one place to discuss and inter-religious among the Hindus there are so many sects the if they come and sit among the Christians so many different churches if they come and sit and discuss we love Jesus only I explained that Jesus and his path the God in this way that's all so why we should be so Allah long back when I was young I observed a movie the last Valley if you I think that is still there you can see how well those people bear and the father was a Catholic so he was killing all the participant people in London England and then afterwards his daughter became the Queen and she was killing all the Catholics the last the soldiers are coming to kill the last Valley terrible in the name of God and what the Jesus said whom they were worshipping for whom they were killing that person said that God said love thy neighbor as thyself to the misunderstanding so if we can that is the one thing then cultural mate then not only singing and dancing but at the same time say if the other people they come and cook and the Hindus will cook what are the difference not much always the same ingredients you are using so why do we say oh they're all bears and if you can knead together so these are the things I am going to do then online religious classes if you pay $10 you will be register and then for the 10 months all our material will reach you and then after one
