booyakasha unum padmanabham sir iam vishwanadham Goggin Assad regime mingi Burnham soo hyung Lakshmi contem Kamala jnanam you give he the Anagha Miam Bundy Bishan 'm babu-bhaiya harem cerebral okay II cannot today we will discuss about the confusion of the hood Dava we are now the last part of the bhagavata we are completing the bhagavata and it is known as the last message of Shri Krishna the Krishna and the would double was having the dialogue we find the same type of thing in the bhagavad-gita is the dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna and here's the would Dava and Krishna the Arjuna was also getting confused again and again because Shri Krishna was giving him a very broad prospective of the religion and Arjuna was confused when sometimes the Krishna was telling him about practicing the Karma unselfish work and sometimes he's too urging him to smother yo give of Arjuna therefore you become a yogi and then sometimes he is asking you must know the knowledge what is the truth and again the Krishna was asking him to give up everything and surrendering himself at him as Shri Krishna the God supreme sarva-dharman parityajya Meachem sharanam vraja' and every time or Juna was getting confused that you are asking me to do the work you are now asking me to meditate now you're asking me to discriminate the what shall I do the same thing we find in the root over also when you give a narrow ideology it becomes easy for the people to follow and when it is a really vast all compassing all-embracing ideology philosophy spiritual practice people become confused so because by nature the humans they find that if you say do this and don't do this it as easy for them but that is for the ordinary type of mind for the children we're beginning so you have to give them the direction you should do this and you should not and in the democracy suppose in the democracy also almost the same thing there is no dictation and you have to take your own decision there are so many other things are there you have to choose the development of the human brain human mind the Krishna again and again giving days and that is in general the Hinduism all-embracing ideas and in particular the Ramakrishna ideology Sri Ramakrishna is also telling the same thing you have to embrace each and everything why we will come to that afterwards that is the answer that will be given by Sri Krishna to the wood table friends you must have noticed the emblem of the Ramakrishna mission this emblem was designed by Shami Vivekananda himself and in the emblem you'll find a serpent all around circling the whole picture and in between there is wavy water and a lotus bloomed Lotus and also a Rising Sun and the center of that is a paramahamsa there's a swan what is the idea this what sri krishna is teaching what three Ramakrishna practiced Yoga is the people hotel thing you must have to control your senses so the serpent is the symbol of the yoga you must have noticed in there the Sheba the master of the Yogi's he is having the serpent as his Gerland and the wavy water is the symbol of karma it never stopped it continues and the Lotus is a symbol of devotion and the Rising Sun is the symbol of gianna knowledge all the darkness it dispersed goes away and when the knowledge is dawning ignorance goes away so this is the symbol this is the way one should practice the combination of all the four yugas all the four paths by that way it becomes very easy for one to reach to the goal and by that way one become broad-minded can accept others also here the would trouble the great devotee of bhagavata fame got confused after listening the advices of the Lord Krishna why once the Lord said Mui sarvani karmani need a picture some Archer offer me me the god the result of all your action and perform your duties pure karmayoga this is nothing but Karma Yoga in the bhagavad-gita also he find the Karma Yoga the third chapter of the bhagavad-gita is karma yoga without the Karma without performing the work you cannot purify your mind to purify your mind you must have to work what type of work physical and then intellectual then mental all type of work physical work you're an educated person and obviously they'll be a saints of ego oh I am educated I come from this family I am this I am that and they have asked me to sweep the floor to clean the bathroom and doing cooking so ego will be hard and slowly you are doing it because you like the ideology so in the beginning you are feeling now why should I do but still you are doing by that way your ego is crashed and that is called purity of the mind what is impurity ego when the ego is gone pure this is only simple thing how the ego will go through karma all difficult type of Karma's different type of Karma's different results different reactions through that when you were going and I am doing it for God and God will surely understand me will bless me and I am trying to do it as best as possible and that is called the Karma I liked a lady who came over here and she decorated the whole a Strama with the flowers and she used to being purchased the flowers and to keep over here there as to observe and to and if she could only understand I am doing it for the happiness of God but the blessings of God karmayoga and sometimes some people will come they will come and clean our kitchen this wash our dishes we don't dim never ask them they're doing it out of their own karma yoga mind become purified so that is the glory extreme you should do again he said yah didim Manasa bacha Chuck Shabnam savanna debe heat Nostrum at Mauna Kea Beto Tom atmanam Maya D sherry now what do you see what you hear what you smell what you test everything temporary try to understand this and what is this discrimination and what is the discrimination is the basis of knowledge so those who are trying to practice the path of knowledge trying to follow the path of knowledge what they should do they should also work and at the same time they should discriminate whatever I am doing is nothing but the temporary my goal is completely different I am going to reach somewhere else to buy that way through discrimination his mind is also getting purified but first is the Karma and second you have to practice this discrimination the Karma Yoga then gianna yoga Dhyana yoga that means we draw in the senses in everywhere unless and until you are withdrawing your senses you cannot judge you cannot discriminate that is the reason that that yoga afterwards you will touch it but he's not explaining or Juiz like the Arjuna that would there is also confused now you are telling Oh Lord mam ekam Eber sharanam AoE now forget everything and completely dedicate yourself at my feet you accept me as the whole Summum bonum now I am little confused but if you read the bhagavata the original words who the boy is not mentioning that he is telling I am not yet clear he never said confused he said I am not yet clear about your teaching I'm sorry for that and he's again and again addressing Krishna as a yoga Ashura you're the master you are the Lord you're the God of all these paths paths that is leading for the union with the supreme the jivatma Paramatma this I have understood that I am the individual self my only salvation is to go and march with the supreme self which is you now I am not clear what should I do shall I work shall i meditate shall I discriminate or shall I love these four paths that is the confusion of the rudaba we also get always confused many of the devotees will be asking what shall I do give me a routine and when you say that you do this we do that they're not very satisfied so many things but if you give a narrow path it becomes very easy and they will be immediately falling that's why the the calls the people are so dedicated and one master he will say you must love you must worship me and you must follow me you must listen to me and nobody else no one else and whoever coming near you hate them and people are very happy I don't say happy but at least they follow like that and there'll be a big number but if you say the broad-mindedness except everyone will find very less people that's why the Hinduism which is the basis of all broadness ishavasya madam cerebrum Iaquinta jaga Tom yoga the whole universe is nothing but that God manifestation we will listen to the same thing everywhere in all the scripture where else is a bhagavata our definition whether it is a Tantra or the yoga Sutra everywhere this idea of the pure Hinduism sanatana-dharma by DK Dharma all is broad but among the Hindus there are people who love to be narrow my god is the only God and I am NOT going to accept anything else your God is the only God that is to you good no problem but the second sentence that you say don't do that the others I don't like I don't believe just don't do that if you do that you are hating God why God is everywhere and your scripture I am addressing the Hindus your scripture the Isha Phoenicia say is that almost all the felicia's saying that and hear about the path is not about different religion it is different paths when the Krishna and would the was having the dialogue there was no other religions except sanatana dharma so obviously they were discussing about the path and krishna said whatever that miracle s effect of the holy company we have already discussed that in our previous discourses the miraculous effect if you go to a holy person your mind is lifted and you won't understand that you are already lifted just in the presence of that person normal discussion is going on the fan chatting if you read the gospel of ceramic Krishna not that all the time he is talking about the high philosophy he is also making fun with other devotees but the company of sri ramakrishna the company of a holy man always give that mind of lifted one of the direct disciples of Avanza ramakrishna Shama Torian and the G was the great Vedanta he just wanted to meditate but from me Vivekananda he forced him to come to America a 2d analogy he was not a big the orator but he create spiritual personality what he used to do that's why the Torian and this disciples and the students the neighbor could forget him why before giving there in those days in America people had no idea about India forget about Indian philosophies now this type of people are coming the Indians are coming at tracing them but the Americans have a natural tendency natural curiosity to know about the new things to understand the new things then if they like the accepting as because they love freedom so the family pressure won't be there the social pressure won't be there in our country we cannot do that in whole of Europe majority we cannot do that even in this modern time if a son is trying to accept the Hinduism whole family will go against and will pressurize him no you cannot do that and the whole society will come on him but in America tis not like that so that's why they were very free open-minded and they invited these pedantic teachers and when two realities to speak before that used to Artur oom-oom-oom three with again and again and naturally the students they stood why he's so many times spirit their church chanting the Omkara because to make their mind up lifted so that when he will speak about the Vedanta the highest form of the philosophy a very subtle understanding these people will be able to grab that think of the spiritual power one person he is uplifting the mind of so many at a time so that is the power of the Vedanta and what is that Vedanta God is in everything except that consciousness that manifestation that Supreme Being there is nothing and that is the basis of Hinduism also and the Lord Krishna now he is telling that see the holy company about the holy company he told him about unquestionable love of the gopis of brindaban why he is changing the topic he mentioned the holy company effect of the holy company and as an example he mentioned about the gopis of the brindaban we have not touched those pages now we are coming to he say that even the demons when they came in contact with the divine personalities they were changed even the animals their behavior changed and also the very ordinary the group they were the cowboys and girls they were they is to only arm at their livelihood by selling the milk the very ordinary people villagers but the as Krishna grew up into that village all of them they were elevated to a very high level of spirituality and that is called prema we will come to that the prema now only love for Lord Krishna took them to the highest position of divine love only love for Lord Krishna why the loved Lord Krishna because he was God himself not that they wanted to love they were forced to love compel to love and you cannot deny the God in the form of the human being and whatever form the God will take the mean and understanding will be attraction to that particular person or thing that is called the manifestation of the divinity sometimes if you go to India you will go to some shrine and they will show you one stone I will say this is jyothirlinga this is the Linga means the the manifestation a Chinna as a symbol of Shiva and no one placed it it is there from the beginning itself so called Jyoti the God manifested as that knowledge over there the great Kashi if you go that is the jyothirlinga if you go and see nothing but a stone and they're worshiping that stone as the Shiva but if you understand that if you have the devotion then the knowledge will dawn and the personality like Shankar Acharya came to Kashi and he was mesmerised at the manifestation of the Supreme God as Shiva so this is the way we can understand and we have the proofs to accept this the Shankara wind the person like Shankara when he is accepting there is no chance of doubting we should not waste our time doubting so this is called the faith the belief the understanding through love also it is possible Krishna here's the God himself he was born and in other other another city the Brindavan then mathura he was born in mathura is there adjacent cities and mathura his parents were in prison he was born over there and you all know the story of Lord Krishna he was transported to the next city to save his life because the DDM King Kamsa wanted to kill the the children of the day Bakke Krishna grew up in that humble place the humble village and chilled all people who are attracted men and women men because of their physical strength they developed a short of a ego and they always thing I don't need to do all this that is you will find even today it is always in the mind of the mill that they don't like to follow the path of devotion but by Nature the women they are having the motherly heart the softness the kindness and they'd love the God and they do it as a in the form of in the emotion of mother it becomes very easy for them there is no question the small child I have to love the child otherwise we will help so that way the gopis the women of the Brindavan they became much much benefited in the company of Shri Krishna than the male folks so gopis said go per Gopi Gopi means the women them form of the the cowherd people this group is they reach to that highest position pure attraction purple van Sri Krishna is not power is not the beauty not for the wealth or the physical comfort they took the pure minds of the gopis to the seven stage of the prema sadhana are the divine law practices now friends we are maybe many of you know but those who don't know it is very interesting to know that we all know almost the yoga is having seven stages and some of us we know those who are studying and following the path of knowledge even the knowledge is also having seven stages but the prima shardana the practice through devotion is also seven stages we will study this if you like you can note it this is very interesting yoga sadhana has seven stages what is that mooladhara shrewdest on money pura Anahata Bishu da auga and shower ARA almost all you know and this meditation the yoga and the physical practice of yoga that is now all over the world is so popular and almost all of them they know if they don't understand but even they know the names of these plexus and what is that the first bottom that is called the mooladhara mooladhara iturra means the container mula means the main the main container because the energy the supreme energy is coiled up over there the Yogi's they discovered it and then from there a little app is called swadishtana then come third money pool the fourth is very important on altar and this Anahata where but once the ramakrishna and all the spiritual teachers they are teaching to meditate if you want to meditate concentrate on the anata which is in the heart then above is a be shoot then father goes agra and finally on the crown of the head at the center of the head skull sahasrara so these are the seven stages the Yogi's they pull back the mind from the objects and concentrate and when they are taking the long deep breathing Saint that to the ultimate and we can save physical level we can say at the end of our spinal cord at the end of the final chord and from there it goes up above and up to the cup of the eight is called sahasrara this is very famous seven stages of the yoga guiana sadhana gana means the knowledge the to have the seven stages what is that first is Chevette cha in my peace glasses I have discussed about it this shoe betcha and then Beach R&R Don o manasa set uppity Assam are Shakti padartha Havana and - yoga all Sanskrit words shoe getcha is good desire in the beginning at the very first age is my decision I am going to be good that is my decision nobody can ask me to do that I am going to be good I am going to know my real self that is called the fast Shuba was pure holy it cha so when you club together Chevette cha shubo yah Shuba is pure holy each desire the shoe getcha a holy desire you notice that all it is there I like to become my own master I like to know my real self I like to realize God this is the shoe Bo each a fast immediately comes Beach arena incredi and naturally you have to inquire who am I am i dis body mind or there is something beyond and that way slowly slowly what is mine what is this body composed of where from the body and mind the both are inert juror then from the where from the consciousness came and how the consciousness is activated through this juror through this inner thing so that is called Beach arena that is called the discrimination then come to new Menasha this very wonderful name they are given tony minutiae the mind become theme when you are not eating your body become thin similarly when you are not eating from for your mind your mind become thin what is the food of the mind Chuck shook our Nanashi Kajiwara and tuck this I dis tan and all the five organs five senses they are going out and collecting food for the mind yep sound smell touch taste a sight everything that is the food of the mind and it goes to the mind and mind is becoming a B and a B because it is thinking so many things but those who are going towards God they should not try to do that they should avoid all other company all of the discussion except the discussion about God so what becomes and them in the mind food only one food that is the thought of God and nothing else the songs about God and the places of God all the pilgrimage and the Virgin's the songs divine devotional songs all these all one only so turn home - ah the mind manasa mind the new it become subtle and team septa / team when we withdraw all our mind and our other sense organs from all sense objects and concentrate only one thing that is God naturally you realize God you know about God that is called self-realization those who are following the pancham of a the classes you must be knowing that we have already discussed the three questions of the master larger and the ceramic isne replied asure dharshan he shall love how it is possible so we have discussed that the septa beauty self-realization then come asana shakti non-attachment when we realize god when he realized the self when we are conformed that there is something beyond all this manifestation then what happens we become completely detached to all this when you come to know that I had to leave this country then what you do you give up all your properties to your friends I don't need this I purchased this bade it was a really by good choice but now since I have to leave I give it to somebody and all these sofas chairs table and TV all I want to disperse how it is possible because you know that you are not going to be here the same way if you know that you are not going to be this into this world it is completely temporary and nothing is going to go with you what will happen a Agha you will all give up give up give up and when you give it up that is called Hamas Shakti the non attachment is a beautiful way it explained then afterwards say padartha Bona non perceptions of all of chips you don't see any other things except God in a life of Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna he could not see anything else but God in everything even the temple it was nothing but that consciousness of God the image inside the temple the holy of earliest of the holy there is also manifestation of God and at the same time it that is also the manifestation the utensils that are used for the puja is also manifestation of the same God so that we padartha Bhavana non perception of the object why there is no other object accepted consciousness of the God and that way well that is called transcendent condition to yoga that is the ultimate the seventh stage the to yoga the seventh stage of the yoga and seventh stage of the Gianna now is the seventh stage of the Prima sadhana what is that prema sadhana yoga sadhana Gianna sadhana and prema sadhana sadhana means austerity circular means practice spiritual practice yoga means we during the mind from the object Yoga sadhana guiana sadhana understanding the true form or the true nature of the object jana sadhana and what is prema sadhana these is very interesting and it begins with the strata said the means complete devotion devotion in the words of the guru fiscal complete devotion unless and until you have the complete devotion in the words of the guru you will never be able to proceed first Estrada and guru bhakti Shastra Bach a show Shankar Acharya says the teachings of the scripture and also the teaching of the guru you must accept it 100% no doubt Shammi Vivekananda he told to some some young boys came to meet him and he told you like to take me accept me as your guru the yes sir Vivekananda was very famous so naturally all over the Vivekananda was known that these people came and SRAM eg testing them you know if as a guru I think that jumping from the top of the tree will make you good and you will get the liberation and I ask you go flying on the top of the tree and jump from there you will get liberation will you do that so we can understand many of them they are scratching their head if you could say yes but that was not 100 percent from their mind very very difficult so accepting the guru in that sense but guru should be also the right person but anyway Suda that is their faith in the words of the guru is called citta and that guru is asking go and have the shadow Sangha let us take the words of Raghavan Sri Ramakrishna when it was asked to him how to realize God the what he said the first four steps and very almost known to all of the Ramakrishna and the followers the frost is sadhu sanga satsangha the second newgen Bosh the third discrimination Nietzschean Bosh living in the isolation all alone and constantly judging your thought on thought then discrimination then partner these are the four steps now guru is ceramic isne what he asked sadhu sanga what is the sadhu sanga those thoughts that makes the mind uplifted and detached from all that is all around that is called sadhu sanga then compassion Virgin means is not only the songs but a prayer coming out in the musical form as we in in India we are at we know all those media virgin Ramprasad virgin so they are singing but not to please the listeners others but it is a communication through music to God so everything towards God the police come and give me your the divine darshan that is the song and they'll be singing and when they are singing they're crying they're wailing the praying that is called virgin so that budget makes one enlightened this is the darkest nobility the first is Radha then sadhu sanga and after the sadhu sanga the faith comes in the existence of God and from the sadhu sanga we know that we can communicate with God through silent prayer through words or through songs so dad budgin and finally comes nobility nobility means we drawing the census from the Saints objects see the fast yoga then guiana and bhakti all us teaching us you have to be draw your senses from the Saints objects what are the same subjects this world manifested world and if our mind goes to that so obviously it cannot be concentrated and that's why purification of the mind means we drawing the mind from the Saints objects nobility and when you we draw the mind where you will keep the mind you have to get much mind is just like a child very naughty you have to give him some occupation otherwise it will go on running here there so you you are withdrawing the mind from the same subjects where he will keep it how to engage the mind Bhagwan our sakti asset the Isetta means complete attachment Isetta means complete dedication how Talabani that means that did complete dedication attachment to God so I like to read about God I like to listen about God I like to meditate about God I like to sing songs in praise of God all these things call our Shakti I cannot speak anything else but God I don't like anything but God that is called our Shakti this our shop tea just remembers attachment usually used for the attachment of the worldly things but the singing attachment the strong attachment to God will give you liberation after that ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba Ibiza what is that bah bah bah bah my beloved God and you are becoming completely merged into that when the they are they worship usually they always say and in in the books also you find that they bond Putra the Bemidji Ajit you are worshiping the God after transforming yourself as God this call our beitia RV she means you were completely transformed into that you forget it all surrounding you forget where you are there your whole mind is thinking only about God that is called our beitia so ordinarily sometimes people will say in the villages particularly I don't know the true or not sometimes you'll find an ordinary lady she is crying and then the ruling on the floor and people will say ah bah she is now possessed the possessed by demigod or the ghost the spirit a heart the pure God so that is the question but anyway as an example of Abby she means she forgets all around people so many people are there watching but usually very blushful lady but she is now behaving completely different way that's called Ibiza and from the of Asia comes the prema prema means love ultimately this prema shop that this word that we use is the very very pure and why the prema it cannot think anything else but God anything else that's called prema the rather developed prema there's a another character those who know about Vaishnavism you know about the radha and particularly this gaudiya vaishnava sampradaya they highlighted this particular aspect of the devotion the Radha Radha she was married to another person but seems to run to Krishna whenever she will hear the flute to the sound of the flute and she will forget what what she is doing people will criticize and in that society it was really one could not think about but other did because of the attraction for the God and that is not for the physical or for the beauty or for the world nothing like that only the pure devotion that is called prema Raghavan see Rama Krishna again and again mentioned about this prema from the prima comes on araga and after the nura vocal mahabhava that is the ultimate but the seven stage stop in prima and from the prima then another two mahabhava that is not possible for the ordinary people he is only for the avocadoes the God Himself can reach up to that the Pavan see ramakrishna had that mahabhava the people who used to see and this to wonder what is it how it is possible because it is it is usually people aren't able to see the manifestation of the divine love in one person so here friends we find Sirte sadhu sanga company of the holy Sirte means the respect and complete devotion to the teaching of the scripture and the guru then the holy company then expression of joy of that holy company through music the Virgin nobility the withdrawing the senses from the sense objects are sucked II then giving the whole in body and mind into that the god then baba Vasia transformation of the god godliness and prema the complete love it is said the practices are different but the goal is the same those who practice yoga contemplation when reached their goal the supreme self Paramatma Phil great bliss while merging with it those who practice gana discrimination when reach their goal Brahman the consciousness also feel bleah while realizing it because it is the joy Ananda but don't you practice bhakti the devotion when reached their goal the Lord God they don't Marge but remain separate in his company and supremely enjoy his divine play this is the ultimate difference Yoga gianna bhakti practices are almost the same between the rich to the goal of course in devotion some can merge with God but majority of the devotee want to be separate from God and like to enjoy his company and his divine play so this is the little different now how it will be suppose the golfer the famous golfer in America the Tiger rude right the Tiger rude supposing you were also a golfer so you want to get the company of the tiger root and in one meeting suddenly you saw him sitting very close to you maybe two three years away you can see him you can hear him feel the joy the you love Tiger root and he is your ideal as a golfer and then you are in so close company of the tiger rule and you are feeling the joy you're going on taking the photo maybe thinking to take a selfie all this going on now suddenly if the tiger would ask you to play with him what will be the intensity of your joy similarly if we go to the God we can see God we can hear him the great joy but when the God come I ask you to be the part of his divine play think the great joy you will find so there is a big one of our Swan he wrote a song in Bengali amar you now to mark a lie the he's praying to the gods Ramakrishna oh Lord I don't want mukthi I don't want liberation I want to be all the time in your holy company and to enjoy and take part you divine play so that is always it says the practitioners of the part of devotion boastfully says if you compare joy of the mahabhava with other coveted practices it will be like comprising motion with a drop of water that they say it will be joy of ocean Joey like the and then and your path Gianna are the the yoga it will be a drop of water like that comparing at the ocean bhakti Sudama Bodhi para maana to Lama P mother once Rakesh na wanted his friend whatever to enjoy the Bliss then he said I and his universe are not separate now here it will go the answer of the Lord we may continue this in our next class the answer the doubt that was completely the dispersed from the mind of the would double the adult was removed by the Lord how he did that in bed anta as a definition of the brahman it has been said own ET brahma now the Lord is telling you see me as Krishna and you want that I should the Krishna should be realized as Brahman nothing wrong in it then he is disclosing do you know everything that you see in this world and nothing but me we will how the God manifested how did God which is nothing but the consciousness manifested through the inner things which are not conscious how the inner things came how the consciousness came into it how this prop injure how this manifestation manifestation came we will come to know in the next class but let me conclude with this the skull shop the Brahma shabda means sound Brahma that consciousness do you go very close to that consciousness the supreme consciousness is very difficult to understand why there is no comparison we understand thing with a comparison and when there is no comparison how you can so the person who dropped the atom from the first atom bomb and the Hiroshima and Nagasaki there in Japan in the second world war he quoted from the bhagavad-gita 11th chapter to give the come to compare the effect of the atom bomb that was the first attempt so God forbid we don't want to see the second atom bomb that is self sufficient this atom bomb when it he threw he dropped and the effect of the atom bomb the fire and the sound and the other effect that was comparing quoting from the bhagavad-gita now he was having the quotations of the bhagavad-gita to compare that's it that is my idea I like to say these do you have something to compare then you can express if you have some idea about something then also you can say like this how is the milk you say white then liquid little sticky and sometimes it is very thin or sometimes it is maybe a little different so you are going on giving the description of the milk because you are having some idea about that what about Brahman we don't have any idea so naturally but it is there so it says as Brahman the pure consciousness is the basis of everything similarly ohm is the basis of all sounds ohm ET Brahma is that Oh miss brandman no the moment you say that Oh miss Brahman it says o mighty Brahma but at the same time you have to understand we cannot conclude in that as the brahman is nothing but the Omkara the moment you conclude in that fashion it becomes limited we cannot he is giving an example why the Ankara is the basis of all sounds similarly the Artman the Paramatma the Brahman is the basis of all creation so this is they're trying to give this so that we can understand for that only any sound is created when two things are objects are colliding the sound comes from the collision of the two things but the Ankara is anartha this own color we doubt the collision with anything it is created that is called ankara self-made sound and it's called Anuradha and the Brahman has no creator that may be reason ohm is considered as Brahman ohm has no creator the Brahman has no creator ohm is self-made Brahman is self-made so that is the reason they are given own ET Brahma does it mean omen Brahmin are separate no Brahmin and own at the same why because one is also created out of that consciousness which is Grumman and again is the own color is Brahman know why because not the Brahman is 1 and the absolute we again and again we say like that and in Benanti student and they all know and the example they always give in Vedanta the waves are ocean but you cannot say waves are ocean which belong to ocean ocean doesn't complete in waves same way waves that is there on the ocean and it is a part of the ocean but it is not complete ocean similarly in bhagavata we find the Supreme God explaining the creation and disclosing the secret of his creation the supreme being the Paramatma manifest itself in the center of the spinal column we will go to that part the answer of the God to dispel the doubt of the hood dava in our next discourse so what was the doubt of the whatever that is the conclusion the he was doubting he was not doubting you as confusing what we can say when the Lord was telling you must become a yogi then the Lord was telling you must become a gyani now the Lord is telling forget about everything and dedicate yourself to me the Supreme Lord so naturally what the was it what should I do and then the Lord is telling that see all the three paths are living to the same goal you may follow all the three or you may choose any one of it but know that all paths are leading to the same goal then ultimately he is going to tell I am again and again asking you to withdraw from the SIS have we draw the census from the Saints objects but you know what all that you see this prop ensure he is also my manifestation who will come to that in our next discuss thank you let us chant this
