[Bhagavatam 014 - A Guide to Liberation: How to face Death?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WACGvAU1NSg)

good morning today we are going to discuss out a very very interesting subject that only one thing every human being is afraid of every being afraid of is dead and only thing which is inevitable that will come in the life of the being is dead now how to handle this situation so how to face the depth that means studying here a great sage sukadeva he'll be giving the answer to a great king was also fearless the Seiken of the pandavas King and pardon a second of the Barnabas he is going to ask this test but before that as usual let us offer our respect to the Supreme Lord Shankara would you go shallow but the moon album [Music] traditions rishaad autumn governess attrition me about now [Music] shabanam loves me condom comma denial of you give me the honor commune Monday mission [Music] servile ho Krieger this question was asked by king pariksit why because he was cursed by a brahmana that he will die on the seventh day of the curse and another the brahmana came and announced that to him King we have already hard we already read that particular portion that he did a mistake and when he came back he was going on repenting why have I done that you know that is the work of the Maya deluding sometimes create people also make mistakes and after that when you are repenting that won't do that won't help because each and every action will have the opposite reaction whatever you have done the result will come back now for exchange he was thinking I have done a mistake shall I go and big pardon what to do and how to go go and request him not to be angry with me but in the meantime one person came and he told the very shape he had been cursed by his son a very powerful Brahmin and you will die from today on the seventh day and there is no fail nobody can save you and how you will die tuck sugar the most venomous snake will and biting and what the king did he could take the now make a room in such a way that they it cannot comment and you using all the girls all over it until death that is the speciality of this King because of his family lineage he knew now I have done a mistake and I am going to suffer for this let me visit when he decided that he will give up all his things and he gave the kingdom to his son John Major and decided to go on the bank of the river sitting over there waiting for the death he never tried to hide or save himself this is the excellent characteristics of the king if we had that if the rich people were having a plane and 24 hours they would be going over there because I have so much of money I can that was seven different processes they may think of to save themselves but here the King said no that is called Purusha I have done the mistake I am going to face it I'm not going to blame anyone and no argument why that man was sitting closing his eyes I was so thirsty he could give me a glass of water he didn't gave so haughty or send his soldiers to kill that brahmana he could do that he didn't do that anything rather he prepared himself and wing it was all these people all the great sages they all came I give you the list of names and they all came and they were sitting near the king why because they appreciated the way the King accepted the curse of death didn't go to that the brahmana why your son has done this take it back River the rather came as we were sitting for the earth that teeth became as if a sacrifice so all this great sages scheme and all said and not only they alone all their followers their disciples they also came a huge number of people so naturally T was the responsibility of the King to look after them will read them so the king's son John Major was taking care the king himself the pollak she to care there all people there attend keeping well food and all other things are provided or not so when we think of all of these look the courage he is facing the depth but when all those people decide suddenly saw a young monk is coming he is sukadeva we have already discussed that when the sugar they were king who is very humble and very young hardly sixteen or seventeen years old and when he came the great sages stood up and gave all respect to him and King also wind and saw that he is sitting in a comfortable way when the sugar they were certain then he asked how to face the death can you please tell me everybody knew that he is going to rest having the death after seven days can you see if we sell he never did that he never asked that question that how to face the depth so that was the question so before addressing answering that particular question we'll find the great sage he's told him what happened in between Brahma and the Vishnu Vishnu the Great Lord he created Brahma the first God and asked him to start the creation and the Brahma he went again to the Mishnah mentor Lord please reveal thyself to me so that I can concentrate my mind on that and when I am greeting so many different things I will do the ego should not fit into my mind but as you will who is doing because of you on your power the term did I should not forget that I should not forget that because of you you have given me the power this knowledge you have created me and I am doing with your power so no ego should come into me that blessings you have to give them near start the world frames devotees these are the things we should learn so we go to the God and pray I have got a job my master I got a job and this is a very wonderful thing that I am going to achieve in my diet but it is because of you so please save me so that I should not go away from you do we pray like this we don't remember I have done I have studied I have got the good result so I am getting the job I am earning and I should enjoy we decide we never cared to know about it not a Brahma he went and told sir please tell me reveal thyself unto me so that I can concentrate my mind all the time on you and no ego should come why this ego in the Christian conception that day very and Hindu conception Maya the Maya is separating us the God and the demon thing what is this Maya ego and what is this ego no one can explain but we're all having that each and every one all are having that ego but where from it came we don't know why it is here we don't know so Brahma wait and ask them in reply the lord vishnu told him enforce lockers who is he why the Great Sage instead of answering how to face the dead why he is melting this portion we understand why he did like that and it is called chatter slow key shuttle means the four slow key is a sloka chatter slow key in four verses only four verses the whole bhagavata was told we mentioned that last time this chat was lowkey bhagavata and in the first it is in the second window second book nine chapter 32 verse 32 33 34 35 in these four verses lord vishnu he is giving the whole idea of the creation and who is he and he said before creation are alone words we have to destroy someone is going to die and he is eager to know how to fester now who is Lord Vishnu and the sannyasin instead of giving the reply directly he is telling that old world is nothing but of Vishnu before creation I alone was the wish to history to the Brahma who is going to create just before the creation he is telling cause and effect are not different from me cause and effect what is the cause that mean and what is the effect this universe are not different and that is why Shami becomes say each soul is potentially divine it's not just making a wonderful sentence and people are thinking oh we are also not like that this is the truth and this truth is not in the padishah not in the Veda in bhagavata the book of devotion in the Bhagavata the central God is the Vishnu and that Vishnu is telling I alone was before creation now sometimes and we always love to make it that because I love Vishnu or I'm a follower of Vishnu I have to say see the only God was there nothing was there so Bishnu is the only God it's not like that is all-pervading when there was nothing how the conception of Vishnu will also come it is not so only that consciousness all-pervading everywhere cause an effect of not different from me after dissolution I known exist so the creation it is coming again disillusion is going back and in the dissolution it is also inevitable it is individual life it is depth and for the whole University's dissolution same thing and in the death very go we go back to our source and in the dissolution what happens all those things go back to the source but in between because of our desire the karmic Allah the individual self instead of going to the source they go on traveling here they're in different deserts and that's why so many varieties of things are happening in our life so before the creation I alone was the cause and the effect it was not different and after dissolution I alone exist this universe is also myself now the answer has been given already the what is that you were talking about what is this question you were thinking you had the singing supreme Vishnu and that Brahmin boy who costume also the same and the snake who is coming to bind you also the same modern re to hunama shaman shaman in the ravine Donati say you are just like my god Shama because the love is loving embracing the dead and that is the courage and not that I have to go and commit suicide but when that comes when the problem comes with great calm composed mind we are accepting and that is the first sloka of the - slow key and it says the universe is also myself everything that you see is nothing but the manifestation of the Vishnu this is the real point after if we say dwellest but are tweeting the same a shower wash a medium Selvam in the fast of arts of the issue Benicia this whole universe that you see is nothing but the God and what is that God the consciousness in the second look it says what is presented on the Hartmann know that appears due to mind divine power Maya Hartmann means the individual itself and on the individual self what is presented reflecting what I am a man that is a woman I am reached that is a war I am educated and that is illiterate and so so so many things and that we go on telling the skull epithets we're going to going on adding adding adding adding and what is that Maya waha nothing is there and we I am so proud I don't like to meet the people and these that suppose there is no people what you will do suppose you are marooned in an island and there is not a single soul at all what will happen to you then so that we don't understand that we don't think so this is the way the Lord he is telling this is the truth all that is happening within your mind I am going to die can you please tell me to raise the dead the king is asking and he saved all the changes that is happening on your mind is a reflection of the Maya in a third verse he said the great basic elements the pancha maharaja a shitty uppity is meruit and bowman of the nature it combined and constitute all objects but after creating that it remains outside and not that in it grows well in a certain form it remains outside similarly I also after creation I entered into it but still I remain outside this is a very important that you have to understand even after the creation of the two different type of things one is consciousness the life and other is the inner thing gerrae and cheetah uses it as a juror this inner chiton the consciousness and the juror this body is Jared annulment but within the body that is something consciousness is there the scientist they are trying to have the idea about it the neurologist they are trying to get an answer about it what is this the mixture of these and reflection of these and all different type of answers are coming but actually no one knows what these consciousness ease without the consciousness all these things is of no use so that God say I the consciousness entered into that inner thing but still don't think I am exhausted I am outside and in the last the four - VAR CC is seeker after the truth should try to understand these the Supreme Spirit is that ultimate substance these are called the four verses of bhagavata - to slow keep our word but that's all and when they say to slow keep our over time there will be piranha there will be Putin Akuma's Lana come and donate $1,000 all people are going to say what is this lucky God is only there and nothing else the lasts look it says you should try to understand these otherwise you are going to go back to the circle of birth and death again and again sometimes some birds are very happy so you are very happy but not that all the time will be like this proceed he was born and devote the Pearl even the Lord Krishna the incarnation of the Vishnu protected him even in his mother's womb that was the great thing that happened we studied the story and in the Mahabharata and then afterwards dad Greaves soul the psyche on of the great Pandavas he made a mistake just because he was very thirsty he could not control his anger and because of that now he's going to face the death and then he is asking atop which army see some system yogi nom para mom guru puja see her yet karyam real Manassas Alberta in the in the first 19 verse is asking this the great sage sugar and king pariksit so they're facing each other and he's asking o teacher I'd like to ask you a question what a prick charming rich and means been asking please advise me what if person should do when waiting for death you are the yogi number among guru you are the great master even of the Yogi's so you are the best person to answer me please tell me what a person should do Purusha say in her yet Guardian Briana's avatar when I am going to die that time what I should do then what happened this sage he was so happy hearing this question said what is there this Christian the great sages is happy and he's oh you have done a wonderful question you have asking go great one and the next he is asking the let me add this question together yet so Topton a toga iam yet Caribbean Ruby Bravo smart opium progeny embark brew he yet Bobby Bonilla in 1 1938 per cc oh great one two questions and a one question two-part instruct me what a person waiting for death should hear about repeat do remember and worship so also please tell me what he should not do now when we become elderly that's pavan's rama business daily instead of going to any place or trying to practice the holy thing they will simply play the card and spend that time when you are asking what you were doing now I cannot sit idle so playing the curves so that is called some sorry why some study because even a little light as not coming to his mind is altered the whole his constant grandchild so grandchild she will grow her and she will marry then and I had to come as hard son think of it the desire never think why should I have to come can't I be free from this body and mind it table comes into the mind that is the real so the he is asking but this man is asking the to question first can you tell me that were ask me what a man waiting for the to attain elaborating the what type of thing I should here I should see I should discuss and repeat again and again and also what I should not do he's directly I he's telling those who are facing the depth and this important that one recently one of our nuns she passed away and before that when she was in that condition the doctors told the now there is nothing she's going to within one or two hours she's going to give a birth life the other nuns went over there and if one tried to talk to her you remember that what we did and all that time even in that condition she showed her hand don't talk about that forget about all those things alertness was there then another non started chanting the name of God and singing and her face lighted up she was accepting those she was happy and she was listening to those holy names they're continuously going on I have seen one of our Swami the great Swami he was put on under he told how to control the mind how to meditate acceptor I translated that book from English to Bengali so that Bhutan and the G suddenly went into coma and there was no sense but anyone coming and whispering Shivaji I have brought Sharon augment the holy water from balloon wand immediately will open up my heart to receive that when the doctors are trying to feed him you won't take but when the Chariton breath immediately and we notice to it there is no other function but your his hand was going on counting counting that means Jafar was going on inside another soul many of you must be knowing he clearly after hundred three hundred five years he told now it is enough I'm going to die on souls chance escaped all people started meeting and all that he said okay nor have my life I I have no other desire complete and that particular dyrdek specific time he passed me and here in Hollywood the foundry can say Shammi proven on the G when he declared the fourth of July I'm going to die Paris is the fourth of July is a great day for the Americans and he came to America I see now from this moment I am a miracle no connection with India and all the young Swami's who came used to say forget India become Americans love Americans love everything the disability and before death he said I am going to die on 4th of July and before death suddenly he was you know an unconscious type say certainly after his assistant tell me when it is fourth of July and when that was announced to him sharmaji today's 4th of July oh okay charity after Gemma the bastard so how to explain all these things no fear at all so that is the practice we are going to listen from here the after listening that sir can you please tell me what a man should after hearing that question the great sugar see Brianna shotty Prasanna tweto loka-hitam Rico or Nicole King your question is really excellent why the answer to this question will give lot of benefit to this world no Cory Tom the for the benefit of the other people here watch this question he knew the great person so he's not asking for himself in asking for everyone he was not at all afraid and that is the reason he left everything and he came on the bank of the river waiting for the tape completely free of any fear even then when he acts there he understood the Shakur the sage understood and appreciated perry on YCJA t Berean is the highest in the supreme so Briana Briana Shetty Presnell your question is supreme the great excellent question then the sugar after appreciating the question is going on telling what one should do majority of the people are tilted by the mile now if they hear this if they listen to digital realities if the remembered is that will help them so this a pretty lucrative new common scheme Oh King you have done loka-hitam and after describing the futility of the worldly life and not quoting those parts then in two three versus the sugar they were safe see how people are spending their time and if you read the gospel of ceramic is not the same way cinema pitch night also describing when I was traveling in Calcutta he is telling to someone Salameh vishna I saw everybody's concentration is on the Bailey all the time thinking about food how to earn and all that no one is thinking anything higher so Salaam o Krishna in a rustic way in from the village px play expressed that so sometimes some people they say oh my God why is tilling like that he was not broadening about whether you like it or not and he was from the village in that village fashion he saved and very straight when he said all of you are surviving why the baby he said because most of us we deal only for food and comfort which is actually characteristics of the animals the animals only two things they though they need the food and they are afraid of death fear so they will eat a little and then immediately they will observe if anyone is coming to attack they were not that - and no other instinct - that's why and now he is telling this is the second control and first chapter 50 verse the small arc sarvatma bhagavan is Shirou rhee-soo tapia guilty top bestial smart appear each other opium eat cheetah orion he never seen their Amrit he said if you want to be fearless each other if you want a fiim in what you should do Oh harder the Seiken of the rod of the slime why is it Bharata that you know that the great king bharata say from whom the name Marek became Shakuntala and so death pardon so that is the lenient so he's telling the old character this man Barada all-pervading spirit serve God mom Atma is the spirit the soul Salva all pervading spirit and the only put in Lord of all and also Pavan ishaara very the two things he stood one he is all-pervading how as a spirit as a soul as the consciousness the people who are following the path of knowledge Jana Marga they concerned in on that and at the same time same person same spirit of bourbon in spirit the Brahmin he is also taking them warm and he is really and this hurry who is that Raghavan issue so utilize these two words omnipotent Lord all-powerful Lord he study about him through the pure you must hear about him listen about him then lift it up pure you must praise he must appreciate those things and also smart appeal remember always japa you must go taking the name of that Lord if you want of a young if you want fearlessness why did he use the word fearless avoidance of a booty issue accepted they say these are where means I am giving the assurance that from me nothing wrong is going to happen and here this Ohio means I'm not afraid at all why because I know I'm not going to die I am as it is as it DS so this form will change but I will be as it is so that's why over here what is the great fear depth and when that fear is gone what remains Ohio so no problem for him Bobby beaten the came to a medical and humane he was traveling someplace in Texas he was delivering a table and some of the Cowboys came and they told I did not fear of death he said no I am immortal let us try immediately without giving any caution they started shooting of course they knew how to do and the bullets were passing through and there on his head on the top of his head and the side they didn't see they didn't notice the Swami be weakened the blinking are short evening the expression of fear nothing was there to that fearlessness that is can be daunting here he's stealing the if you like to be fearless and there is no other way but only this tree what sort of girl and when you go to the the teacher of the knowledge through the bill and they say only three things are there - here you two go on wandering and your diminutive needed the asset appear meditate so these are the three steps three ways but the fat of knowledge they'll always practice throat appear multiple needed the asset appear there is the path of knowledge but the devotion now for the devotion is you hear about God and then you must sing the glory of once Adama business daily today I will go to the big audience a solution to speak on that particular topic advice to the householders sluggishness advice to the householders and this is very simple way is telling you must hear the name of God first about him and then you should go on remember whether what he said is correct or not in afterwards you must have preciate those days correct it can be because you do then only you can and finally comes receives here that the sugar Sotomayor tilt it up best you that you must go on thinking about the glory of the God smart the beer and also you must go on repeating repeating and repeating but both are the ways the these three steals the Gianni's and the Baptists are utilizing is the beauty of the world order the some people they only tell the bhagavata means devotion and here the Supreme God is the Vishnu and okay for them but in reality those who are following the path of knowledge they can also follow so that is the advice and the beauty is we you you know that God is all pervading but at the same time you have some conception of God it helps you to concentrate that is the reason Fabiana anouk important brahmana rupa kalpana kalpana means imagination Luca means the form whose Rupa the Brahma who is the Brahma all-pervading consciousness why he's taking the form only to help the devotees who won't be able to understand that all-pervading consciousness that concept don't come but when you say that this is the Lord Vishnu Shankar Dada Dada Dada each this symbol is having some meaning he is creating his serving he is destroying we can imagine it and that we is telling and in the next for all spiritual aspirants whether they follow the method of intellectual self analysis does the iana Marga and he mentioned I am NOT putting that particular verse some key some key means that those who are all in the path of knowledge but some it is a separate philosophy is there some dear but this son can means the part of knowledge and then it said all the path of action Yoga consisting in the discharge of duties without attachment so after la parada styie the goal of human life that which is the courrier ization of the god pavan's Ramakrishnan is first advice he said it shall la mancha given a Leticia the goal of human life is to realize God why that is the question that one should ask to oneself do I really need God and if I needed for God to protect me from all the time different things and so that I can be successful everywhere that is a different thing and you need a personal gardener okay the God can be your personal bodyguard and some people delete the time being now this moment I'm in difficulty please come and help and if you help me okay I can also give you something like some corn or some fruits many people did you like that when my prayer has been answered if it is not then I am NOT going to visit your temple and if somebody says do not this temple another temple the God is very powerful just go and pray and then all people doing runned over there if you only go in in a nowadays it is so easy but if we just send out that I weigh in to the Vedanta society and all my prayer has been answered then we have to increase the chairs our people will come but after one month when the answer did not there then say what if this begin another message will go don't go over there no prayers get answered so rang the king so he go on giving the ranking so 1 star 2 star 3 stars or visit do you think the God may give the services like that no it is not but God will give you your own idea who are you that idea what will happen oh that joy but once donkey she is telling I wish I could express the joy you know the aim bring from the every point of our from the body as if the blood with will come out so much of joy inside unexplicable and how wanted to know how to love ourselves so here he is telling how it is possible those who are following the path of knowledge those who are following the path of action and of course those who according the part of devotion all can follow these three things here then on deliver that and then meditate on that distri and afterwards history swadharma but in Israel in the bhagavad-gita also we find subtle meaning the noms de parar la guayaba one should not take up the others religion sometimes some people say once you have become a sannyasi the ideology that you have accepted to love each and every one without any discrimination there another day that one family came the gentleman is good whole family was also they were feeling little shy he was only he was telling I cannot agree with you show me all should join the politics and all and particularly your individual five join the camp of the Hindus Exeter Exeter Atlanta thank you but the problem is now there's no time left for me to go do all these things the only thing that I have taken up that definition so this way we are at I'm thinking the swadharma what is the saga if we practice the swadharma in why she has a swagger a husband as his father father mother children teacher and each and every blesses Rachel they call it walks of life each and every one is having a struggle mother only perform that even see the life is so wonderful and what will happen if you practice that your mind will become tranquil the calm and now I have done my job that's okay so many people are doing this lady she is taking care of the house again going out and she is doing cement don't compare I didn't get the job no problem I'm looking after me I have got a job I have to go because I have to support my family I do that so this way whoever we're in whatever capacity be happy and I am performing my duty a hundred person dedication what will happen your mind will be done come otherwise competing with others what will happen all the time in the mind the waves will be there oh I could also do like that if I got that opportunity all these and there then someone she loves to sing she would say there is no one here to appreciate my son then don't bother about that go on singing no problem you sing for yourself and get satisfied when Ram prefers to sing the great stage he never sang for others he sent for himself and if you can do that for yourself when I'm talking or giving the lecture if I myself is satisfied so many people have come you people there was none we need to give the lectures there's not a single hey close these eyes and meditated in God and delivered the lecture for one hour and it creates a suspection was coming out then someone told me there was no one and why you spoke like that oh no I never spoke for them but myself I am so satisfied and their listeners whether I was telling right thing or not my god Saddam occasional marshal of the sharmaji always present people listeners are always there no problem so that is called the sadhana and otherwise the dissatisfaction will come when Shami living under gives the lecture the overhaul is full and it becomes so difficult for others also to come and now when i dhamma Tichenor under the wonderful name of god in the name of Guru nobody is there shall I cry satisfaction and this is the secret of struggle ma this is I am I am this is my capacity of my Lord and when I

all clap your hands and sing the name of God your mind will become uncontrolled that is the way you can do that the simple thing anyone can do and here when did approaching one should not be a pro afraid rather with a calm mind detached all attachment related to the body and mind when death is approaching so this is the advice to those who are facing the depth how to face the death in a courageous way when the date is approaching oh yes time has come okay I'm ready that is the way one should see when the death has come oh my god I'm going to die where are the doctors this one the doctors have not given me forward medicine I'm going to die don't pay the bill and all those things they are going on telling but I do not taking the name of God one person was dying and he was asking his manager so I am going to die what will happen to my next generations is the sufficient money is there then he said sad don't worry pass out peacefully at least your fourteen generation whatever you have accumulated fourteen generation will enjoy and you fool what will happen to the fifteenth one he's constantly thinking about that he thinks that without him everything will break down nothing will happen the moment he passed out they will for few few days only they will hang his picture then they will say picture is not good taking back and they'll put back somewhere nobody noticed it goes and that is the truth the mall with gada in the Shankar Acharya and every morning they're chanting whichever Wyndham very Wyndham Govinda Maha Maha mati and he said unto God a to Purusha our Goti got assad essa chit chit done chin god I shall versus Trina spree sham de da new chat tomorrow under Kali to Purusha when the date will cut up calm oh you be what he should do the Sarika you must concentrate how you must first cut asunder all the attachments friends I am Telling You a very ordinary person he was an advocate in the doctor that I could and apparently he was attached to so many things apparently he was so he good stick you so difficult to approach him and talk to him but it is time of death only three four four days he was lying on his deathbed he told his son can it bring a big photo of our on cinema Krishna and keep in front of me so his head was in this way and exactly opposite world that photo was found he used to tell make my head little height suit I can look at it day and night when he used to sleep when nothing all the time looking at that photo constantly and when the time came he understood his son and wife and other relatives were there and can I have some time can you all go out then they all went out and after five or ten minutes they came back in this ahir past me eyes are fixed on that photo it was not closed under dolly to pull sure Agata gotta sorta Saha Chittenden he was cutting a center or older this my wife my child my T's and that all those things a cart asunder no I cannot help so why I have to think so that way he withdrew and he try again and again to concentrate your mind on the divine form of God that will generate devotion in the mind and that is the aim of that particular advice try again and again to concentrate try again and again to concentrate obvious of Piazza of Piazza when we seek the first time I finish this occasion and then we like to get up and after 10 minutes all the knees are paining and after 15 minutes old body isn't it and after 20 minutes I remember oh my god I have a great job I have to do they may god is so difficult to sit for one hour but tried to practice slowly slowly slowly and then one thing will come fearlessness and when the date will come the last inevitable thing that will come to our life at least I am Not Afraid you can see oh I'm not afraid because I have completed all my duties and free from all that no bondage and suppose there is something that still you feel that you should do in that case you can say when I was not in this world things were morning when I won't be
