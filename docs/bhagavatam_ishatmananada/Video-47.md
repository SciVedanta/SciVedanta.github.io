[Bhagavatam 057 : Spiritual Tips Of Krishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JUCougp8_1I)

let us begin with this slow Sean whoo Jagger Cheyenne [Music] but Demong Solutions vishwa garden Assad regime me the Varnum Chuang Lakshmi gone taman ayun you give me the honor come young Bundy I am Sarah Volokh we cannot we are starting have a rhythm now it is almost the whole so many days we are studying and now in a wonderful the conversation that we are studying that is the conversation between the God Shri Krishna and he is friend and follower good double Botta great god of COSLA shri krishna we cannot imagine but at the same time we find food double there is a great personality he was a person of knowledge of man of knowledge at the same time could we are clean from the point of view of the devotee why to make it clear about this last part of the sloka that we chanted power higher or her arm is taken out Hara was taken out what the field higher the paya means the fear fear award Baba dissing averse this world so this is the basis of the spirituality unless and until we can realize this world the manifested world that we feel with our five senses from the eye from the ear nose and taste touch this is nothing but the bondage unless and until we realize it truly the religious life never start so that is the main thing sometimes majority of the people they go to the shrine the temple church moss another only to give some protection in this life that is not religion so Swami Vivekananda is telling religion is realization French we have to understand is very clearly and we should not be afraid of this why because this is all temporary things try to understand it is all temporary each and everything is passing of course some of the incidents that gives us joy and some misery and if it be so that is there but if you close your eyes fix your mind and then try to understand then each and every word of the scripture we will understand we will realize and that is exactly the last time we saw the how the hood Dawa is arguing the God what is the argument you cannot go leaving this world because the God say Krishna was preparing to give up his body and he lived 125 years as a long life and after that he is living in what situation in what condition condition whatever he created was being destroyed just in front of him he created the huge powerful clan the audible clan but the other verse became so egoistic even his own son Shambo he also misbehaving and Krishna the God with all power could not control how it is because he disassociated he disassociated it all these why he came to stablish Dharma what is this Dharma to teach this this association in the life of Shri Krishna we learned this only this association be with everything and when you were working what with full 100% mind but knowing that this is nothing all temporal so that is exactly what happened all people they were trying to save themselves the last time we were discussing the Creed other verse elders they came and they saw the people are killing each other not the enemy is their own people sometimes by mistake we think that if there is no matter religion no other culture only our culture our religion will be so happy this is the example they were all in other words they were from the same plan they were their language was the same culture was same religion was same but they killed each other why he book and this we must understand all these people doesn't look like us we should kill them all these people don't talk in our language so make them throw them out wrong thing so it is not that is the only the good people they become friends we have to understand that this is the other verse who were killing each other Krishna saw it and then he all other elderly people came what to do now he said you better go right now and then made in that pond etc last time he studied only one person he came to Krishna and he approached with this prayer you should not leave the Krishna tour but my work is done I have completed my work so I am leaving so this three the shuka who was explaining all these things happen and it was recorded by bed of the ocean bed of the Asha narrated he told it to his son sugar a great mind then sugar when traveling came and made the another king was ready for death so why again and again I mentioned the ready for death because just before death people are not having any other desire when you know that we are going to die got four wheeled suppose we are in the flight and flight in in trouble and we can understand that is going to break because both both the engines are burning we call the air hostess for a cup of coffee at that moment we cannot think of can you go and ask hey are you going to serve the lunch no that time on the date the end is coming the mind is one pointed that is the moment if we can remember God you are completely liberated that is the faith of the Hindus right at that moment when a person is dying if we can remember God that particular moment is brief and that is the reason people all the time can eat the chapel mala keep the photo of tar pool and all this but the problem is at that moment you would forget that your mother also forget that photo of that your God is there in your pocket and he will go on shouting why this is happening I purchased a ticket in $500 and what is all this so that is the peculiarity so the teaching is the training is you must concentrate your mind and the God he is telling the sugar he's explaining and he said even be happy to Rajan Raghavan Devaki sutala Deepak is the mother suitor who is the son the son of the table who Krishna this is a title of telling all the time Krishna no not like that sometimes Devaki suta sometimes Basu the evil so that is the son of the were shooting like this that is so Devaki Sutra a canteen Umbreon victimhood Diwan some of our citta and he is telling to who he he's selling that oberek Oh King you know what happened brick is all one mind mind he is trying to listen about the Krishna because Krishna he saw in his divine form when he was in the womb of his mother and he was going to die and the mother the brick sheets mother was praying to Krishna to save and Krishna game in a divine form and saved him that is another story of the Mahabharata many of you know so he saw that face and he could not forget it and then afterwards all to his life is trying to understand what that person did so now the Krishna about the Krishna he is listening from whom from that great sage sugar and he said you know what happened when the water became all other people they are living only with lava came quietly and he told Krishna I am NOT going to leave you I like to be with you if you die I'd also like to die if you go away I like to be with you this is the love of God anything happened the first suppose God forbid again the earthquake the first thing we will grab is our passport and impossible little money whatever and then jump out of it we even remember the thakura sitting over here we have to take out the taco many of us will be doing that we'll never imagine we'll never remember why because we don't have the love there's no attachment there's no love but the mother will never forget her child the first thing she will take that the child and then only she will go for safety so that it shows when the Buddha is coming and approaching Krishna when calamity everywhere good things are going on all people are scared they wanted to save themselves they were going away from the city then this man came to Krishna and told no I cannot leave you Krishna told please go don't bother about me I am going to leave my body and know if that is so take me with you I am going to die so when he was talking like that then what happened this sukadeva that he is giving he can't become real morita brittany is the follower is not a servant it is the forward the great follower you won't leave the master he won't leave the frame so he said he can't he can't okay nam seed I'd like to tell you some truth to that conversation started from here and the the Lord Krishna spoke to his beloved followers who tell what is he the Krishna see my own Despard eaten here through the carrion machine cetera yet our Tama body nominee D this is the 1107 chapter second verse he is telling and this is a wonderful way is mentioning and it's a whole of Hinduism in this he say Maya miss positon he ultra D Bukharian a Shahada as if I am NOT anyone I have performed the duty that the God has given to me Divakar iam the gods whatever the duty they have given to me I have performed perfectly for shisha Taha there is no she Asian nothing no remnant nothing is left everything I have completed or she shatter what the AVA column the the work of the God God has given the duty to Sri Krishna so this is the question said history is the supreme being in the human form and what this Brahma and others they will come and say hey Krishna go and do this word that is know he say but he is telling your tongue about these now why because for the Hat only I had vented about Tina not gentleman genovese birth and from the birth some conditions are there and about Dina means just a twenty manifested so this little world only the single later or butene that shows is the master he is the master anytime he can come he can go that near the bottom that is the reason I about the Nagahama then you see on Sheena or theta ha what is long as a little part of mine that also was born as Balarama his elder brother you know that story again I am just giving the hint because I cannot go back to the story it was his mother the Devaki he was arrested by his heart brother come share and this company there are some books another for the children but if you read it's a wonderful history and that they will like to read that very exciting and this culture he was a very notorious person and he was so selfish the moment he came to know that the eighth Burns born son of his sister is going to kill him immediately he wanted to kill the sister herself then somehow persuaded by the husband okay you want the children eight born son I will give hand over the moment the child is born I will give it to you then he was ok but hold the stage worse for that killing of the culture and the God is coming only to kill to punish the culture so if he is waiting after the eighth then what will happen because he is giving a chair like the the forgiving those children is ok no so the knowledge that came and told a how you were counting from one to eight don't you think from 8 to 1 also it may be so 8 means what may be the first of all and you are giving the pardoning like the American president pardoning the the turkey and it will be very dangerous for you oh the yes that is also true if I count from the 8th the first one is the one then I will kill all those so what happened this fellow because of his ego and because of his fear I lost all this and committed sin after singling those little babies and seventh one it was taken to the another wife of the past of it and that is Rohini and the Rowena gave birth of the seventh one but the people came to know that miscavige by the Devaki not true and that was the whole secretly and 8/1 was exchanged again ada say Krishna he was exchanged with another girl say Krishna's Maya and she was born in that the other : so the Krishna that she was brought over here in extreme Krishna was over there but all the stories the here he is mentioning my arm is body tone he ordered a Korean or she shuttle or she shot her she she missed in a future in Britain I have done nothing left portion shatter what they were courage on what is the deeper cordial that establish the religion I have done that and that is the reason I am a butene and the head hon I'm Sheena so he is giving the hint end and the brother was also this and this in the bhakti Shastra this is the most difficult part to understand now the Vedanta they say there is no part at all all imagination to the people they are very happy who I am not born but he is going to the office and if he lost the job being applied to other operation but even say I am not born anyway no problem so this is sometimes hypocritical so we don't know what actually we are telling and what we are doing that Bethan proceeding but the redundancies for those who can understand it and who can understand that pure MacArthur those who is not having the body consciousness at all then only it is not so easy so the bhakti Shastra the devotional part they applied and the devotion the problem is this again he is sitting the god is telling in the bhagavad-gita the say Krishna say na me part are she could the country surely create su Qing Jenna in the three world you know the heaven the art and the hell in this three she location I don't have anything to do and also Nami karma philosophy huh I don't have that desire to get my result also on my work then why the same God sit whistling him some saying in bhagavad-gita he said to her Juna and the same sri krishna after few years when he is talking to this good da ba is telling no I have done my dear how it is possible the why this confusion you see that you don't have any desire again you say that I have completed my duties that was even to me how it is possible and who gave the instructions Brahma and who created Brahma this God the game spirit grows in a very peculiar way the Brahma was created by the Supreme Court and this Brahma again asking as if asking the Supreme God please go manifest yourself and this so this is as is once Ramakrishna said this is all Leela this is a word that they always mentioned Leela Leela means divine play everything that you see is nothing but the divine play we have to take the help of the Vedanta to understand these the absolute on what is in tourism to understand absolute want there's no - this is the conception of to go in every into temple there will be thousands of hundreds of gods and goddesses and if you go to South people are marked with different things if you go to North another different marks will be there and like this everywhere so many people so many said so many God so many goddesses so many different types of functions but the Hindu they do not worship the images the only worship without any form all-pervading consciousness that is exactly what the Vedanta sales and so when they are asking who was in the beginning of this creation they say on one was the air and then we're from the creation came from that one how he created out of his own self look at him one he is the creator and creating out of his own self so these are the way so he is creating the the moment is creating his thinking to create how he will create and he needs some qualities a person when he is sleeping completely he's not having any quality though he may be an engineer though he may be a doctor may be an administrator but at that very moment he is not doing anything so that is one the same person moment he gets up immediately all things come in his mind oh I am the boss of that office and I have to go and perform this is the duty list for today I have to do like this most of the people now it is you know the moment they get up they don't think about God they go and touch the the computer what the duty is today we have to perform and today is duties they will see that oh my god no time you'll be jumping so like this we are our life is going on that this man just five minutes before when he was sleeping he was not having any quality what is the quality quality Sutter a giant amount these three qualities these are all Hindu philosophy they've found sucked the good quality the before clean I must say hello to my son and then thus must say hello to my wife and then I will start all these things very good and I must admit that that today is the birthday of my wife I should not forget to bring them given all this thing good things then the rajo-guna the moment you entered into there you see the your boss sitting before you before you he has already there and with the frowning he's looking at you so the rajo-guna my god he has come over here and i'm all this goes on then you have to then comes the tamo-guna you feel jealousy for the chair I have better qualities but this man is sitting over here and after six years only he is going to return my card after six years so all the tamo-guna also comes isn't it a pretty every individual is having like that every individual to satirize otama three qualities they come well from it came from that supreme one he created these three qualities and after that he disassociated himself this is very peculiar the supreme one is not having any quality but he wants to create so he created himself and gave all these three qualities and disassociated himself and like to see what he is doing see you and scientists and technologists there creatively rojo very intelligent role can feel anything everything they can do the scientist the technologist he created that give everything intellect and decision-making thing these everything then this is disassociated and give them a go work and the rofo will go and collect the order and supplying the teams now the restaurants the robos are coming everything they are doing cleaning the rooms and everything they are doing nowadays it is coming so obviously who created the scientist where is the scientist in the robot no it's completely different from the RO isn't it same way this Supreme Lord created another image what is that Robo if they can make the same phase of a human being then you like to look at them some of the Japanese the pictures that I saw at so good-looking they're like that the Robo will be just like me I am creating you so I am giving you my form but it will be completely separate similarly the supreme being the Lord created another just image and skull saguna brahman this two terminology if you can remember one is neat boon of Brahma what is the drama all-pervading consciousness and without any quality and if there is no sabotage otama there is no action there is no reaction nothing is there to tranquility and if there is no action then no reaction then there's no movement so that tranquility call supreme brahman paramatma and param brahma he has created another form which is active there's called saguna brahman ninguna saw una ninguna without me means negative without any quality and suave weed quality this Swarna Bremner this wound he's also known as Ishwara and also known as baka bond so when he called Bhagavad mr. Sahu know Brahma when he called Ishwara it's Asha Munna Brahma so these are in different names this supreme Brahman completely disassociated with this guna Brahma and in the creation the best created bring are the humans the human beings of the best created beam why because just like that intellect is their judgment is there this cumulative capacity is there and they can understand so they have given some problem the way you are intelligent so you go for the best job obviously your interview will be very tough the obvious so that's why the human being they now started researching who am i who created me where is he now the god said oh my god that they have started already searching for me but their God is happy because this intellect has come and how he will go back to that Supreme Being to the God the original then sometimes God is coming through his power the skull my arm through his power his projected nowadays in the science I don't know whether it is in reality or not but in the friction movies they say they show it then the person sitting over here and his complete picture is going as if he himself is present over there not true this computer of TV as this fine the projection he goes and he talks have forgotten that particular world so he goes and he talks and he mixed with them and then he comes back he's not there but he is also there how to the projection he's just like that that God is not here but his projection comes and what is the projection of what are the guards projection is the avatar exactly God himself but not in reality the skull about our and the spiritual about others they come just like a static birth and then they slowly grow up they'll go to school they'll have their teachers they'll have so many things in your life but at the same time so special so very special the people the society they wonder and they think oh such a person so they call the car you are God like the Jesus like the Buddha McGovern's around teach them the Krishna's we're on Chandra the wonderful lives so much they can do to you wonderful so this is was called now these about others the images of the supreme one who is also not having any desire only desire to guide the human being and who never wants ramakrishna he is making three different sections of the human being and those who believe in the existence of god the love god what one is in a circle and he said untangle another is bahadin the outer circle and thirties Assad to are their supplier the God brings them to make arrangements so this will be a stage drama in the drama some people they are active behind the scene that you don't see them we don't see them but they're keeping everything ready at they are called reserved wall and there will be some people very close to the the writer or we can say the hero very close supporting him and some people little outside so Anton de Bahia Honda and reservoir this tree under angle is inner circle the hidden the outer circle and reservoir supplier forget about the reservoir answer to untangle buoy Rangga what the buoy rangas they come to Temple but with the doubt they don't believe in the existence of God in that way but nothing wrong let us go sometimes they come with their frames relatives sometimes parents we saw two young men they came with the old parents the parents are so devoted so they came and sat over here they are looking at God and the praying and these two brothers young men they are also the stablished they are sitting at the we're looking at each other and sometimes coming and whispering let us go then the father is saying no wait so it is going on he came to this line but not with the faith but he is not disturbing the father also so this color here under the outer circle they are not against the God but they are not accepting the God also so this is a type of mind disculpa here on the external not bad people but not devoted people and this devoted people for the only God said what even the instructions of God is given only for this inner circle and this inner circle about them the gods say you bhagavati Ramakrishna you need not to do much only in two things you should do one Who am I you should know that and who are you that also you should know and then the third one what is the relation between you and me that's all that that is for the inner circle people not for all for the inner circle people this inner circle people here they are coming and this would the world belongs to inner circle and for these inner circle people God is giving all these advices and what is the advice of the God and first question why is giving the advice because the person will come into him the devotee the inner circle devotee the person he is interested to go back to the source see he is not interested in this worldly life but at the same time he cannot understand how to give it up my mother my father my relatives my whole family shall I keep it up and go sometimes some people are coming to the gods lamb dish now and asking to realize God shall I have to renounce the family the question all suggest naturally selfish I said no no you try from there yourself it will be done but a time will come then even see what is this family whole is God and nothing else and then oh my God if I go to the source did I get everything the family that I was thinking the society that I he was thinking everything nothing but the same God so this is the we did realized so this inner circle when they can what what is the advice of the God he says it is again the eleven skander seventy or types of in chapter six verse it says one to serve imperat teacher sneak on Swarna banda soon my officia mana Samia Samia drink mr. Hasegawa you just like the Bhagavad Gita Krishna is telling almost like the same way he's telling to on to star evaporated chair this is the first world if you like to realize God the first thing you should realize I should have to give up thing to a masseuse album protector the moment the people listen to these they know is not necessary I think I told you that one gentleman I don't know whether still is the other known so nearly said maybe he still let him be the end so he was used to come to the rostrum ah but sometimes the egoistic person he wanted to show to the other people that he is also somebody so when I was giving a discourse he suddenly stood up and say I have a question there is no relation between the dog and the cost suddenly he said how to gain the peace the happiness I knew the gentleman he is a good person but like that then I told how many houses were happy deserve one and how many floors are there were three so you and your wife is only living theory right okay so get the peace the two floors you donate to the ramakrishna mission and you will get 75% peace and the finally when you pass and die make the this way so that it will come to the ramakrishna mission and hundred percent peace you will get this I don't want that piece already the moment you say you have to give up then people are not or no I have to give up no one to serve and protector and the world is everything to people come to our bumper integer when I first joined in the monastic order and the joint means just I guess the interested and curious so I started started living with the monastic brothers there and the inter show me that was the deal in ceramic isness birthday the images show me told me look at these all devotees are bringing so many things in India the system is when you are coming to the temple or to the holy people you must bring something either the fruits of flour the sweets or something like that right so all people are bringing their offering so showing that it all what you are going to give then I use no because I left all my everything so I was not having the money the I was thinking what to bring I don't and right this moment I don't have the money but if you had told me informed me I could get some from my friends or now I am NOT asking those things what you are going to give today but what there is a give yourself to God go and lie down over there just on the pronoun and say God I have nothing except his body mind and consciousness all this three I give it to you for your service and whatever we you like to use this and ready the go and give yourself to God I remember that and that was in chair upon G and the beautiful place so this year you have to give everything sullivan protector and you're gibbehh' what do you give up ego what is mine this building is mine evil and this is mine ego so everything nothing but the ego so the Hindus they pointed over there Raghavan said I'm pissed at all if you can crash the ego then no problem will be there here also we listen the Sri Krishna advising the hood double sorrow want to solder bumper integers if you got me I made this whole thing to ARCA this beautiful city and the state everything I made at this moment I'm living everything without hesitation without hesitation without know who I am bill to give up not like that just like that giving up so you to follow that mom to serve and protect you what you have to pretend you because Neha SWAT Jana bun do you and your attachment your love for the sewage Anna and bun do you relatives and friends we love our relatives and friends the last two days all people who are doing crisscross if they are visiting these people they are going over there so like these all wonderful time they were passing so this is what is they call such an abundant what is the sadhana Sajal means the relatives so Jana that this is mine so Jana and Pandu shoo though they are not of the same clan at the same language but they are friends to such an appendage you must detached yourself don't get attached through emotion and love for relatives and frames this is the first thing so sometimes the people the thing that what to do to become a monk many people that think that we should become a mom and what is this monk or what is this mom only to putting a gay bar and grow the beard and like that nothing you have to give up the such an abundant you know attachment if your father kama the mother comes all the friend your sisters brothers are coming and other devotees are coming it should be equal the singing hymns idea but this is my father so the special oh this is my sister so special nothing like that if you are having that even in the mind you are not a monkey but you have the love for them concern for them not that we have forgotten Tommy be big on this mother she came to belittlement and balloon what is a in a big place and the big temple so many people working the Swami's Brahma cherries and rich people are visiting from Calcutta in their cars homage his mother was very feeling very happy and proud and she was ready elderly lady she was telling see this is my Pierre's down below means the bibigon under the nickname might be he has purchased these you know this blood all my ability the other young so means they were enjoying the company of that lady so grandmother here seems you Billy has done this year Billy as done death somehow and the information the news came to Swamiji he was sick he was lying down in his room the moment he came to know his mother is telling like that in that condition he came running and our daughters for me I call a crowd and asked a mother mother please leave and one thing please remember I did nothing this is nothing nothing belongs to me it belongs to my Master's I am Krishna no see I'm Krishna team so the mother is there she is there but the moment she was making this immediately the great monk Vivekananda he said so this is calm uncle not that we don't have love we have trained us love respect attachment but the attachment true God if you are good people we are attached with you we love you but if you are not from distance we say thank you but that is the whole thing the monkhood means this and he's telling don't deserve imprinted jerk Sneha Majin upon the shoes liam means your attachment and what you should do the mind it needs to go somewhere either to my frame or to then he said to me to call you have to keep your mind somewhere and what is there miyabi Shobana Samuel you must keep your mind on me see friends this is a wonderful way and this is called devotional way bhakti bottle through the path of the devotion how you can do this constantly imagine the goddess we do sometimes we have seen from India that the ladies they are coming with small little and that Krishna the baby Krishna and they will be carrying all the time not necessary carry the God in the heart wherever you go someone has offered you the food whatever be with the food just seek and you may remember God look at this food I have got this because of your grace and there's so many other people are there all I can see so many there on the street homeless people no one invites them to give the food but I got a friend who is offering food is because of you thank you so in that only you just imagine and you eat and after that you say thank you God this is some cheese food and full I'm very happy because you get that because you give these frames these relatives discomfort all this advantages because of you you you you my garbage German are efficient I wish you know that sometimes some people who say that because the ghost has come on end then the person will be very peculiarly there's a vision a vision means completely possessed possessed with God but externally nothing o am possessed with God the moment they come out though I saw the one gentleman in Belem thought he was walking with me and suddenly he stopped then I went further then I turned back and so he is looking at the sky then I came back and what can't you see the Shiva is looking at us and you that she was see because we believed the Shiva is constantly looking at us but we are hungry you know better what is everything timing if you don't if you don't reach in time then you don't get the food so I don't see this you don't know you have to go in time otherwise she won't feed you let us eat afterwards like down and then talk to the Shiva come so not like that in order to show like that never even a particularly in the life of the spirituality one must be very very careful knowing compressing no you go crazy Rami be weak and said I can stand everything but hypocrisy your to remember that I can stand everything some people sometimes they tell the lies and then they all I have told the lies I'm so nice the Swamiji was okay no problem they're all human the weaknesses but hypocrisy no but unfortunately most of the religious people they are under the spell of the hypocrisy why people will be attracted to me what is people for whom I am doing these so we must say say my Amish shaman are some merit some big visitorís you're gone they'll know go around wherever you like to go there is no problem how to become even minded he is giving the answer when we can ask you told that you should be even minded how to become PC yet eaten Manasa bar cha-cha should be on so kannada me not sharam greens of oranger built a Maya ma no way on how I can become even minded then the Lord suit richness telling this is the seventh slow curve he is telling whatever you see in this world whatever you think in your mind see through your eyes here to the year and everything that it natural transitory temporary so obviously why should I be so much attached to these yet Eden Manasa Archer Churchill Downs Abernathy being national clear boninger be my ammonium is the end of work Maya everything nothing but the images and nothing when as a young age push to go to see the movies mostly chargin movies you know so and I were very fond of tauriel that Arjun dumping from here there I am very manly so he was very happy with the turtle I might you know was tortured then sometimes the target is standing then a tiger is approaching from the back and sometimes you know so much association and I used to shout d'argent Arjun turn back and other things later sit down turjun knows what is happening you know when I grew up I used to love for my this foolishness why attachment that that meant to so so when in the night also I'll be the help you see seeing that I am swinging and all that so they gave some pillow in both the side of my otherwise I jumped from the car so like that it to happen why so much of a situation and all imagination there is no about related it has nothing nothing truth and another thing that I told you though I was in the fourth grade a fight sleep great in our country usually we come from a school walking and not like these the school guards and all so we were coming back then he found on the street corner the ramayana is going on and that was the scene where the Rama is banishing schita I am naturally I felt oh my god why the agonizing schita where the schita will go and the forceful in the banister sheet Ishita was profusely crying and then she went at the back of the stage I also went to see what what will happen to schita maybe that I have to help father and when I paint I found there is no lady a gentleman he to go took of the week and then smoking secretly but we were sita and that was such a shock for me certain actually think everything that happens and i have confirmed now is all Maya everything is nothing but Maya but we do is find when you read the news it's just for a girl and boys committing suicide or killing some people just for in the name of love is very very wrong they should understand the truth they should understand I like you and if you like me okay if don't okay that should be the mine this is practical life how to apply the religion in the practical life days and this is the teaching your dee-dum Panesar barcha barcha means through that sometimes some people they will tell you so wonderfully and you start believing that be careful and this Manasa you are thinking imagining chuck's you've gone through this both eyes you were seeing 7rv you are hearing not Shirin already temporary do you come on chibita Maya Manu who I am these are all imaginary all through our life everything so when they understand that then there's no problem to see equally everything is the same those who are loving me okay not loving okay Allah clearly and who is enjoying the life I and if I suffer who suffer I so that is the thing my life and I am going to leave maybe hardly 40 years maximum why should I suffer this is the practical teachings of the our Scripture and it says I will conclude with this one why this happen to us because our mind is not why we suffer because our mind is not controlled and the people of uncontrolled mind but one krishna stealing falls into the error of morality this isn't easy in the Bhagavata in the conversation of the Watauga Shri Krishna stealing the problem because you see Perl so many wrong his only God is there and nothing is there every manifestation is nothing but the car and find many 10 demerit and the thing that I should do these for a merit and this is demerit for this type of people there are three types of action I will conclude in with this what are the three types of action we must know it without what we cannot survive we are doing work but there is a in such thing the same with the scripture karma akarma and because karma is the work with a purpose whatever I am doing with a purpose what is the purpose that will be helpful to the people the Karma that is called truly karma whatever I am doing that will help people another is a karma I am doing with no purpose nothing is going to happen the Bahamas Rama Krishna he noticed that elderly people the spending time by playing cards they why you people don't do something good you can go and talk to the younger people giving them some moral values or do something no no no I don't like all these I like to spend my time spending the time the spending the time should be something must be what fulfill a karma these are no value at all they're going on that then comes P karma and B karma is evil action what will evil purpose I am not naming but I saw the interview of underground leader and the he is fighting so when the the recorder is asking what do you do what is you two team now I get up in the morning and get fresh and then we plan where we are going to have the bomb blast and whom I am going to kill from the morning itself he is thinking whom to kill and how to talk torture and all that is this is called be calm the bickerman is any action that creates problem for others in a mission that creates problem for others so friends I think I should stop over here and from the next day again next Sunday we will continue with this and again at rise of the an argument of the devotee hotel and they again counter argument of Shri Krishna from here we learned that all these things that we see is nothing but images and these images should be the same all pictures is not true in that case why should I be so much affect us to this so it is time that should try to understand this and slowly withdraw my mind and in the ninth verse of the Krishna is advising in the next class we will discuss what will happen then eternal peace will come if you can understand this and we are doing the work every work should be Karma for the benefit of others not for the trouble for others benefit of others so this is the teaching we learn let us join this mantra and I complete you need drama student is the place that we build a song but the drama Pony shadowy Guardian some harvested that did the Dina - aw borsch Indian yogi No yes young dumb happy
