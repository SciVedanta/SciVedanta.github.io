[Music] but solutions governess attrition hung Lakshmi gamma u pv d on Adam Bundy Mishu papa hyah hyah server locally girl [Music] today we'll be discussing about how devotee the mother got liberation those were following this bhagavata you've all known the devotee and her son Kapila they were having the discussion for last few classes we were discussing about that it was the ordinary mother devotee was not an or 30 mother she performed her duties as a daughter then as a while then as a mother and then ultimately decided to get the liberation after completing all our responsibilities and to get the liberation you need someone who is enlightened we should go to him seek for him who else was there that copy so without thinking that Kapila is her son she took koopida as a guru and went over there with great respect and then started asking question so you know all those then finally she is asking a very important question pollution property Brahman now we moved Utica legit Brahman she's addressing her son as a drama piane she knew it very well the capito was not ordinary so he is a Brahmin Yanni the one who has theorized is also Brahman from mommy the myopathy so that way the cupola is also the problem again she's addressing him as Brahman and asking the the prakruti and purusa are inseparable property is never disconnected from the Purusha do you do Ananya ' Archer will torture on Io Bravo this is the third book 27 chapter 17 verse of the bhagavata she's there in interdependence and eternal connection purusa and prakruti this knowledge camilla gave to her mother sheera student now after listening she is asking you see kirusha and property that means the consciousness and its power are inseparable in that case and their eternal and they are dependent on each other in that case how will get Mukti globulin the shutter curtain go evenly they should cut on how cotton means how there is a liberation in the parts number 19 and in the small portion of that - Liam - dish cutter cutter how it is possible to get the liberation now why we are not free this is the first question that consciousness has created us so we are also conscious and then why we don't feel the freedom because we have got the simple answer bound bank what what is the court cause of the bondage our mind gets associated with the objects wish area we share means the objects where is the problem in that these desires these objects are all temporary constantly changing so when we are keeping our mind on that so obviously there is no stability every time it is changing every time it is changing when we were children we had some objects like the kites like the ball like many other things we kept our mind on there a time came all those things changed as a young man I thought that these are the things I must did I started trying to all those things there's also gun at their very senior age I am thinking what will happen to me only look after me all these things the constantly temporary things that we are going on thinking getting associated and result uncertainty anxiety so that is not them so one thing we could understand it's not the body it is the mind that is the cause of bondage and it has written very clearly it is mentioned mana eva manusyanam karna won the milkshake mind is the cause of bondage and also liberation so now it is not the body it is a mind we have to go through that through mine - mine is the root cause of the bondage but a spiritual spiritually laboured person using the same mind can get liberation this is very unique now when we are feeling sick we were going to the doctor then the doctor analyzing and giving the medicine remedy we are having some other problem we are going to that particular person who can solve it that it goes on but what will happen to me with my own mind can help me because I have to help myself to purify my own mind which is impure because of the thoughts are these worldly objects now we have to understand the seriousness of the problem our mind which is already corrupted with the help of that corrupted mind I have to get the free education how it is possible but that's why the liberation understanding the subtleness of the spirituality millions almost everyone in the whole world each and every person is having a religion and they're practicing the religion and to some extent satisfied with the religion or disgusted with the religion but what about the spirituality knowing about the truth what is the truth that my and purity itself the very strong world in the revolutionary world for many of the people who thinks themselves we are separated we are sinners I mean one lady and when I was telling that we are Buganda what is that Vedanta I told that we feel that each and every one is the divinity oh this is privileged the one should not think in that way it's a scene I must say after that Easter that is the problem we are thinking hours a week we are thinking hours of sinners we must have to understand that and it is coming how it has come we have to understand that then of course we were in a different purpose so he could not continue and she was not in a mood to accept that particularly but this is the problem I am thinking about I am thinking I am we I am thinking that I can never get liberation now who will help me this is the problem so that's why shall we be vacant to say but thinking weakness you cannot overcome witness we have to think something positive what is that positive so it is Coquina gives the example of the wound he says heaven notice the wool now of course in California all of California they know what is this wood and fire nobody's going and lighting it just because of the tremendous greening then two branches of trees they are running together creating fire and burning losses that is the long bad in our country there was surely there notice this type of fire and moreover the only the thing that is to use for fire was the who so kuvira is giving the example of the wood and he's telling haven't noticed how the wood creating fire and then burning and totally destroying itself in that file the wood is creating the fire and then destroyed similarly use your mind and then destroy that mine because mine is the cause of bondage use that mine to destroy that part of the mind and go beyond it beyond the mind so this is the wonderfully our Parramatta is giving the teaching in our lives you experience joy and sorrow what will happen to these experiences after the liberation another question is coming now right from the childhood days there's a little bit of joy and little bit of sorrow and it goes on and on and on if we make it crap it will constantly go on up and down up and down so this is the joy and sorrow joy and Soulja hands goes on what will happen after the liberation when those things when it is going the to get a tip like a Peter gives a wonderful analogy it says suppose you are having a fearful dream and in the dream everything is so permanent so real and in the dream we were aspiring gasping and trying to go out of the danger now tell me when you get up but what happens to those sufferings but joy that you are having in the dream what happens to that vanishes even in the night when I was really terminating the moment in the mall I get her I forget that and I don't like to remember that also that is a different thing but it's okay so in the dream it was so real in the waiting stage it is completely unreal the similarly now in the waking stage we were even we are thinking so real in the spiritual stage it will be completely unreadable there's a repellency Ramakrishna said if I knew this world is true I would have covered the holy that village where I was born tomorrow could with God he said no it is not like that it's all temporary so this is the truth the first is we have to use our own mind to burn our mind to completely remove our mind which says I me and my all these things we have to burn that remove that and then what will happen to our experiences I think maybe after deliberation or Nimet Nimet in subtle mean I'm a lot of UNAM now how do now the question comes to practices theory we have understood we have to realize that how do now he gives that small enough to another the state by state we have to practice and the very first word he said go and close your eyes and signa PC software Dena on the limit Dean we are given the limited limited the cause is there think that because is not there by practice your own responsibility son animal I have accepted that so why should I not say that I got that old to become the accident American citizenship and in the old it is written the deep necessary I will take the gun I will take the arm to father still fight for the country then I don't know but I have accepted the hope that I cannot take the gun that is okay that line with others are repeating you don't admit that all right I appreciated that the officer is so confident the all this 2015 20 lines that you're promising what he you were telling just keeping the hand like this you are telling the truth how much faith but truly in the indian mind we feel or let me tell but I am NOT going to follow them but that is not good we will come to that why in the Indian my leaders come every time in the Indian religion is giving certain certain truthfulness truthfulness then why am i leaving like this because of the social condition we were under the subjugation of the foreign rulers for 800 to 1000 years almost and you know that we were subjugated many things that you cannot express the moment to express you entail so you have to save your life you have to tell lies so this thing has crept into our mind so we don't mind telling lies why we think that we have to save ourselves and even ever if I'm telling I'm not going to do the but this gentleman seen me you're a monk so non-violence that you have promised you must keep that non-violence promised how you will be accepted as a citizen of America but there you need not do they recite that particular repeat that particular promise that means expecting whatever promises that to your dream you're telling the truth everywhere they will say raise your hand like this and say whatever is written in the form is true you select that truth why the hand because that I suspect that this hand is the symbol of my truth I'm not going to tell eyes ever so this he says shut arena you want to practice spirituality you must perform swadharma swaddle Nina Oh Mona Mona what will happen practicing your own responsibility one duties your mind will become completely pure Allah mana Ottoman are nominees the mind will become pure very fine look at it for the beautification we go to bait in the Ganga for purification we do so many things but what is the purification the first thing the Cabiria the great Muni he is telling you must perform your slaughter Amma the responsibility he's telling to his mother and the mother as I was telling as a daughter her father said you must marry the kardama the Mooney should look at them then kardama told ask my wife you must look after my house or then you must raise my children okay then the window husband was leaving she told I also need liberation why you were putting me over here then the husband told this son is not ordinary one she is the Vishnu himself has come as his son so being me does not take care of him and the son will give you the liberation she waited when the Sun blue Kapila then she came and toured you are my good and are considering you as my son usually the parents they won't listen to the Sun again what he would say do we know everything about it is known in the spiritual world is completely different it's not about the age it's not about the relation is about the knowledge so Kapila gave that and we said mother or limit the limit Tina one should perform one's own duty that is swadharma we create sincerity and we doubt hankering for the result on Nimet Nimet dinner by that one's mind will become purified among so this is the main thing we must have to practice swaddle what is the subtle any responsibilities that you have accepted willingly that is you know so that that's what I was dealing willingly I am accepting notice forcing me to accept the citizenship of America I accept it now they say being an American you should not perform all these sitamma you must have to do so this one action and tourism is very interestingly says sudharma true karma yoga when you were doing the southern are your responsibilities your duties whatever you have to perform you are performing but how or delete the limit thinner not demanding are expecting the result and it is coming over see how one action is giving the two dessert I have a doctor I am going and taking care of the patients are very carefully but at the same time what the patient will give me these and they're nothing like that I am not expecting anything but a patient must be cured that much I must do stitches and giving the best of my knowledge to the students but I'm not expecting the students will remember me and come back and then with respect to me and these in their neighborhood Billings raising the children giving best but afterwards not depending on them if they had come okay let them be happy so this is the way is a special type of training why because our mind is naturally at us to what won't get and came many of the families I know the mother will never leave the son or the daughter and creating the problem in the life of the Son and the daughter too so I told I think then one mother told her son till I am leaving you should not accept the sannyas he he was very much eager to take the seniors and the mother became now two words like the sachin tenduikar green orbiting up 200 the Sun now the Sun would not so the Sun was taking I am happy that I lived in my mother bird and medicine yes I will make don't bother about that you have practiced subtle that will give you liberation so this swadharma and karma Yola it goes like by side we must understand that it tells us a mind to disassociate from the world things perdy worse the whole thing's property in the world of the Kapila this worldly things anything that is changing is nothing but property and its associated with the supreme law when the mind is disassociated from the property where it will go it will go to Supreme God and my experiences must be supported by the experiences of my earlier practitioners that is also very important Gian Hina Tristan doctrine and click the whole sloka I've taken the words from their Giannina twister 13 result of my experience must stand with the result of those experiments done earlier there so again Nina I am having the knowledge but we said all right dirty of the people don't understand that they think that I realized many of the people to senayan realized out there having tallied with others and if you had anything will understand and fathers to his heart sometimes some people say my father told that he realized God he's a very great respect for the father but if he has realized the God then this is dis dis quality must have shown in his character have you noticed that emotion is one part attachment is another thing the respect is another thing truth is another thing truth is completely different they have a cut-and-dried is it telling with the experiences that is recorded in the scripture if in the spiritual whatever has been written it is there we can see then you can understand least we think that liberation from the clutches is not very difficult as we are reading now just practice your Dharma your own responsibilities without any expecting any reserve and even mind be purified and leave the liberating this is so simple Kapila understood that and the 27th chapter 27 verse he is telling yada even a heart monitor Colleen with gentlemen are celibate regard availa give our Brahma Baba Moony then you become a meaning if you can this disaster sweetie you would mind from these objects to such intense practices for a very long time even several births one develops extreme dispassion without care and how for everything after brahmaloka the brunt on is the firstborn the Creator if someone comes and gives in that post if you eaten oh that is be good then he was not going to get the liberation that is also bondage so you have to have the dispassion for everything the dismal boy he went to the Yama loop and the story goes in the Phoenician Kotoko nation and the Yama was tending him giving all the prizes that he said no I don't need all these things I need only the knowledge so that is of this passion mohammed salameh pitched also tainted in his greed difficult times and our indra not he wanted money to support his family his mother brother sister that times long distances go today is the Tuesday today is attorney go to my mother Kali whatever he will play you negate that young boy will be accepted mother Kali entered into the temple and saw mother is not image the living and alien thing you just wish you will get there it was a great temptation make me the king of the whole world no he did say that it will be by in archaea this fashion that was the prayer so that tremendous control over your mind the temptation how it comes just one day I practice and it we can't know Bojana Gallina Babu gentleman are you have to after practising that only job the way darker then only you get that dispassion and what is that dispersion are Brahma bourbon arm if you have that type of dispersion the only people that called you Mooney Mon and Sheila copy Domini name teaches his mother diverting the spiritual discipline practicing which she will get liberation now this is a way she is concluding the conversation with his mother now we will also go on practicing addressing his mother s River heart emoji atma jaya a son a daughter the job job means birth one who has taken birth from me so hard my job so this job nipple the king's daughter that his Prince's addressing his mind and that lead the daughter of the king you were the princess and he was stating why suddenly he addressed the mother as the heart mature why he addressed now anything in the scripture any water that they use they must have thought something so that's why here I thought this my analysis by telling the mother that you are said to be a lady and even the princess so you were born and brought up in a comfortable life first analysis modern you were born in a very comfortable life sir born and brought up we be able to practice this abstract ease that is the first thing the Pavillon is giving telling her his mother and again the second meaning it may be you are a Kshatriya baby people who are determined to finish the task once taken of the Kshatriya clan they never give up once the think of anything they will finish it and then only do stop that is the speciality of the Kshatriyas so this Kshatriya means the Mill Creek and the meat relives they are very very determined to the fly here reminding the mother here a Kshatriya so once you take up the north in return so in both the meaning it maybe you got lucky on up bakshi I will tell you how to practice the yoga Hugh Berkshire lucky on impoverishing National means the system the way you must practice trains these are the great teachings of the Parramatta and how this slowly we will go to that swadharma arches on a shuttle with her mom neighbor the nom de la latina santosha our group in Tirana Archana the first law cases the third book 20 chapter second verse he said there solder love Archer you must practice your own responsibilities again and again and again the Swami Vivekananda pretend for a long time in our country in India these teachings are misinterpreted by some of the people and all over the society it came that if you are a religious person practicing religion don't work why what we buy is a wrong conception some people came and told the great leader our Lord Buddha he said this world is full of misery permissive moon who has understood it Shankaracharya came and told that this world is nothing but Maya Maya for room was understood it for other people millions and millions of people who don't bother about it they like to survive for them humanely weak but in the bhagavata says long back in the bhagavata says slower than about Archer Anna mentioned there then afterwards in the bhagavad-gita Shri Krishna is dealing superbly written on Surya para trabajar so forcefully easily so their name written on Sri Sri a period when he is a soldier he must be powerful physically and mentally he must be dedicated to the cause no he will be just humble as medicating doing like these writing point he mean there's no problem between the responsibility comes is must and like if soon otherwise the king must be judged even if his own son is doing something wrong the punishment should be equal that's why Rama Chandra in the the Indian society Rama Chandra is a great personality why because he was equal everything was the same his brother did some mystic - wanna his own shadow she detailed mistake immediately the punishment the punishment it is supposed to get better others also dad detachment because being King I am supposed to do this and mother father and not related with anything sitting on the throne I am The King and same sightedness certain of autonomous act worth between man me Burton Amon and you must come back perform your duties and responsibilities as best as you can Archer initiative as best as you can not that you should be perfect is not possible all the time to become perfect but as best as you can so that is the first thing second abstain from performing those word that will harm others even deeds beat harmony Burton on the moment we save beat ARMA the others religion immediately the present-day society will say oh that is let's see even in the paper that they say other silly children where was other religion at a time of Agartha there was no other religion anything anywhere around it is only the sanatana-dharma so why be Dharma what is that with Dharma the responsibility which is not yours you should not step into that otherwise you create problem now the administration and the Judiciary if the Judiciary start doing that restriction and administration start influencing the judiciary what will happen Society will break down see that from the beginning itself that is considered ma Dean's not a this is a big list what the king should do and the ministers should do in the Rigveda the oldest religious book there the Reese's are addressing that the captain directress in the Shema body and there's a human is inoperative we have chosen you as our general of the military so you must perform your duty in the real way that they are reminding again and again so that is called solar ma Saturn mom Archer alums are there one person a married person came to Saddam vishna and he wanted to practice spirituality Salam Krishna told what about your family how they look doctor I don't care you don't care you must do dramatic man who is going to look after your family go back that is use of them with Swami be read under the young man you know the parish managed and that was ring on saddam is the heart about that and ran to McCauley mother don't bind him I need his service but when another person came Master Pasha who noted the gospel the of the conversation and he said I am already married and had children he said oh I saw you that you create potential he was there I could utilize that for spreading the religion so this way shut her mouth look at the life of Marshall community be the 30th December we are going to observe the mother's Domini Devi is a great day and mother is the embodiment of all of these suburban she practiced and then whatever the responsibility came she practiced obscene from the Dharma the neighbor to few ladies came to master the man in Damien told we are going with the saddam krishna to visit that place will you come just think of it 18 years young the wife and in those days they could not come out so naturally it wasn't great opportunity her husband is going other people are also going she was also naturally thinking to go but still without masters permission i cannot go my husband's permission this lady's ring to the ceramic dish Nando the mother also wants to go with she selamat Easton replied the stoutest is a great master he said if she likes she can go look at it if she likes and mother went they came back and told him he has given the permission mother to know what we say tell me exactly what he say he said if you think you can go that means he is not liking I won't go that this is the wives responsibility so this is called swadharma there's a lot of many things we must understand about the sadhana as a student as a star as a daughter as a parent as a husband and wife all these things we must have to have then this whole society will become really heaven only by performing certain it will be heaven do you not love the innocent ocean then whatever you have achieved you must be satisfied with that some people are getting something more and if you are constantly going on complaining why do you get all those things where I am not having and you were burning only nobody else so you must be continued oh whatever I have got on fire no problem for me that drill of the Latina santosha Dini see our human journal Archana didn't must serve the holy people unless and until you were doing the service to the holy people he will never get anything because your ego is not going to get the crashers' otherwise it will be very difficult then if you go then they will be escorting you rebuking you so many other problems will come and slowly slowly your ego will go away otherwise we'll never get ready to receive the blessings of the God the skull you must a half OB jarana Archana the first instruction that he gave in the second verse of the 28th chapter these certain march around with a lot which is not your responsibility don't disturb in that and then these are the lovely innocent dosha whatever you have got be satisfied in that and go to the holy people and try to serve them in the three verses that continues over there he said grandma thora the batista this is a very unique way presenting grandmother if you translate the ground the war drama is village and if you translate religion of the villages why the compiler is criticizing the villagers villagers of that all emotional thing here the Brahmin is completely differently in the Journal of Prabhu also if you read his gentle nature interpreter he said grandma cotton are Cohiba in bengali say grandma cut out all the useless discussions you should not do because it's a waste of time no kata not really you should not see there with here the grandma means that which is not connected for your purpose what is our purpose liberation our both liberation the only thing we should concentrate and he said drama teacher Musa are Marathi Tatar you must love the moksha Dharma and he must denounce the ground and Arbor metre mother organum shut shutter victor Seamus Abram these are the basic thing to start the spiritual the first chapter xxviii the third book 20 chapter 2nd verse and then disease in the third verse one who wants to get liberation should not practice Dharma artha kama that's the drama you know that for the goals in human life that was fixed in the our tradition Frosty's Dharma the duties and responsibilities etc must learn about that and after getting that knowledge you must utilize those knowledge ease and earn some money order and then comma all your desire should be fulfilled with that money so these are the three steps then comes the moksha finally Jerry says since you have sincerely trying to get the liberation don't bother about the other three things go straight to the motion you must practice moksha Dharma perhaps that lead to liberation should eat moderately and feel food you should eat moderately and beautiful this is also very very important very very important otherwise it is very difficult to control the mind and then meet the mother autonomous work but no list of food but not least two items that what you should eat afterwards only it has been added nothing like that which is good for you you must eat but limited and must reside in a solitary place between - a massive animal you must stay in a solitary place then heat released the whole list the seekers of the liberation master doubt those who are interested must read the whole twenty eighth chapter of the third board so the 28th chapter gives how to practice and the most important thing I am sir I'm Savannah Singh of ill-will towards the creatures let's go fast by himself banishing the ill will hear the rhymes are the moment you say I am the most of the Indian Minds will immediately think of vegetarian food it has nothing to do with the food the ill will that you are thinking about the others the bad thing if you are not doing that that is my mission then subtly holding to the truthfulness as I was telling at a time of war they told since you have accepted on himself they don't repeat these words certainly the small thing little thing but for us it is nothing once you take up any responsibility you must stick to that subtly so that's a little in a posterior refraining from exploiting others one should not exploit others mostly the highly educated people they exploit those who are going for this PhD and their masters middle classes if you go and talk to those people they will tell the stories of these so many times they will torture them any other places also any opportunity immediately they will torture that is called you should not esteem him refraining from exploiting others you should not Java art every girl except only declared quantity unnecessarily exceeds an excess and X is why if you take the wounded include contantly that much I need these things this is necessary for me did that that's for you no problem you are a doctor even a thinker and you need some comfort you must get it but at the same time not exist brahmacharya practicing substring top austerity physical and psychological the someone say something wrong about you immediately you are reacted they are not practicing the person the tapa the tapasya means that let him say is okay and very happily you are accepting that that is called tapasya someone is praising you that also you are not accepting that is called tapasya this is on psychology and physical the person some time you are having the good one thing and something you are not in whatever condition you must accept that the self physical torture socha maintaining purity externally and internally and what is this seniority the most of the people I know the ones say take the monastic girl didn't clean themselves if you go near today with a bad smell is coming from the body and the proteins little war they think oh this is austerity we are practicing and we don't care about the body no wrong you must be very neat and clean and after about Saddam kissed was very attentive Marsala monetary very very careful Shami we began they used to visit now and then the rooms of the Brahma chalice suddenly even enter into the room of the parameter is whether everything is nicely kept or not very neat and clean maybe the simple dress but very well cost and properly so that is the ramakrishna mission a mean-ass trauma if you go the ramakrishna mission this is a lanta society in this country and ramakrishna mission or what ma th in india anywhere very poor if you go meet aunty very neat and clean all the time and people think that all there are rich people is not Richard for many of the customers that they're very poor particularly Kerala some of the asanas are really very poor I visited that only one item they would eat either rice over that girl that South Indian the rasam us that's all nothing else but look at the plate they will read it so nicely it's all collective in plates and you won't understand okay very clean so this is the symbol of spirituality spirituality means oh I saw the light crossing this way that way I don't understand so these are the basic theme then it says swap tire so other things regular study of Scripture of' instead and now I am NOT not like that every day at least two pages three pages you must read since in humans to eat and that is retired Purusha Archana worship Purusha means one who is residing within that scale Purusha Archana that is worshipping of God and these are the basic things if you are not practicing or did not get getting the liberation now you can't so the son heard about from the Animus begin what is the responsibility wherever you are start from the earth do that with the mind of detachment so along with the straddle ma with the Karma and then morning the moderate and speech this is very very important we all the time think like talking but moderate and speech one must be you must be we never we gave an opportunity any Indian they know minimum 50 things about the spirituality if they give any opportunity they will constantly giving in that crisis but I don't practice what I'm telling you if you like you can practice but this is ready they really burned at one cup of Cana Macon Carlos they were late in taking the shop and they were ready purchasing books then afterwards when they came I found that there was nothing so I bring to our volunteers and told arrange something per thing so they should not go empty store so they arranged then one day he came we all these things were doing she was not anywhere they when they sad for eating she came oh you have come to be done you know what is bad also I don't my god then I had Lee Hawkins tower I cannot say please at least to really have the practical without the eating and then afterwards sleeping and then if there no she will go on giving the lecture and then you know when she stopped with Nakata and then through the things and washed their hands and went away then only he told I converted them and what conversion to do that so this is the problem other people don't understand the who is Swami and who is a devotee for them without the society and what the impression they became hope is a necessity for my car they will give you food and one ton of lecture so on blinken Ana's the people don't understand we should how they will know new people meet me I'm wearing a peculiar dress and they think oh it is a Halloween dress okay no problem listen but so that's right the responsibility of our devotees whoever morning the path the vedanta must understand these so this is the reason these things are so important Mona moderate speech inspired no problem giving some ideas also no problem help terrific of the books no problem but at the same time mid controlled manner Siddhartha joyous to adjourn practices didi posture for meditation Isana strategy when you're practicing meditation the way you are sitting that must be very very steady brownie has shalini then gradually controlling you breathing's prana yeah this is also very important and then breath the archer in Rio Nam Michelin Man Azadi prefer Tihar wheeler withdrawing the mine from the same subjects and directing the mine towards the heart ready the chapter 28 of the third book kabila explaining details the process of meditation then he described how the mind we fix on slippery snow so this is also very important after this he said lead out Donna it's not easy to meditate on without any objective some people that think in that way but it becomes very in a slow progress but if you have an object and what you be the object to be see you then he is describing in many verses what the Vishnu the chancre chakra God are not our equation what they do though the god of the Vishnu what they were learning how is the eyes how his ears about the hands how his smiling how his feet everything in great details he is giving over here so that you can just close your eyes and visualize when the mind get free from any objects it marches in supreme Brahman automatically like a lamb without oil extinguished so the example is giving what will happen the moment you realize what will happen but once the domination you say suppose there is a darkness in a room for a long long time many many days then suddenly someone brings a light inside the room will that Turkish go slowly slowly now the polar kid the last mum in Hindi they say man who come who Dogon they might attain apartment where he was searching me my friend and we till you joking the a premium couple Erica told Osman if you truly seek me without a blink I will tear he will get me you'd realize me so that he says the moment you realize the truth and immediately all other things are gone nothing will remain the great rishi Kabila he instructed the mother and along with the mother all of us what he started this is very important we are studying the father bottom this bhagavata is giving the example and the instruction that one should practice karma yoga but the Karma Yoga you are practicing your own responsibility without waiting for the result calm disassociated from the reserved Gyana yoga understanding that we are the pure we have been created by God the supreme god so obviously I am also God and my practices is nothing but becoming my god and then Tianna yoga all the practices that here given over there and then up to you and in our next class we will try to understand different types of bhakti Greed's devotion the of the the Blessed Mother listened very carefully cerana then analyzed mañana those were following this classism know how she was asking the question that proves he was she was not only listening she was also fumbling over that analyzing that whether this type of teaching is going to be beneficial or not circe ravana and mañana para means listening attentively monana analyzing and then DDT asana she meditated and got completely mercy brandman today about the garden liberation how salvo cotija art mana serve a brutal nature harmony santoku tissues apart mana he saw the same divinity in every being and all this in that divinity Salva brutality harmony in the 42nd verse he concludes having just conquered the property the primal energy of the Lord Vishnu devotee obtain the real form of Brahman how the mother devotee got liberation she sees the way now question comes whether we are interested to get the liberation or not we are interested to get the liberation it is not the publicly the way one can explain this one sincerity these are the things that you have to practice we have to practice and the drill teacher Kapila is asking us my name's are cetera as the operator brahma georgia the perfumes of Tyre the anusha Archana mana regen and prana higher birth aha all these you go to any scripture you find this list anywhere in the arabic gita saying karma-yoga jnana-yoga bhakti-yoga all this dear you go to yoga Shastra the same list will be there you go to any spiritual these are the things they are constantly asking us to practice we tell the practicing it is just waiting some of the things and we think that we are very intelligent we understand religion you may understand something but the deeper relation will come when you see that divinity present in every being and how then you can say I hate you you don't belong to me and this is in reason religion is reorganization what is the realization that Supreme Being who we call as God is present in every being the moment you see they don't belong to us you are not Hindu the moment you say create now as a religion you cannot say that politically socially economically almost sure you can say that but spiritually no religiously no you cannot so in the temple the Hindu temple all should be allowed to go if they have the devotion it should be allowed why not who are you to see another son or daughter of God no you should not come were you friends if you leave the biography of Sri Ramakrishna they will see that the one gentleman was there whose two subs Ramakrishna and he used to see others don't go to some wish to come to me I will give you this and that he never allowed many to go to see Ramakrishna and we do the people don't understand they come and they don't know they don't know so they were working with the other people we are by the same way except that then what Islam National noticed it and she said even not doing the right thing that people come to God everyone has the right to go don't do it ultimately he was removed from the earth so that is that all is it happens the Lord will remove you if you are asking other not to go to God this is a dangerous thing then I always feel in some of the temples the traditional temples they don't allow people they do they know how the God will react if the scripture is filled then this is also going to happen for sure one should not do that it is the law and this is unselfishness on the basis of which the whole edifice of Hindu religion is standing all religion in fact are standing thank you let us
