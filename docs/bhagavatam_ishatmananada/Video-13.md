[Bhagavatam 023 - A Guide to Liberation: Holy Association Develops Devotion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LegHC0f2Zxc)

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] the bhagavata is a great book that leads us to liberation it's harder when we were last time when we were studying that the Sun he was advising some the Kabila the great money he was as advising his mother Deva Beauty to have a good company wholly convening the mother at the Sun but how I will recognize who is a holy person and there we are already discussed with many other things the Kapila said that you must find the five qualities in a person who is truly only whose company whose advises with guidance will help you what are their deeksha first is the detection the must have the patient's detection in the spiritual life is full of struggle external and internal from outside people may not understand inside who is trying to develop the spiritual life particularly segregating from the other house or duties completely alone so that is why in the opposition it says structured our initiative dr. Dugan but a stucco warranty should shahara and this is a very far better results age you have to walk on that Nishita drug they are they do not know when is going to stop Durga mother is very difficult to travel and who say those who have traveled in this part of our but Andy dissing it so that is called the strategic patience is necessary a lot of patience I have taken initiation for five years over I have not realized God and this type of impatient people can never reach anywhere in the spiritual life you have to be patient how you can be patient complete faith in the words of the scripture and in the words of the Guru the master the preceptor the scriptures say that there is God and it can be real the Guru said this is the path to follow now your only duty is to follow that whether you reach over there are not doing bothered about that he will reach for sure so these two qualities are necessary to have faith that's why they say Sardar without the strata one cannot as a wonderful world the sanskrit word to later world that is called sir - Swami we began the and again he used to say sir - on our you must have that serda what is that self confidence and confidence in the words of the scripture what is the scripture Veda but the reader sees all this is you see is nothing but the consciousness and the same consciousness for the benefit of the ordinary people have taken the human form and this human form that the God has taken we call him God why he has to get the human and we have already started that the Bishnu the that consciousness is he taking the human form and then the Lord Vishnu is making him two different part one is man and one is woman all we have already studied in last classes because the devotees they cannot understand all-pervading consciousness last anyone meditate on all-pervading consciousness what he will agitate or she so that is the reason the concentration of the mind is the first and foremost thing and to help to develop that concentration the God has taken the human form that's kala pathar that is called the Vishnu the law and from him the Rama the Krishna so this you have to understand a person who has realized that after a long patience the thick Shiva Shankar Acharya he is giving the definition of the titik shah aahana son Babu kana those who understand a little bit of Sanskrit sivanna and forbearing server do kana all types of problems miseries a pretty karuppu broken without trying to solve that cinta Bennifer all he done without even thinking a lamenting oh why this thing to be neighborhood that sada teacher that is called the diksha this patient system says the first quality holy person addiction whether having this if you go and see that the only people really patient and some people externally when they are talking with the people there the show but that Vivekananda the Hebrews angry sometimes used disciples why to make them perfect but then shall we say that oh he is not addiction he is not this deeksha we have to help that we need to understand what truly it means one lady in this new year she's to serve from Vivekananda she's to stay in the other part of the park and from there after attending all her house and then she will serve the shaman in cooking he taking notes and also arranging the other things some disclose old her all the time then one day sharmaji noticed that she is crying the why you were crying but I don't understand why all the time you scold me other people at there don't do anything for you but you never say anything to them then somebody said I wanted to see you perfect that's why scold you then afterwards that lady she always expected that from eg with school because she understood that that is the expression of God I want to see you so that's why the holy people used to do like that the patients we have to understand in a different way to another that we know it was very difficult to understand though the shaman to Rihanna and the tea and other direct disciples of Raghavan surround Krishna they were sitting in the chair II have to finish is in the he was coming down it was step seeing that the open tears bench still the bench is their wooden bench and suddenly he looked at that boy and started scolding him abusing him very angrily the other Swami's were taken about he didn't do anything he finished that puja coming down then the boy was also terrified I didn't do anything what happened why the farm is behaving like this - somehow you know the naturally we like to go away to hide somewhere so he almost ran away from there then to the energy sad and the other Swami's up to sometime asked how come that you became so angry the boy didn't do anything I didn't say anything to the boy I didn't say much honey I saw a bad Atma a soul had soul trying to enter into that prematurely when he came out from the temple I was trying to protect that furniture so we do not know when the bombs are scolding why suddenly they're so pale friends we have to understand the first quality teak shower and the diction is for bearing all this it doesn't mean that all the tiling face no sometimes some people that I go see all the time smile and some people develop the habit of smiling all the time there's another problem I sometimes say if someone is smiling all the time don't believe it all the time angry don't believe in normal this okay so tickety shovel you know in our training in middle world oh my god when we now think about that tweeting how could you pass that example when you are joining the Ramakrishna region a young boy below thirty with proper education and free from all physical ailments and all men were then you can join and of course you should have be vacant and then surround energy as your ideal and then three years you can be in any centre after the two-year trip to Spain in the training centre the monastic training rigorous training but is more fun almost same he the barometer angel be there and all to have one Idol orgy that this I am going to achieve and they will give a different type of job two months two months like that two years different it sometimes you have to serve the food sometime you have to dress the positive or something cleaning the bathrooms sometimes serving the elderly people sometimes in the temple I got the temple duty in a balloon or temple if you have gone is all white marble the floor Jerry maharaja was there the the monastic members to senior swami he becomes the priest the he is to keep the white rice spreading all over now though if the white rice is over here how can you understand it's a big idiot the sanctum sanctorium is also big and then the white paste also in the sprinkle here and when you clean it and we do naturally sometimes over there see you have not done it do we take it now it's really as a physical you should have to be very very feet otherwise so difficult to clean once again first year to sleep once again then the game being so that is terrible punishment I was lucky i'ma see my pretty session he had a very difficult time but when he was handing over the charge he whispered see this show me will do I have developed a system to find out what of what the moment to enter at the page itself you lie down on the floor as if you are prostrating to God and then you look like this the floor and you can notice what is rare patience patience and patience or maybe a cup of milk and we used to take up the milk up go and bring the milk from the kitchen now you come where is this ring and then exactly on that spot so he was very very motivations the tremendous in other words you cannot be the it is difficult so the tea shop so that you passed then you go god only god you have to have a very compassionate heart feeling for each and every one friends I'm talking about the description the definition that Kapila Muni is giving about a holy person there are so many hundreds and thousands of people who claim that they're religious people but all religious people have not only person holy people we have to understand that the company of the only person must have this five qualities first the diksha ba ii Hanukkah some people are very emotional but emotional is not the Karuna Karuna the kindness is not emotional you have to understand how far I can do and how far I can help then only it is possible otherwise not so you have to understand this that internet should be there the majority people are emotional people the angry I D again see look at this that is not the way helping in such a way so that he or she can help afterwards not depending on the material dean of the people we always serve or help in such a way they become dependent on us that is very long so Karuna the garlic are that kind heartedness is completely different thing shall we be victim of the worse and all others the young people they say assalamu krishna he was taking care that their proper food is given to them exeter then one person came from outside he also said by the side of sami be bacon on that tell not even 17 18 years old young people saddam krishna came running and shouted that man no you get Torah from here not in the same line the young boy he was taken to take food no go away and apparently if you read up to that and stop if you don't know the person's ramakrishna and you will conclude oh this is the man Oh God he cannot be a good person see he came to eat he could serve no person was not good verse his character was very bad so the Guru never wanted that these people should come and mix with the young 16 17 Aires all these young people whom he was slowly slowly making up this type of association will completely destroy their mind so he was guarding them apparently action ABC or no there is no Karuna there is no love for this poor people he was having so much of celebration of food of love but that moment he was very careful like a mother mother knows the son wants to get the friendship with someone the mother said no don't go to them why the mother didn't know that they may not be trains the out of protection so we have to understand this also that Karuna and we have seen Runa the compassion the kind-hearted of Shawnee Vivekananda you know those who have read the calendar how I used to move all around here in one day he has given lecture eight ten twelve lectures on aunty in those days there was no microphone yet to shout almost to get little money why to help the poor people in our country and the people so-called educated people jealous sir these constantly they were writing the letters that he is not a true monk and he is having so many children over here was all wrong false things is to go on writing or somebody never said anything against them all these poor people know that little bit jealous no problem so like this used to go on dream so guna I love them I should go and help so we have seen these type of activities if anyone is not working at all just simply sitting how you understand whether he is having any kind heartedness or not so through the action we can understand a person a person simply quietly sitting not talking at work at all not being good person and so he does body he know he must be friendly with each and every one but this is these are my people so I will you know in the life of sister nivedita she was not that time associated with Shami become the hand his philosophy she was a just young lady just graduated and got a job and a school and the school they used to serve in one quarter in some places the mediator was very happy she's to go and serve the people one day the aboard called her and said oh those people that don't belong to discharge you should not help them visit she was taken away but they have poor it doesn't matter if they don't come to ours we are not going to help them so that is sad about the inky Nam when Shami we began the game and he gave that idea the visitor accepted and that moderate noble she left everything and came went to India to accept this ideology that is the things that body enough one day in one place they were criticizing us and they were telling the ramakrishna mission in a very tribal place I am not mentioning that area in India so they were criticizing a political people a group of people that ramakrishna mission is getting the government grant because Indo the government was also the BJP got so because of that they are getting the money and these and that and the head the state chief minister like the governor he was very critical then what to do in India you know the you cannot work without the support of the government it was a very difficult them they invited me in a program that Chief Minister also came and I could understand the Chief Minister is expressing in different way they're not very happy with us then in my talk I told that before cheapest speaks give me the opportunity so that I will explain I'll try to explain and I told them some people they do not understand the ramakrishna mission our first plan traffic work started by starving the Muslims a little Muslim girl she was crying and one of the direct disciples of Bhagwan see Ramakrishna he was passing through that path and see what happened to you I was having the only art thank God - we keep our water and by mistake I fro broken and my modern Bavarian between then what to do for me to cut to the shop and in those days you know a little money other things also - for her to eat from the started then so many other children also came and they were also baking for some food the Shami himself was having only foreigners and he was thinking to go to him mother in those days this to walk months after months to reach over there for others were sufficient and in any village you go people is to feel so foreigners all of that but he's been the whole money for feeding these poor people then law related to shaman Vivekananda what should I do these people are mostly Muslims should I serve and there are boys and girls and we are monastic people we are not supposed to take care of the girls what to do and if you have to remember it is hundred years before this is all these things are happening very Orthodox in the society Shami be back on the road back you must read the letters of swami vivekananda there are all just fires the dear Swamiji say this is the heroic work hats off to you you are doing the heroic work don't bother about the religion don't bother about the language don't bother about the sex or anything they serve them help them get to education only food or clothing on health in the vegetation so that they can stand on their own feet so that is called suita sad about the Agena yesterday one group of people they perform the durga puja and they were asking about the Kumari puja and then I mentioned shall be Vivekananda when he went to Kashmir he worship as the Muslim girl the daughter of the boat man in English we do know that people they that in the bow to this day so in the boat man and he took the permission of the father and worshiped at five years old girl should other and different names they can give the Muslim girl so that is the way we have to understand so he does salvo de nom ajatashatru her knee will feel an immediate anyone we are discussing about the quality of a holy person the firm that I am reminding you and also to me first aesthetic Shiva that is the first quality second is Garnica kindheartedness then so he deservedly he nam the friend of all or jaha Tasha true and no enemy T to anyone the in Shanta very calm and quiet and peaceful that is the only that is called Soderbergh otherwise unless and until you had having how can you become peaceful you know satisfied that is called Santa Betty this is the we utter obeyed as ashram suburban Siddhanta starts that person to go away see the atharvaveda it says who Naraka what is the hell asking the question and in reply dr. Guevara stealing or shut some sorry we shall some cerca even Erica I went to attend one program interfaith program they were discussing about the hell and heaven at work this is the hell they don't think that the place only is the people start assert that is a very very selfish some sorry who is thinking this world as the permanent fishery the same thing some solid official his companion even Erica I have seen very rich people but they will ask the other people to work the poor people they come from different places only for little money and this is influential person lasted to work and after that suddenly he will go and complain to the police they have done this they have done that and removed them so that you need not pay them my dad who is having the manner if you take the that company his company if you go and if you take the help from him or develop friendship with this type of person is another part you are going to be in great difficulty for sure so we have to understand who will help us you have to understand you have to judge and there are some people holy people the developer sends anyone coming very near the immediately can understand that this is not a good person a great person like Xiaomi we become the his mind was so broad and anyone coming anything they are doing all accepted as Robin do not take a toll everything is positive and nothing negative in Swami ji shall we be vacant under the head be bigger and in conversation with his disciple some ashish and bothers a very good book the dialogue between the disciple and the master there he mentioned nowadays if any bad person is coming I get the bad smell can you imagine selfish person is called also some solid officially and their company if you are sitting with them talking with them that is called America but sometimes there is you cannot avoid so what we should do we know that person is very bad but the situation is such we must have to have some hello and hi with that person that much only don't get involved so that is called as a solution of a very selfish person not the society means anyone having the children and the family no Paula Manson ambition is to go and steal and take food and in some studies houses in Calcutta more than 100 times he visited person's house so not natural it is not mentioning that and sometimes some people wish to come and stand in his room after that person leg is to sprinting the Ganga water on their spot so we have to understand atharvaveda very clearly mentioned could not recover what is that el-assad samsara be shy some sirga cool sharra Ferger here what is that the heaven then he said such Sangha sagar the company of the holy person is the heaven they will never cheat you they will never betray you rather they will try to help you always cooperate with you encourage you the debt is called sub Sangha holy people unselfish people the honest love so this we have to understand and there is a beautiful sayings need to bother the Guru T the unholy people they only say they never do now we know a lot of people they were saying like that suja na na patottie karate Eva but the holy people they don't say hey I'm going to help you in this a neighbor but they do that and previously the young people in our society dares to remember this type of the quotations so that they can understand niju unholy people they say but they do not do what they say neech of auditing Nakuru team susana the holy people know but the thing they don't see karate Abel but they do sadhunam darshanam putnam so this is the question of the mother was how the holy company are trusting how to understand the holy person and how the holy company is going to help me and we find in the wrong to read manners you know that book that Bashar me to sidarsky he wrote the whole bride Rafi of three-alarm agenda is very famous this Rancher it man has saved Hinduism from the onslaught of the Islam and in that eleven twelve thirteen century the people they used to go on chanting this book and to keep their mind at their be news at the Sanger Niharika table and the RAM turret manners they chant like this be news of the Sangha Nevada gotta weed out the companion of the holy people you don't listen to the words of God will speak about the God unless and until you are in the company of the holy people they Hibino move on a job without listening to the words of God how the delusion that you are in will be notes at the Sanger Nevada kata the Hibino movin up our Mujahideen oorah mother without Eva free from delusion how you can think about the Sri Ramachandra he's a God who has knowledge under his chosen Knightley was ramachandra guha guy he knew da hua Luo here you don't know but if I had chanted these in the with rockin or in the u p CR Balarama Chandra T they would have shouted so this is without anybody company you don't hear the words of God's not discussion about God and we thought that delusion and without the removal of the delusion that cannot be true devotion the frames the what is this true devotion that the mother never the master son in the thoughts Condor 25th chapter 28 verse of the father whether she is asking gachi atopic tt3 she maharaja what is the nature of the true devotion and how I understand that God children 3 who cheat our work the ochita means the true devotion perfect devotion so we have the devotion devotion is nothing but love but when the love [Music] associated with attachment that brings the bondage the love without attachment that gives nothing it is only love we love but we are not attached could that is the mother they wrote is asking Koch it tween wichita bhakti ki 3 she woman butcher ah how I will understand that realize that in reply Kapila Muni is doing this is the same scandal chapter but the vs. 32nd 32d bonham guna Linga now honest Rebecca karamaneh swapped a week mana so pretty Saba Vicki - ah unnie Mitte Parvati bhakti city greasy so he is telling when all the powers of man senses here the Deva Deva usually is God but here the Deva means you senses why the Saints is called Deva because it reveals the Deva Deva means that which reveals in all our senses we have five senses the eyes the ear the nose the touch and the tongue disco theme on this is the sometimes is little complicated for the people not knowing the sensory particularly they use the same word for different meaning d VAR na hoona ningún on the evil are learning when all the powers of the mains senses we should generally go away through external objects the vaniville our we know that we try to control try to meditate our eyeballs constantly move though we have closed our eyes it goes on moving that means the eyelids and not at all satisfied the thing that we were trying to do why you are meditating open up let us see so many things are happening all around so this goes on and then the ear is constantly hearing so many different type of sounds and the moment can hear the sound immediately you start thinking what is happening you hear someone just honking over them what happened okay why he's honking it is inside the campus or outside on the road like that just one sound mix your mind start thinking so let me be Sol decal reveal so they ever thought they were you have to control that generally go up not that he was sending it on but by nature it goes out are purified through practices prescribed in the scripture arnica kahramana anesthetic Armada means prescribe the scripture what the scripture says you must get up in the morning and then go and have little devotion sure practice some meditation like that like that all scripture is telling so that way when you are practicing closing your eyes and then trying to concentrate so by that way slowly slowly South political leaders like that Prime Minister presidents you can imagine the difficulties in their lives when they go we see in all the time they're having the separate fly of plane and so many things but we have to understand the responsibility that is on their field and they're so busy I knew a person in India and ninety 11 o'clock he returned from his office then took a cup of tea and came back up to 2 o'clock his resident official continued again in the morning as together so many things are going on unless you do these you are not important and in the political field you have to be important so that way also what he used to do is to meditate he told me family it was difficult to sleep but somehow I sleep for 2-3 hours and then before going for any work I take the shower and then safer meditate for half an hour and that gives me tremendous energy so this is that you have to purify your senses out through meditation and get naturally concentrated on Ishwara then when you are controlling your senses which are going out to the sense objects you all the senses are getting purified why this is a very special thing that the other the Indian philosophy the same when your mind which is the main source of all the senses are free from the worldly objects it is purified the purification means this only and naturally concentrated on each other Sakthi Safavieh karate yoga Manasa the concentrated without any motivation or Namita namida no namida without a motivation this is the bhagavata they are talking about the bhakti the whole book is sexy this is the book of devotion and what is the devotion withdrawing your senses from the external objects concentrating it on one object which is God of your choice any god or goddess and there should not have any desire to do that or limited without any more deal then it is called devotion I see today sometimes some people that will come and they use it over here I've seen people crying and praying for hours connect devotion no because something happened now they are coming and trying to get some solace from the God concentrating on God good but that is not devotion why there's a mati what is that material I have some problem oh god please solve that problem so that is the multi I am having this trouble please make me free from that trouble that is the mountain so we doubt any more till the property you are having their prayer itsuki and one should do that that's okay but you cannot define the and I must be having 70 No so the water the devotion is withdrawing the census from the same and concentrating on the object is God Ishwara and at the same time you should not have any limiter then Coppola added a world that is very interesting tsaah City a greasy greasy and he see in 33rd worse thing that in India there are two flows constant in the spiritual world goes one goes for multi emancipation liberation and another gospel octi the devotion this is the devotional and here the Kapila was a gaining who was the man of knowledge he is telling this type of devotion love 100% love without any motive is greater than the Mukti and a group of people those who follow they have developed particularly this radha and that krishna the devotion and there's a copies copies and copies the boys of the girls foolish to play with Shri Krishna this gopi knees they were illiterate ladies but they had a great love for Krishna the one person came would double he was a man of knowledge he given hey why you were crying for Krishna do you think Krishna means that person Krishna is all-pervading and all that he gave a lecture on the knowledge after listening to that the Gopi nice tour like to listen to you we do stop you in between because you are telling with all in a notch okay but we are not going to accept your words why we want only Krishna we love that's all we don't bother about the heaven we don't bother about the emancipation we don't know anything we only want to love the God that is green Raghavan still on occasion is also telling the heck is called good tea table of the highest taken love LA without any any other material just they love you and sunny be with them to say love knows no barter exchange in butter means exchange that that in olden days I used to sell this thing and then I used to take from you that that's cool barter no exchange is nothing I love you God in exchange I don't want anything now if we take the boat how many people who lose the hell no it's very very difficult realist of the rear and further the Camellia mentioned that yeah ocean a huge area tea but don't worry quotient quotient means our single unit that care three different bodies inside one in the gross body rot which we know from and a subtle body that the Hindu philosophy they say there is a subtle bodies there and Cardinal body causal body so there are three cause of mister cause what is the cause I want that that is the first cause the idea comes then I start forming that slowly now an idea has come into my mind if we can start one online school coaching about different religions and when we speak about religion we speak only about the philosophy not about the background and what is that background you must be having a history geography social condition economical condition then this religion has come otherwise it is very difficult not the Semitic religion all the three semitic religion in one place the group that Judaism's ooh that is rahim and the christianity and islam if you notice each and every one of them they like to get go out of the misery so the conception is ever some people are telling that we will lead you to at the land of milk and honey and some people are telling that we will take you to give you the mukthi because they were oppressed by the Roman tyranny but it little away from the earth Indian Peninsula they never talk about that their religion completely different they are searching for the heart man the one who created these exists except why so there must be having social because in India the fertile land there's a very good with the the Kings were there and there was a check and balance by the king and the Buddha heats all those things of the beautiful society was the heir to the religion that grew completely very - as Africa and they never talked about this not don't tell the lies and these that nowadays of course we have to tell because it has gone down and according to the situation in our mikhyl political social sooo wheel now the tortoise come though through the thought cardinal fiscal car dementia leader is the causal body now I'm trying some people will be able to do this and not that the egoistically but with their to serve the others to help others so that is another going on that is sukshma sharir it has certain things are going on then finally maybe by the grace of the Divine Mother a person will come and donate the land the money will come proper teachers will come then we will start that program and it will be all over the students will come that's called the gross body so this key body and similarly we have now we see this gross body Wishart Melinda the gross body people know this but why this body why why this active having something previously so God and the group he says here your but something will be burned if you have this devotion the subtle body is not there then you have three your moved up so that indirectly he said capillary said yeah this type of devotion yum is that that devotion ocean ocean means subtle body causal body lotion are to immediately charity burned and they destroy that so after the death even Mars with God and what is that subtle body just to mention now this this body physical body you know that we are having puncher kosha right you know that that the puncher who should the five different states Annamayya monomania pranamaya with Gianna Maya anandamaya kosha these that they don't think only this much use have it of course if the you go to a medical hospital and ask them to find out the plan of Maya and the began Amaya they won't be able to but if you come to us we can prove it so under my arm one whom I am prana we have big Gianna Maya and anandamaya kosha this is called his body then inside that they are there is also a book it gives the definition of subtor Abba Abba sup tada Abhaya verse after - I mean 17 Abba ABBA means shalida and it is subtle what are the seven things bunch of prana is so difficult the Hinduism the God is there here in between at the scene and no not that like that you have to know so many things and we do not do much good about ourselves we do this body it is in name and my father my mother not like this this puncher kosha and then it goes to punch iranian prana sudan Samana the like that the bunch of prana the skull force which is skipping our body intact then mana we know about this manner the mind then the booty the intellect and Dasha andreas holding rears their subtle up when chickaleta in sanskrit terminology ah when chicken chicken means mixed up it's not mixed so it is all circle and - Russia in real we know the five plus five thirteen and this booty and mana - with 12 plus punchy prana 5:17 so this is called the that will be birth and in the Bible we find a wonderful statement I don't know whether those who are reading the back we will be able to will explain these sentence here it says to know the love of Christ which passeth knowledge that ye might be filled with all the fullness of God to know the love of Christ Christ is God and God is full of love and love without any boundary without any reservation that is love so show me be big and also do a gift nation what is God Aled OBE and that was personification of Ramakrishna personified Jesus also the same love so if you like to know that Jesus the love of Jesus you have to pass through the knowledge pass it through the knowledge the white knowledge because how Jesus came the Son of God and all this but when you were going to and reaching to that that he might be filled with all the fullness of God you will be transformed into God so that copy the money also say if you have control your senses and then concentrate it on God then we doubt any hankering or any prayer only for the lovesick then you become God yourself here we also find in Bhagavad saddam additional society this love for God makes one forget the whole world even his own body and true devotee loves God from love sake sorry we become the same love for love's sake I go to Temple if the authorities are giving attention to me this is not the love of God I go to Temple because I love I go and serve and then that we should get the recognition that I am doing this and then some people will bring the donation sleep my grandfather donated this mizuna so give that so that is not the devotion the devotion is completely other thing scientists again said longing is like rosy dawn we've concluded this when you are loving God feeling love for God longing longing this tremendous judgment and to get that particular person or the God or the ideology is like rosy dawn after the dawn out comes the Sun longing is followed by vision God so the devotion the longing and immense love for God is only the dawn and be sure the Sun is going to come the vision of God occurred after peal however they gave me find some endowed with such bhakti do not aspire for moksha even the oneness with might be friendly from the next Sunday this is the devotion and this is the quality of a holy person but apart from these the Kapila is giving us a excellent philosophy I know this is God I know this is the devotee then this relation okay but where from all this game why these so he is going to give us the philosophy that philosophy maybe we will take two three Sunday's to discuss the Kapila philosophy so let us conclude with this total young Rama [Music] Bowden Andromeda student Eve deeply stop i'ii be the song but the grammar punishes a guarantee young saga the honesty that the Catena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah yes john Tanabe do [Music] Sudama pseudonym the buyer this mean [Music] Oh bees bees bees please have some Prashad when you
