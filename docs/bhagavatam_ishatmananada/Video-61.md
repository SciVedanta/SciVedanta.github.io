[Bhagavatam 055 : Parting Advices Of Krishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5TYwoT45PM)

good morning today we will begin as usual by chanting that mantra who speaks about the all-pervading God was taking the form and creating sustaining destroying so let us charge Shaunta bhujangasana but the moon our solution vishwanadham Goggin Assad regime made her burnham shavonda Laxmi condom Kamala nam Yugi beat yharnam Bundy Vishnu harem Ceravolo clicker Nam today we will begin the parting message of Yvonne Shri Krishna now before that this pedometer we know is a wonderful book and it's the authority of devotion authoritative on devotion so the bhagavata but at the same time those who have attained in this class are listening to these discourses and rate the bhagavata you know that there is also a lot of Jana so this bhagavata also teaches knowledge that Jana bhagavata is a piranha you know we have the in Indian systems the et Harsha purana and then Upanishad then bhagavad-gita and lot of the scriptures the Puranas are 18 in total in number bhagavata is a piranha what is speciality we have already discussed about it just to remind the Puranas main purpose is to polarize the boy dick truths that is one has become many but this is very unique one has become many this is the teaching of the Upanishad of the reader he come cert one is only there and nothing else again and again and again it's a and there is only one and that has become many when we say that there is only one there is no confusion there's no problem but the moment we say one has become many then the question comes that means that one no more there then we answer no it is as it is there so again the confusion if the one out of which all these things have come how can it remain as one and that is the Hinduism today will tell you in different way and the Phoenicians and others they will tell you that give you all the examples and here comes the Puranas through the stories they will tell you the same truth to the stories so that is the speciality of the purana see Ramakrishna wonderfully in his the words of Ramakrishna he said how is this Puranas he said it is fried in the barter of Guiana the soaked in the syrup of bhakti so these two things soaked in the syrup of bhakti fried in the batter of ghana truth directly coming from the Phoenicians that is completely different but truth coming learning from the Puranas differently so the people they like to read Puranas they like to know the Puranas and bhagavata is one of the best one so we were reading the bhagavata and we have come almost to the conclusion I kept this particular portion at the end though it comes in the eleven scandal and in the sixth chapter the Sri Krishna he is giving up his body after 125 years of living Sri Krishna lived 125 years and then after completing his mission he is going back so that is the scenario so this bhagavata I kept this particular portion of the burger but I kept in the lane because this is the parting messages absolutely Schnur and we have read the advices of the Naga yogi those who are regular students you know it the nine brothers they were the sons of the burrata and the one King was asking them different questions each question was answered by one brother sir Nava yogi the nine Yogi's they have replied the wonderful questions when we have learned so many things from there about the spirituality and also recently we have completed the experiences of the Tatra Avadhuta completely different never care for anything whether people will criticize or people will accept nothing like that whatever he realized he said how can you ask me to worship Shiva because I'm the Shiva miser he said and that is in Naga but that is also in the bhagavata and he said directly this Avadhuta is also coming that is also in the bhagavata and we have also read that advises the teachings of the son to his mother the Kapila and to his mother day Babu team so Dave abuti was asking question and she was asking how to get liberation then the son was a great sage who as the Vishnu himself so he gave the advices all that we have already started now today from today we will study these eleven scandal and from check chapter six to twenty nine from six to twenty nine chapter of the eleven scandal the Turkish condom is booked they say in English and this entire chapter from six to twenty nine that is the wonderful conversation between Bhagwan Shree Krishna and his friend and follower Buddha so this we will begin but it begins with the description of the sugar I think you have not forgotten the sugar the whole thing started with the sugar and sugar is the son of the Vyasa and rasa is the composer of the bhagavata so after composing the whole thing he taught it to his own son sugar and then shook her he went to meet a king who was curse of death for these seven days the king was waiting for the death but he was a just king and he was a great person so obviously this sugar he went to him and the king in those days days to always ask the Rishi's please tell me some spiritual thing so that I will remember and go and the only thing was all the time everywhere how to get liberation not to how to become more rich how to do this now how to get liberation and when Shami Vivek and is telling again and again if you want to get liberation you have to come to this country because here it is only in this country they always talk about the liberation Mukti mob they not swagger not going to heaven not only going to any God complete liberation that is the Swami Vivekananda say this is the thermo Bhoomi and karma Bhumi you have to work hard what is this work work is understanding the reality what is the reality I am that one from where everything has come so we'll come slowly how the things are coming so here it says like this now the Schuch he is giving the description and he is telling Krishna decided to go but why to look at it the before we go to that their conversation I just like to remind you most of you have read already that all these yada was they became very very proud why they become very strong very powerful very wealthy and what happened ego but for whom they got the success with a bond Krishna but they forgot that that is very peculiar they forgot that always it happened always it happened the person who come and guide then they are leading that particular community of the society and then they forget why again the ego calm well from the ego come from that God gave why the God is given the ego to continue the plane this is very peculiar so the god we will hear we will listen how he is giving the teaching to the hood double because whatever was very much attached to him devoted to him whatever neighbor wanted anything else whatever was also a yoga ba the other by means of that clan of the same family but who told I only want you and then his advice was completely different what is Java the deed they were very very egoistic and they used to drink a lot and there's naturally after drinking you cannot control your mind obviously all these things got happening and one day a group of young the other words they were wandering in the streets then the Rishi's who came to the tour car the capital and the abode of Krishna that they came over there they performed the yuckiest but the young people they were never liked so all through all this is happening the ignorance means they do not understand they do not get the proper teaching - that is the problem the younger generation yesterday I was in Huntsville and I came to a temple after the top the temple Authority those people they came the president and the Acting Secretary the elderly people they came sharmaji they were asking we have made this temple for the betterment of our children but the children don't come the younger generation are not coming that what will happen I told I am going to purchase a church when they come constructed the chart started the church they were thinking it will continue the same thing happened the younger generation is not coming so they are selling it to us now we are purchasing after some time we will also search for the people to continue and then maybe they will sell it to the Buddhists so like this is a good thing we do not know so it goes on like this why because if the culture is not going through the generation then it is a great great difficulty so this Hindus they are now here constructing the temple why after spending millions of dollars because they are thinking their children will come and learn this culture but they are not interested then I told they are not interested because you don't explain you bring them and force them to lie down over the air and the is that they won't understand you have to make them understand they should love it back in country in our age in our generation whatever the senior said whether we liked it or not we follow so that was the norm you must have to pita genic idea feel be patron in a sunnah yeah he but could you then the gob father has said and the son has not listened to it it is not possible that would absurd in our society why that was the tradition now the Sun is telly I'd like to listen to you but explain but the father never learned father only followed so here comes the Swami Vivekananda see Ramakrishna's they are explaining it so what is this explanation the hood Thaba he is coming but before that this sukadeva is giving the description now this Rishi's who assembled over there and they were trade Rishi's holy people they came to celebrate and perform on puja after the puja they were going back this young people and among them was Shambo Shambo is a very famous character and he was at the brothers son of krishna krishna's brother's son Shambo and the Shankar and other frames they were making fun when they saw the Rishi they dressed samba as a lady woman pregnant woman and to that samba to the Rishi's a you are all great people you can read the future and all past isn't it Patricia's understood these people are going to do something wrong then they asked can him say this pregnant woman whether he is going to deliver a son or a daughter they became very angry des rouges and he told no this mel lady is going to produce the depth for you all people and it happened the shamba from his body came at the iron the different type of iron and is almost like that arrows did he became afraid the rishi stole the same this thing so they went on breaking those arrows and the small small pieces and when they could break the all the arrows they were very happy now nothing is going to happen so they threw it to the river but it floated came to the shore and grew up as the crosses but very hard grasses now one day all these people waiting for a picnic the holy other a clan they all went over the earth merrymaking they were drinking swimming and obviously fighting among themselves they're all strong so when they started fighting they took up just pull those grasses not thinking that grass can kill people they started beating each other by that way they started killing each other and when one was dead the other took the revenge by that with the whole Riyad of a clan particularly the younger generation all they were killed about the earth krishna was present but into anything krishna's clan is the other verse Krishna was bought born in the yard of a clan but didn't say anything from here we should learn God will be with us if we are good even when we God has taken birth in our family if we are not good the God won't be with us so that is leading Krishna didn't say anything rather he prepared to depart so that is the scenario so when all these things happen Krishna decided to give up his body and then all the gods and how they are coming sir his Brahma along with Shiva Devers prajapati's and Brahma sons sanaka sananda sanatana sanat-kumara these are the four the sunset bro and they came to meet the one Shri Krishna who was Vishnu himself Vishnu incarnated as Krishna sugar is going on describing not only the Brahma and Shiva that the other cars like the Indra Muruga Muruga means they are super human beings and Adak tears pursues Reuters if you go to Hindu temple you will find there are some oddities then the pursues that keep all these images the auditors pursues and the rooters the all they are highly exalted character and spiritually but not liberated self but there they are through their practices they have reached up to that including in the origin then comes the Condor Silvia rishi and all created beings they all cat gathered to pay their respect to Shri Krishna at Dwarka so this Dwarka is a historical thing still the people they have found that the worker submerged in the ocean and now the distance becomes so easy so it is there a big city under the ocean so this Dwarka is there krishna was also historical figure so this thing happened the lord vishnu who took the form of sri krishna now that the aim time of this incarnation as krishna came so all creative beings they came to pay their respect and they saved the God's telling nataas mati not bother our Windom t indriya prana mano bacio be he I'm quoting only one line and that is from the eleven scan the six chapter 7 verse one line there are two two lines not as nothing not not amines Oh Lord we are bowing down surrendering to you Badar Windom we are surrendering at your feet how they are saying but the this these are the few words we must notice they say we are surrendering to you O Lord because you have created us and how your surrendering booty in the earth prana mono watch over here but the means the intellect the human being become either successful or failure because of this intellect isn't it that those who are sharp intellect they can understand things and they can understand and then immediately can come and they become very great leaders there are so many thousands of all words are there but what is this leader leader can see what is going to happen in future and at the same time how it is but the intellect he's that particular intellect what is the scientist so many thousands millions are reading the science but some only become very famous why but they again so this is the booty so who gave the good the Lord Lord God gave me the booty so I am surrendering it to him so one person he became very rich this Rockefeller and he was very proud also he was earning a lot of money then one day he came to know from his frame that there is a yogi a monk has come he's also very famous now Swami be makin the he was in Chicago so the vital let us go and meet him and did some curiosity so let us go and see she went and when they were conversing and they were introduced easy fabulously rich man a billionaire in those days then the Swamiji told do you keep charity some money to others for the help of the poor why should I I earned my money and because of my intellect I could do the great business and why should I use that money for those the fellows who couldn't do it perhaps sharmaji are good who gave you the booty this intellect god forbid maybe tomorrow morning when you get up you lose all the thinking capacity what will happen to you then he understood the point so after seven days he came back and he gave a receipt he gave us some money to the church and he said now you can thank me we are sharmaji and Shami she said you should thank me because I saved you from the hell so like this we should understand whose booty whose intellect is this and you know that booty means those who have already read to Shankar Acharya spiritual Romani he is giving all the descriptions definitions this is nothing but the reflection the Supreme Being reflection it's not original even in the reflection we are so big think of it when you truly go and margin that supreme so that is that the reflection in the booty so they say with thee and the booty is working through what engineers what are the increase all our sense organs the intellect that is asking these inner ears to go and inquire so the eye is going out here is listening smell touch taste everything is working because the body if that is not there then even if these organs are there in my body it is of no use so the first is the beauty then India Indra means all the Russia India they retain in the layers of the earth then prana the vital force in the mana mana means the our storehouse here the storehouse mind means the store and then Bachchu me through the words this is really really very important we do not learn how to use the words those who are great orators what do they do only words they don't give anything you don't do anything but just through the words they must memorize the thousands of people isn't it the that is called the bodger the words are very very important so powerful and this who gave from the Gordon Lee so we are thankful to the God the other day one young lady came from the nearby college they are learning the comparative religion so maybe their teacher asked them to go and collect information from without the society she came attended about this but she immediately noticed all everything why are so many different type of the religious symbols of their white good three is there because you are Hindu and who is that like this like she was asking and then she was asking the one young man he was doing showing the light and these what a good is that that is oddity and then I explained that artyom the deceased are the only five things at there five elements out of which everything has been made and that five things at the fire then the air then the art water and the eater that it that is we are showing a symbol the fire with puncher the Agni or one fire like this like this the RT why do we do it because God has created everything we are also made of those five things so now I am surrendering those to God and thanking him that much and nothing else that is the only thing here also we find when we come and give salute can we give all this booty indriyaih prana mano barge over here mostly you will notice the people from the southern India the southern part of India when they come they will never offer pranaam like this they will lie down and this make their hand straight they will touch their forehead then the chest then the thigh then the lake that is called astanga pranam Ashtanga ostomies 8-under means the leaves so all these ate leaves Oh God it is your gift I am only having this so I give it to you so what they doing or stronger first is the hands have you ever seen our read our she's doing something on a Stanga Branagh that is very unique results will never touch the floor he was somehow somehow a little so he will do and then immediately will get up why because he has not learned it he doesn't know the meaning of it so that is trying to do in the Hindu way he's an American gentleman is a long long time devotee and all alone looking after our property over there in the Ganges so whole devotees are grateful to him but he's an American born I mean he'd never learned it this is a stronger but he liked to do it most of us even the southern people who are doing over here you ask why you're doing it now my father asked me when I was young kid so it has become a habit so just be having but why we do was done the prana that is devotion what is this devotion faith and understanding and what is the faith God alone is there and I am here is nothing but the reflection of the same God reflection of the same God so I should not boast for my strong body or my mind or my intellect so it says both the hands that should be stretched today you can practice I can show you so this is both the hands the stretching the floor then second leaks and that heart that means the whole body then the head the eyes then the thighs should also be there and mind and speech the Ashtanga why the mind when you were dream like this you're sleeping the beautiful very cold well you can when I was a very young kid my father used to ask me to do that and that was a great time for me after the the play we used to come tired and father to go and do that a strong the prana and very obedient son I used to do and then sleep then most of the time they will pick me out like this oh my god we have send you to do pranaam and you are sleeping but that way when you were doing your forehead should touch then the your heart should just you touch then tie then the legs in the hand and mind mind also go and along with that speech I surrender Dao to you I surrender me to doubts under me to you so that should be the speech this is called Ashtanga the wane we do that along with the devotion there is a knowledge behind what is that knowledge God alone is there and all these creations are nothing so that again that eight verse it says o invincible one now look at it all the gods have come assembled over there and now they are worshiping the Krishna and how they are addressing the Krishna this is very important very evenly important very interesting also they are separate gods are separate not Krishna in a human form but they know this in human form is the Supreme Being so they are coming and telling all invincible one through the high Maya with three gunas what is this Maya power of God what is that power three qualities what are the three qualities satrajit AMA to understand the whole thing again and again you have to recalculate and keep your mind alert to understand this the moment they say Maya Amy Y yay what does it mean Maya means the power of God what is the power of God only three qualities what these three qualities are doing along with these three qualities there another two power is there one is covering and superimposing these are the five actions all the time they do the Maya so the Maya through Maya the bhagavata is a book of devotion brother Bert are teaching us to worship a personal God and in the bhagavata we find the gods who are worshiping the supreme God in the form of Krishna they are saying like this oh the supreme one truth I Maya you have created maintain and destroy DS unthinkable universe but these activities do not touch thee in one two sentence or two lines only they are explaining everything these activities do not touch D you always remain immersed in the unobstructed bliss of the self so they are making this prayer to the God the way I am going to God I know who these goddess so that is called bhakti but bhakti back to it Gannon if the bhakti is not back to it supported with the knowledge what it becomes very narrow sectarian egoistic and then this devotion become a problem for the human society because of these narrow misunderstanding about the God this whole world it has seen in the pages of the history how many times in the name of religion people have killed each other why they were not understanding that at the back of it what is this God God is something which cannot be destroyed the first thing it is eternal if we do not accept these then obviously we are going to think something which is limited if anything is limited it cannot give us the supreme thing limit anything limited going to be destroyed so that means we have to think God is going to be destroyed God is going to die it cannot be so that is fast so that's why they are telling you are invincible you are no one can conquer you and you are all-pervading but you are creating sustaining destroying so all these three things are happening how through Maya this is not Shankar Acharya Shankar Acharya used the same fallacy Aarti Shankar Acharya use the same fallacy but this is not the Shankar Acharya the other devotees they have come to make the king the king is the Krishna and they are telling you are dead but the second line when they say though you have created these you are not affected by this why then every sentence as a philosophy that's that is the cause of the philosophy philosophy always explained if the God is affected by the creation then obviously as we are they'd buy so many things so obviously we suffer and when we suffer the naturally that proves that we are not getting something which you wanted the one after another it goes that means we have a desire unsatisfied desire bring misery suffering if the God is also having the same thing oh I created these sanaka sananda sanatana they are not listening to me so naturally they're like your father the children are not listening to the father father is suffering if the God is also suffering can you be God No so obviously philosophical it is impossible so they are killing in two lines though you have created it you have created through Maya and what is this Maya just like magic just like magic the magician he is creating so many things he is creating money you know is going on pouring money going on pouring it for the poor man poor man the magician is going to arm that money if it could produce so much of money just from nothing why is going to arm that money from others magic so this magic proves it tease the ever at the same time it is not there and this is nothing but the Maya so the luck will kill of luck will kill at they'll be telling in them there there's also village magicians you'll be saying the Pelkey means Maya and they'll be going on showing something slowly slowly your mind is attracted to that and they will do something else so this way they are are people are really really entertained and they don't understand how it is possible but it is everything is nothing but just game so this is called Maya friends is it possible for us now to understand everything that is happening all Maya know I cannot think that you mean all these are nothing but the same soul I cannot think that whatever is happening is just like that magicians magic and nothing else but why we cannot because the ego again another thing as entered into us that is the ego so the Maya when it is individually reflecting that is called ego each and every individual are separate because of the ego to brothers sisters father mother all are different because of this ego individual ego but what is this eventually if we sit and analyze we won't be able to find out the ego but know why he talked to me like that dad we am fighting I am angry because of that why he talked to me like what is this me so completely if we go just like a scientist each and everything immediately if you analyze you will find it there is no gain to this and ultimately the result will be a complete zero nothing is there but whole life and generation after generation we are fighting like that whole life we are doing like that so this is called the Maya so who is the creator of the Maya God himself so that this they have done and they are worshipping God and they are telling like this this is the sukkah is explaining that all the Devas they came and they were telling like can we find going on telling all these may they feed contribute to our welfare now there on 14th verse this the gods are telling I have not come to this food double whatever is completely different way his approach is completely different so he will learn it this is only there as an introduction to that great scripture would the vaquita gita means again the conversation between who tava and the Sri Krishna so that we will enter it says that you are the you're our all will fare is coming from you thou are the supreme being thou are the time and you are beyond the prakruti and purusa in one verse they keep the whole philosophy so this is the problem when you read only purchase one with Davo gita and try to read that takes you to different philosophy the purusa and prakruti nearly two words what is this purusa and prakruti the Sanka and who is the founder of the Sanka then Kapila so it goes in this way so have to have some basic knowledge of philosophies also particularly this shank a philosophy and Vedanta philosophy then only it is possible to understand the Sangha and Vedanta the most modern philosophy and so they explain what is this property everything that you see and what is the pollution and this purusa they say there again they say prakruti and purusa in the chancre phraseology and the prakruti corresponds to certain vital differences to the objective of daughter advaita vedanta purusa is the g bar the individual soul so you are beyond purusa and prakruti prakruti is that creation and purusa that giba the individual soul you are beyond that though you have created this that telling like this under whose we are the Brahma and all other embodied beings even the Brahma the first ball that it was all there who fight mutually like an to Bullock's etc so they say that God you are the creator and you are the supreme even the Brahma who is the fast board the moment you say the firstborn it comes where from this thing came in the Bhagavata we find it says that God divided himself into three parts and one became a de teba another became a devotee and third one became a Trotman so Adi Deva a devotee and at Dartmouth this three separately it became who got himself developed then sometimes it says is a he became a male and a female together so sometimes you'll find the images in India so they also so he himself the God him so I should not say he eat the consciousness the dad divided it in three different parts and that is the main idea and it says son mutters - Geronimo purushu then we are bowing down to you and then it says that the gods and I will skip to all these when it comes to you have placed the religion in the hands of the virtuous now the finally the gods are telling to Krishna dharmasya star peterson to sector son sunday issue wait they are get discharged tissue big shipped serb a locum of ha each and every locals are look everywhere they have learned about you Oh Krishna the two words they are telling you have given the dharma righteousness in the hands of those who are really righteous those who have realized it so you have given that in their hand so it will continue along with that your fame it has reached every nook and corner Krishna is a very popular car and they say if you repeat the name of the Krishna that is sufficient when that hour hour time came when the Muslims they were the Islamic the ruler they came and they were controlling the all over the India so in different parts of India to continue this sanatana dharma different dharma guru scheme and they were telling in this way in the eastern part came to a tune about Prabhu and the Shaitan looma Prabhu to save the ordinary people go and meditate do these do that it was there's no time for them they were under the subjugation they were so tortured by people don't he said just repeat the name of God hari krishna krishna krishna krishna are you reading that's all the krishna you please take my responsibilities that god let's say this is the belief this is the field and faith based on realization so here here the gods are telling could still guilty and your name it has reached everywhere cerebral local everywhere your name is reached if you read different scripture in those days so that there is a doubt about the historicity of sri ramachandra some people the doubt but about the krishna no doubt why because there are so many examples of there about the krishna even the greeks win the game they were also mentioning in record not properly like the B vehicle and the they could not pronounce or write properly the Hindu the Hindu like that D weapon look at doing same way the Krishna's but he mentioned it but distich all these different places so here dimension everywhere Oh Lord a hundred and twenty five years we have passed over here now it is time for you to leave who is telling the gods gods approach is from the knowledge but when the would Taba is coming he told no I cannot leave you because the love gods came you are the per being who created everything through Maya now you have given the guidance now 125 years is a long time you can better go back goddess are telling to Krishna this is a another one approach but when the wouldthe he is approaching the god from his love how can I survive without you my love that was his so today I don't know that we will be able to reach he says these you are you were the fit person they say you are the fit person now sweeper gabon is telling I have already decided that whatever you have saved I have done what the gods wanted me to do I have finished your entire work now I am going back so what is this is a mission the avatar they come with a mission what is that mission stop acharya dharmasya to establish the dharma the great soul they are not about others they are great soul they have tried to control the maya try to understand the maya and then they have overcome the Maya and to some extent they had realized the truth today they're great Souls but when the Avatar accounts there's the power of God only God so obviously everything under control but he is coming and taking the human form for what for these mission is over so Krishna is going back and these things are happening suka is giving the description and in here we find suka he is telling in the 37 verse and for 39 verse 40 41 would ever ever devoted to Krishna approves the lord of the world rulers or now hood the way is coming and sugar they were giving that description he heard all the conversation memorized that conversation and he told this to everyone sometimes some people they pulled out when the conversation is going on is it possible to memorize everything I will conclude by telling you a very ordinary brahmana in Calcutta he was very truthful and he practiced austerity brahmacharya and he developed a tremendous unique the mental power he could remember anything and everything so one day so happened the one lady the British lady came to that particular place of the Ganga where this man was bathing and another two people came both are British and they started fighting between them and the lady was there and this Tullio gentleman they were fighting all they were talking in English and this brahmana he was not knowing English at all he was little the distance west here he was changing his clothes after the bathing just listening that's all not that attentively he was listening but he was the only person over there when these things was happening then one person made the other man and this thing happened it went to the court and the police was inquiring whether there was anyone the witness and they came to know about this brahmana the police told you had to come to the court he went to the court and the way the British judge asked him you had the will I was there so have you seen this judge never expected that if he will say those things what they were conversing team talking they say you have seen this I have seen this who bet that this is the first man with the second man then the second man like this and do can you say some which they were fighting this is the point he went on telling I don't understand English but I can tell you this man was telling this this man was telling this continuously he waved on him that from this memory the conversation and hot exchange of words in English and you know that when the British or American they are talking to us particularly Indians from India those were born over here they not understand but the Indians from India we can understand when they we can say lowered down their pronunciation then only it is possible for us to understand otherwise when they talk between them are among them we don't and in our language also when you are talking about our friends will be using only at the one or two words and that give the whole sentence other people even though they have learned language on be able to understand this is the beauty of the languages this gentleman went on telling the cool conversation that proves it is possible to develop the memory so here whole conversation that happened people the sugar is narrating that we will enter into the original text and that is the hood the vaquita the conversation between street krishna and the hotel whatever is asking some questions the krishna giving the answer and just not only for whatever it is for us and that was the parting message of krishna thank you friends thank you for coming we will enter into the original disk of the text dr. hood Tubber gita in our next class from our next class please repeat after me young brahma born Indra Rudra murder student II deeply stably be the song or the trauma open ashada he [Music] guarantee young sama God they are nervous teeter-totter dirty in a manasa pasyanti yam yoginah yes young Tom Navi do Sudha Sudha Ghana the fire thus my namah Shanti Shanti Shanti [Music] hurry heal that's the God is everything that again refined in the 11th chapter of the bhagavad-gita and there he's showing his divine form and Arjuna saw it that everything from him each and everything so when we meditate if we try to remember that God is everything it'll be difficult for us to concentrate so what we think actually in meditation we negate all those creation that forms names in meditation there should not be any name any form if you are thinking about the name and form it will be very difficult but mind cannot take it so what we do we give a name and form of a god particular one God and that God we concentrate and slowly slowly we are also mixing that God that particular form in the infinite I also March in that infinite ultimately and if we can't do it even for a single moment a great joy come within the mind and when you get up after that will feel fresh so that proves the eternity is the source of joy and that again coming back to God is that eternity thank you please have some lunch you go down No Oh
