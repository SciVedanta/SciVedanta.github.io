[Bhagavatam 066 : The Secret Of Spirituality](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HhnLjnQ5s8)

good morning dear devotees friends that is begin as usual with this mantra Shanta Karim booyakasha annum pardon or navamsa rashim [Music] vishwanadham Goggin Assad regime me the bernam shabanam lakshmi contemn Kamala jnanam you give heed yharnam monday be shanem Bob Arum cerebral who quicker now [Music] before we begin our discussion on the secret of spirituality I like to congratulate and humbly offer my pranaam to all the mothers of the world today is the Mother's Day usually every year on this particular day as to offer flowers and some candies to our Mother's wish to come to visit our s Rama as because this is a different situation I cannot physically offer you but here I am offering you the flower and also the candy to all the mothers be happy and bless us all who can be called as a mother the one who always feel happy at the progress of her children and the mother is always happy when she sees that our children are becoming good and that is exactly the approach of the divine personality the divine personality the Avatara they come to help the humanity to develop the righteousness so that they can become really happy why do I say really happy because this world cannot give us happiness a little bit of happiness here and there and sometimes with ice cream sometimes with the movie sometimes with the company of the friends but all temporary after that again it goes back to the square one which is misery so we always feel unhappy lonely frustrated so from that we have to go beyond all this and be in a place where constantly we are happy and that is called spirituality and what is the secret of spirituality and the last two classes we have discussed who is a sadhu a holy person and who is a good devotee who is a real sadhu this holy person and a real devotee dr. Lord has also mentioned eleven symbols as objects and on those objects we can worship considering a mean that the Supreme Being and those are as we all know the last class we were discussing the Sun the fire the holy person the cow the devotee the sky air water earth soul and then finally all beings this is the beauty of the Hinduism they will start with a small little thing and slowly slowly it will take you to the ultimate which is unfair and unmeasurable suribabu tani all beings each soul is potentially divine the Shami we began the same it is notice the statement that some people they give now there is a realization what is that realization each soul is divine and Swamiji said somebody puts in this way each soul is potentially divine and goal is to manifest his divinity within how by controlling nature external and internal so these are the things that we have to so tsuneo Agni brahmana gawe Bosch naba come murdered GABA means all the animals and come Marut Ghulam who art man suribabu thani but their poo yard on each of me that is we have already started the Krishna he taught the cadaver how to worship now the God is everywhere and suddenly you cannot go and simply throw some flower at the sky and say I am worshipping you know do you need some object why this much that's why Rama be waken the once again Swami Vivekananda he said that we traveled from lower truth to higher truth I repeat lower truth to higher truth and that is the main thing neighbor from error are from mystic to the truth no neighbor from darkness to light no the darkness that in the venetie it says the that take me from darkness to light that is it ignorin s' to the in our knowledge the knowledge of spirituality so this Swami Vivekananda's words from lower truth what is the lower truth I need an object I need an object to concentrate so I can express all my emotion on that object and that is the reason Hindus have given complete freedom you can choose any object why if all are not God why the Hindu will give you that object even the cow animals reverse the oceans the sky the moon there's everything you can make an object because each and everything is the expression of the same God as nothing but God there is only one God that we know but the child or no the person who's starting beginning his spiritual life all be able to know and that is the reason so many things have come so this is the object the Lord has saved eleven objects but the eleventh one sorry Babu Thani anything that you like anything now that we should develop the faith and devotion to God to worship Him according to Shri Krishna faith and devotion can be acquired East our poor Tina true Easter what is that Easter and Porter this agnihotra that miss yangjia and austerity tapasya practice of truthfulness at their reading scripture or Diana Veda Diana serving the guests at it is a bar and offering to gods d body and that is called Easter if you go to the the Punjabis Sheikh Punjabis they call it Gurudwara their temple is known as good at dwara and if you go over there a very successful people will stablished people they'll be taking your shoes and you say please go and meet the guard and when you come back your shoes will be ready over here and when you go he will clean your shoes holy and keep it properly and when you come back they will offer another group of people we'll be waiting and they'll say please come over here and take some pressure they will give you some car apprecia the very testy so that way they are serving the people why the people are coming they go to God and then go away why I have to serve like that this is called car sheba car means the hands with the hands you were serving the people Easter I don't know all people are doing or not but they're doing it this called Easter every day you are supposed to read a few pages from a holy book that is also East are reading from the Veda or Dianna agnihotra yagya what is the younger yet the means doing anything for the benefit of others so that is also younger austerity that tapasya then he was saving some food and sharing that with one with having nothing that is called the tapasya I could enjoy but I control my senses and then I give it to someone someone else that is called tapasya Paragon see Ramakrishna's direct disciple Sheridan and the ji Maharaj he was travelling in a very steep path in the Himalaya region it was drizzling slippery a stick is essential to climb to that hill but he found as another elderly person a villager it's not having anything he immediately offered his stick to that gentleman and he himself started somehow to climb tapasya that is called tapasya whatever I am having if you need I am ready to give you that is called tapasya so we don't understand the meaning of tapasya we go and stand these those are also  bah cheek manasik all these different tapasya has been explained in the bhagavad-gita particularly to promise that I am NOT going to tell any harsh world to anyone any sentence any word that will heat others and make him or her sorry for that no I'll never do that I control my tongue that is called bhakti tapasya always telling this inspiring all is positive tapasya these are all come under each term and a TT Shiva when some guests are coming you are supposed to give them some health and to attain them to see that when they go out to go back they're very happy why God is visiting you the h and everything you see the Hindus they take your whole mind everything you were doing you are receiving guests you're inviting some people but even in that oh we are socializing a calm how are you that is okay but you should see that they are really happy and in the way that they are also developing their spirituality the thinking level that is colotti Toshiba almost every house every we came there having their tea tea but that's called party they are all jumping enjoying the company of each other because that's all but OTT is a completely different he comes without announcing the person who is coming without announcing you should not be unhappy it's okay for me please come how can I help you so that is color titi shaver friends this is called East our Porter these two little the small words we hear again and again and this is each - and what is Porter Porter the Manu samhita is the lawgiver the Hindu society Iran's according to the law of the Manu the law he Berman who says bar P Cooper Torah God II the biotin Ananya under pradana Behrami put'em ET Ovadia t the in in Hindi and in Indian language recall port of evolved and forth over God is that PWD public works at the Department they are doing all these things they are supposed to do that in every contemporary society it is there in different names this PWD which is known in the India they are supposed to take care of the tanks the water tanks wills them pawns and the temples you know the three times tanks wells and ponds they are mentioned you know why in those days the water scarcity drinking water was not available people used to drink from the river of course this river they are very clear so these two drink like that but a society you need how to maintain the water rainwater collection then then also purifying it sending it for drinking so all these things were done by the kings all the landlords they call porta and if you do that our government is doing it is supposed to do but when the Kings used to do or the lenders used to do they are not compelled to do but these to do you know why these to do for the betterment of the people and that is also a religious and the holy work so Easter and porta on the pradhana Behrami and making the gardens licking the making the places where people can come and can feel happy these are all come under the portable baaga under pradhana distribution of food that means ration nowadays in India is all ration all government's arranging the ration the fook should come and it should go over there and the poor people can have it and the people can go and purchase from there so like this ration system Porter it comes under that under pradana Mihama making the gardens poor tomatillo Vidya tea the ishtar and Porter suppose you are a rich man and you can do all these things you will acquire the spirituality the blessings of God so that is also there the God said you can worship and the eleven objects and also you can have the blessings of God you can acquire that spirituality through Easter and portal that he is telling and then he is telling in this way not only through Krishna thought that would double taught how to worship those objects and at the same time he said sudhi a to bid they are aja hawisher acknowledged eight Imam how you worship Surya you cannot throw flour to Surya it is not possible so that is giving the eggs how to instruction how to worship this is really so completed when they are giving their teachings they are given complete teaching first you like to worship Surya majority of the Hindus they worship Surya the early morning they will get up they will purify themselves and then they will sit for meditation and when the Sun rises they are supposed to get up at least minimum one hour before or half an hour before sunrise then they'll wait for the sunrise and when their Sun is rising almost all the Brahmins they are supposed to they'll be chanting yakushima Shamgar 'some Cassiopeia Mahad do team gontar I'm sorry Baba Putnam Renato Schmidty bokram in my life in two places and the profound that sunrise that I have noticed one in Himalaya and I went to it from Darjeeling if you have to go in Bengal their jars are jelly then you can it's called volute and on the top from the top of the hill when the Sun is rising in the east you can see the reflection on the Mount Everest and there is a little and a carb is there in the Mount Everest and when that light is falling on that as if a golden throne it is there and as if the Lord Shiva will come and sit on that that is the imagination but the beauty all the small small the clouds and the light is reflecting on the clouds as if millions of boards of different colors they're flying that many people they go and Europeans they all keep information about it and then Americans they go and the photograph and all that that was one and another I saw in the Millennium day the first millennium day in the Bay of Bengal that the huge ocean and the Sun was rising that is the Sun is Russia how you worship the Sun Surya to Obadiah Asia Alisha ignore ajaita mom are to Tina to be proper dosoo Yoda Nina you should worship me in capital me the God with the Vedas in the Sun when the Sun is rising we are not trying anything but we are chanting the bye mantras that is the worship of the Sun but what is that Sun the God himself you are worshiping me with the way the mantra in the Sun ii he said you should worship me with the clarified butter in the fire we have to remember again and again when you are giving the oblation to the fire it is not fire it is God so that is the main thing you should worship me with hospitality in the holy persons when the people are coming visiting so we have to worship Him the God has come in those days in the olden days they had the practice of worshiping the washing the feet because the road or dusty there's to come in there so Indian people the first thing there's to do asking them to stand on a plate and there's to wash the feet that that was the humbleness - that I am worshipping your feet and that is the way the all is to do what shipping the feet that is there your - hospitality and offering the fodder to the animals that is also they belong are they are also the manifestation of God and the friendly respect in the devotees when you are meeting the devotees who are the believers in God you should be friendly with them talking with them in a friendly manner and then that is the way I am the knower of all creatures Chaitra be sorry Babu tissue this is Vedanta it begins with duality that is the Sun God and I am worshipping Sun I am worshipping the animals and worshipping the fire but why see again immediately from the drita God is taking you to Advaita Chaitra bia suribabu tissue I am the nor in all creatures the body and also the mind in the mind there is intellect on the intellect the reflection of the consciousness that is called Chaitra Ghia this is body called Chaitra what is the body body mind complexes Chaitra Chaitra is the field Chaitra Ghia who knows about these that is God and who is it the reflection of the consciousness on our intellect it's not real reflection of the consciousness and that is called Chaitra gear with equality you should worship some athena yet you jet mom but unfortunately we forget it we don't worship equally sometimes some people will come and they will neighbor salute they'll never offer the respect to our God why didn't your God we are not wrong so this we have to understand wherever we go any holy place we have to go and bow down mother one see Ramakrishna used to visit all holy places there is the uniqueness of ceramic is NAND we are the followers of Sri Ramakrishna used to go to that place who were criticizing in RISM the Brahmas they were devoted deviating from the Hinduism they were developing a separate path Salam o Krishna was not critical about them then he never criticized them rather you asked Ullaeus to go and see how they are worshipping oh you're also worshipping this same God the God that I worship in the form of Kali the mother you're also worshipping so this is the beauty of the religion if we read any Hindu scripture originally in the scripture you will find this greater advaitha dorita it will take you to Advaita and always say everything of the same so the Lord is telling over here Chaitra celebrities you some Athena hijita mom you must equally worship me so this is the way it is going and then the Lord said Oh Dora the efficient and the best way to develop devotion is the company of the holy sages just let the mother know the God is the only key mother he's the frame and he is his master man oh he's behaving like a mother very soft kind heart and completely concerned very much concerned about the development of his devotee the would Dava so he told who is a sadhu who is a devotee how the worship can be on the object though the God is all pervading but there are objects that there anything in this world but always think that this is the manifestation of me so worship some Athena equally now he's telling but I will tell you a secret what is that secret you will come to that and that secret is he is telling you know how it is possible to develop the devotion unless you have the faith and devotion there is no question about the spirituality I don't believe in God I don't have any devotion then why should you discuss about it so you have to have the faith in the existence of God and at the same time you should develop attachment to God love for God which is known as devotion now he's telling you can develop these two things you know by how by worshipping Surya by worshipping the Sun or worshipping in many others it is possible and also practicing Ishtar porta possible but the best and the easiest way the company of the holy people so he's telling Briana dr. yoginah satsang ghena vena cava now by a bit dirty Sangram Pryor Barnum he Saddam Homme oh whatever the efficient and the best way to bhakti-yoga is the company of the holy person because I am the goal of the holy person they always represent me who is a holy person now we will come to that now here there he gives the shock cart what is the shut car instead of doing all those things it's not possible reading good books every day and two words offer the young guy and this that it's not possible okay the God knew it in the modern time it won't be possible and that is the reason he is telling you better go to a holy person because the holy person is giving the indication because the holy person means he knows nothing but me me the God he knows nothing in this world except me in a dramatical way to draw the full attention of Buddha ba the Lord said I am going to tell you the profound secret para mangu iam paramon profound Greenham secret the most confidential Sugo pium it is very confidential but still I shall tell you because you are my obedient companion and friend the God is disclosing the truth to whom if those who have read the gospel of ceramic Krishna sometimes you must have come across that the ceramic ISNA is telling that you are my own you are my inner circle I can disclose many things to you which is possible to tell others why people don't believe rather disbelieve rather they will criticize they will have fun on that that's why see Ramakrishna is not disclosing and he is telling us because you are my inner circle very close what is the inner circle I faith believe then he is disclosing you know I saw sama Krishna in gospel I saw the same like me someone came out of me and he was roaming with me if it if he says to the other people don't believe it rather they will know they suggest he's commenting like this only the very close circle people can say like this the Lord Jesus he took his chosen disciples and gave them some instructions that is the very special instructions to his inner circle it always happened so this is the way we had to understand Raghavan omocha Schnurr he is telling if you know God then you know everything and he puts that word God as Babu Babu means the one who is having a lot of wealth and knowledge so if you go and develop friendship with that Babu you know everything the develop intimacy with the master and he will tell you all about him now we are entering into the twelfth chapter all this time we were reading the eleven skander that means the eleventh book eleven a dire 11th chapter and now eleven Skanda but twelfth chapter where I am telling these things all details the many of you are very much interested to read the original book this is available in our bookstore online also and this book will give you a one full inside let us read this verse first and second verses from the twelfth chapter the Quran himself was telling na roda atiba may you go 'no sangkum dharma i batur na zdrowie tabata Agha nah Ishta put'em na Dakshina Brittani yagi-chan dom c til tani near muhammara utah abba duty satsanga cerebral Sangha op o ha imam this is the secret the secret of spirituality I gave that today's top what is the spirituality to become God to feel that you are the Brahman that is spirituality and before that it is all religion going and acquiring the knowledge from the educational institution that is the ultimate goal but going to the institution educational institution schools and colleges and talking with the professors reading the books going to the laboratory all those things religion there is practices when ultimate thing is spirituality so when you go to the temple to the churches to the mosque to the synagogue all that is religion and there the religion is different the paths are different the teachers are different environments are different but the knowledge is the same because the knowledge of God it is the same so we should not waste our time fighting and criticizing rather if I feel that Vedanta is my path in reason I should follow follow and don't be this the the hearted that is to your thinking oh I am for Hinduism but I am in European I am an American I have this type of days dress and I have this type of culture I should not imbibe all those wrong thing once you are imbibing imbibing the full thing fully completely and then proceed one life I dedicate for this if I don't realize God no problem next level try so many hundreds of lives I have wasted one more life no problem let me try with the instructions of the ceramic Asian of Vivekananda Masada that that should be the determination otherwise no progress I'll be half like Europeans and half like Indians and I criticize India for everything and their behavior wastage of time I have accepted these so I go in this way so this is the path and the God said it is possible only through holy company it is very important friends I should tell you this well quickly otherwise we won't be able to complete he says the God is telling to realize God one is supposed to practice what meditation but with yoga discrimination that is gana virtue that is Dharma study of scriptures so attire austerity tapara renunciation the other rights like Ishtar Putin mr. Putin we just discussed charity Dakshina observance of vows brother sacrifice yoga reputation of holy name mantra pilgrimage theatre physical and mental purity yama niyama etc so that is the God then disclose the cigarette what is that yet our buried day satsangha holy company is the best practice to realize me the god because holy company destroy all other association server Sangha op o ye sara sangha apple ye one is god another is this universe this world and why server because in this world in this universe there are many varieties of things at there but for the god it is only one so if you go to the holy person and you have the his company his instruction follow his path in all the attractions to this world things will go away and you can realize God that is what the Shri Krishna is teaching in the Bhagavatam and this is the would double gita that he will start starting and is the last message of Shri Krishna after that he will cease to be that over there so we know so he is giving the last message and here he is giving the most importance on the sadhu sanga those who are associated with the ceramic is not ideology you know the ceramic is not in his four practices core practice when the someone arcs team question can idealize God and how then he said in the four ways you can realize God and the first very first thing is sadhu sanga sadhu sanga that means the company of the holy religion bar and living in solitude discrimination bechara and prarthana the devotional way to talk to God that is prarthana the first is sadhu sanga but the question is with a sadhu once again we have already read and we know the Sri Krishna has given the 28 sometimes they say 30 the Train t8 wonderful qualities if a person is having those qualities he can be called as a shadow but the one cinema Krishna it just gave in a small one line he said sadhu means who's his whole thing is body mind and intellect merged in God Mon brawn hunter Atma Ashura got to achieve that he has no ego at all in him is the complete transformation of God in that body he's called shadow Oh stay back Romani you're also giving the idea about the holy person to the Janaka and we are also studying that every second Saturday we study this austere bakra samhita in the austere Bhakra there is 17 chapters 16th verse he says now hymns our neighbour corundum it's a very unique way of Astra Bhakra he always says like that Nahum Xiao niba corundum no depth 'm NACHA Dena da na oestrogen neighbor Chuck Schwab ah Sheena Sam's Ronnie nari Sheena some suddeniy Nadi whose worldly desires have been exhausted Sheena Sheena means very team exhausted what samsara nee worldly thoughts nari that a human who's worldly thoughts are completely exhausted for him how you know this is worldly thoughts have completely exhausted now austere bakra in his own unique way he said that neither compassion not desire to harm after this he will not have compassion not desire to harm the duality is not there neither compassion not desired to harm something has happened and I feel compassionate oh sorry why they should do like this or I feel angry and think like protesting nothing is there neither humility nor humbleness neither wonder nor mental disturbance now our charger neighbor Church / super disturbances our charger wonder oh my god why this should happen and then nothing can imagine how the person that is called sadhu that is the holy person because he knows everything what is going to happen or Juna again I will take you to Mahabharata and the origin a man like him a hero he was completely broken and he said oh my god what is going to happen we are going to kill each other we are friends we are brothers we are relatives we are known to each other why for just a plot of land now we should not do it he was disturbed what about Krishna well quietly sitting and observing he knew what is going to happen so that is exactly neither compassion nor desire now himsel neighbor coronium note that them not adi Ngata nostril geneva church / sheena some Saarinen are' if we find this type of person go and touch his feet he is the holy person now Atari buried near a lambo Ganesha he defines Evan and hell I am quoting here is very interesting because always we think about the heaven and all of they think about the hell that we should not go over there and we are so eager to saying who we don't like to help go to hell there's always in English they say when they're angry do we why is very bad place and Haven is a good place you know what now it says a turbo be ADA is asking corner akka nanaka means L what is Naraka except samsara be shy some selgeh eva Naraka not at least not a place that we will go we have to go from here to Naraku no not like that if you are having the bad company you are in Naraka you are in hell every day was suffering and leaving like an animal you are thinking that you were driving a very costly car and spending lot of money and drinking the the tones and gallons of the wine and then falling down here and there and then somehow you spent the whole night and next morning the same person you are in Nautica so that he says or satsanga samsara bie acept samsara be sure if we take in this way assert means which is not permanent samsara that constantly moving and be schooi he is thinking that is permanent and trying to acquire it and his process of a clearing is all bad either killing or cheating but that way they are becoming rich barren let them be but their company is like the naraka we have to understand this and of course Swarga is asking what is having only small two words satsanga sirga association of holy person is heaven see this is also the hindus they believe that they have the karma Falla Master Marsha is Rima and his friend and relative c2c teacher both of them going to made Salam o Krishna after the first account that the sedition taking master message to see Ramakrishna have you ever read about the dish no he never returned to see Ramakrishna the god himself rather master Masha started visiting again again and again and what the master master saw in ceramic Krishna he saw as if the shuka Deva he's expounding the bhagavata the message of Krishna and all people are sitting around so this is the way the he is describing what is Swarga holy company what do you find in the holy company all positive thoughts never the negative and all beautiful music and people are each other very friendly happy trying to help each other that is worker so this is the way sometimes some people they come in the ass Rama and then they will make a small group and then they will go on criticizing this man they are also coming to the Rama but why they should come here our our things should be more we should have the control of all the activities that is not Swarga that is not only company please be aware of it I believe in it so if you are trying to get the God realization the develop spirituality listen to the words of Raghavan Krishna Shri Krishna the Great God what he said satsangha and what is such Sangha where your mind become broad as Rama Vivekananda said to his disciple he said I don't know whether I have realized God or not but I can accept even the devil if that is there anything like that that means I can accept everyone the broadness of mine now let us go to Shankar Acharya the Lord said sir Krishna said satsanga and in the satsanghis Adama Krishna gave the definition austere bokram Unni gave the definition now Acharya Shankara he is telling his sterling in this way who is he he is asking the question who either holy person K son t Santa is very very important that's why so many people there again and again discussing on this case on t Santa who is a holy person then he himself replying akela beat raga completely free from desire again and again we have to repeat ourselves to become holy person means to give up all desire all desire and for the monks the last desire is clapping of the people that is the last desire and that is very very difficult to overcome the great personalities they rise up to that and then they fall then as they were showing as the coronavirus it is rising and then flatting they're very happy that it is not rising again and then it will come down but in the life of a monk it should not be like that rising means rising until it realizes the God of the Supreme it is not flattering and coming down and it is happening because some people after practicing spirituality will go some and then the moment the your power at the gods power is manifesting immediately the world is attracted and then the moment the world is attracted you are dragging down again you were going down so that is Aquila be turaga raga means the desire Aquila completely beat gun who is the only person Shankar Acharya is asking case Santa Santa first quality no dessert second a pasta mo ha no delusion also no delusion about anything then I will go to this place I will go to that place if I meet - that man will be good if I have this no more no delusion completely knowing that Lord is doing everything if he wants he will send people he will send money yeah everything will be I will be just in the front as a Perot heater that's all and nothing and then finally he said Shiva tetani star he is completely dedicated to the auspiciousness we live it do any harm we'll never do anything wrongly never she bought a tiny star why should I do in this way now this is wrong I'll never do now Sri Ramachandra he also wanted to know from his guru Bush today how to distinguish a holy person how to find the only person how to know a holy person and bushy star also telling the same thing is look at this lower moja Russia Isha tenuto know denim Bobby Natasha Austin be karate sir karmasu sadhana yoga vasishta said lower the greed Mohar the delusion rushan means anger lower and more it goes together what is the Mohan Mohan is delusion what is the delusion oh this is very good I see something and start thinking oh this must be so wonderful so good then I went to visit some place and the hotel with the saw and from the front out so beautiful that big glass doors and these and that everything was nice but when I went inside the dirty bathroom and the bed was not also very good and there is no window from the outside you are so good so Mohan when you see something wonderful good but you know it is going to be very joyful but if you go inside acquire that then you find nothing so this always it happens there's calm or the lower desire Mohar delusion rushan anger why my desire is not fulfilled so that anger tenuto know the number wait that means the desire the delusion and the anger has been completely erased from the mind and this is negative and positive guitar Sjostrom be herati as per the injunction of the scripture he is living what is that you should not accept existing whatever is necessary for you is okay but excess you should not take you should not cheat someone to gain something never these are Shastra guitar sjostrom be herati his life is according to the injunction of the scripture and so karmasu he is completely dedicated in his own duty so a karma as a monk I have some responsibilities duty I must perform that as a householder you have some responsibilities you must do that sashad channa he's a holy person the secret of spiritual life is holy company then a one scripture it says say Tom Sango he is a gem Vasia means it means the medicine and this worldly things is so difficult to go out because I have already been intoxicated I cannot come out of it sometimes people and the young age out of curiosity they start smoking and doing something and by that way they are bounding that day it is so difficult for them to come out and it says in the worldly things also the desire grows and grows and grows and that is why it says that Saddam Stanga he be Adam what is the medicine to go beyond this desire is the holy company I think we should conclude after quoting from the cool our neighbor Tundra after I can conclude Liz what is this cool Arabic country I'm quoting from different scripture what what is Sado because this is important to know and see almost from Saddam Oh Krishna Shri Krishna then see Rama Krishna then all the Shankar Acharya Abba sister then the cool air Nava Tantra is telling satsanghis cha be-because name alumni and not them beautiful it is putting these like the two eyes that will help you to go towards the goal there's a spirituality one is such Sangha and as it is be beca only holy company on to there's so many people are there in association with the holy people but they don't have the discrimination they're only just following like that no that don't do you have to understand which is good for me and you have to understand what he is telling what is the real meaning of it that is called the discrimination satsanghis cha cha means an satsangha holy company and be because cha the discrimination capacity to judge from the wrong to the right name alumni on Adam these are the two eyes Jasha nasty so Nora so under the person he's not having these two quality then is a very unfortunate is a blind person in the field of the spirituality he cannot do anything then the Lord Krishna described to do double how ordinary people are brindaban though not studied any scripture all practice austerity to attain spiritual liberation had achieved the highest goal just because they lived in his company does it mean just living in the holy company in the holy Association can give spiritual liberation again I will give the the ceramic richness instances because he is very modern so many people induction Isha this to leave its Ramakrishna majority of them never accepted him rather these to fill in way this to criticise him because the landlord is two loves the Ramakrishna respects Ramakrishna the arbor priest they are very jealous of him they criticized him and many people were not at all liking see Ramakrishna but he was there in his company take the life of Shri Krishna himself so many people wanted to kill him they wanted to kill him why so Association means what Association means understanding that person appreciating his behavior and knowledge and then finally love him to the utmost that is Colossus reaction the holy company holy Association doesn't mean you go and rub your shoulder with that man no it is not like that you have to love that holy person and if the ego will completely wash out like about do to a party to a not the Eva Batista I'm quoting a very small line from the bhagavata and the sri krishna has given a long and I think almost four or five the lines so anyway to describe how you should understand that you are in the company of the holy person and then only will get the benefit how then it is like as the river is merging in the ocean and then having nothing of its own the river is becoming ocean like that if you are living in the company of a holy person and then transform yourself into a holy person then only it is the benefit then the Lord Krishna asked his follower and friend would Tubber therefore would old ubba mama cami botulinum atmanam is the twelfth chapter 15 verse do thou wholeheartedly take refuge in me alone me the god so that is the ultimate and now friends whatever is a wonderful person though he was having the krishna is a frame but he wanted to have completely the clarified thing so he wanted to know what do you mean by that he lost that
