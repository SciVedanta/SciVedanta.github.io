[Bhagavatam 054 : Son's Advices To Mother](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGWGm9bLSN4)

good morning let us chant this mantra and begin the discussion Shanta pooja - annum but mana sirisha [Music] wish WOD governess attrition me [Music] shuhang Lakshmi condom [Music] Kamala Lionel you keep the honor in the heavens Thunder we found the good towel the friend and the follower of Shri Krishna requesting the Lord not to give up his body and why because he said if you go away if you die then who will be guiding us so you must continue you must leave Krishna was living for a long time even then whatever was not ready and to be separated from him so naturally the devotees mind and their Sri Krishna told him the story after the Tatra about Hooda who learned from the nature the time should come when we should become our own teacher so that tatra of a daughter he learned from the nature and became his own guru and we had the last few days we discussed about the data of a daughter and this his realization and his teaching takes us to the highest position of the Hinduism here in the last discourse the November 3rd on the topic to tie the last Sunday we got the answer from the dr. Trevor Tata and he said no we cannot die why however Shiva per mark mighty that is the answer Dattatreya homey be Shiva or motto I am the ultimate reality which never changes so that means change birth means change it cannot be possible when we are feeling that we had the ultimate reality that is our daughter Gita is very difficult to understand but at the same time this is the truth about the guitar it tells that this is the truth the highest point then bhagavata informed us that the Raghavan Vishnu to keep his promise to birth as a son of a tree and unusual doctor trio also was the Lord Vishnu internet again we find and here as a doctor tree the Lord Vishnu is giving us the high knowledge and it says how many were Shiva and those who were attended the classes you know again and again and again and again doctor through said who I am going to worship how it is possible to worship because a hundred Supreme God can i worship myself so that way down again we find the same lord vishnu taking the incarnation and he took birth as the son of a tree and on schewe a tree the father Anusha and they became the doctor kriya not Bishnu the preserver of the universe also took the bird as an illustrator son of the ascetic the great astok and he was the Prajapati also kendama who was the Prajapati those who took the responsibility to generate so many progeny should be there because it was the beginning of the creation so there was a position that's called Prajapati that there are many prajapatis also the earth do you have great ascetics their mind was constantly merged with the government the supreme knowledge at the same time as because they took the responsibility so it is not what the physical comfort it was only as a duty as a responsibility these to do that great difference so we also sell books and booksellers also sell books what are the difference we sell books with an idea that these will help the reader so we sell the books and why we sell we can't distribute freely because we don't have that capacity so we are whatever the expenses are incurred and we calculate and make a value and then we sell the book but not for our own personal profit it's not our business is a mission there similarly the project these it was the mission because the God Himself himself said to them that you had to generate so kardama Prajapati he married devotee the Cortana and devotee dear son was our this Kapila the shyamu manu see those who are studying the hindu the scriptures so one is the brahman then come a group of people that's called Manu Manu is the Supreme Lord the ruler of that whole creation for a period of time that period is a long long period and under him all we theme we can say this prajapati's there in many numbers so the Manu his daughter is devotee he is coming and I'm requesting the kardama to marry his daughter devotee he was having three daughters two daughters are already married that last one and khaddama without any argument agreed why was when he was meditating suddenly he saw the form of Vishnu there's also description is the air and we have already described all these things in our previous discourses this time the Vishnu told kardama you prayed that I should give a vision to you I have given now you are liberated but you have to do something for me what is that you have to married Mary devotee and I will born as your son really recently in 1830 six we see the same thing the Bishnu he is requesting the father of vagabonds Ramkrishna I like to become your son some people may believe it some may not but this is the truth because the Supreme Lord which is all-pervading and all-powerful he is very eager to help us the human being Thermal Shanaya again and again in the bhagavad-gita we clearly see that I have to protect the third mother I just that some people are really good and I must guide them and we will come to that point here at this time the Vishnu took the name Kabila the son of kardama and devotee and here we find that we started and those who are regularly attending this class or listening to the YouTube you know that we started the father bottom as a guide to liberation from March cult 2018 and we are going to complete 2019 and maybe our complete our 2020 we will continue the bhagavata and on September 2018 we discussed in details how the Supreme Being desires to become many divided himself in three parts so here I am quoting from that previous one its sale equal na na Tom Nietzsche Maya does result 3 da the Supreme Lord he became desirous he wanted to become many there is nothing else please remember the scripture that we were studying is a devotional speech the scripture of love scripture of devotion and here God is separate and we are separate that conception is also there but at the same time in the beginning it says that that in the as a second scandal that is almost in the beginning of the scripture it says equal non-optimal I am one Nana tanana means different meaning on nature desires to become many Maya this is the word again used in the Bhagavata Maya through my power best result 3 da divided into 3 parts into three divisions what divine then human and then matter are the diva then are the Buddha till at thearc what that means the being all the tree whatever you see in this phenomena is nothing but the manifestation of the same God why because there was nothing else but that supreme thing and are the river that is also nothing but the same God and what we are the same god this is really really very confusing that God we are worshipping and I Who am worshipping and the material that I am using to worship has nothing but the same isn't it so this is very very confusing but at the same time this is the only answer what is liberation understanding this understanding that I and the material my god and nothing but the same one now again if you go back to the realization of ANSI Ramakrishna this is the scripture that says as anyone realized it yes in our time Raghavan C Ramakrishna he is telling I saw the goddess Kali and all the things that I used for puja and myself and each and everything that I see is nothing but the made of the same consciousness that was easier ization the one person came and she was telling the shams you don't have gods we have gone over here she didn't say anything but I could read from her face that she cannot accept a human being how can it be a god it takes time understanding so he said no engineer engineer means the Mohave course Kali goddess Kali she was not very happy with the color but still for us it is okay like that why this conception because we think something that is not visible to all this is a very very ancient old so we take that we do not know whether no hanji was there or not and people they believe that guru hanji is eternal some people they laugh at it so it goes on but the human being he's God is very difficult to understand very difficult and that is the reason again and again the God is coming in the human form to teachers and he's suffering he knew that he is going to suffer he is suffering but still he comes why guidance now the question is why he created the bad thing and why unnecessarily he has to teach us so this there is no real answer he said Lila as we are reading from here the second scan the third stanza and 13 verse equal nah nuttin an engine equal the one none of them to become many on niching desiring to be mainly washed into thinking this way no one can ask that question can do the God's will that's why everyone Salaam o Krishna said to even Lila this is Lila Maya our best reach our freedom now here my own young Krishna children real if a person if we think that God is a person as a being is making the three parts then what will happen think if he is thinking in that way then what happens the three parts then the god is divided if the God is divided naturally there is no Supreme God it cannot be so philosophically we cannot go in that way so how the God met himself three these here the Shankar Aziz actually it's a parental appearance is not true it's not real all these things that you see again and again the began thin this thing it's not true including me I am also not true and what is the difference between a tree and me manifestation of the consciousness little more in me than the tree the tree is also having the same reflection of the consciousness but the manifestation of the correction is less that's why we call it inner the stone inert but human being conscious and look at the Buddha look at the Jesus Christ look at the result Muhammad look at the great soul at the moon hundreds and thousands of people worshipping then why because that divinity manifested in a maximum in them so what is the difference differences manifestation of the consciousness where from the consciousness come it is already there so now what we should do Tati's the question was asked by kapila's mother Deva the to his son to her son the father kardama he said now the son is born my duty is over I will go back because it was mine to us 90% 99% mind was always a test with the Brahman so he he left the heart and home and became a mom Kokila he also got himself a D to go then the mother told what will happen to me father is already liberated you were also liberated won't you think about me because I am looking after the whole property the household and I am attached I cannot simply say grabbing because I have to help you and your father to feed them I have to go and purchase the groceries who is doing all these things me why for you and I am bound you will leave me like this so the Kapila said okay this is the conversation between the MA the son so if we find this this way the it says in this creation this has been divided into four time John Sutter Drita Saba and Colleen we know that and devotee did this conversation was going on we will go to a little philosophy instead of other things in that philosophy we find the word purana which we are starting now the famous books abductee the love of God but what a devotee when the Kapila is giving the instruction to her mother to his mother we find the Kapila is also speaking you people are making great mistake I am present everywhere but you are worshiping me look at this world I am present everywhere and even worshipping me in the temple you're making a great mistake again that or three the vedanta swami vivekananda when he returned back from the Europe the whole of India they were very happy and they were giving a reception in the Madras and Madras there is a part of the temple the very famous temple still that is there so parthasarathi temple they wanted to give him the or to honor him Vivekananda a great scholar and orator so obviously they wanted him to thousands of people came to listen there was no microphone the Vivekananda went on the chariot that the car the cost on chariot and on the top of it is stood and he is full to the matrices and at that time failure products people and at that time he was telling you are worshipping your Krishna in the stem standing before that temple he was telling you are worshipping Krishna in this temple and look at that there were some poor people their hearts were their dirty poor and your Krishna is living over there you are not serving them the Krishna is suffering in the human form over there you never care for that you never go to them you didn't feed them and you are coming and worshiping here in this temple in the stone image Krishna will be more happy for you and it's a pole wars in those time and he said that and that's the whole truth so copy no podía we find this type of sentences one of our Swamiji and after where he was the president of the Ramakrishna vision one of the residents Xiaomi Ramanathan antigen and he used to code again and again this verse the cap Allah is telling his mother you're making a great mistake and you are going and worshipping me in the shrine in the temple in an image I don't image ignoring me who is there outside in like this all beings so the Ramakrishna mission they started the padartha the practical be done on the basis of this Raghavan see Ramakrishna also saved if you can see God by closing your eyes how come that you can't see God with open eyes God is everywhere so this is the wonderful teaching of the Vedanta now the property when you are learning about the bhakti we find here that there is a guiana of T and also Parvati I have taken this from a book of some interpersonal and the G he was also a great soul in the great monk of Rama in order he was for a long time in charge of the Madras norsu mr. Bhushan Gandhiji I met him personally Ranganathan years old made so these are the great souls and the personality he is mentioning in his book the introduction of the capital pod Asia that gianna bhakti devotion to the Supreme Being pleased the realization of all pervasiveness of the Supreme Being and become one with that I will repeat to become one with that devotion wholehearted concentration to the Supreme Being and after the realization that that Supreme Being is all-pervasive is everywhere after that realization marching with that Supreme Being that is called gianna bhakti devotion through knowledge Gyan adopted as our heart a bazooka is telling how many were Sheba for a martini I am that lord supreme then baba bhakti is another but the another devotion loving intensely the god wheat for loving intensely the god with form it does not want to become one with it so this is the two difference one is loving God as all pervasive everywhere and at the same time loving God as the only one image statue or picture or one personality so this to type the Ganapathy and Baba Bakhtin the gonna bhakti we have gone through the day eita and again refined in this book also and paga Burt Raghavan Vishnu in his incarnation in capito but the difference between our Kapila is also speaking of the highest truth and about who the Tatra Avadhuta told the highest truth but the Tatra who to just Express these experiences is a realization never cared to give you why and how no filosophy they never tried to analyse he never bothered about the people will accept it or not that is the difference Avadhuta never bothered about the people whether they will accept it or not and how they will accept because to him there was nothing but the consciousness whom to teach and half routine then when that incident happened Shami Ramananda he was detained the president of the Ramakrishna order we can we can say the first president to the first president or Swami Vivekananda but then officially he became the president from monitor famous known as Rakhal Maharaja gospel reading and he used to most of the time he's with open eyes sitting over here and sometimes used to sit in the inside small garden or sometimes fishing like that in even catch any fish that is to see pretending that he is doing that why people don't disturb him with an uncle will go and sit all the time his eyes looking but at the same time not looking at not noticing anything but that was wonderful so province rankest is to say when he was young practicing the Ramakrishna Devi see whenever I look at him my mind goes floor high into that up to eight awawa why it was a Supreme Being what he's constantly thinking of God the sing him was almost realization so that is a rattle mother he was sitting on a bench and some of the young novices new recruit and actually to develop the monk or to develop the spiritual the mentality takes time we come from the families of many naturally different families different cultural background different type of people nature it is and the magnitude of that time of the better part was Sami preeminent a another director loves Ramakrishna he came and complained to the procedure naturally he will come to see Raja his another name was Raja that was given by Xiaomi G Raja you should school these young people they are not listening to me they are not following the time so it should score because it's a precedent you must do that al-mi'raj Amara start even said Dada Dada means the elder brother that is to call themselves like that I don't see anyone else except see Ramakrishna who I am going to score who should i score these young boys I don't see as the unwise I see the Saddam occasionally in dose form making prank and behaving like that I cannot score sit on Krishna these we find here the same God in a ravine this is also probable this is devotion but the devotional in what way devotion that my God has become everything the last few days I was observing a wonderful great movie from the Muslim world Sufism that the Sufis mistakes so they in how they are practicing exactly that we do same way same practices and saying will teach me the one person came is a new knowledge though he was holding a big post but he has come and then afterwards he has taken the initiation from that guru guru was completely uneducated but the disciple he was a judge one time judge of the same locality so often obviously he was thinking that we should do in this way we should do in that way and guru told you but a girl don't be with me go away from here and he lived and afterwards he understood the great mistake I have done not getting any peace any and then again came back the Guru told okay if you like to be here take this this feed this dog there is a stray dog good fit this dog regularly and if it goes away then you have to go and search that means you have to sleep with the side of the dog all the time watching that it is not going away it was not possible for him and the dog went away then afterwards the Guru told you go and find in the shops and in the marketplaces it must have gone over there he went that the one-time judge of that same locality and people they used to respect him so much now this man is going like a bigger searching for the dog he himself was thick what I am doing actually I came to realize God and I'm searching for a dog what is he thought he was going on searching and all people they are asking what happened what happened said what he was searching he couldn't say that I am searching a dog then ultimately he found that that the dog then the daughter of that teacher she told the dog is the stray dog mostly goes to that forest he never goes to it never goes to the market then he said why guru said that ma the daughter said I don't know but you'll find the dog over there in them and they found him it was sitting over there he went to but they found the dog and coming back going coming bad he made his frame that he also became the judge same badge and they were very close friends very interesting that frame the judge told my god what has happened to you are you becoming mad so the act mental tension was going on then the Guru told you have to break your ego see our teaching saying him teaching you have to break your ego why I did that to break your ego unless you break your ego you will never be even understand so this is the philosophy and the practice philosophy is okay and what is the practice breaking the ego why this is the ego that is standing in between God and being I have in reality God but I don't understand the head because of my ego I am always separating myself from the God thinking I am a male I am a female I am a rich and poor I'm educated I managed you created so many epithets one after another I am going on putting on that so what is the ultimate thing completely remove it and have the dependence on the guard that's called Baba bhakti if you cannot have the jonovic thing then we have to develop the poverty and we find in that darshanam it goes on dating in this way showing a girl to the Great Sage the show knocker he is announcing in order to reveal the knowledge of the hutment men the Lord doe in himself godless embodied himself by the power of his own Maya as Kapila the profounder of the doctrine of sound the sound conduction who did it all is the Hindu they will say a great person means God himself why well otherwise it is not possible unloosen until you are having the direct connection with God the source God all knowledge in God unless and until you are having that direct source particularly spiritual knowledge is not possible so will ever anyone anywhere as the direct contact with the God his teachings completely changes his life and behavior completely changes and we can understand this is the God and you must be remembering this is the December is coming and the grave soul who was born they say there's a lot of controversy on the 24th that was the eve and as he is famous as the Lord Jesus and he was born what the people first found three wise men from the east why they always calculate go on calculating like this to what is happening the stars are changing the positions some great things are going to happen and then they calculated and found that the star is moving and that must be a power is coming down and curious and with all devotion they came all the way from the east to find that the Lord was born about there so we know the story the three great wise men from the east so that was the if the Lord is taking birth we believe it and we have the proof what is the proof just look at the behavior what is the proof that God was born as Krishna look at the behavior how he behaved how he lived he could be the empower of the whole India in those days undivided India huge but rather he used to always take the side of the righteous people good people and then fighting with the bad people and also giving the philosophical teaching so that the people who are not in the core texture of this life can develop the spiritual life this is Krishna so naturally we can obviously accept that Krishna was God look at the life of Sri Ramachandra the Ramachandra has found his own mentally yesterday only all Indians didn't know it is a great excitement so whether Rama was born in a jet the norm so almost all over the world people they were observing as in the America you observed the American president election we were observing what is the result is coming from the Supreme Court judgment ultimately they say Iran was born with this Rama why we consider him as God look at his life so this is the proof a person can never be an ordinary person just because his father gave a word and that was not the father was denying right just by chance I told this your mother that I will mother means the stepmother that I will listen to her and give her a boon as because she saved one time she helped me so and now she is asking that you should be banished and hard son should be the king actually father is also supporting him and father told you better arrest me and become the king the whole population used to love him so much this young Ramachandra and his wife and her father was a very famous man even they in the Ramachandra told against weak against his father a bit and his wife and each and everybody said no once you have given the word must be kept because human being it just like that why other things are changing father nothing will remain ejecta will never remain but these will remain we gave the father my father gave the word but didn't keep that should not be that is called the really that is the reason we've always a split see Rama Chandra has God himself and if we see that see Rama Chandra what is how he is behavior everywhere according to that situation you should understand him not according to the present day in those days see Rama Chandra was stuck establishing a society a civilized society without understanding that when we judge why he lived like that why he did that no that's because in those days it was necessary and the first and foremost thing thing is Sathya the truthfulness he knew wheels who he is but at the same time he was accepting all and everyone there are people different type of people and we are naman they are not just animals they were human being and the Hanuman if you read in the pal Mickey Ramayana they were having the great Kingdom almost everywhere the millions of population was there very powerful very intelligent people but these to worship in that form not one the nature worshiper so Rama Chandra accepted them in each and every state if you read so I should not enter into Rama Chandra it will come back to this hour the Kabila and it says the same Vishnu who was born as Rama and his brother again if you read Vishnu has taken the form of Sri Ramachandra why to establish Dharma business what is that Dharma if you give the word you should not deviate from that nowadays the people of course there are many other problem but still look at it since I have given the world in the marriage that I am going to have I protect my wife all through my life how can you break it how can I break it the way we are taking the sannyasa nobody forced us to take the sannyasa only thing that we took the vows of poverty chastity on this team how can I break it there is no one behind me to look after me secretly I can do but when actually I have nobody seeing me doesn't mean that I am going to do that no if it is me so that is covered about the Dharma means this once a given the word till depth I'm not going to give me like that so this he is telling any again and again in different form he has the form of the Kapila he came and the Kapena became the Shankill and very peculiar lives the Lord Vishnu who took the form of the capella and he prepared it the somke philosophy and in the son Kapinos avi the atheistic country they don't believe in God the Shankar never believed in God who we are we were praying there is no God lit up to you look at it a theistic philosophy the Lord Vishnu he took the form of a capella and then the Lord Vishnu is giving this now this is the philosophy and we find that Shankar system it gives that in this way the two realities are there the one is mutually opposite one is subjective another is objective the subjective is the Purusha objective is the property the Purusha and the property Purusha of the chakra is the countless multiplicity of individual center of pure consciousness a pure consciousness in each and every individual center there is a pure consciousness without capacity for any kind of work consciousness but cannot work with the concept of the Shankill each and every individual is nothing but the pure consciousness but the consciousness itself cannot work up to this though an individual kirusha is vishnu all-pervading but non contextual with pushes of the other now a second point first is all being and nothing but the consciousness this is fast and the consciousness they turned capitalist pollution what is that purusa is residing inside a small house heart and inside the heart that is the consciousness each and every individual having the consciousness if that is so then we are all same if we are all saying if somebody is suffering I should also suffer but I don't know why then they say again though it is reflecting in every individual but at the same time they are all separate these are the very certain points of the subject so maybe again in the next year we will take up the philosophies and the other details will discuss the different philosophy and different their the viewpoint individual each is the Purusha puja means consciousness and they are different cable given amis alone so that that's why it says satkaryavada Kabbalah develop individually I am completely separated my father then my mother they're brothers then friends each and every one I am separate part I have the consciousness so this is one point opposed to the kirusha is this paternal the subjective attorneys Prakriti objective the subjective and objective the subjective is consciousness which is known as the pollution exactly opposite is the parity is an objective now this is called objected it is known by the various names of pradana this property this schanke's is property also known as pradhana the first category our objective in discrete object means not manifested to uncaused eternal part lives only present like the Purusha it is just the opposite in all other respect it is single in sentient and objective puja is not objective subjective why I am looking sometimes the Ballentine David say I am looking at my own image who is looking the image who is seeing the image I whom I see how it becomes one is object another is subject this little point is a subtle point try to understand one is object I can understand an object to smell through touch through sight mercy through hearing to test because it is outside when I tested D I know this is a very good deal okay but who is testing hi how can I understand meaning so from this point we come to conclusion that there must be an subject which is always enjoying them object if there is no purchaser who is going to produce so many confectionery things are different paper maybe cards no one because the purchaser is not there if the subject is not there then the object has no value so here it comes in this way it is the pradhana to uncaused eternal worthless this again only present like the Purusha this property is almost like the pollution but this is opposite how it is single it is in sentient and the objective productivity or evolution into a multiplicity is its most important feature and functions now what is that property it say it becomes multiple purusa never becomes multiple this properties multiple it manifests in the British and these pretties the 23 categories we know that different categories that will come so one is a pepti pasta for the effect is always contained in the cause in an applet the state in discrete state and the evolution means only the manifestation of the already existing entity and not production of anything new so it says satkaryavada satkaryavada set Korea badabada miss philosophy and South Korea means this production comes now to conclude we can say there are two things one is consciousness which is present everywhere which is eternal unchanging at the same time another part is there and it is subjective consciousness is a subjective and there is another part that is relative the prakruti again is objective who created this the first verse in the beginning of the discussion we heard that their Supreme Being divided itself in three parts to remember that in three parts and in one is the consciousness pure another the second part is recruited object this capital in his philosophy he said the consciousness is pollution in terminology if the name consciousness revolution Shankara says Hartman there is artment the same consciousness and the Prakriti the inert thing so dear it says this prakruti Shankar is also telling taking a treat also taking almost the same step but it says this Kapila says that it never ends Shankara says it ends this is the difference will come readily discussed if there is a again in the procreative the Sun gunas sattva Raja Tama the frames today we are reading from here that Kapila who was the Lord Supreme Lord Vishnu himself he is trying to teach us a wonderful solving if you read the bhagavad-gita became the Lord Vishnu in the form of Shri Krishna and this Lord Vishnu in the form of Shri Krishna is accepting the Kapila again and again Sanka yoga and that this Sanka it goes only this is nothing but the philosophy and in that philosophy we understand a very simple thing though very complicated to practice understanding is very ok one is consciousness another is inert and how it goes it goes in this way avi mana Homme gada these are the problem so we are nothing but that same consciousness at the same time we are mingled with poor Kathy pocket is inert the property is creating this problem how home god I conclude from this verse and this son he was giving the advice to his mother the bhavati and he said mother toll it is all ok understand but why I cannot get the liberation answering him and saying hard the capillary telling home mama avi Monica three he gama-lobo RDB Mele be Tonia domina shut up or to come also comes among very simple Sanskrit is eight the freed from the last and greed that's all nothing else a homo vimana three a hung and mama I and my mind I and mine this is the only of Iman who is I we can understand we can answer if you ask yourself Who am I they use of an O and the daughter or son son of so-and-so I was brought on such and such date I was born in that particular place but that is not the real answer my why I was born into that particular family no answer actually so ultimately it comes to these the I means the I and me is completely false but it is so much in this world so much I was observing in the nature driving they were showing the Penguins the thousands of penguins one penguin I don't know they were focusing and gay giving the narration one penguin leaving his wife went for catching the fish for the feeding with the fish when it came back he found that the wife thinking that their husband returned and he's sitting with another male penguin what was the result just like our family society only thing they were not having the guns so they were fighting with the flaps and the wings this very strongly fighting so long default and then ultimately and one thing was good then after defeating him the husband said whom you are going to choose and the wife ultimately choose the husband again otherwise that second male was going to die what is this in the dad world the same we think that they don't have any feeling they are having the feeling and what is the feeling I and mine is anybody is going to take any wrong action with my white what the husband will do the same way the husband reacted over there as a penguin I and my everywhere and you must do as a householder you must this iron mine means there's also there's also Dharma that's also religion if anyone is trying to do harm to my daughter to my wife it is mine religion to fight to protect them as that is it when I and mine is there we all know it and from this I in mind came so here the philosophy says the problem is in that only aha mama vimana who tree he just because of the iron mine this hunk ara this ego is acting what comes as an effect gama-lobo RDV male this impurities model he means impurities what is the impurities karma and over to the comma and lower the desire comma and lower the greed the intense form of desire is the greed these an R DV etc and that is not explaining here Beatlemania Dharma Nishita if you can give away that your mind is pure so what is the purity only fasting only going to the holy places only living repeating the name of Allah God hmm the purity comes only after giving up the ego so I and mine should go away I was telling you that story of the turbine in the Sufi they call it dervish that which means a saint or among what is the teaching you must crash your ego in our teaching must crush your ego you are a great speaker right people like you a very good singer people like you but be careful always every time he should think I am doing it as a service to my lord not for myself otherwise again you are going back to that old position built a miada when you give up what this me and mine this comic Roda this caramel over then wanna soothe the mind is then the result oh do come there is no misery and also comes among there is no misery and there is no suffering he'll become eternally happy so that is the teaching of the Kapila to his mother friends we will from the nest we will enter into another great taste good about Gita I was just giving in a side by side one is about Jota and then the Kapila but now we will enter into would the Gita there is also part of our bhagavata thank you very much the latest chant this mantra and we young grandma [Music] oh Linda Lutra murder student dee dee placed away be the song but acrimony shoddy guarantee young-sam Oh God they are harvested data Katina manasa pasyanti yam yoginah yes young thomna be do surah surah ghana the boy does my namaha boom shanti shanti shanti hurry you that brings many of you know that we are going to purchase a property in the downtown Chicago downtown winds the northern part of Chicago City very close to the dark Lincoln Park it's a very nice place almost everything is done is the old church Methodist Church and the coming 25th November you are going to pay them the check and getting the tea so I will request you to pray that the new venture that we are going to take up there it is not that like the here the shrine and temple and puja there mainly will stress on home of harmony that all religion all philosophies are leading to the same goal the conflict just because of misunderstanding as I was telling quoting you that's why I was observing that for last two three days in bricks I was observing how they are training the Turkish the Muslim Sufi Saints just like us and all the teachings just like us and the same thing they were telling break your ego and March with the Prima they say the Lord is the full of love so the Prima love so they again and again same thing we don't understand that dress is different features are different language is different and we are running them oh my god they should not but if we can understand we know the same Road going to the same goal only they are terminologies rod separate nothing else and that is exactly what's ramakrishna practiced all through his life that is exactly what show me Vivekananda propagated and that is exactly what true into his amis sanatana-dharma means embracing everything sanatana dharma is just like the ocean and all the rivers are coming and pouring and making the ocean so this is the beauty to understand that and to practice that we are trying to purchase that property and it is not a gift we have to purchase that and to purchase that the thing always in the beginning we say we are not going to add anything now we are going out to get donations so because to purchase means you have to pay them most of the amount is not collected but for using in this country the rule is the moment you are a new owner you have to follow all the present-day rule so that you have to change these you have to add these you have to make this so many other you people know it so obviously that needs another five hundred to six hundred thousand dollars so that is the other thing that is the only thing otherwise purchasing amount is always there so please pray to the Lord that the effort that we are going to take with all of us together this should be successful over there so thank you but official inauguration will be afterwards I will inform you
