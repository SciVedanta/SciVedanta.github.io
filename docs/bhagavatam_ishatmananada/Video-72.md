[Bhagavatam 077: Transition from Householder to Sanyasi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNU9_Z5WXbw)

namaskar their devotees and friends the sunday discourse on the bhagavata we as you always do we will start with this mantra [Music] sure lord vishnu the master of the whole universe sarva loki kanatham so today to transition from a householder to a sannyasi in the bhagavata we find this and very clearly instructions are there you will study that why the scripture is giving this to develop the human society as we are discussing about this in the uddhava gita particularly this part is known as the uddhava gita and in the uddhava gita lord krishna and it is famous as the last message of the lord krishna he is telling and here we find that he is giving the details how the society should be the first he said i have developed this human society and then i have given made them four classifications one group of people will be considered as the brahmana second group the shatria then the bhashya and the sudra so this way this will continue so this is the the first he said then he said that a individual person his life also should be in four different the portion and every 25 years the total hundred years it was considered that person will survive so first 25 years will be the student's life and then afterwards next 25 he'll be the householder third is the banana prasti returned and preparing for the sannyasa and ultimately it is the sannyasa did you notice that in this whole thing the always slowly the guidance is liberation the bhagavata is a book of liberation it takes as helpless guide us into liberation it is the knowledge pure knowledge but sooked in the syriac of devotion we can say in the copying the words of swami vivekananda it has soaked in the syrup of devotion but it is pure knowledge friends we will discuss the last sunday we have started discussing the respective responsibilities of the four asamas the four asramas what are that brahmacharya garasthabana prison astrama the responsibility of these people but before that it was the burna so barna and astrama these two sanskrit word if you can remember burna according to the capacity of the person he was classified he was in the group so that bharna brahmana shatriya bhusha and sudra now here astrama asami is the period of time that they will get the training this is the human society just born as a human with two hands and two legs and all that i'm a human no it's not considered like that it's through the culture it's to the education and the manifestation of the intellect and then pure understanding of the truth that that is the main so here it says the fast astrama is the brahmacharya and we have already read there were two types of brahmacharya one is upakurbana another naishtika what is the upokurvana they will enter into the householder's life no there is no pressure on anyone if you feel like that with the brahmacharya time he's not only respecting the guru the teacher as god but at the same time he is spending time with the guru till he finishes the study and when he is it is a comprehensive the development capacity we can say the program so he will stay with the guru so obviously maybe his father is a king or a very rich man maybe his parents are not so rich or maybe poor whatever it may be it has no connection with them all the students will be in the same standard and they will learn the same scripture and they will understand according to their capacity and they will utilize that knowledge according to their capacity again so this is the whole way a human slowly developing human birth is very very precious again and again the shankaracharya mentioned and this life we can understand who has created us we can understand our creator we can find our creator we can go back to the source that is kal moksha so we are starting that moksha sastra that is this bhagavata through the knowledge and the brahmacari in the 17th chapter 30th verse it says the brahmacharya should live in the company of the teacher shunning all comforts the physical comforts that takes the mind away so the brahmacari should keep that up that is why very simple food simple dress simple leaving and high thinking a human is slowly developing and in the beginning itself they should understand it and it should continue maintaining the absolute chastity till his study is complete then afterwards if he thinks that you should go and marry and settle as a householder he can and some they have the option if that person decides to dedicate the life for knowledge then he should accept either one term they have used means the promise brihat means the big the big promise that is naishtika brahmacharya the naishtika brahmacharya they are dedicated after they finish the study from the guru and then one group is entering into the samsara another they are going to become the sannyasi so they are bypassing the other two stages that is how the householders life and bana prasti life street they are going to why temperament so that is the way we have to understand it says in the 36 births it says brahmana it is just like the burning fire the brahmacharya means the burning fire because he is completely away though there are so much of attractions are there in this world but he is withdrawing it think of the strength that he is withdrawing his mind not going into that and it is just like the fire whatever comes it burns those who practice a brahmacharya through these serious spiritual practices they burned their store up samskara antakarana this antakarana man buddhist this chitta is known as antakarana the little terminological changes the chitta is nothing but the anta and antha karuna is the storehouse storehouse all the impressions all the lives that we have already spent that is stored over there and sometimes some people can remember like lord buddha he remembered 500 times he was born and everything he remembered and he said that the jataka stories the every time we are born in different form and different situation our mind is recording those things and carrying it with us mind means this antakarana this storehouse a part of the mind this chitta that is purified why no some scholars are there no impressions are there everything is burned because of the tremendous austerity that they practice physical mental spiritual austerities in the bhagavad-gita very clearly is the same bhagavan krishna he had that's why they say jagadguru why the krishna is jagadguru gave everything how one should practice austerity to purify his mind the physical austerity is there then baachika and in thought also the austerity so in the bhagavad-gita if you study you will find the all this and one who is really sincere to realize god should practice the austerity otherwise how can he realize god so this austerity is when the brahmacharya is practicing he become like a blind fire masharadamani devi used to protect the brahmacharyans is to respect the brahmacharyans respecting the brahmacharyans why because they are completely different apparently they are not apparently they are just like any ordinary person so this is the reason after joining in the organization in a monastery one should go away from the families and the friends and the why because they will never ever understand or this man is completely changed for them it will be oh this is the same person we knew him we would do with the friends he is from that house particularly in india that we know each other and they will be all huge family so this is the reason the they always should go the far away place where there is no one known to him so this way they slowly grow this is become purified now mala amala mala means the dirts and now mala is the pure amola so it says in this way how by practicing austerity what are the austerities controlling the tongue they should not speak unnecessarily and the physically they should also practice the austerities etc i am not going into details so we will someday maybe we can discuss so there are two types of students one after finishing the study they go and join in the society and become a householder what they should do what should be the occupation if he is a brahmana he is having that capacity and he will then take up that so we will come to this finishing the study in gurukula if the student wishes to enter the householder's life he should take the permission of the teacher and with his blessing go back and marry a girl who must be younger in age and begin his family life the all details are there those who are interested you can read the uddhava gita it is there in the 17th chapter so obviously the hearty sadhushim bharyam uddahit ajuguptam yabiya seem to byosa tam serbanam anukramath those who settle down in householder's life should earn according to their respective burners those who want to settle as a householder saud rasheem bharyam would be her utbhiya means they will marry saudia the wife should be of the same category otherwise it is very difficult you know the love marriage is good but the problem is only two persons are not married it's a whole family and the family is associated with the society so afterwards it becomes very difficult so we have to understand and adjust of course in the modern days the whole world has become like a one country so we know each other we can appreciate each other and adjust with other cultures also so this is the way it's no problem but sad rishi bharajam but one thing they have said arjug or jagupsitam what is this odjugupsita one who is not criticizing others or constantly fighting with others that type of lady so why because that lady mother is the source is the center of a family the wife today's wife the tomorrow's mother so obviously if that lady is constantly having the craving and constantly quarreling with others creating problem in the family there's so much it they don't understand that breaking a family means they're breaking the tradition and she going out and starting a family again and the next generation they will go out they won't listen to them we have to understand that so ah jugupsitam the lady the girl should be very adjusted very loving way should should keep everyone mother is the main source the why they are telling so much because it is not the father is the mother she keeps contact with all the neighbors and all the relatives and with the children and with the husband and friends of the husband so much that one lady she's the pivotal she's the center she's keeping everything and if she is qualified to develop this wonderful relation that family really grow very happily so that is why they say jabir you seem too biosa and she should be little younger than the person the man and they should continue so how they should earn according to their burna now this is the asrama again and again i am repeating one is a burna and there is astrama so burna is a period of individual human life so that burna and now he is coming to astrama so that burna is now coming what he is doing in the astra the varana is a clan you can say the brahmana shatriya and the astrama is the period now the brahmana we know who can be brahmana we have already studied that now that brahmana what is his temperament study his temperament is to to also give coaching teaching and worship so that is the brahmana so that brahmana according to the respective burner brahmana householder are supposed to earn by performing religious performances pujas etc through teaching and by accepting gifts other burners are not supposed to accept the gift because insult to them gift means the donation but the brahmana can accept the donation the sannyasins can accept the donations but a householder they are not is a businessman if he is going and accepting the donation from some other that means his business is not he is not earning that much money so why should he go he is supposed to give but a teacher a brahmana he is not earning that much so they go and they accept this is the way the whole society was balanced without understanding we just simply complain and we like to break it and so all these things it's not like this the society is a like enough you are the fabrics slowly slowly giving a beautiful form beautiful shape and it's not in a one day thousands of years and they develop a culture that's why xiaomi we become this aid it is culture that withstand shocks the culture is a very important thing you cannot simply break it and if you break it then uprooted personality they do not know what they will do oh i don't understand god so i am not caring for god then i'm i don't have the family i don't like family i don't like the relatives then how you are surviving just all alone going to office earning some money then coming back and preparing some food and then you're sleeping think of your idea that how you are developing there is no adjustment there is no learning there is no friendship so we have to understand this is very very important so i have to accept the one type of life according to my capacity and capability and if we accept the life of a brahmana a very very important thing because he is the teacher all others three groups will go to the brahmana only they'll go to learn from him so brahmana should leave a high moral value and what is the morality god alone is that is highest morality so the brahmana should leave always on that high pedestal but for the survival of the body they should also earn and how by teaching they are the teachers the brahmanas used to teach caitanya mahaprabhu you're such an intelligent person what was his profession teaching he started a school and started giving the classes and whatever little money the students used to bring in those days mainly this to bring the fruits and the vegetables and the rice and and the teacher family is very happy by that way only they used to do but most of the time he's studying concentrating meditating that is the brahmana then come the shattriya and sudra now you may remember a beautiful story it is a fact in the mahabharata in the beginning all they go as a student and live under a teacher so what happened drunkaria he was a brahmana he went to his teacher where he met another person dhrupada drupada was the son of a king he was a prince but in that astrama there is no difference so drupada and the drona they became very fast friends and they were very happy with each other then slowly slowly time passed they grew up and then when they were departing after the graduation the drupada said i am going to take up the responsibility of a king my friend you are a brahmana so you are going back and then settled down as a brahmana if you need anything please don't hesitate to come to me dranacharja came back and he married the sister of kripa charia but you know the kripaj area the another acharya in the mahabharata though they were brahmana but afterwards they took up the job of shatria that is a different story now that this dharmacharya has a son ashatama he was very strong healthy boy he used to play with other boys and other boys they used to drink milk their mothers will call them will give them the glass of milk as always they do mothers they already do now stop the game now stop the play and then come and drink the milk each one is to get the milk except this ashatama so he used to run to his mother and say give me the milk everybody is giving ashathama's mother she was so poor she could not afford the milk but the boy will go on pestering crying and demanding what to do she made some white colored water and gave it to him and said now you drink it this is the milk ashatuma was very happy so he took the glass and went out and along with their friends he was drinking in the same he was telling this is my milk but those they were from the rich family they knew what is milk and what is not this saw that and said oh this is not milk this is only white color water so your mother must have used the dust of the rice and made this it is not milk the boy came back and asked the mother is this milk cow milk then she could not give the answer she started crying in the meantime donation came back he saw he felt really very sorry what a father i am cannot give a glass of milk to my son when he was sad and thinking then his wife suggested why don't you go to your friend because dornacharja many times told the stories to his wife about his friends and he said drupal is my very close friend and dhrupada is a king etc etc so the wife suggested why don't you go to your king you are a brahmana and you have the right to accept the donation now you go and tell your friend that you like some donation to maintain your family there is nothing wrong in it you thought let me go so he went the one mistake he did perhaps when the king was sitting on the throne he went and he called him as he used to call him in the school but this time this man is a king he has his all respect so obviously he felt very angry and he showed that he could not recognize the nacharya drupada told who are you beggar why you are calling me in this way be humble otherwise i'll i'm going to give you the punishment dona church was totally insulted and he thought what is this then he understood because of the wealth and power he has forgotten the good relationship so this always happened donation came back and that moment he took the decision no i am also going to earn money and then i will show that i can also become powerful so donation started from there he started walking towards the kuru rajya so he knew that there is a very powerful kingdom a rich kingdom he will get a job over there he left the brahmana job now this is to be noted the brahmana job the profession of a brahmana that is performing the pujas accepting donation and all those he took up the shatria job the profession of a shatria that means to fight and giving the training and all those things the military training he went and he saw that the story goes on i'm not going in in details and bhisma recruited him as a teacher of the young prince all those princes were there the kuru and pandavas he was the teacher when they learned then they wanted to give the guru dakshina you know this is the tradition i have learned from you oh venerable sir i like to also give you something donation as a guru dakshina you have to go fight with the drupada and you have to bind him and bring him to me that is the best gift that i will accept others they were very much afraid to go to drupada because brother was very powerful it was a very strong kingdom that it was not so easy to go and fight with him and bring them it's not the whole country going only the boys are going the students those who have completed the military education now they wanted to give something so the teacher is asking go and fight with the drona charger dhrupada and bind him bring him here you should not kill him you should arrest him and it's not a simple thing and it's not the vishma and all others are going with their all power no the boys should go the students should go so obviously it was very difficult arjuna told i'm going to do that arjuna was very confident so he went and he challenged the the drupada and afterwards in a single fight so in 12 we can say after that he brought him there so donation was very happy and he used to love arjuna for that so here we notice they can they could change the professions also suppose a brahmana practicing of the brahmana the profession he can go to become a shatriya or can become a basha that permission was there again a shatriya like the vishyamitra he was a shatriya then when he found that he's no match with the brahmana so then he started practicing the austerity to gain that power supernatural power and the power of the scripture then from satria he became a brahmana so it could change and this is the way the whole the society was so now the brahmin householder become ideal householder the householder through his love for knowledge that this brahmin householder they were greatly respected highly respected because of their knowledge and their austere life some of you may know that there's a the beautiful story of buno ram dash bunno he was wild the ram dash used to live in the forest never cared for anything but he was a great scholar for all other thing people used to go to him the ramdash he he could not give anything to his wife not proper clothings or the the jewelleries nothing but the lady was very happy with his wife with his husband with her husband because the husband was a qualified person she was proud that my husband is a teacher though humble the one day so happened the queen of that place she came to bathe in the river and the ramdash wife was also bathing almost in the same place in a little distance the queen noticed that this lady though married is not having any jewelry in in india it is a tradition that the married women should have the jewelries so they she started taunting who is it and look at her the poor lady her husband cannot purchase a little thing and to gift her the jewelries is a must for a married woman the bruno ramdas wife showed her hand and showed that as a few and the trades were there the raid trades were there on her wrist and she showed that and told this is more the powerful than your husband's gift more worthy than your husband's escaped she became insulted she came back and complained to the king when the king inquired and came to know that lady was the wife of buno ramdas then the king said to his queen my god you do not know how respected person is he his wife you must go and bake pardon from her so that was the society high respect for the educated people qualified people austere people holy people that was the indian society so this is the way the koth householder their king their rulers their military so they go in that way bush householders taking care of the economy and the business and sudra householders they serve the society so they could change this way there are now some common duties for all the astronomers what are the common duties now it is clear the brahmana then the shatriya vaisha and sudra according to their profession according they were educated in the same way now the professions are different but the whole society should practice one type of morality to develop the spirituality that was also listed what are those socham cleanliness the first thing the cleanliness you can understand in the very early society the people the how they used to live so it was thrust on them first you should be very clean every time thrice you should bathe otherwise you are not allowed in the respected society so shoucham aachamanam you should clean your mouth sanam then bathing shot means cleanliness the house and the dress and the body should be clean slaanam bathing sunda uppasti mama archanam regular prayer and god's puja mama archana mumma is the god teeth sheva you must visit the holy places japa repeat the name of god auspicious those are something are there that you should not go and touch all the time because another contamination and all those so maybe a dead body a dead animal you should be a little away from that so auspritia you should not go abraksya a food which has gone bad should not eat that and also ashamabhasya you should not use the bad words bharjanam when you are behaving with people should not use the bad words you will notice that educated people and you know the elites of the people they know the bad words but they will never the filthy words they don't use it the cultured people don't use it but if you go down to the lower grade people almost all the time they are going on using that filthy words why this is the difference of culture the culture purified the mind and slowly slowly the human developed the control of the mind so the 17th chapter 34 verse and also 35 four astronomers all the four asthma's people of the four astronomers they should practice this that they should be clean all the time the yesterday the a few guests came four of them and they were telling swamiji the moment we entered into the the center the vivekananda center here and it's so welcoming everything is so neat not so clean and everything so properly maintained the moment we entered we felt ah this is very welcoming so cleanliness of course credit goes to our the volunteers and the brahmacharians so they are cleaning it every time maintaining it so this is the way always if you go to bellarmore any ramakrishna mission astrum any asthma our temple all the time clean that is the first thing swami vivekananda taught you must have to keep everything neat and tidy very clean and all other things that they are practicing now that is the physical practices now this suddenly the god is giving another task and that is very subtle and that is for the mind you have to see me the god in every being all all the asama people that means the whole society should practice this the cleanliness washing the mouth and bathing and regular practices of the puja taking the name of god all these things will be there and not using the filthy words let me controlling your anger these are of course the external and what internal immediately it is taken to the highest advaitic ideology see me in every being so your mind should be controlled so many different thoughts are going on should be controlled so many times you are tempted to say something you should control kaya back back control and then kaya the body so the control of the mind control of the words of the tongue and also the physically you should not behave in that way say yama this is spirituality the whole society they should practice this that's why the rishi arabinda said hinduism is not a religion it's a way of life sometimes some people they misunderstand it misinterpreted that is not a religion it is of course religion and the religion that is helping us to live in that religion and this is the religion physically and mentally completely pure now another must performance for all the asthmas has been described in 50th birth and that is pancha yagya and that is not for the all the astronauts say sorry it's not for the all the awesome it's for the grievous these is a must perform the grease these should perform the panchayat sometimes say panchama pancha means five yang means performances spiritual performances so this pancha mahajan what is that householder now we are talking about the householder first the brahmana householder what they should do shatria sudra then there's a common some practices then comes these also the householders whoever may be brahmana they should practice in this way what is that rishi yankya the read scripture and holy books regularly daily you have to read one must read holy book one must read you will find that in the islam also they always insist that you must read quran christianity always insists that you must read bible and the hindus they always read the either the gita or the ramayana and many others and nowadays people they like to read the gospel of sirama krishna so that is the all scripture one must read we must remember and respect the ancestors because we should become humble to them whoever they were because of them we are here now so that is called the human is grateful grateful to whom rishis why they have given the very high morality to us so reading the scripture means constantly remembering those moralities and then our mind will be on that plane remembering our ancestors why because of them we are then respect to god by performing puja so almost all household the hindus they're having a small place that's called shrine personal shrine in the morning before doing anything they'll burn in incense thing and keep over there when for all the folded hands they will pray oh god please save me save my family and also save the society and be kind on us like that they will pray every day one should do it's not very difficult this panchama is not very difficult anyone can do only if you have that in the inclinations no i don't believe in this okay we are not talking for those people bhutan one should offer food to animals and birds so how in this in this society if we are not helping the animals and birds how they will survive and if they are not surviving in the naturally in the nature if the changes are coming will be affected so this is the reason so long back even the time of krishna and before him these are the things it was a must you must offer some food to the animals and birds and then come nuri yagya you have to donate to help the poor and needy and in the society there may be some people who are failure so they need some help some food so we have to take care of that this is not the sannyasin's duty this is the duty of the householders and the 17th chapter in verses 51 52 53 and 54 the lord advised the householders not to be attached with the relatives and friends too much so i am not reading those those who are interested you can read that the money that he earns judiciously he is earning the money judiciously in a proper way should be used for the maintenance of his family and for the philanthropic work so that is the injunction he should always remember the tempora temporariness of this world and constantly remember god by this way he will become pure this is the period 25 years period of the householder's life so 25 years is the brahmacharya but it says you they they usually they used to marry at the age of 18. up to six they'll be with the mother and the parents then from 6 to 16 with the the teacher then after coming back settling down it takes another four years so three to four years there because they will be settled and started earning money they cannot marry depending on the father's earning so they should earn start earning then they will be married so we can say from 18 or from 20 years up to 50 years this is the period of the householder and then they should prepare for the banaprastha we will come to that a householder after worshiping me the god through his householders duties may retire and prepare for the highest and the final stage sannyasa so it goes in this way and to introduce the third astra the lord said it is the 18th chapter first verse sahih means the longevity tritium the third that means from 50 to 75 these 25 years what they should do they should retire at the age of 50. now most of these trees the retirement age it was 60 now it has become 65 naturally the medicine is good the health consciousness has come longevity so that is not the question question is a period of time will come af the retirement the banana prasti should decide to live a retired life go to a secluded place why because with the family now they are withdrawing themselves if they live with the son daughter grandchildren they will be never to endure their mind it is not compulsory those who can for them only they should after the retirement they should go maybe with his wife or if the wife is not willing keeping her at the care of the sun so they should go to the this human life it was this way slowly they should prepare for the final mana period is paint with great austerity physical and mental within these 25 years one should detach oneself from all the worldly objects and contracts on the earth so all these things slowly slowly see how ultimate is the sannyasa sannyasa samyak nyasa the instructions that has been given in the 18th chapter verses 1 to 11 may not be possible to practice for the modern day people but if you are interested you can read from the uddhava gita it is in english if you want our book stores are having the book the uddhava gita translated by swami madhavanandaji and the 13th chapter of that book it is there i'll just give a hint what type of austerity one should practice because they used to live in a happy life in the family now they should practice panchagani five fires the sun will be on the top and the four fire you should lit and sit in the center mahasaratha mani devi perform that panchagan it is not so easy so what happens you have to spend the whole day sitting over there the moment the sun is over there on the head maybe at 12 o'clock and you are sitting there fasting after bathing and go on taking the name of god slowly that heat burning your skin but you have to go on repeating the name of god for getting your body consciousness that is the main idea so panchayat is a very very hard and then another that's called abraham akasha means the promise of practice you can say that this practice what type of practice when it is that rain is torrential rain you should go and stand over there without showing any weakness so you're bathing with the rain maybe for hours so by that way you have to prepare your body another udda means the water basa staying in the winter time you should go down up to your neck and then stand over there in that chill water very cold water and take the name of god constantly forgetting the pain that you are feeling in the body so what is the idea why this type of tremendous no don't try to practice because it is very difficult i am not asking you to do that many of us won't be able to in those days it was there but those who are strong if they like to withdraw the mind from the body panchama a pancha panchagni sorry panchagni this is the tremendous thing this panchagni not only just sitting in the in the fire no nothing like that you have to forget that you are sitting inside the fire not that you are bathing under the rain you have to forget the body consciousness that is the idea and also going down in the chilled water you have to forget so this thing if we can practice some other way for getting the body consciousness again and again that will surprise that will be sufficient so this way one should practice withdrawing the mind from the body and that pure one pointed mind we should give to become a sannyasi yet it says in the whenever you feel like giving up the moment you think that i like to give away all that i am having do that that is the time for you but just leaving the household is not helping you for what you are leaving god realization you have you should have the pure conception clear conception about the god realization attacks the at the atma the knowledge of the self you should have that clear idea then only it will be beneficial otherwise simply living and going away sometimes people they become emotional oh i should go away and then roam like this no that is so many people that do that is not helping you the globe tartars there are some i met one gentleman he has come with the cycle and roaming around all there are so many people are doing like that that is all different things it's all good but the thing is sannyas is completely different thing you are going to give away all desires all attachment and becoming only god centric god god and god nothing else friends i think in our next class we will discuss about the sannyasa the beautiful way but i like to read one poem before i conclude when swami vivekananda was here in america and in the august 1898 you know the u.s it is he was in 1895 he was in the thousand island park i don't know how many of you have visited that i went with some of our devotees as a they are maintaining it as it is a thousand island park the beautiful where swamiji state the small house and he stayed with only 12 or some few numbers and gave them the high advaita the inspired talks the book is there and there he composed the song of the sannyasins let me read the first the song as uh first poem first para wake up the note the song that had its birth far off where worldly taint could never reach in mountain caves and glades of forest deep whose calm no sign for lost or wealth or fame could ever dare to break where role the stream of knowledge truth and please that follows both sing high that note sannyasin bold say um there's a 13 verses he composed about there and in the last verse he said does day by day till karma's powers paint release the soul forever no more is birth nor i nor thou nor god nor men the i has all become the all is i and please no thou art that sannyas in bold [Music] for a beautiful i will once again we may read and if you are interested you can purchase the the poems of swami vivekananda he was a great writer and in that way so the next class i think that is on the ninth sunday we will uh that will dedicate to sri krishna because the krishna janmaster we will be very near so we will dedicate to krishna because we are reading his teachings so who is this krishna we will discuss on that and then again the next sunday may be the 16th on that we will discuss about the sannyasa and the knowledge of vedanta knowledge of bhagavata sannyasa and the knowledge of bhagavata in that way you will try to discuss thank you very much any questions asking swamiji thank you so much for your words can you tell us a little about the austerities to be followed to purify the mind tanya we will discuss it maybe in our 16th class if you please continue the austerity means you know we have the nature and nature is constantly provoking us to react controlling those is austerity now somebody is blaming me or criticizing me or abusing me i can also go and fight my nature will provoke me to do that but i am not going to do that controlling that is called austerity i feel like eating something but no i should not eat today i am not going to drink even a drop of water i should control my thirst and hunger austerity so like these when the nature is provoking you to go and react if you can control swami vivekananda say it is easy to move away in the the hearts but it's very difficult to control the rain and keep it stand in one place very difficult so that is the way we can the controlling the mind is called austerity we may discuss some other time householders as we discussed the shrimah the srimad that is when we are after the education you are marrying and settling down then when you are retired then from the retirement life you try to prepare yourself for the sannyasa and sannyasa means completely ego free we will discuss about that the completely ego-free householders we have to have the ego and our own respect so obviously that is the preparation then when at that age you have to prepare try to leave alone as maximum possible you know our that swamiji bhashananda that he purchased almost 80 acres hundreds acres of land and he constructed small small houses over there and the michigan ganges and he thought that after the retirement people will go over there like that but it is not possible because the place is very isolated very far but people need at that age immediate medical care and also so their sons and the daughters can come and visit like this like this i have a mind in this place if we can construct one that the house may be there some of the rooms will be there this type of people after completing their householder's life if they like to come and stay permanently they can stay our shrine is there library is there and we have the garden they can help us but that will be the preparation for the sunya's life so this many places they are developing like this from the samsara to the sannyasa in between you have to prepare yourself it's called banana prasta if not followed previously how to practice unselfishness very good question and practicing unselfishness see that when you are supposed sharing something with other but without any expectation that the person whom you have given something the gift will be remembering you or thank you or grateful not doing that that is called unselfishness the practicing like that suppose you are helping your relatives don't expect anything in return even they are criticizing you even there and forgetting the help that you have done you are not reacting that is called unselfishness and the pure love means the the same thing i only love oh god whether you love me or not it doesn't matter so when we love god we expect that everything will be good to me i worship god and i took the name of god why this problem will come to me not like that no bargaining and no business with god that is called pure love i only love god but how you will love some good qualities if it is the ramachandra if it is the krishna if it is suramar krishna if it is caitanya mahaprabhu the qualities of that personality if you like you can love and in that love if there is no expectation in return pure love we can do it the next question question is is it possible to be spiritual by sitting at home and praying instead of going to mundane of course the one can become spiritual and what is the spirituality the worldly war world is there and spirituality is there this is the two thing the spirituality means that which is not connected with this world whether connected with this world means if you are hankering for this world i want name i want fame i want appreciation i want the all these things that is called worldly things exactly opposite spirituality anyone can practice anywhere and from the householder's life staying in home that you can also do whatever you are doing don't expect anything against in return swamiji said unselfishness is more pain but we don't have the patience to practice it if we become unselfish and perform the action we truly get lot but don't expect whether you are going to get it back in return or not maybe god forbid the people will misunderstand you people will criticize you whatever the good thing you wanted to do but in return don't expect anything whether they are praising or criticizing you know what you have done is to please the god and god is jagannatha he is having two big eyes he observed he sees he knows and his blessings will surely come whether you expect it or not it will come and that is called spirituality thank you very much so let us chant this mantra and conclude [Music] [Music] foreign
