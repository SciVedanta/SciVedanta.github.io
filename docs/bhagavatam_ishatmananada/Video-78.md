[Bhagavatam 069 : Go Beyond The Gunas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyVwX2foTbU)

good morning dear devotees and Friends that has begin the sunday discourse with a beautiful stotra Shanta karim pooja gursha annum but the mana Suresh Rashad harem Gurgaon Assad regime made a Birnam shuhang Lakshmi contem Kamala jnanam you give he the Anagha miam bundy vishnu m-- babu-bhaiya harem Sarah Valu quicker now [Music] is it quiet Shanta Okara his nature is completely quiet why why there is no disturbances because there is no gunas gunas are not activated over there inside the guard what are the gunas we will discuss today we have to go beyond the guna that is the teaching of our Shri Krishna so that guna we have to go beyond this way if we see the God is shantih shantih means tranquil peaceful why because there is no action how there is an action because the route of action are the gunas he's lying on the pooja pooja gosh Ayane is lying on a snake there is a symbol of yoga how can you control those things because of the yoga complete yoga that is the way we can control then Padmanabha the Padma the Lotus is a symbol of bhakti the devotion the God by that way symbolizing everything so let us begin the go beyond gunas the bring this whatever he was the disciple and trained up and also follower of shri krishna we are reading the last message of sri krishna and after this hour the years long study of the bhagavata will aim I only took up all the guiana the mostly the discussions on the giana the teachings of sri krishna on the basis of the knowledge and major portion of that bhagavata the gradebook is of that knowledge so here we find he is talking with the would double his friend his follower his disciple but whatever was very much attached to Sri Krishna and Shri Krishna decided to give up his body because his mission was over so he thought that now I should go would the was not ready at all we have already read all those things discussed now how to stop with dhaba the god first told him look good ever don't think that I am this body only as well c'mon see Ramakrishna he said to march out of the Mona Devi also the same way when the mother was crying because the part after the passing away of vagabonds ramakrishna and she was all alone sitting and then crying salam o krishna appeared before her and said what is it why you are crying like this you should understand there's a body that I have left but I am eternal it is just like going from this room to that room so this is the truth there is no end of it there is no date actually but that is a different discussion now whatever is so much attest to is framed and philosopher and his beloved God Krishna the Krishna told see don't think in that way that I am this body only I'm the art man I'm everywhere I have created this universe all this gianna the same Krishna gain in one told the dubba you better follow the path of the the that Gopi knees of the Brindavan what is that complete faith and dedication and love for Krishna now the word ever got confused just now you told that you should not dedicate yourself to this body and now you are telling again so what is this so we know that when the Krishna was telling like that he said would never got confused and vagabond Krishna told that he himself is immanent and transcendent the God is immanent and God is transcendent here comes Saguna and Nirguna these are the two sanskrit words guna guna means qualities and this is the beautiful way how the sanatana dharma are the barren thick dharma they explained the creation the creation from where from God how God can create because God has the power and which is known as Maya what is that Maya it is their three gunas three qualities what are those three qualities Shakti Raja and Tama good and good and bad mixed and completely bad so good good and bad mix 10 so this Sutra Raja and Tama another permutation and combination of this three and all these beings are liked if only good was there like the sanaka sananda sanatana they are only purely good but didn't do anything Lord wants the play Lords once the game he wants to create and there will be so many different things that is his enjoyment that's called in sanskrit lila divine play as a naturally in the divine play only one kind of now if you go to any military barrack same type of dress same type of haircut same type of people rooming in the beginning you will find out so now then afterwards when you were the era field borer they're all same but if you come to the marketplace different color different type of people and some are fatty sammartino some are well-built and good the varieties gives us the enjoyment similarly God wanted the variety and for the variety he created these three gunas the Gunners are coming gunas are the qualities out of which that power that material out of which God is creating this universe this is very important so these are the gunas that he saw me be waken under many of you know those who are the followers of ceramic is no tradition he has composed a beautiful virgin eighteen we can say a beautiful hymn he has composed and his famous sr3 Kuragin is the evening prayer and there he is mentioning at the sea Ramakrishna what is this Ramakrishna near guna guna Moy look at it one is near guna no qualities and that time he is only pure Brahmin absolute Brahman and that supreme self is not creating not destroying or not doing anything that is the goal of every human life we have to go to that situation that condition we are in reality debt but the God has created us and mixed with the gunas and now sometimes we are very good friendly loving sometimes we are angry and sometimes we are dull so this why a person behaving three different ways because of this gunas so today we will read in that way and see this the gunas and from the guna we find the Brahman when not creating keep all its creative power in equilibrium now the question is when there is no creation is there that gunas are not there it is there but we deem the God and in an equilibrium situation position nothing is happening the yesterday is the first time a private company that say in the rocket and naturally all over the world there is a enthusiasm is a usually the government they do but the first time the Tesla company they have done it it's a great leave now slowly slowly the ordinary people will purchase a ticket and go and see how the moons and all that it's a great thing for the human history and it goes on the creation but when the rocket is not there no function the huge factory closed the scientist they have closed down their computers the maybe they have gone back to their homes and none was there how will be the situation not that they don't know how to send a rocket they know they know how to make a rocket they know but no activity and that is the actual condition of equilibrium when it's called dump shall complete destruction it is not destruction going back to the original form that is only a more apt will be if we can remember when you go to the cinema the movie and when you go over there we see the people are coming and then all are very happy and also excited to see the movie then what suddenly the musical start light will come after some advertisement the movie will start the whole creation and after maybe one or two hours or three hours when the movie is over and when the children I have seen the ladies also they'll be popcorn they will go on munching the popcorn and I'll go very good after that what when everybody goes away if you just quietly sit over there you'll find all other things are there but no activity and that is the condition the Brahmin goes back to his original self no creation but we cannot call it as a destruction is going back to the source that's why in the Hindu Pantheon they say Brahma Vishnu and Mahesh are the same God in three different form and doing three different type of work Brahma is creating Vishnu Raghavan he is sustaining and then Sheba is destroying and this world when he's used the Shiva is destroying the some of the shiva bhaktas they don't take it properly the WYD our God should destroy destroy means we know the date and all that but it is not like that it goes back to the original and Shiva is a yogi he takes back all the activities he controlled the whole activities that is why Shiva the great guard Mahadeva so different way the hour the philosophy our religion the sanatana-dharma Vedantic Dharma they go on telling this truth the same God he's sOooo guna and also need guna Bhagwan Shree Krishna when we consider Swami Vivekananda considered the God himself Neera guna is not having any qualities and the same time when he is creating guna moy so that is the two and it goes in this way sri krishna also that is there is a chapter 13 chapter 11 book the eighth it says that in the mother one and the G sometimes some devotees requested me to mention that too in the modern and edgy suitable Gita it is the 8th chapter but the original the parameter it is 13 chapter the sloka is sautron Raja Tommo ET guna booty natural mana set Raja Tama et guna booty nature art wanna certain anata mo and not satin Cetina je veux he now he says shutter agent amma belong to the intellect but not to the real self but when they go back to the real self what happened they just how can you explain it is there God can create any time but at the same time when it is inside that Brahman it is Brahman no activity so this is the point we have to understand it is there anytime God can create God can sustain God can destroy its all-powerful one of the Patels that we call as the God is all-powerful and this is the quality but it is not up the Artman he's not of the self when he creates he separate himself out of his own creation and when he's separating how he's separating he's giving three gunas into them in that creation when separating himself from that this is the situation this is the position now we being created being but very intelligent human being and because of our the desires desire to know the truth all of us now all over the world you are observing or listening this sir the bhagavata why you could see a movie you could do something else because you love religion why you love religion because you want peace happiness joy eternal and when you were thinking in that way you want the guidance and what is the guidance the problem deceptor raja Tama these three gunas can we take it out by we cannot go to a hospital and ask the doctor to operate and take out no it is the air now the realized people like the Krishna himself the god himself is telling but it is not in the art man had it been in the art man no question of destroying us because it is not in the art man we can destroy it now the king is their king is good but some of his people the officials they are bad when the King comes to know about it King can remove them but if the bad qualities they're already in the king who will remove the King till he dies there is no chance for the others they will have to suffer so the same way because it is not in the original source that is the Brahman it can be destroyed and daddy say is how to destroy increase the sattva-guna God has given the sattva-guna we will discuss in details what of the sattva-guna is etc increase the sattva-guna and then you destroy the Rajah and Tama scepter Raja Tama three are there within us and if we are increasing the Tama guna then all our friends and relatives and neighbors they try to shun oh my god this boy whom we see he was so young and so good now he has become like a devil they'll be going away you were a little bit completely different the devilish type of people will be your company and all the bad things that will be your joy so that is how to destroy that by increasing the good quality and no other way this he says in this structure Raja Tama et guna booty it is in the intellect not your heart mana it is not actually original and wouldthe means is a created thing but the itself is going to be destroyed some day so obviously if we try we can destroy it what we are going to destroy quality what is that quality satureja Tama how we will destroy Rajjo an Tama by increasing citta but again subtly is also equality and we have to go beyond quality go beyond gunas that is the sub topic that we are discussing now this is the last phase I have destroyed the Roger ego I have destroyed the Tama the anger and last and all those things now I'm a very good person and that is also a bondage that is also a bondage and this is very subtle point majority of the sod occurs the spiritual practitioners they come and they end over here why they feel joy they feel happiness and they stop over here majority of the philosophies also they're satisfied with the the heavenly joy there it completes is a haven but it's also a goona it is also a quality it's also temporary then what happens when all the good qualities are exhausted when you become bored with all the good things again desire come to go down and that is the reason in the Upanishads says naka she preached it a secret e underwood way Imam locum Hinata Rama be shanti they talked about the karma fella the guna is also a karma fella that is the reason Lord Krishna he is mentioning over here on yachts atoms Athena Hanyu in or destroy or remove the satyr truce at their tribal ye but once the dam Krishna gave a beautiful example he said in those days in other villages even today if you go to the Indian villages you'll find that rustic thing is not like America village and naturally if you go there our thoughts are there here and there and when the people are going at all stick to and what to do how to take out the thorn and you break another guitar and use that to take the tar that is sticking in your the body use the second thorn and then are you going to keep the second tour because it helped you to remove the first one no you threw both of them the similar way if you are using chakra to destroy Tama then Roger you have to destroy citta also how I am not doing anything I'm not doing anything you you you ow ow ow God you are doing everything not me not me not me all the priests all that the people they will come like a man they will come and say you have done you have done no you go at all no I have not done anything the moment the work is over just resign that is the reason we have to study the life of Swami Vivekananda is Roger and sattva and then such was beyond beautiful in his own life we can see sometimes he used the tamo-guna Elsa if you read the biography of Swami Vivekanand he went and stood against others and he fought and he controlled them but for the good good reason of course use the Tama but not we cannot say that he was angry he showed that anger so the Raja was there I have to do this I have to fight the one gentleman wrote against him and he wrote let the devil die in hunger and cold when he was coming to America those who know the Xiaomi G's life you can understand his reference and Xiaomi we began the afterwards wrote back to his friends he said this devil has not born he called himself as Ana born to destroy in cold and hunger I have a message to give like this is 8 the tremendous rajo-guna when he went back to India when what was done when the establishment of the ramakrishna mission that part of swami vivekananda the Pioche wat occur and then he went beyond that sure optical sir no Prabhu this is not me this is not me this is not me he's completely surrender to the God and he became God himself so subtle a good quality and going beyond that good quality again how completely dedicating the ego and becoming God himself so this he says sat Trina or not mo and yacht or not mo Tommo and other that means Raja and Tama hun yacht they used the word Anja they have to kill is very difficult the Tama on go Raja one go for little little thing we have if you look at the devotee forget about other things other people who never care for the religion forget about them very few who says that they are devotees they are trying to realize God they believe in God existence of God look at their life even then a little thing happen immediately angry and you will never forget that you insulted me whole life do you remember the Tama is there Raju is there you to remove that and septums obtain achiever he and this is the way we should go Shri Krishna in his last message to double and through him to the posterity taught that same Supreme Being at it will create the goal of the created being is to go back to the Supreme Being the param Brahma so here in botando Sutra he says Baqarah birth teacher taught aji City AHA the brahma sutra also supporting the same idea but the question is how and bhagavata also says grita my are goona serra da ba guna swat aha he's creating how taking the help of the Maya and this struggle saga means this creation swagger with war it becomes the heaven we don't want that is the world is the are the creation it is greater my are goona the guna of the Mayas sir God are begun aha all these beings were created now the question is how to go beyond as we'd already discussed we have to control the tamo-guna by raja guna you are feeling sleepy then one of our brahmacari mr. feel sleepy Edwin's sitting for meditation then a senior Bangkok's team you should not sit over there you rather go on walking around the temple and take the name of God but never go back to big the Roger I am going to do the Japan and I must do it and as because when I see it I feel sleepy drowsy okay I get up I walk and then I take the name of God so in the balloon mode huge big temple used to walk all around again and again for one hour taking the name of God after practicing 17 days the drowsiness went away the through the Raja Tama was removed and jealousy and anger and lust and all those things you have to use the Tama no I am NOT going to do it in every religion you will find they always inspire people to fast in Hinduism in the Islam and Christianity in almost all religion why the fasting means you are overtaking Tama with the Roger Roger the dictating the mind is dictating I am NOT going to drink I'm not going to eat but the body is going on dealing no no I'm thirsty I'm hungry I must eat I must drink but over that you're telling no it is not possible I'm not going to eat a drink and that is the fasting the debt oopah vasa Hoopa varsa in sanskrit decay fasting the translation the window when they are fasting HUPO bar sir in Sanskrit and it gives another meaning you have to leave near guard and naturally will forget all of the worldly things so the food and drink and all of the comforts you are forgetting that particular day why pure you were sitting read close to God and he was listening to God you are looking at God your bars are your staying oopah is very close near to God oopah vasa now I am constantly going on thinking you know I am fasting you know I am fasting that is not trusting and going on telling everybody announcing everyone that I'm do I am very hungry but still I am NOT eating is of no use you have to take a Sat wha we have to take the name of God or a good heart on which you are failing and keeping your mind and forgetting your hunger and thirst that is the true sense of practicing fasting and rajo-guna again with SATA guna after practising some time with all those then you think why I am doing it and fasting but why for God so I will see it in the shrine or in the temple and whole day I will read holy book or do the mantra japa or meditation and by that way you are controlling the Tama you are controlling the Raja ulcer how by using your sattva-guna that's then after that that's a - a guna how we are going to overcome you are going on thinking that I am the self I am the self who is going to meditate well if I say that I am meditating there is eye there is no eye at all if there is no I how can I meditate on whom I am going to meditate I need a mind to conceive that someone that is me the ego meditating on something that is God when that is not there who is meditating on whom he is meditating and why so that is the austere Bhakra gita when you are studying so every first Saturday I give the talk in the Hindu temple lemon dr. bockris Amita that is the height beyond Satta buna up to scepter guna we can understand majority of the philosophy they talk about the citta guna but going beyond Satta guna as vagabonds Ramakrishna turned is has began the gianna is satra knowledge is sattva beginner beyond that beyond that the Sat WA and what is that you cannot explain you can only feel realize enjoy in that condition what a scepter gunas in the bhagavad-gita I will take the help of the bhagavad-gita to understand this and it says bhagavad-gita 14 chapter 50 verse sattva Raja Tommo ET guna prakriti's am baba as in the Bhagavad same in the bhagavad-gita this is the product of the prakruti now again once again to understand because it's all Sanskrit words so suddenly when you listen you won't be able to understand what is going on prakruti is Maya again prakruti is the power of God so it may be called as Maya it may be turned as prakruti different people they gave that type of terminologies and what is this Procrit e the three gunas combination of three gunas sattva Raja and Tama but it belongs to prakruti and prakruti belongs to God and God has that power and with the power god separate himself for the creation separate himself the Artman the Brahman the supreme being separate himself as if the same way if you go to the Tantra param Maha Shiva Sadashiva Kali I said in many times the paramus eva is the Parana brahma then Sadashiva is a Saguna Brahma or the Ishwara and the activity that is the Kali that is Maya are the prakruti so by this way we can understand me but don t maha-baho the the enum abiam the album the Septuagint immodest rig owners are born opportunity they bind the Artman in the body this question also a mystery and in the philosophy they will go on attacking the Advaita Vedanta if this body which is inert the mind which is inert intellect also inert so this mom the me and mind when we say all inner just like the wood just like the stone then how you I am talking how I am cognizing how I am moving now other things cannot do it then the answer is within you there is the art man which has manifested and with the power of the art man the Atman is a consciousness how the consciousness can be attached with this inner thing consciousness is like the light inert is just like the Derk and darkness and light how they both come together that is not possible this it is possible how through the gunas said this effect of the gunas sattva Raja and Tama release a parent is not real and the consciousness that we feel that is also a per and not real reflected what is the reflection original consciousness reflecting on our intellect not on the body not on other parts of the mind it is on the intellect it is reflecting the bit under the books they always say like that and by that way you feel that you are conscious you feel that you are conscious so the as if the consciousness is bound with the inner the body and mind because of the reflection by that way only and the same heater 14 chapter six verse it says tetra satrom near mala Prakash Occam UNAM I am su casa minha but naughty Gianna Sangeeta Anagha the Onaga means the clear our Arjuna o sinless one Krishna said that receptor Mirabella what is the Cytron it is stainless need mala need madam is clear pure and in the water sometimes in the dirt will be there something mixed in the water and some very clear water and in sanskrit is a near mala no mala nah mala ET near mala the need mala is that stainless prakash Ockham it is the lumen alone aluminous why because i can understand i can think about it when the all of you are listening your understanding it how it is possible because of that art man and in that art man sattva-guna if the sector guna was not there it not possible for people to understand the philosophy and other things also scientist there understand the mathematician their understanding why because of the Saguna that without the scepter gana that is the quality of the sattva-guna that it can illuminate can give you the understanding and free from evil they will never do anything wrong they become very unselfish type of people and in the in sometime in the newspaper in the news media you come to know about so many people they're so good not that they're billionaires or millionaires but they're donating their whatever the little they can they're donating for the betterment of others where the billionaires and millionaires are counting oh my god if I give the in donation how much we leave then on that they're going on counting but this man may be hardly having 5,000 from 5,000 it gives $1,000 in charity why SATA Hoonah feels for the others if suppose I die what is going to happen to my 5,000 you'll think in that way so that is called sattva-guna the sattva-guna sukhasan gained about knotty they're very happy sukkah song ghena there the company is the happiness and by that they're bound so but that is a very higher standard of binding that bondage is very high standard very high standard not in the Tama or the Raja Raja people they also help and sattva-guna being stainless they do like that and attachment to the knowledge they would like to know about God that's why as I was telling Raghavan C Ramakrishna he said those in the world they will have to suffer according to a karma fella then one person told in if it is so then why should we do good work Salaam o Krishna said but that is not applicable to the doctors the devotees the good people the swapped iike minded people that rule doesn't apply over here even if it is that there is very less very less so the bondage goes away because knowledge and what is the knowledge knowledge about God every day every time whoever is talking about God you are eagerly listening you are reading books so obviously you know many things why because in the past birth all of us we had developed the citta guna and because of the Sattler guna we have come and become the monk of the ramakrishna order there's also past karma fella and good luck we can say and you people though you are having many other options you are also keeping time to listen to the discourses pondering about on that those things why citta guna again what is the word the rajo-guna in the fourteenth chapter seventh verse of the bhagavad-gita rajo-guna creates in mine tremendous desire that bind the soul with the body not you're gonna means desire desire desire never-ending desire one after another desire why I need the name I need the fame I need the and the prosperity and that is the reason there's sometimes nowadays there is no king even the kings at the earth they are not very that way very active some of the places are there Kings are there but majority of the world a democratic and then the people choose a leader and he takes all the decisions think of it one single person taking the decisions for the millions wonderful situation wonderful position he is the first man first citizen of that country still not happy why Raja guna tremendous Raja guna desire desire desire I have to be the only one if you read the history and there are in the I was yesterday I was observing the history cooked Kings after Kings game and the each and everyone thought that I am going to be permanent and they made the pyramids they made these they made dad if you go to the China the Kings when they passed away they took so many soldiers along with them kill them so that King will get the company and their wives and other madness why because ignorance I this body and I the art man at two different thing that is exactly what the Krishna is telling over here this rajo-guna it binds tremendous desire the bind the soul and whatever the tamo-guna tamo-guna is born from ignorance it's stupidly the stupefy the mind by miss comprehension tiredness and sleep this is called tamo-guna stupefy MOA no Augusta that is their new Raja he he Donna Gama Tristram Shankar Acharya he is mentioning the Mohan is the word the denouncing till you have to beyond this more he's deluded he do not understand anything what is going to happen afterwards there is a delusion so this is called the Mohan and he becomes miss comprehension miss pramada pramada he goes on thinking that he is going to enjoy but in reality he suffers so that is the problem and I really really think if these leaders if they think I have become the leader of this society for a limited period of years okay five years ten years fifteen years now let me do all the good works for the betterment of my people and the best wait is possible not by hearting or criticizing others it is possible at least give them proper education and they will help themselves I cannot solve all their problems it's not possible give them education then they will help themselves give the opportunity and those who are doing bad work as a king as the ruler at the administrator I should shun them I should punish them so everyone can feel that I have an opportunity and I have to true lies that opportunity but my period is over girls gone next whether this will continue or not I don't care so that is the attitude one should have let's call swatter and raja mixed when the Raju and Tama mixed we see all over the world people are having like that rascal Roger and Tama mixed aye-aye-aye so these three gunas we have to go beyond friends we are really studying a very very important thing for our life forget about others those of us who are interested to go beyond and then realize the brahman what we should do we should be careful about the three gunas prakruti or Maya has no beginning why because it is from inherent from the God itself the God has no beginning and his power is also not having any beginning but the God has no end it is eternal but its power has an aim and how it is eternal sometimes they say it is eternal how it is eternal when one suppose a understood the Maya and then analyzing the Raja and Tamar and satra goes beyond sattva he's free Maya then gives in freedom but not all so Maya continues it goes on like these these days the same way when the grandfather whatever the grandfather did the father did almost the same thing and then the his son also did the same thing almost thing they're almost the same way when the situation changes but almost the same type of with almost all the young people they are very fond of the bicycles and then when they grow then it will be something else something else if you go and ask and take the interview everybody did the same thing so that is called the Maya but someone suddenly like the Lord Buddha he said enough the licchavi that was the plan all they were hankering to become the king but this Gautama is original name Gautama he said no father I don't like to be the king then he comes out that means sattva Raja Tama he choose the citta and set the gives illumination and inquiry and the love to know the truth Buddha took the path and he meditated and he realized the truth this body is nothing there is Artman and that goes beyond the citta even an increase of equality with that power overcome the other - now Bhagwan Krishna is giving that teaching to Odawa how to overcome this - Roger aunt Amma satra Dharma habib poncy mad bhakti luck Shannara Saticoy opaza satrom tata dharma proper 30 now have to increase the citta gunas the more you increase the citta gunas the sixteen chapter of the bhagavad-gita it is giving a big list of all the sattva-guna and it says de begoña they were divine qualities there's also tahuna and if you look at all the success spiritually successful personalities all we're having all these big wonderful qualities if anyone is claiming the time a spiritual leader I'm having this power that power but if we don't find these good qualities in his character night for sure he's telling the lies it cannot be we doubt the increase of the sattva-guna and then decreasing our giving up the Raja and Tama one can never become spiritual so this we have to understand why we read the scripture to understand this this is like the map and it gives the guidance whether we are going in the right direction or not the sometimes some people will come when they are talking there their tears are coming out and we become emotional who this person is so holy no tears and all those things is okay but the thing is we have to find all those good qualities are there in his character or not that's why Bhagwan see Ramakrishna said you must take a monk at daytime and nighttime also sadhu Caden a Digby rata Digby then you should have faith a character should be equal high during night or in day that means all the time so this is SWAT to equality increase the spirituality and devotion well how we will know the spirituality what is the spirituality we can say unselfishness and love these are the two qualities the person who is spiritual is unselfish and he has love Allah for all being not for only my friends and my family know that is everybody's having love for all being no discrimination so that is called spiritual law and then unselfish the spiritual love is possible when there is no selfishness so SWAT tikka spirituality means days and devotion to me I've formed faith that God is there me means the God the Satya will always say God is there I'm sure I have not realized God in this life but it that doesn't mean that God is not there God is there I couldn't realize that is my fault so this is a by using the SWAT to equality then the purity understanding love that increases everything is having every everything is having the three qualities Swatow means purity knowledge and bliss Raja temporary pleasure followed by pin and Tama start with ignorance and result in bondage now we understand this and what we should do when the scepter increases other to decrease and with that the root of suffering or Dharma is also get destroyed in the bhagavad-gita a famous locus there almost all Hindus and many other people they all is the code yada yada hi dharmasya glanir bhavati bharata what is that Dharma Clanny majority of the people become selfish the cunning and the ruler of the country is also behaving in a very selfish way that is called a Dharma and that is the suffering and each and every one suffers over there the history pages after pages if you read that is the main thing some people will always will be there who are good quark people but their number is safe so less people don't understand and when these good people are coming and then telling on the top of their voice majority of the people will never listen to them never believe them why because of the tamo-guna tamo-guna is always doubtful and they cannot discriminate between good and bad they always go for the bad so friends this 3 guna we should understand and dharma raja Tama and yacht Sat ability on uttama Hashanah Shetty that moola ye a Dharma boy or T when these two are destroyed then the other ba completely goes away see Ramakrishna said the more you go towards the East the West will remain at the back we need not to go on pushing the Rajah and Tama go away go everyday with a ram no nothing like that just do the good work just become a very good person concern for others love for others and then you're very meditative then automatically Roger and Tama will go away automatically Lord Buddha said Ukraina g'tok Roda the croutha anger should be conquered by love not by another anger so all these wars and then there will be there will be big big statue war hero and what is the result of the war suffering in both side no one get their ultimate thing and sometimes we will go and capture the land of others and after 200 years where everything changed so one should read the history to become spiritual the unless and until we know the history and all the geography and if you see and one time was there the Roman Eagle used to fly on all over and sometimes you will find the British and British used to proudly deuced to say that the Sun never set in British Empire in one place it is going down to another place because the Sun is coming up where is British now where is all these people nothing remain if that is so then why should it be so peculiarly but that is the game satureja Tama that has been injected within us by the God to see the game but the beauty is for those who can understand it Oh God wants us to play in this way okay but I am NOT going to play I am going to be on and going to go to God you know God becomes very happy when someone can understand all the things that he has made and can overcome that go back to God God become happy that's why he has made this and this chateau increase is possible through mantra japa when you go on constantly taking the name of mantra even a great man of knowledge turian and the ji maharaj used to do a lot of Jabba Swami to the ananda so that is the reason i would request you friends read the biographies of these great souls and swami brahmananda he never could stop doing the japa his working is walking his everytime used to do Shami siwon and the ulcer and forget about mother don't talk about mother she's - she Stoker she herself said more than 100000 on look good job more than 100000 - going on constantly by that way the rajo-guna and tamo-guna automatically go away only Sutter gonna remain when the SATA guna is there then one day I can feel the I am good it is alright but the God is always in distance I cannot go in embrace I cannot feel that within so that is the prayer we find in the open Isha the asking the requesting the push and the sun-god remove that the golden cover is the golden cover means the joy that is the golden cover remove that I want to face the truth Thank You friends thank you for listening and if there is any question I will try to give the answer so please bring the question at the levels of each guna in a person a result of past karma can normal human being change it the Shipra gupta is a really really very good question as three Poorna three Poorna gupta right the sleeper Nakata asking are the levels of each guna in a person a result of particle of course so the in the past karma only the oldest gunas they come normal human being means any human being the moment the thought has come into our mind that I'd like to realize God and by the grace of the god if I believe in the words of the holy people the God is there as Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna he is telling again and again believe me God is there you can see God you can talk to God just believe it we believe so many things believe the word of the ramakrishna god is there that is the first thing it's called suvichar and then second you go on bicha Rinna and then you go on thinking how to go to God then you go on listening what is actually God it is that which is beyond the three gunas sattva Raja Tama what are the three gunas this quality dis quality this quality all the best quality good qualities are cults at work if that is so let me develop this what word is that unselfishness and love try anyone can do it Apple which Acrobat I asked so many people with corrupt mind ascend to the pinnacle of success is it due to good karma in past life again yes they are getting the opportunity to be successful not because of the karma that they're doing now but the Karma that they did in the past but unfortunately we doubt understanding days they are miss utilizing the opportunity that was given to them there is a bad luck and in the next bird or maybe in this life in this life they will suffer so that is why we should be very careful about our karma we should also try to do okay then any other questions complain tanita is asking in this way I think you have heard so well Neeta I know neither very well she's a very good girl and Mita we will discuss about it because we are already late and the second is days but that is the struggle you know Neeta that is the struggle and that is called sadhana in sanskrit we called sadhana and it can be translated as the spiritual practices what is the spiritual practice not complaining about others but doing all positive thing that is the sadhana and how I can constantly go on doing good things I must have to have the faith in the existence of God the God who is my own soul it is not the outside anyone and then I will say God it is you who is creating all the problem through this person this person this person they don't have any capacity create problem for me because of you it is doing but I know you are my only love you love me to remove them and so that I do not feel bad against them give them positive idea and save me this positive tart I should not take up action against them but I can you know the in the family life you have to yes but don't bite as Salam o Krishna says that you should show in such a way that they will understand that it is not easy to harm harder him but at the same time you are not going to harm rather you are going to pray pray and pray right that way we can overcome thank you let us conclude with this mantra young brahma Varun indra root rama ruta student a debatably BD song patrimony shaadi guarantee young sambar they
