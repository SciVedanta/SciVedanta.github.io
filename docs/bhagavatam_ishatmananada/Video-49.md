[Bhagavatam 037 : Brahman Is The Mother Of All](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MYys0Jk99fw)

and happy Mother's Day and today our topic is Brahman the mother of all according to the bhagavata that we're studying how Brahman can be the mother of all but as usual we will start with this chanting Santa who Jerusalem but mana sireesha be our governess attrition me shuhang Laxmi can't come on iron you dianna come Bundy Bishnu Adam Duvall okay to describe the brahman the mundo Upanishad has a very famous supination and that is highly respected by the monks the Mundaka Upanishad mentioned near sahajiya set up a bead Yesha Gianna maíam tapa he who is omniscient in general and all-knowing in detail whose austerity is knowledge ghana maíam tapa tapa is austerity knowledge eases austerity then very clearly indicating that Brahman is the creator of everything the smart from that realm on either Rama nama Rupa Anagha jayati and from that evil this Brahmin now from Brahman another Brahman has evolved what is that is called Erina guru the same Brahman who is active acting tadesco hidden negara and also naam the name Rupa the form onion into food jayati all these things were created so Brahman is the mother of all but again supported by another Keynesian why I am coding initiative because in upon collisions the rishis those who discovered this truth they were very clear minded people no ambiguity and no superstitions they understood it realized it then only they rotate are saved so another initiative so the three trio kinesia Moonrock is a separate definition trattoria another separate opposition but deterring the same thing too it really fine the supporting the same the idea it says here to bar imani bhutani jayante from which all these beings take birth yet over from which Emani all this butonly beings take birth everything is taken birth created in mythology one thing then also narrating in this way not only that surviving on it inna yuh itani G&T by which they feel and then yet priyanka for resubmission d after that they move towards that after the depth pre and after the death the move towards that particular thing from where it came so this is the speciality and then the margin 8 since brahman is beyond time space and causation and cannot be described hence the Rishi's the knower of the brahman give hints to describe it now some of the things we cannot simply tell that this is this approved in this way is the feeling you have to realize it and very very subjective very very subjective the teacher can eat the best of his knowledge to the student the piece is the thing you must study these are the way you should produce you must write even then if the student cannot grasp it express it then what the teacher can do understanding is completely subjective guru can say teacher can say feelings can say but the understanding here also we find the teachers the Rishi's after realization of this truth that Brahman the pure consciousness is the source of creation and if we know the source of creation then we are completely free from fear and what is the greatest fear in the minds of human being dead yesterday I was in Pittsburgh so one lady total ghost 94 ha perhaps so the ghost is the fear but not the ultimate fear is dead and this actually we can overcome why because I am NOT born and how can I die that is the conception that is the realization and this bodies that we are wearing they just with the dresses we have putting on the dress and and changing the dress and if I get a new dress I am happy than the whole brazzers ok we throw it the same way the old body we are trying out and putting on the new body but haven't I'm not dying I cannot die so what did it happen completely free from fear avoidance errababu thieves you it says avium said of a booth age all being will be fearless there are many people there fearless people they are hunting the ghost ghost is supposed to hunt us but they are going for the ghost that very courageous but that courage has nothing to do with this if these courageous people they said you must know it why because all the problem that constantly you are facing and crying and thinking how to go beyond this is the only way understand this and then be free and how do because they cannot express that directly so it's called luck Sharna the luck tional Luxur means indication so through the duck channel they are mentioning before I go to the discussion how this luck Sharna we have already as because we are studying the bhagavata I quoted from the Upanishads but however kur is considered as a good book of devotion but the bhagavata is still talking about this bhagavata also said in the tent condo 480 seventh chapter 2nd verse it says boo team Indian mana prana jananam oestrogen prabhu who is his problem the problem is the master mocked Artemisia baba artem up monocle furniture the Lord created faculties like intellect senses mind I tell forces in the Jiva so that they may enjoy since contacts in this world matter Artem the who has created now we see we test we hear all these things we are very happy I am doing the sometimes some people they say I don't believe in God but who is telling their God himself why in his booty in his intellect God is behaving like that the why God is behaving like that he said those who do not like to come to God I give them the desires to enjoy that is also again gods but that's not good that's not good one so we should always try to go towards the God not away from the God the only two things are there God created thing but away from God so we should not go away from God the Christians theology they see original sin what is this original sink going away from God and that every from God then the God says okay you go and enjoy as long as you like then I will see but God cannot control himself because of the tremendous love then he sends his son the only begotten son the Christian theory they say and we believe that God is coming himself sometimes in the form of Krishna Rama so here also in the bhagavata we find again in the third column is the book fifth chapter the 25th verse he says saba eater still some dress to who shakti such assad africa maya namaha diadem need money before all the big they are to my eye young we will discuss this a little afterwards it is a very interesting way how the creation comes not let like the the magician's that stick they will even move like this and the creation come not like that is a wonderful waste episteme all descriptions will be there the supreme God's power is Maya for the creation for action we need two things what consciousness our knowledge and power so shift E and Jana when they do come together the in action so here it says in the purgatory fine the supreme God's power Maya is the material cause who pardon a cardinal who pardon economy is the material cause material is the Maya then this intellectual cause limit the karana is a conscious being Brahma himself Raman itself we should say not him our heart itself the Brahman is consciousness the no gender so naturally Brahman itself is the intellectual cause but Brahmans power which is termed as Maya is the kupatana karana material cause the material is there and the interent person is also there then he is creating creation is coming and the Shakti it is manifesting we find all this in the Bhagavata here the blush Anna we were talking why because we cannot understand the Brahman right this way that's why the Hindus they don't like to allow people to say oh we can't understand so they will go have it known but that they have made all these God who you like I like a tree think about the tree trees your God whom you like I like that person think about that so different different different gods and goddesses but all at the manifestation of the same power whether they externally you are carving as a Krishna or a Rama or anyone it doesn't matter main thing is that so they are indicating us how through two different methods one is if you can remember swarupa laksana a direct indication Subaru optional another is Tata Steel optional the Tata star lucky on a cutter selection what is the direct indication Satyam jeonnam anantam big jana anandam all these qualities are the direct indication about the what is that consciousness that Brahman is Satya sati Easter truth it is eternal it cannot change it never changes so that is called the cetera then Ganim Ananda the eternal knowledge and this knowledge unfathomable everything that we can consider comes from that so these a source of knowledge is a direct indication then another comes that a star so Appa and taught esta indicating indirectly but clearly separating the target object from others what's the target object Brahman so we are indicating it's such a way so others are totally that now we understood that this is not this this person must be the indication now I like to mention that so can you please find such and such person over there and he has is visiting that particular place and he will be there by this time can you please go and find it because his phone his switcher so they go and find him and ask him to contact me however no he is wearing a red shirt and he's having a glasses and he is a tall he is a fear complex and having little beard also all this data selection so indicating that person so you go and find him always like this this man must be all indications are there so here the indications that is called Tata Steel action ah that from whom the universe these beings are born the indication from whom this all beings are born no other being can do that so that means that it must be the Brahman so indirect way the indication which solute pollution ah is a need you know Brampton now another a deeper level we are Queen need a guna Brahma I don't know whether you have ever visited that our coal mines haven't visited coal mines anyone of you if you go to the coal mines at the table it is nothing but the more you go down and down is not like this elevator and particularly in our country it is not so advanced so when I visited it was the row and so much of knowledge and all sides are open you have to hold that the file and then you are going down the more you were going down the more black dark and no sound at all so we are going deeper and deeper into the knowledge of Brahman is called neo Kunin nothing is there if there is so guna something is there he is playing the music or doing something talking some recreation some changes movements are there and nothing no movement that wintertime if you go into the deep into the Himalaya no movement everything is white white and white and you won't see the bars also nothing is there so that is called need guna no quality no movement that is also grown man and seeing coming down slowly in the form of water and then there will be the waves the ripples the boats the people are swimming and all this activity on that Saguna the Nira gonna and Saguna this statistic china is the saloon a brahman and we are talking about mother don't forget all that and what is this mother Brahman and how is this mother unfathomable some time and without an equality and if we can address brahmana she the mother she's calm composed no movement no form nothing is there there is also mother but again sometimes we find that mother is running here and there cleaning the room cooking putting things and catching the children and so many things are going on so that is also the mother so when we see the mother active saguna brahman just remember this terminology saw guna along with the qualities and the wind the mother is in active doing nothing nil guna Brahma the same mother to Cebu moon and ninguna now friends the bay the Piazza he is not actually accepting this the brahma sutra that he has written there he is telling the Sehun and Brahma the same Ramon he is not giving any difference is not making any difference those who are studying the padartha they know this is a very tricky point very difficult to understand and on this point there will be hundreds of a different type of ideas and Hindus are even today so many different opinions are coming out on this point what is that if the brahman is inactive and not having any qualities how then you can say the Brahmin is creating for the creation power is necessary without power there cannot be any creation and that is for sure if you don't have the power you cannot create a man maybe a very good engineer but he is lying down in the hospital bed he cannot move and so many things are going on can you create anything no for that the power is necessary that power is absent this very moment so similarly just try to imagine the Brahmin if it is not having the power then how he created and now he actually what happened you know he created another Brahmin and that is the lower Brahma is called sub you know grandma sometimes we turn as here another ba and he mixed that with the power called Maya and all these things are creating okay we accept that but where he kept where he kept that power full of that best suppose it is a bag full of instruments he must have kept somewhere if the Maya is the power I had he kept it so this is the point Brahman you say it is a free from all gunas again the same Brahman is creating with its power now the question is when he is not creating you say that without any qualities where the qualities go where he kept the qualities this is a great debate you know not only one day thousands of years the best minds of India they debated on this point that this is really really very certain point and that's why most of the people they accept Ibaka why it is very easy God is there I am here God is perfect I am imperfect I go to God and pray and God sometimes received my pray and accept my pray and grant my prayer but this is okay I am happy and if he is not accepting then we run here and there what to do how to make the God happy with me this is a one type of thing this is of course there I will come to that but before I go to that particular thing let us remember that actions needs two things knowledge plus power equal to action only knowledge cannot be any action only power the ship t cannot do anything so knowledge plus power equal to action have you noticed that Kali image this is the the Morty the embodiment of the image of this idea the knowledge is Shiva and power is Macaulay and then the action is going on so this is the iana last ship T equal to Kriya the best minds of India they have found out three things one is Jeeva we being then juggled the whole universe apart from we the living being there are so many other things also there also leaving but the expression is very very less like a stone it is also leaving it is that consciousness also but so it goes into it that it cannot express but still it is there so that Jeeva jevetta and brahman the consciousness and how these the Cheever and Jagirdar came from from how over that so many mother bothers bothers me in the theory I will give you a little list if you can count please try or do it about Maya bother be birth the vada poori Amma bada piece Easter Drita vada doing the bada beta really the bother achieve the Vida Aveda vada push the border and summon nayavada I stopped over here and forgot to count 13 and this is only a few now if you like to understand the Hinduism in total do you think is possible in one life the one bother one theory is so difficult to understand and green with with all this and I am not mentioning the different philosophy they are different this is only the theory that is explaining the God and the creation and the relation between the God and the creation that is this is now this bother each and every theory they are actually giving two ideas one Tok Tok Tok Tunisia means fixation of the goal why I am heading like this the fixation of the goal it is there and sadhana lift Asian one is taught taught that the means the gold Nastasia indication that that is your goal and another sardonic Dasia how to reach over there the practice this eat each and every one and let us make a table first is Shankar Acharya and the shankara's tine was 788 to 820 only 32 years and in this 32 years if we - that when he was greener so that much time regard and with with that little time he made so many the conception of the hut Rita began to established by him all over India his goal Tata is need guna Brahma bother the Brahma without any appearance and also the Maya bada etc and what is the practice the sadhana path of knowledge Gianna manga what is the path of knowledge I am NOT going to explain this most of you know this is a discrimination which is permanent and which is temporary and after the Shankara his greatest pretty is ramanujacharya he is also from the south and ramanujacharya he lived 120 years so you can understand he got lot of time to criticize if we - the twenty hundred years ago sighs Shankara but anyway this ramanujacharya is Abby sister adroit ibadah in one line we can see a great of are the means not to there is only one that means God is separate I am separate we cannot select that we are saying we are one how it is we will discuss a little hurriedly of course and then wish they are doing that on adult Society ACS we are from God but separate from God you cannot say I am with God it is not possible how then the ramanuja gave take an example the fire and the spark spark is also every way it is a fire but thus it is a spark the small one tiny little one so the fire and the spark so that is separated from God but still we are we should start with the bother then after a manager came nimbarka this nimbarka he lived 62 years and he propounded peda Ave the bother almost like the same is a leader different God is different I am different but again we are seen Aveda bada like son and the father in one way they are seen in the same time they're different is better to same mother in the son or mother and the daughter to sing we the are seen but at the same time they are different to be the different Aveda united that is the bother of the Newmark then Matt watch Aria he came he said not real only Twitter though it means to should turbo enter pure data no never think that God can in any way at us with you you are a sinner you are a sinner and you are completely separate God is pure and completely different from you and that is madhvacharya it's very very strong the truest and what is the path they indicated devotion the only way that you can save yourself by crying at the feet of the God that is the devotion Ramanuja also devotion but devotion to Vasudeva not in here in there I go to god Ganesha that devotion Rahman who don't accept only bar suitable so and nimbarka he says Radha and Krishna otherwise you cannot follow the nimbarka path but Matt words say no any God any goddess but the path is devotion then came one of our chharia this vulnerable Chari he said pushed avada this is a very special terminology he used what is the push the grace you can do nothing whether you gah you offer food or for these and that you can try but unless and until God is gracious and giving you the blessings you can achieve nothing so push the means grace the push the bother and he's also devotion to Radha Krishna who can save you only Radha Krishna this is a lava then came Chaitanya this is 1486 and to 1534 he forwarded another very interesting or cinta be the obey the bath read or read about we have already heard that is nimbarka and he said achieve the unthinkable unimaginable excellent type of peda of a the body these was going on in different way how to now ultimately came Raghavan see Ramakrishna 1836 to 1886 that is only fifty years and in the fifty years of course is from the beginning itself he was giving the indication he gave a wonderful conception someone I am God other the Salam peace now give the saman nayavada you like to cry at the feet of God welcome continue that you will get the grace of God you like to think that God is only Radha Krishna no problem the only Narayana grave this is Ramakrishna but he only said be sincere whatever you do do sincerely some day Radha Krishna someday Narayana someday these some day there that won't do to stick to one and your devotion your sincerity your one pointed mind will purify your mind and then you will understand in whatever path you are traveling all are leading to the same goal this is the beauty of ceramic busines and in the present day life when in the society constantly we are observing that in the name of religion people are cutting each other's throat this is cinema business philosophy salmon nayavada can only save us and we are talking about the brahman the creator and what is that Brahman the best way to express such cheat on on the server we will go now how we can realize God how we are nothing but that God this a great step that we are going to take what is this existence knowledge and please if I ask myself Who am I oh I I was born in such-and-such day I am days and there what you are actually expressing existence the I am there I am there even the children if you ask a who is there me he they will say what is this mean existence conception of I am existing so where from that conception comes from the original from the source and the source is Brahman and that source is served that means existence we like to leave we don't like to die no one likes to die why because of the existence with the main source is that the existence knowledge each and every one particular human being whoever he may be very very maybe they know so many things I have seen the and a tribals they know so many things they may not speak in English of range solving the mathematics of this computer but they know when the elephants are near guy in the jungle they know when you have to stop because snake become the vitals how they can know that we were telling listen you will find the sound that is the sound of the Python we try to listen nothing was there but they known it so this is the knowledge each and every human being they know how to survive the knowledge knowledge and knowledge from the torrential rain the human being developed how to make the houses hearts use the fire you would use these and that all knowledge where from it came to source what is that source Brahman Subramani sub existence Brahman is the source of knowledge and we are also dad and please the joy the our London each and everything that we do only for the police only for the joy and never ever for their suffering sometimes the young people they'll be driving the car in a very fast in the ordinary Road they'll be going crossing Jeep jet why onon the excitement the joy then of course got for me they will also make other people unhappy helos unhappy and doctors are happy they all let them come so some people will be happy but the word the sword sees the joy why do we do that because of on endure the joy so that God is there and we are studying the bhagavata who is the god of bhagavata particularly the taint the chapter that we are studying Krishna and what is Krishna here you see it says the brahma-samhita describing Krishna's ishaara parama Krishna Krishna is the parama is shut up Krishna is the Parana is sure what is the Parana supreme ishaara god is a supreme god i didn't stop over here they say such cheat onon the big club is the figure the embodiment of such cheat ananda at this satchitananda means brahmana to succeed on the big club now this such cheat ananda is the father is the goal and how to reach over them how to act on that what is the shakti the power it says now these are very very new terminologies perhaps for you all if you can have little attention this beautiful explanation about this each and every thing acting how to power and they have given the name of the power what is the first name son Dini some did gardening these are the three powers the power observed that means existence and when you are thinking the existence that is the power the activity how you were thinking that existence sandini that particular power that you are thinking that I am existing I'd like to exist that particular name of that power is son living in so details that go and then come cheat that knowledge and when we are occurring that knowledge how the power without powering do it some power some actions are going on so I say knowledge plus power equal to action now the action is that we are constantly I like to know I like to know I like to know what is that action how the action came into existence knowledge plus power what is that knowledge cheat a part of Brahman is cheap or we can say indication towards Brahman chill but what is that power then the name of that particular party's son beat and then under the Blees the joy we feel that joy Express joy that missing in the consciousness of the knowledge plus power equal to action this action is the Bliss the joy knowledge is the brahmana Ananda but what is the power the name of that power is gardening hjl cloudy knee this are the initial T the power the this is the Vishnu Purana they are describing la Dini Chandni some built these are the three powers the power means action and son Dini now they are giving the definition of the son Denis yeah yeah hasta variety that you are thinking your existing that is called sandini and something it can be mentioned as the principle of creative life then comes some beat versus zombie yeah a bit TP d'ya teacher we can understand and also can make people understand can express that tingle knowledge that power we should not make any mistake there's a power and the action and the knowledge and the knowledge is Brahman in total and particular portion of that is chilled and the power that is activated in that chief is called some bead they then comes that Laden II yeah yeah rather they claw d'ya teacher there are some people they can make others laughing making them joy joyful they're wonderful people they'll be talking or dancing or creating something thousands of people are enjoying their performances it's okay and we in general we go we look at his performance and we say yes is a wonderful performer and we always enjoy his performance we always enjoy his talk we already enjoy his song but what is that the whole that is making the action possible that is la Dini so this is the way it goes so there are three powers associated with three power and that is known as the God now friends quickly we will look at us we have been created that Brahman is our mother and the particularly Asian people they like to call the supreme power as model and the there are in the Europe and America we find they always address God as father the father and we call mother this is the difference the D here the Jeeva Jeeva means the beam what had that be being first the supreme knockin on the part of the Brahman the heart that drum even the pancetta she it mentions like this about the Brahmin satyam Gianna Ananta brahmalok channel see each and every one I am quoting from different scripture why to get this get the support it is not only one person that saved so many people the after the realization not that the copy they realized it themselves then only they are mentioning otherwise they will never do it so be Jarl nominee a very famous person and he is mentioning and this book is pancetta G and there he is mentioning that it is tagged Romani septum Gianna and and humble being the part G boy is also having this tree now we are we are also having just like the Brahmin three things what kurta the doer sense of the doer and then woke the enjoyer and yata the no more so what we are what is our speciality each and every one of us even a little small kid he has made something on the wall where itself really tired of telling him don't write on the wall whatever I'd like to write right on the button he always finds that's a wonderful clean placed why should I not drive so he goes and do something and any person entering into them and he will introduce in this identity I did kurta I went to somebody's house and as the baby was super and he was going on telling I think that I did that like that and I was thinking kurta the kurta means I am dear and is good if that sense is not there it will never grow but the problem is it becomes too much then the religious people will come and say kharbut otherwise your 20 problem so why this type of war between the nations do you think all the nation each and every individual people they are going to fight with each other no they don't know each other rather they'll be so happy if you tell come we will go to that particular country we declared as our enemy country all people will be so happy to go and visit that place and they will also be so happy to come to our place what many people are very happy there will be no problem and if you keep the telephone connection with one lady to another lady one mother to another mother to three hours they'll be discussing about the recipes how we are cooking this honor will be so happy but some people are not happy who are they hum Gauri kurta I am doubt kurta I am the doer that is giba the moment he thinks I am doing and I am the representative representative of the millions and millions of people we ported leeward want to fight but anyway he takes the decision and we have to wait when things happen that this is the kurta and an enjoyer when I say I did to enjoy hi and then gotta know so all these three processes they go the car machete are the connection this connection to desire to have the precision this is called Carta of Carta what is his power I the Carta that I and he is that again you to remember now it is not Brahman is me I the Jeeva okay now I am having some power which is coming with me and action is taking shape what is that that power is called Keynesian Karma Shakti then hooked I enjoy our each our Shakti so that some need and Laden II and for the Jeeva what first the kurta the car tada I I am doing some action and what is that power that is helping me to perform that is called karma shop team and win the poker I'm enjoying what is that power helping with Ranger each charge Shakti and third guitar the Noah Gianna Shakti cognition in English the same very quickly we'll make this study side by side now we are the children of the gunman and the Rishi he declared silent vichy Amrita Sutra I'd harmony to be honest to be da hominem purusa Mahanta addictive Arnim Thomas of Paris thought who is dead who has created us to know him you have to go beyond ignorance tamasa literally darkness and darkness is a symbol of ignorance so we have to go beyond that ignorance and where what will find Brahman what is that Brahman searched on under who is going to find me what am i Carta bhakta yada sat-chit-ananda in one place kurta bhakta gotta in another now that brahman acting activate power he is also having three powers I was having three powers what are the power that Brahmin is having son Dini and the same power I am also having the mine very little but its name is karma Shakti the power cloudy knee the Brahman is having that gardening I am observing the same thing my power name is teacher Shakti and third the Brahmin is having some meal usually I am also having giannis of tea so the tree it comes so our spiritual practices also they say karma yoga because karma Shakti we are having so if you do the Karma Yoga then each a Shakti bhakti-yoga gianna Shakti Gianna yoga if we follow these karma yoga bhakti yoga Gyana yoga yoga is always there the meditation that we God is always there in three when we go to our source who is our source our mother who is our mother Braman after one hour you do condoms our mothers name a Brahmin so how it has been proved because we are the part and parcel of dad Brahmin and we are going to realize Brahmin but how through these three paths karma Gianna and bhakti what is karma whatever you do just offer it to God their son whatever you are preparing some food mentally just offer God this is for you and he is so simple in accepting then he will see that you are eating it but anyway you won't mind if you had just offer it to God God I am preparing this food for you please accept it God will accept it that karma whatever I do I am not telling the flowers or doing these and there only mentally you say suppose someone has come and asking who planted this beautiful flower God created at that then people would say that you must have to consult doctors everything God is coming for you know we are not very practical way we have to understand mentally I know the power that has come out of me to do that is coming from God so mentally I am offering that to God between practically some people are coming to my house and asking who decorated this room oh I tried that is okay I that is okay so that it should be the way of karma yoga then bhakti yoga whatever you do yes object the gardener see everything whatever you would think whatever you are doing whatever you are eating each and everything you should offer to God that is called bhakti yoga mentally you will find that most of the monks after the lecture they will say Ramakrishna economist to Arcana I am offering these what even the knowledge I could acquire I have given it also the gods in the fall or devotees but God actually whole thing I have given to you that apana and then Gianna Shakthi the knowledge I am NOT this body and mind complex I am eternal I am consciousness I am NOT going to die so why fear so that is called Gianna Shakti phrase the great diamond that started long long back whether the same gunmen as I pointed out who is needed una without an equality can become swag una will form and qualities recently in the 19th century they excellent that Raghavan see Rama Tichenor a simple way he solved it you know how he said have you seen how the water is taking the ship as a nice the water is liquid but the same water when it is too cold taking a shape as nice and again the same eyes which has a form when the light of knowledge that means the power of Sun reflecting on that again it becomes water so why don't you understand that God is all-powerful it can have the fall it can be read out for also while you are calling whatever you like you follow without form you like it it is your path we'd form someone else's liking his path and ultimately you are going to know yourself in whatever path you tread go Thank You friends the goal is to be in joy and great joy and in success and how it is possible by brain for others let them be successful let them be always healthy and happy if you pray for each and every one then even get that same prayer will come back to you give you success give you a charge and give you proper health my prayer to the supreme mother Brahman let our mothers be very happy and healthy all over the world oh the Chandi Chandi hurry [Music]
