[Bhagavatam 049 : Avadhut Gita: How to Realize Brahman?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcLWUU5HMR0)

today we'll be discussing that about Hooters experience in realizing the brahman how to realize Brahman that is a wonderful way is explained so we will come to the avadhuta gita before that please repeat after me Shanta who jerker shayana but the mana sireesha Vishwa governess attrition me shuhang Lakshmi condom kamidana Yanam you give the arnica meum Bundy pshh papaya harem serve aloo clickers in Indian tradition guru parampara user is a very big thing so they will ask you who is your guru and the Guru school and he is good Saburo masti guru and lineage is very very important why school but how the gurus are they were trained their realization and how they are giving the same thing to their disciples is very important and sometimes some people when they come and if you ask them who is your guru they will from non Krishna Mission tradition they will say so and so forth okay so like that it goes that means that tradition so it is like this but overdo to was not having any human guru and he has not started any Veda unless and until you have studied the Veda unless and until you are having the Guru tradition in Indian spiritual or the world you are not accepted but how come this Avadhuta that are tria he was highly the he was not only accepted he is a very very respected soul in the spiritual world how it is possible now again it comes it doesn't matter how he realized but it matters he has realized that to the Brahmin the Artman how he will understand that that he has realized the truth he will tell every word which tallies with the Vedas and sometimes some people they can memorize the whole bead and if they are quoting from the Veda no you can understand they are simply quoting from the period is not from their realization so this is the way the people to understand that these are the people who are realized soul and we should follow them Indians that way very clear at the same time there are some mistakes at the end sometimes they do not understand there another not only India the whole of Asia the emotion is very prevalent and Shamim awakened the same because the emotion you can realize God really easily when he were thinking that God has come to you as your child God has come to you as your father mother just emotion but that emotion that tremendous force helps you to realize God that's at one part another because of the emotion sometimes they forget to discriminate but leaders the spiritual leaders they all do that so that is why when you are not having a guru parampara a guru tradition then second it goes what is your realization how you leave how you speak how you behave everything comes you cannot simply defeat that governs the Ramakrishna said shot who came they made it be rotating me you must offer him in the daytime and also in the nighttime that means every moment at the Hin only you should accept otherwise is very difficult the Avadhuta he is telling that so har har the problem-solver proton and spontaneously from his own nature from his own realization the words are coming exactly as Provence a language Devon serum Krishna in the traditional way didn't study the Vader and but he was having the Guru I like about who the heroes are in many gurus of course human gurus as because that this time the God has come in the form of sri ramakrishna to prove that all paths that has developed in the human society to lead to the God are true that was his mission Sri Lanka schnur's mission was completely different so ceramic is not the God incarnated in that form his mission was different about you to lived the life and proved that even if you are not having the Guru parampara training in that way but you can realize God how then Avadhuta observed the nature and from there he selected twenty-four beings persons and the things as his good as a river is his good ear is guru the B is his guru he is getting the inspiration from that and a and oneness that is the ultimate realization samara Samak no ha betta butta her and the first chapter 75 words of the the avadhuta gita he says summer rasa Magna par with the puta the beautiful way the spirituality he is telling them from his realization of the oneness summer rasa usually we always think why the same thing has been told in so many different ways that is the speciality each and every st. he's expressing his realization in a beautiful way someone has a m√°quina here he uses that word the Avadhuta is using the word some others are equal oneness Magna is because I cannot think anything but one there is no - no existence of - and when there is no existence of - Babita Buddha by constant thinking of that one that pure all-pervading puta I become pure and from that I am Telling so this they say Shastra somebody who become that did you must have to have the realization which has already been realized by the previous the Moonies and Rishi's and the others balance the moment you say I only have realized that nobody else will be able to realize and before me after me there should be nobody in wrong it cannot be the science if you have followed some method and realized the truth the same method following the same mentor others have also the chance opportunity possibility to realize God if not there is something mystical the mystic will be surely there so this is the process I followed and by that I have realized God and I can tell you this much this Swami Vivekananda said how the small small groove the small teacher no one person he was a tip he went to a village - still and people they were so they chased him and he was running here and they had how to hide then suddenly he reached to the back end of the village where these two through the garbages and a lot of some dust was there and he put those things on the body and sudden sat under a tree meditating India the moment the people who went over there they never thought how these people came the person has come here we never saw in the whole day how in the date night he is sitting over here but without any clothes he is meditating all over the body smeared with the those things so immediately they decide all these must be a realized soul and they started bringing all puja this man was sitting right I was going to steal those things and they are giving it to me now it was good thing so this is a good profession let me continue so he was continuing slowly slowly asked him around him people started coming and some people has the habit of telling you know exaggerating oh you do not know him the last night I saw him on a light he's floating he was going to that place and just simply there and people they like to accept that the more you say the mystical way but you have to have that and a capacity to put it so people will understand the moment you go if he or she keeps the touches right hand on your head boss somehow you have to go and they will go now these things were going on one wheelman I he came and he told said I like to become your disciple this pillar understood that this will be the problem he was not talking with anyone now this young man only he is persistent said I like to be a disciple how he have realized God please teach me he never did anything now whole day he was not speaking so the night time the boy came and when he was persisting so much and he said okay okay if bring a sharp razor tomorrow and this time in the night time and I will give me the deeksha he was excited the shall I bid shall I put on the new clothes and just come and bring the region then he came close your eyes and I will hold your nose and he did it and cut the top of the nose what is this you see from now onwards not Qatar sampradaya the nose without no sampradaya so he who start because I don't know anything and I had to burn my face like this now so this is where the Sangha die accounts so one must be very very careful about dogmatism but this man say these and we should follow only these are nothing else this is dope material you should follow the philosophy and the philosophy always goes with reason why how so that way you have to understand and there will be a tragedy in that tradition you'll find the exalted characters many many many many we are keeping the Dame the direct disciples the Apostles of Sri Ramakrishna but not only them the tradition of the Ramakrishna mission if you read the stories of their life exalted so many of them how it is possible because the theory is perfect and once you are practicing that story you are getting the perfection so here our duty is telling now of course it is possible one should not consider the quality of the scholarship of the Guru of the distilling a true spiritual seeker should recognize on the essence that we have already sprayed and the second chapter second bars no yatra kappa guna able to which in the Linea naive atre etre means air when you are considering the Guru don't think that he is a educated person or not sad from which University have studied oh I started from so-and-so oh my god it must be a big good it's got some people thinking that it has nothing to do it must be a very good student no that is okay but about the spirituality that is priority and what is that purity unselfishness so that is the purity cry hapara Munakata Colusa aber you must see the quality of the spiritual quality of a guru I always say if a doctor is not maintaining the proper moral character doesn't matter it is his problem but he's very good doctor dagger Isis is okay for me and if an administrator also the same way to some it's a little problem but we can matter like this in a profession the pure character is not the criteria it is his other qualities but in the spirituality fast and the last and the only criteria is this is if your that is the thing so he says in Brier Barham kunibert are the highest guna what is the highest guna lava and unselfishness the love and unselfishness kulasara eva then we go to this to the abba tutor was not having the human guru but he was tracing on the stealth realization his realization process on a completely unique the sometimes if you are studying the Upanishad you will come across some of the stories a young man has gone to his guru and the guru say you like to realize God okay take this 1000 cows and go to the dead jungle and when they will become ten thousand come back I will give you the realization and these two away and then okay and he took that one thousand cows and then he what he will do but he was very sincere or after alone I have gone but here the cows are grazing let me go to this village that police know he was meditating meditating meditating when I go back when these cows will become ten thousand it will be right it must be within five years six years but there is a limit I will go and realize the God the Guru will bless me and he's constantly thinking and one day he heard a cow a poodle is telling said now we are ten thousand let us go back it's true sometime people is L or what is this how the bull can talk but why not if you understand that they are also conveying if you can understand he was there and slowly slowly slowly he realized through that bull that realization came he came back to the Guru Guru never after is it true that it is ten thousand now why go and count me well he looked at his face and said come I will embrace you because you have realized God the face shows that his eye shows that in the realization first and foremost thing you forget the body no concern only the love and compassion the purity all that shows prize is at the metres of the mind so from the highest you can understand so he is telling in this way and worldly education suit status and is not important after the self-realization there cannot remain any difference this is the one thing after the self-realization there can never even any difference why because the realization of the oneness what the person is going to realize oneness that can never be - AHA me before amia smart Sarah Sarah param shabam gamma-gamma be near mugam will be calendar ocula in the second chapter v versus ease and the supreme brahman more essential than the essences surah saad param param Tarun these are the words means absolute and auspicious Sheba the Shiva means auspicious now again this is a world of species what is the meaning of those species if you go to the dictionary immediately the reserve species means these these days species means unselfishness the moment you become completely unselfish you're pure and the moment you are unselfish only love remains and nothing else the only thing that will be within your heart is love anyone suffering anywhere you will feel oh how can I help so they will pray Oh God that's why they all is in our tradition drunk crystal nation tradition the gurus always teaches in this way that before praying for you you should pray oh god let everyone be happy anywhere there I do not know but anyone anywhere must be happy server started to do Ghani sorry boo but granny Pasha to let each and everyone free from the misery how it is possible and some people are there they enjoy the other suffering how it is possible because the earth their human being but at the same time when they see the other people are suffering they are very happy and not only that they will also go and tell this man and that person so that slowly slowly the other person the whole of the movies and the theatres and all that we see is what of course if all people are good nobody go to see that movie there must be feeling that must be fighting there must be cruelty then only we can go and say oh that's good movie now because we like that our mind is just like that and Agha Bansi Ramakrishna used to go to see the dramas which type of drama Granada and he'll be going on crying with the prelada the Granada is crying on the stage for the Krishna Krishna a Vishnu Vishnu ceramic is noise could not also crying Vishnu Vishnu along with him he's also because his mind is like that so that is the reason if you find fault that means the fault is there in your mind and if you can appreciate others qualities that means slowly you are becoming pure and a huniepop arania smart Sahaj serum Dharam shabam gamma a gamma we need multum that is a great thing for the you Hindu achievement the Indus spirituality they never think about going to the heaven they always go beyond heaven why because they have understood that heaven means as yesterday we were discussing in the bhagavad-gita class heaven means some achievement then I am studying something and then I become a doctor achieved then the time will come I have to give up that post I won't be able to continue as a doctor all through it is not possible so similarly the moment we get something we had to give up that also it will go automatically but it is not like that the gamma and gamma depth and birth beneath mukham and free from their need epical come near our coulomb miracle come means calm calm doesn't mean that he's quietly sitting and he's come known sitting over the and thinking so many things how can you be calm calm means the one which is constantly thinking about God but bring lot of things to show me become the same you must feel that you are living and meditating in the a Himalaya in New York and Hillier means that if you go to Manhattan oh my god so many cars and that's because a lot of Indian drivers are there they are very fond of honking this machine is the air and you are not utilizing what is it so they go on honking and everybody is happy there's so many sounds so in that situation you have to feel that I am in the team arlynn came that is called calmness when the people are agitated your mind is calm why because you know these are temporary things will all pass so this is called calmness difficult on the rock coulomb and undifferentiated Kula Coulomb is the family I don't have any tradition I don't have any family I don't have any particular thing then what happened near our coulomb I am with everyone so when I was in Andaman I developed one orphanage was called destitute boy Assam which they're not actually orphanage the other mother was there but is to throw them on the road street and this to go away as to go and elect them and started when astrum at the air in Andaman the government is to give little money for the support and then I used to go to Tibet so these boys they were there you can imagine and the Sunda man is an island if you go to the island you can see the mother and she's in another family she is having other children and this boy he would be looking at the mother she is feeding other child you can he can imagine if the mother is dead this is one type of thing the mother is there father is there but you don't look at me you can imagine the account in the mind so they were like there just to get some compassion with one boy was there huge to cut his hand with the plate and he will come and say Hindi mostly they speak Hindi and they will say amici political type there will be accuracy then I will take all care just to get the defection he will do that so this is the condition and one day one boy was admitted in a hospital something was going on then he was not recovering there what happened when the other they went and they came back and reported he is not taking medicine why so I went that evening and made him and immediately understood the problem his next big this is child their children so next bait another young boy almost of his age he was also getting the treatment and his mother unn teased all around the bay Takano politically and he for him there is no one so he was expecting that somebody will come and casual and with loving thing you say then I went and told that boy don't look at him we are different we don't have father or mother our father and mother in the picture when they will come we do not know but we are leaving aspartic on life don't look at this namby-pamby and what is this we depend on ourselves we aspartic on life so take the medicine get well and come back tomorrow ok next day he came back so he was alright so anyway these are the situation the tremendous emotion and why because Kula I will always feel that somebody should be there to take care of me why somebody should be take care of me I should take care of everyone I don't care that someone will take care of me and that is called heroism that show me be waken that the pro nama mantra there if you are many of you do you know they always addressing as beerus raga once the ramakrishna also told him you had a beard of Ihram is 0 what is the heroism you know I don't want anything from anyone but I am ready to give everything that I am having to anyone that means anyone in need so each and every one of the time thinking unless and until you are having that type of mentality strong mentality Vedanta is not worried the Vedanta always stand on your own feet and that is the self confidence and here that Avadhuta is telling the I am free from birth till death completely and I don't have any needs because I am calm because I don't have any desire if there is no desire than why there should be any the waves in the mind I don't have any desire and I am neither happily I alone leave and one else then Abba tutor sharing his realization said this is a very important thing is a rarity crucial stuff but a VIN number Tabata me this is a great realization now you have to understand a little he has used the two words prakruti and purusa those who are following the philosophy Indian philosophy you know the Sanka philosophy the he gave this to name these two words Bharati and purusa what is the Purusha who shall be his consciousness and what is broke at the unconscious everything that we see over here is nothing but unconscious and it is working how through the consciousness so property and pollution if you are interested you can go through that shankha philosophy the protein solution is that main thing they are explaining vedanta has taken the many of their arguments and some vedanta in a different way but here he mentioned prakruti pollutions that worth of Ingham this is important Bharati and Purusha the winner I understand it that way pretty hearty meal but the may means the a Battuta doctor three he said I don't see that this is different and that is different when the world is there we said no no no no we should not go to the world and then we go back there is no I am spiritual nothing but actually those who have realized for them is completely different Shami be vacant and Irwin introduced services in the Hindu society each and everyone criticized and opposed only persons was with him the xiaomi brahmin and answered ananda stood by side I don't understand what he were telling but I support you that sari gelin than Romana and only about whom he began to say almost tears in his eyes one lady supported us who was not anything to support hard that is Macerata Bonita be when Noreen said means it is towards wish now what is that service to humanity and all the human other our traditional Hindu tradition the malls will enable do any work Kurama variety if you are performing any action immediately we'll get the result and that will be bound to you so the long don't do anything you'll be sitting in one place if anybody goes they will raise their hand and give some prana me that is all right you have to bring them food you have to give them everything and instead they will do any nothing so this is very peculiar I have seen in her natural Pradesh visited some of the places of the Buddhist monks as to follow them what they are doing and the Tawaf there's a biggest second-biggest book this monastery so that to Taba we have seen in the book these monks are going to the villages and entering into that house and they'll be telling that who your house is on date that these ghost has come these days and they'll be performing everything and afterwards whatever the poor fellow has accumulated they take all those and go away this is all wrong thing in the name of religion so this I have seen and what is this property and pollution all religion says this world is illusory this world is miserable this world you have to leave and the people they were confused so when they were cultivating to the oh what is this world is all temporary a little bit of food is sufficient for us as long as we leave how long you can leave like that why when you are there show your heroism for this plot of land I am going to cultivate the highest crop will come so that is saying I am going to complete and I will be successful and that is Bharata the period Ananda speed anthem means self-confidence there is completely different no negation affirmation that's why after Swami Vivekananda his very close disciple sister nivedita Saint in him there is no mundane war or spiritual world everything was same and same realization we find that in the Abba tutor prakruti parotias that but a Bingham pretty hearty me Swamiji said if you can close your eyes that is ramakrishna srila zation if you can see God by closing your eyes come to see God with open eyes and be vegan and understood that he saw the God and he said the human being you called him the sinners it is a scene to call him an so and then my special object of worship the downtrodden the in literate or oppressed its orbit anthem and when you go and serve the people then we are serving the living beings and what is this human beings for me become the same the best manifestation of God in them manifestation of God in everything at the best-managed manifestation in the human being when it baby child is coming he's shy his orphan and look straight slowly slowly you are giving the confidence confidence confidence then they are growing up you know that term in Andaman again so the our customer was on a very poor shadier all VIPs is to pass any now India VIP means all the time there will be minimum hype silence now what the police will also do there is no dream in under man so that was the good job so that they'll be in the three in the before to Baraka and this boys just to run to the gate to see that the people are going with the red light alone they could not think the VIPs because all the black the glasses but the light is going on the Polish is great I told them oh you were running to see that good God and then after seeing that tell yourself I am going to be one like that when I will go by five there will be 100 Sidon the vehicle will follow me I am going to be like that confidence confidence confidence so here also we find the world if you see is the manifestation of the God how wonderful it becomes friends I feel like sharing all my experiences with you and in this life have experienced so wonderful things I saw a little small girl hardly eight or nine years old when he went to a place I am not naming that village so there it was all submerged in the water we are going to give the other relief when I was talking with the gentleman he was a brown man and you know you know in our country the Brahmins mostly bare body that we having the Babita and he was talking then I suddenly noticed that the girl looking at me from small little opening of the gate and see looking that I come I will give you the candy and she in any way that the father - no no no no show me you don't call her why now she is we do and we do at this age oh yes is our tradition of money card still they were having that tradition she doesn't know anything afraid then I told you a LeBron Mindy what is supposed to be the leader of the society how you can become so ignoring those things were all over I have to understand these send hard to school let her get this education let her take that opportunity don't waste her life like this so this is property pollution we always think this world all suffering and this is different I have nothing to do with this majority of the Hindu if they'd in the only sannyasins I'm telling forget about other people only sannyasins if they realize the dream and the teachings of Swami Vivekananda our problems will be solved in the vast India with so much of population problems will be solved because the Swami's have 24 hours to dedicate and many of them are educated at least go to the villages and give them some the model training and then this will be and how it is possible with the philosophy and what is the philosophy if I am serving this if I am serving this society I am serving the Living God and a Buddha is giving us this training now friends main thing that we have learned in order to attain to the absolute one has to eliminate the mental differences or the movements of the mind yoga chitta vritti nirodh aha' what is meditation what do you got don't mix up with the hata yoga and Jana you were out of yoga is different what are you gay is the first tip of the Jana yoga but the body becomes ready then you practice the down on yoga the water yoga the first event in the general yoga this jnana yoga we are talking about and what is the Dianna chitta vritti nirodha what is the pretty thought waves and you have to control the thought waves Cheeta where the titta it is not the mind it is a cheetah and the Indian you know most of you those who are regularly attending you know that we have four compartments in English is same mind and we understand mine but mind has four different actions first mind is confused it cannot take the decision and in sanskrit it that is mana that is money the wind it cannot take the action it has got the information but it cannot take the action and when it is taking the action that particular capacity of the mind is called bhakti and then come the another part of the same thing which is chitter the storehouse all these impressions of the air in the storehouse and then britney's rather stay in that store hours the cheetah Brickton you know that you have to control that the sometimes the beginners they they go to a secluded place we have a retreat center in the machiner many people the right to us we like to go and have a personal retreat and sometimes is okay but only for your retreat practice meditation reading books just living alone it's okay so they we given for that now what they are supposed to do they read a lot of books and they'll be quietly sitting somewhere walking alone they do many of them they're very sincere so this is good thing what we are observing our store we are not connected with anything now so there is no fresh thoughts fresh fresh waves but the waves are constantly going on from where I saw a movie it comes to I read a book it comes to my mind somebody told me something that crops up in the mind in the store it is their bricktini Road no movement should be there a Buddha he is giving the training important you have to stop the mind and this is possible in two ways he his processes at - removing and destroying all the talks this is one removing and destroying all the thoughts how it is possible you have to renounce the family you have to go to a secluded place where nobody knows you there should not be any chances of meeting your known people so there you go if possible don't meet the human being be in the deep forest that is the way most of people they try to practice that and we appreciate them no that is one thing but the hillock people they do another thing what is that accepting as the manifestation of the Supreme Being everything that is more heroic I am here but I am NOT going to do anything I am NOT going to be affected by anything it is a very challenging thing very very challenging so most of the time the society they will say older the sannyasa and ER they have grown they are grown up in the family and then without looking after the family they're gone they are all selfish people this is one type of criticism others and I ask and another type of me is that I am here but at the same time I am NOT going to be attached with anything so be there at the same time know how it is possible constantly going on meditating and guard the car the consciousness God which is manifesting in different being I'm going to serve them this is what Shami Vivekananda introduced the one young boy came to Shawnee Vivekananda and he told said I like to be a monk like you is it good can you tell lies oh no no no no I cannot tell lies because the lie is not good go and practice lives past Swami's he said you do not stop you are not smart enough to tell a lie how can you think that you will realize God is not so easy our sister Doris EE stir your mind should be very strong and then only it is possible to give up give up is not so easy thing and very very difficult and sometimes we have seen some of the monks they'll be any any good thing has come to the ospa they'll be keeping and then they will go to meet the family and will they will keep to the mother I've come to the mother and present you to mother that is not okay we always some particularly here in America is okay no problem but you know if you are under the Ramakrishna mission twelve years you are not supposed to meet anyone connected with you so like that it goes so your mind should be that way and then slowly when your mind is some Arase eager wind you don't find this is my relatives my family and they are not that is gone each and every one manifestation of the same God I don't belong to this family I belong to the humanity when that is there now you can go that is bigger than this way the you must be dear serving so this he says one you have to remove and destroy the waves and tourists otherwise use that force of your mind thinking that anything that I see is the manifestation of the God and I am serving God not a human being is my sister's my brother nothing like that no human being don't consider in that reach poor educated uneducated don't think in that way so called samara sir and then he is suggesting first you is better to choose a gross thing to meditate to concentrate the spiritual life is nothing but controlling your mind your own mind and what is the ability nothing but your own mind you go to the guru you go to the temple you go to the religious places what actually would dream you're trying to control your own mind you are not going to help us Rama I will go and do some volunteering over Archer okay how much well interview what could be there if you are capable go and cut the grasses or clean these and clean that that's good but many thing is control your own mind you have to fight with your own mind this should not be any anger there should not be the compassion also yes they should do a filmy compassion I am doing because I know there are all these people and nothing but the manifestation of God I didn't have a harder when you are dealing with that sometimes you're cutting jokes making fun having someone the liking because of the same heart level is good but at the same time no attachment so choose a cross object what is the gross object now you have to be careful you are going to concentrate your mind on some object I repeat object so if it is an object like I like my mother so mother is my goddess and act immediately to my mother okay but you will get the qualities of your mother only well that is good but that will be limited and if you are meditating on particular God I only love the Vishnu Vishnu Bhagavad and nobody else it's also good but the same business van has manifested in everything even not looking at that that is not good then sometimes the mind becomes so narrow even your own God your chosen God if he comes and says he what is this I am also dad no sir I am NOT going to accept it that is called nano nose again Rami be vacant under he in his lecture his picture gives a small story there was a person he will never worship any one any God had goddesses except Vishnu and one day he put a fish too he told it in and he came the Shiva is also being the why he will not worship you sure no no no no I only watching you this okay except Shiva as one No so one day he purchased a very costly incense sticks that's a very good smell she burned that and he was meditating the English new to convenience his own devotee half Shiva and harp Vishnu was sitting before him an act may open your eyes I have manifested over here he opened their eyes and saw yes but hub person is Shiva and half his business you know what he did immediately he took some cloth and blocked the shivers portion of the nostril he whose not disturb you only but sometimes some people are so narrow-minded they came to that so why then this is money costly thing that only for you God why she was rude injured no fever should know so this is an amoeba can the same if your mind become like this where you are going to reach you have to understand this so he is now telling saga cheaper among padam a Battuta in the second chapter 24 verse Sun God cheat for among bottom he shall attain the supreme self who now the sku qualities rather the shabby need Buchta suribabu tahiti rata dear a Buddhist church villager Sagat chet palaburn padam rather trisha benny loopty friends these are the things we should remember now particularly we and of my age group we should understand the time is limited now reading this book that book is a new use only we have to understand what is the main thing we should concentrate and my rocker tisha be near buchta a mine free from the attachment and aversion attachment and aversion raga rodimus attachment and aversion young people they are doing is okay a lot of time is there this okay let them continue but for us time is limited we do not know when we'll be hanging of course if anybody does that and hanging on the wall and somebody else a movie I know him they know he means he was here like that raha tisha beanie looked and we talked about tongs and Don's but you do not know actually what we are going to achieve what if the quality should be there in us no attachment no aversion what remains only now only loud so this same solder Kapoor Tahiti rocker ah sorry Babu thir the wind we come over here we Patriots Indians do we are having the American passport in the pocket but whatever the one dollar we like to donate we don't have to India but American passport why because we cannot think that these people are also mine suribabu Tahiti sir Caputo eita it includes each and every one sorry boo-boo he ta da da and how it is possible do you know Buddhist chair having farm knowledge both of his knowledge from the both are good Buddha means the knowledgeable one the person with knowledge did a reporter's job my farm knowledge everything that we see everyone that we meet was nothing but the manifestation of the same God which I am so till the borders check then dearest you did I mean steady sometimes the emotion comes sometimes some people young people will come and say I like to go back to my country and to serve the uzuki but who and first stay here for five six months and see the situation how we can help them are they ready to take your help what is the situation what best you can do then only don't give up this job is so difficult to be here so like that you have to understand no emotion but very practical way of understanding this is called theorem D remains very steady once they take the decision it continue to scale rather the Isha paneer Moktar suribabu tahiti data did a Buddhist church leaders charge now what happens to this person now suppose one man achieved that he is free from the ragged Asia attachment and aversion he is helping each and every one help doesn't mean that you have to give money or any things really is also helping you know we do not know if we pray for other people someone is suffering just pray for him remember his face and offer the prayer to the God God I have no capacity to help him please help this person is suffering that will also help that is also eaten that is also good job that you were dream sorry Babu Tahiti did a Buddhist child and what is that knowledge everything is nothing but the manifestation of God I am getting the opportunity to serve them not that if I don't give little money they will die no there will be no they have the lifespan they will return only I am getting the opportunity to serve them and theatres just ad suppose that man having dead what is going to happen to him after death this is also a question a bad man a selfish man a cruel person he achieved everything and then he also dies and a good person is also dying are not equal no not at all so this here we have to understand the Hindu they developed the sightedness to understand the life is not only this it goes and goes and goes a long way and what happened to that man who has practiced the religion this then it says beautifully a second chapter 25 verse the Avadhuta Gita got even negative Akasha Akashi Yatta Yatta dijo a gobby tatar yogi sir who paper ahmad money cut evenly cut Akasha first is giving an example otherwise we won't understand that there is a feature and he said the feature space is there Akasha Hashem is the space now suppose that feature is broken Odin at an ardent picture what will happen to that particular sky which was there inside that it'll mix in the Akasha which is that complete everywhere the D huh Bobby D Harvey these are wind body dies fall what happens the consciousness which is already within me that will go and March with the param Atma Paramatma means the the highest consciousness then about water if we like to know what is this Paramatma you said that we will go and March in the Paramatma but what is this Paramatma step-by-step you see how it comes first you have to decide then you have to practice and what you are practicing controlling the mind how you can control two ways one you can go in the solitude and completely cut off from everything or be in this world but not of the world this is the second and when you are doing it how what are the things will develop within you and you will feel that you are not attached to it anything and you don't have any desire and you can love each and every one you can pray for everyone so the mind is elevated to that height of spirituality don't keep all those ideas that I saw the light coming to me you need just put on the switch and light will come why on this really meditating so that is not the thing it is good but them if the light is coming good if the sound you are listening good and if the per body is floating good part are you having these qualities if not then it is of no use so this we have to understand see Ramakrishna this type of people they always think of miracle power and see Ramakrishna is telling two brothers one became a cultivator another became a yogi so he the yogi went inside the jungle and meditated for twelve years and came back and met his brother and said hey you still they were cultivating look at me I have achieved the one full strength I can walk on the water is deep let us go then he hired the boat this first brother hired the board and he was crossing at the boat and the other brother was walking under the stream that real water and when they crossed over there he said see brother after 12 long years of practice you have only achieved one honor power I prayed that boat man won Anna but only a little money and I cross the river and without working unnecessarily in the Sun and you are working what is the use of it by this tourist Ramakrishna said don't go for the miracles go for the original love so the quality now the question comes and with this we'll aim the question is who is this brahmin who is this permanent who is this self you are talking about after our death that we are going to mix with him who is this then the Avadhuta says Nodame I am nice Pratibha nirahara team near Astrium this ocean near our shisha Nitin de did move up a loop the Shakti to an Asian Atmaram opt charlatan and that's why the opportunity is accepted as a high spiritual personality why not a mystic when he's explaining this he has not raped but from his realization all the thing that he said and you cannot explain the brahmana it is not possible to say bhagavati Ramakrishna said Brahm know it on me it means the defile no one can defile the Brahmin when we eat something and give let's call in Bengali in tow that means defy and here in this country it is very good we'll be eating and keeping and that called afterward the next day decreed so we I also do that what to the poor so heat and keep that and half-hour goes on but Brahman you cannot utilize you cannot speak about so they have not even our tongue could not touch the Brahmin so what to do then the the Hindus are very intelligent to make the person understand that highest self they have taken up Aroon duty nya what is this orang duty nya when father was showing a start to his son the son was not able to find that star so the father said well you can see that's long the tree on the bank of the river who yes it's a straight on the above go straight line you see that star yes now in the right hand side like this like this he goes in different direction and reach over there and that is the star I wanted to show this called identity now there's the theory and here the Avadhuta using the orders of the Tenaya by telling that it is eternal it is pure it is fearless it is formless it is support less it is known without body without desire and beyond pairs of opposite cyka cyka and near move are free from in illusion and then on diminishing power is having a daddies problem thank you friends we will discuss about then there in the third chapter if possible if you read the burden to gita in the third chapter the opportunity is expressing how can I explain the Shiva how can I explain the Brahman the supreme knowledge and then he is telling I that have that knowledge realize yourself and then he will understand to show me we become the say religion is realization unless and until you realize you'll be going here there and everywhere so let us chant this mantra and conclude in text and again we'll meet and we will continue with the abbot of the Gita young ROM Baro Linda Lutra murder student is deeply stably be the song [Music] butter crumb Upanishad ie guarantee Young Saeng Dianna was theta 30:13 amanecer question the young yogi know yes young Tom not be do surah surah gana the buyer does my namaha the here also they could not say DC's that Brahman so they're telling the yogi is meditating and the gods even the gods could not understand him like this like this all that way I worship Him that this is orinda Taniya again otherwise this impossible takes place about the Brahman Shanti Shanti Sean de howdy Hugh that frames I let you announce two things you know that we are celebrating the concluding program of Xiaomi B vehicle and
