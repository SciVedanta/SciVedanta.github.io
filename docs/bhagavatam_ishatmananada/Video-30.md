[Bhagavatam 016 - A Guide to Liberation : the Twenty Question Of Parikshit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zkkVXjx4jRI)

he's surrounded by a great number of people mostly the spiritual seeker the spiritual leaders of those days they are all waiting to hear the conversation of the king and the great sage sugar so we will imagine that particular the same and the same way in the Mahabharata also this is the uniqueness before death a person is either curious to know or giving the instruction about the spirituality religion how the life should be that is important they are not afraid of death in the Mahabharata we see the same way the Vishnu is lying down and he's surrounded by so many people including Krishna and they are asking questions but TGT steerer is asking the question and he lying on the bed of arrows giving the reply know nothing about the dead nothing about the misery the pain of the body nothing about that that is the uniqueness of this spirituality the religion so that we have to remember again and again when you are born you are going to die anything that is created is going to be destroyed when that is certain then why should we put all our energy to protect that rather let us develop the spiritual insight so that is the idea of the bhagavata and in the Bhagavata we find that the king made one mistake only was a great thing he was the sicom of the family of the pandavas and he made one mistake why because his body was aching and he was thirsty and he wanted only a glass of water and the only person he made he was meditative and naturally he could not control his anger and when he was praying for a glass of water a little water the person was meditating so deep he could not reply and whole thing happened in this way the king all through his life he was so just and now just because of one mistake everything done so one should learn that we should not part another thing that we learned from this scheme the brick sheet that the moment I have done something wrong and the great punishment is coming on me I am Not Afraid why that is be dontoh it become the teacher Swami Vivekananda's in the words of the vicar and there you are the maker of your own destiny how it is possible I made the mistake so that curse has come on me I am going to suffer I am not blaming anyone that is the speciality tremendous courage mental strength no blaming but utilizing that particular moment the person the king he weighed on the the bank of the river waiting for the death which was inevitable after seven days only seven days are left let me meditate so when he was meditating all people came around neighbor saying we can protect you we should save you we should see that the snake is not coming the tuk shaka cannot come over here they never talked about that okay this is no problem why do those answer we we gate in the Bhagavata before you start friends let us start with this sloka Shanta Buju gosh i annum but the moon are sunni shall be schwa harem governess attrition me marina Xu Hong Lakshmi condom Kamala Lionel you give me the honor dumb young Bundy Vishnu papaya para ser Apollo quakin Artem this LaVon Vishnu he is the center figure of the bhagavata from this Vishnu everything is coming but in every pages everywhere we will find the answers the discussions is based on the pure Vedanta which is God is all pervading he's not having any form and all these people that we see and the world that we see is nothing but the reflection of the power of God that is called Maya we listen to that friends we have already heard when this brick she'd asked the first question what a man should do who is going to die what should be his responsibility all the duties can you please tell me an answer you must have many of you who are regularly attending you know the answer was only one thing that you should do for getting everything all around him the mind should be dedicated completely hundred-person concentrated on the god or the Earthmen now this is the way he is explaining in the Shankar Acharya is giving the divination in the VBA to Romani what is devotion searching for the cell is devotional the different people in different way they have given the definition of the devotion and according to Shankar Acharya the pro founder of the Vedanta he said searching for the serve and all the whole emotion all your energy all your mental focus on what is self how can I reach over there because layers of the layers are there I have to remove all those and reach over there which is the consciousness because of which I am surviving but at the same time it is not we didn't mean but this is a very special condition very very special condition so we need a very special training also to reach over the earth and in the bhagavata we find again and again that this type of questions but Parikh she is asking but because of this questions we learned so many things it is not only about the cell because this world that we see we have to learn about that too we cannot just forget it it was there we are living within it about what is it so we find that discussion goes on and in our last discussion on that 15 the last month because I went to Canada and also the retreat we had to attain and I could not give the classes so after two weeks two classes today in unity as the great sage suka mentioned the form of God is nothing but the projection of the Maya now haveta is based on vision and considered Vishnu as a personal God and we considered Vishnu is having a form and we find how the Brahma the first created being by Vishnu could reach over there in a port of Lord Vishnu and he saw how the Vishnu is sitting and all the people around him he is giving the discrete description the Brahma is giving the description the Vishnu is there but in the sugar say yes that is also true but you know that was nothing but the projection of the Maya well once I Ramakrishna is telling a story that when a new mana was approaching Krishna the Krishna immediately asked Rukmini you become Sheeta and let me take the form of the Rama the doctor minotaur wife what one of those that you are the same but in this time you are Krishna I know but alumina will prefer to see me will like to see me as Rama so I will take the form of Rama and you also see it as schita let us take that form you know Saddam occasionally is explaining what is this through Maya changing I want to see my god as do God I want to see my god as these as that so that is the way so many gods and goddesses you study one lady was telling I have the problem with God and listen to what happened but the God is outside but I don't like to understand that I want to understand the God is inside who is stopping you think the God is inside it is there the God is inside and God is outside is all based on our thought but the ultimate knowledge unless and until we get that ultimate knowledge of the consciousness so here in the second book Rascals kanga each chapter now we have completed the fast scan done our second scan the eighth chapter King Farouk shield like a true spiritual seeker he is asking different questions to sukadeva writer sukadeva because he was the all-knower shuker the son of the sir he knew everything not that the other Rishi's were not knowing they were also knowing they also knew all these things but this time the brick sheet was asking this young sage the sugar and sugar is expounding sugars life was excellent so they accepted sugar okay you tell and they are all at listening this also when you look at the society when someone he is becoming very famous and he is giving the talk sugar was very famous at the time and other Rishi's are not at all jitters they're all squiggly sitting over there listening to the conversation and as if they are the student of sheikah that is the beauty because they knew all these things are immaterial the only thing that matters is a realization unless and until you realize it and it is of no use so that we find the sugar is giving that answer translators this questions are very pertinent and very interesting also and this answer the sukadeva gives a different dimension to power order the bhagavata is a scripture but as the brahma-sutra is a scripture will the open ishes the scripture bhagavata has especially to you what is that speciality is a scripture no doubt speaks about the highest bid on thick truth that God is all pervading and it is not any any form but again and again it explains all these things all around us about the universe karma pala a Genma breath to move the everything and this King brick shield he was actually tapping constantly asking the question and the answer was coming from sukadeva and Halyburton he says because as a pedantic scripture no doubt but excellent blend of knowledge and devotion the knowledge and devotion is blended over here the only pure knowledge the dry knowledge ceramic is not or I cannot accept that don't be like that he said I do not like that only dry the knowledge with other people are trying all around they're suffering and I am thinking and the self all those people are dying and they let them die let them suffer it's a it is not my responsibility because all these things are Maya know it is wrong a completely wrong one swami vivekananda he went to visit his brother disciple to lea and the G and who was practicing austerity at the bank of the river I think it is Jamuna and he was in a heart in the next heart there was another monk the early morning used to chant the bhagavad-gita but he was not playing the Sanskrit properly the pronunciation was very wrong and today analogy was the excellent the exponent of the bhagavad-gita kalyanam that you never corrected him Shami ji went about there one day he heard the man is chanting in a wrong way he said why you have not corrected him now that's not my duty he is doing in his own way let him do immediately shiny Vivekananda became very angry is this your bed anta this Vedanta that is asking you to be aloof in the suffering and mistakes and the wrong dreams of the people all around you this is the special Vedanta see Ramakrishna be vacant and the introduced it has been turned as neo Vedanta the completely associated with each and every one but at the same time not does to anything why the knowledge is there that all these things belongs to Maya l know Maya but at the same time as long as I consciously is their body Association is there I must go and help them so be hidden under started teaching that person then the proper way then Trianon did you also join we began the he was asking his brother disciples to come and serve the people in different manners somewhere all over the India somewhere outside also and to some the came over here and this is called practical Vedanta this practical Vedanta here we find in the Bhagavata is a nice blend of the knowledge and devotion bhagavata is a Hindu theology it is explaining God and the Hindu religious beliefs also then when we read the questions I am NOT going to read all the questions you have to take the trouble to read those yourselves and we'll go to the next chapter in the next Condor where the answers are coming but some of the questions we will discuss twenty five questions he asked related to so wonderful different varieties so it is the theology that comes up the theology means that about the God and the things that we are practicing so this is the Hindu theology and the implicit questions and the answer of the Chicot Deva mycology also as a wonderful way is explaining so the mycology theology and philosophy these are the three things the gate in the Bhagavata so that's why in the Bhagavata is so popular the ordinary people also they are eager to listen to the bhagavata but about reading the vedanta very few in America only all the pedantic the discussions are going on if you go to India no once is only a few handful people are interested about Vedanta mostly they like to know about the God and the Karma Fela and all these things so boy in mind over here and the first questions that they're correct it is asking the Atman is spirit non-material how does it then come to have a body which is material look at this question and look at the mental stability and the intellect of the person who is going to die after a few days I don't know how many days already passed because it is only seven days and this is the question is asking Atman is a spirit and non-material how can it be associated with the material is there any cause or is just accidental now that Artman we call it G Bartman the individual self because of that we are leaving moving talking o Louisville life is nothing but because of that but we do not know what is that and we didn't care to know about it we are more eager to know everything but not the art man so they say that this is the ignorance of guiana and about the Guru this is of Jana Timmy Rhonda's here Jana Jana Solaria who is the Guru here the sukadeva is the Guru why he is disappearing removing the ignorance and the people they never talk about herself they are careful or caring about the next life after this life I was very comfortable over here in the next time new thing I will get like that some people said why not donate some money so he thinks okay just by giving some donation I am securing a seat somewhere is called heaven so he's imagining that I will go to the heaven there are also some good situation will be there I'll be happy he's always concerned about himself I want to be happy but were you before your birth very well after your death when you are going to go nobody cares and that is colleague Norns and it is so deep so we need an Avatara to remove that ignorance so he is asking this question and in the second question this is question he has asked in the second skander eighth chapter seven verse and at the eighth verse he asked a person is having many organs and limbs the supreme being from whom this person and the whole world is created also having as you saved same limbs what is then difference between the Supreme Being the God and the person look at the question how intently he is putting it and this is what about them so I really wonder if the people who are reading the bhagavata whether they go through these chapters or not there are some very very devoted chapters there I mean the God about the God the description of God immediately after this then we agreed description about the brahma visiting the lord and the description of all those things of the earth but the question is a very intelligent question first and foremost how this body which is inert can have a consciousness inside how the consciousness it attached it along back so I got received discussion in one discussion then I to give the answer I told there is a wonderful adhesive you know there's a very powerful once you stick and then it's going to stick for all life and the name of the adhesive is Omkara ego because of the ego because of dad we are associated though the self is completely free it is not having anything as a suited with this body but it is associated because of the ego I consciousness aye-aye-aye and that's why the eyes ceramic is not at all if you remove that eye problem is solve only there so I means that ego that I am doing it I am doing it I am all this so that is the problem for the spiritual growth in the worldly life it is okay when you have to work in the what field you have to say I know this that is okay but at the same time we deem if you are not humble who God because of you I could say like this I could do like this if the humbleness is not there then you are bound and that curve of Allah will bring you back again and again and in this life so tap here it says how it was that person who is having a lien why he is asking this question a condom and Allah Karim a Conda there is no condom and in the padartha when he are proving that it is only one there are swab of the Veda bisciotti Aveda SWA got a beta of these three different Vedas at their differences that there and we have many times we have discussed over here and if you say that here there is no animal in this room in this Chapel we are only one that is human being and nothing else is the God like that one immediately them sin no okay the difference between a tree and a man the God is a divine and all other things are naught is the code differently like that one as you say is it like that no such a hottie patottie swallowed a veil in the saga together he says the God is one person just like ours like having the hands and the legs they said no he is not having any means and that particular idea the abstract idea without any leaves that consciousness to make the ordinary people understand that particular abstract idea they made Germanotta the image of juggernaut no hands no only nothing but he's the witness that's way too big eyes so that is the witness here we find is asking is it just like any other human being having the names third question is asking is going on asking the questions sugar they were only listening he is not giving the answer he will give answers afterwards and the Brahma the first born Navi but Massa mood Papa ended sa Navi but muscle power the fastball the he was born out of Vishnu so that he has seen that Rishi that divine form of the Supreme God that Rupa and not coating the whole suspect at this local but the roof on that Rupert that Rupa at the form of the god who saw Brahma please give me what was that divine for how it is so from the question we can understand that if sukadeva was also knowing about that so he could explain what the Brahma saw the firstborn saw that image of God sugar liver was also having so she could explain that's why but she is asking sugar can you please explain to me Linda another verse he said such a fee yet revolution beitia City good Baba a payara Muktar odd naman yung Myesha shitty surco Guevara very simple sensitive it says such a big saw that char and open again yet revolution kirusha means the one that consciousness which is residing in the heart as because it is residing sapore from the Buddha the pollution the one who is residing inside in the pool this Purusha is not about the general vicious city would Baba Yaga the hint Supreme Being who is the Lord of Maya Maya Asia the my Asia Minor Manisha means the God the Lord the Maya the Maya Asia and in Twitter within all being cerebral whoo-ha-ha shyah shyah shyah means the place at GU honey's we're inside the heart the that is deciding as if within our heart that consciousness is deciding to serve the GU harsh ayah in the Punisher also it says that it is in the so in the heat in the heart always we try to meditate God why because it says that God is residing within the heart but the physical heart that the doctors are doctors knows and we are thinking about it's not that hard but is it we have to understand that they're giving us an imaginary way as if there is a gale and in that Gale the God is their support our share also the source from which the creation sustainer such tension and the dissolution take place vishal city baba a payara bishop this universe city would wobble and a failure in what form does he mean now the question is now this all-pervading God with residing in every heart when he is Maktub are omyeon his free from his are tamiya how he will remain that is the question is very very difficult to answer so we will presume looking for the answer of the sugar how is explaining almost impossible to answer because then you have to answer about the Brahman then no one can speak about the brown but we find how sugar is giving the dancer and it says Buchta art no Maya mati Cheeta Cheeta means lying down this is the way they explain the lying down as if the god is lying down Vishnu mostly you will see that he is lying down and some of the afterwards win the Lord Buddha became very popular very famous then his disciples also started making the images our booth the lying down he is lying down that means he is in Activ a full of knowledge so that is the idea when a person is lying down Shiva is lying down the mother Kali is standing she is active the power of the Sheba taking the form of the mother Kali performing all this but the Shiva himself is just lying down here the Vishnu is also lying down in the question also when he is separate from his Maya that means he is not doing any action so Maya is the power of God with the help of the power of God is all working so procedure never comes to us we have never seen president but his people are acting all the police personnel and different government officials having a seal and because of that power of President they are all working when they are asking us to stop we have to stop because the power if ordinary person someone then we won't stop because he is not having that power damn business giving that example there was a pond and the villages is to come and throw all the litres and making the place dirty and so many people who ain't and told them please don't do it these don't do this but the you never listen then they went to the coat and the person came with the order from the court and say if anyone making this place dirty will be punished and all stopped and this is the power of God and when there is a power of God then activity the God cannot lie to how God cannot sleep the new tween that activity is not there so obviously God must be lying down taking rest inactive how it is possible that is the question in what form does he mean when he disassociate himself from his own Maya please remember the word Maya means the power of God it is inner power of God the Maya we have heard that there are Wars Chattanooga Choo - Dutch woman 14 the Potala and like that there are 14 the different who burns are their words please tell about that and who are protecting that and a form from his limbs again the words and their protectors constitute his limbs why this contradiction now there's a description the what is the God God is all these things limbs means this is his and diseases late diseases these and the pollution sugar if you read in the peloponnesian and that they say the pollution is aid is the brahmana and his hands at the Kshatriya and his ties are the bushes and the name of the shooter the eyes the Sun and the moon at the eye the description of evolution as a huge boosha boosha shootin is a pura the whole the poem is there the chanting is there the pollution of the very famous but is it true and why these four they are given if you see these are the forms of the God again you see God created this why this contradiction who is what that you have to explain and then he is asking the time different type times of their culpa you know that immediately after the birth there will be noting down the exact time of the newborn and then the place and accordingly the date time and place perfectly if you can give to someone who can do that type of calculation can tell what jothika jetha means the person who was born will have in his life success misery failure they can they can understand that in many of the cases it is true how it is possible because the timing and sometimes we don't think so much seriously of course in America they are very specifically saying in India nowadays maybe they are doing in the olden days they used to say not that time it was it will raining every year this rain throughout that time nobody knows so the one Bangladeshi boy he rang me I told what is your age for some reason I have seen history he said you see that and truly they say that I was born on such-and-such time to three years before but in my official that my minus three that means I'm now I am 31 exactly if you see it is 34 so that is the way the ischium they are counting so if you try to understand the timing it is very impossible but just imagining like that but here he wants to know the timing what is the different time lengths between gulper the full cycle and the gulper these are the terminologies used for in our mythology's and there it says the color and the color how to understand as for the decision of time the past present and future we always say that is the past but how long we will say that up to this is the past history is also past and at the time of that was also passed at the time of Ramachandran is also passed so how can we calculate the past and the present and the future that are the questions is asking because he asked and the answer the she could've gave afterwards so a new system developed to understand to analyze the future of people how they wear what they will be and had present what they are going to do everything the petite Berta MA and Bobby shipped but if you look at the Vedanta codes all now recently we will be going to the retreat in this way you hear all these things nothing very soaking but at the same time when that's why I spoke about cinema history instilling you have to take the whole thing the shell and the kernel both your fatigue they know little bit total otherwise you are simply thinking in that way are you ready really if you are not then you have to take these but the man Aditi sure and all these things otherwise you won't be able to develop your life what is the span of life of human or the big trees of the Devils the human span of life now let us try to get the answer of the first question he was asking how the self which is consciousness got actors to eat unconscious material like the body to answer this what the sukadeva is telling Shikoku vulture our mom I am Rita Rajan Parsa unum of art Manama knockety the artisan bundle shop not rush to a bow on jihad anova Batman aha the spiritually conscious entity like the cell phone of a Godman aha Atman that is conscious about the real self that is our self now artists are gonna have any connection with the inert body it is no it is truly not close Vedanta in Bhagavad the consciousness that you think that it is there within us truly it is nothing it is not their friends let us go back to some other aspect this is the from that consciousness everything has come ego humbug watch a movie and the one I like to be many and in Hinduism because of the freedom different type of the ideologies have come different of the explanations are come and hear the same explaining the open ascetic the the stotra iike Hama I am one I had to be meaning he just wished an immediately everything came up it's not the one after another it all came then when it came what we see is the inner thing but who taught that I like to be many consciousness the consciousness when it is creating how can that be inert there's the doubtful that's why a majority of the religion they cannot give the answer to these and here only we differ that God is the creator this is the universe we are related with the God everybody is telling like that but the problem is how God created if he is creating with some material where from he got the material and if he is creating out of himself than we are supposed to be conscious because he is consciousness though obviously something that you are making out of sugar cannot be beaten it must be sweet and you are making a sweet as something out of sugar and it is bitter that means you have mixed something else on sugar it cannot be beat it so that we if the God which is consciousness has created this universe everything must be conscious then why we are not then why we are burning this body or barring this the body after death so the answer is parasha our room I am ready parisa means the god the Lord Peraza and different terminology used to explain how to address here the parousia means the God our whom I am because of his power retain without diluting power of the Lord it is not possible the power of the Lord literally dinars and we are thinking it is true and so we think that we are associated with the consciousness it is not they say that when one person is dead then what happened now again let me remind you because a little complicated way there are something that we have to understand how about the existence one this gross body and inside the gross body they say this subtle body the subtle body is the main combination of the subtle bodies the mind and after that the causal body which you know one can understand we can go up to the mind we can understand the mind the 2d mind is very happy yesterday it was not happy we can understand the mind then goes to cause that cause for which all these things are happening and then comes the Supreme Being the consciousness the causal body then the subtle body suksham sharir then the gross body this reader these all three are active because of that power and that power is called as change the new consciousness now the thing is the consciousness is it associated no disrespect it recently only all people who are looking at the sky the night sky to see the huge moon the red moon the blue moon and wonderful big moon and after so many years only this big moon comes and the bright light of the moon is the light actually moons no according to science we notice a reflected light of the Sun so the reflection of the Sun and similarly the reflection of the consciousness that is coming out on our subtle body that is mine we think that we are conscious in reality we are not so this is the truth this is the knowledge if we can understand that then what will happen our ego will go away so we are just the reflected things and nothing else so later us try to reach to the original this is the opportunity the human being is having their Shankar Acharya in the BH Romani from the second verse to seven words all these verses dedicated for the glory of the human birth and in this human birth was the speciality became discriminate we can think we can judge that is the speciality of the human being and with that if we utilize yo jet evading not as optimistic not yet er abated multi-beam esteem here and now if you can realize then you're blessed if you cannot you do not know what is going to happen to you in your in your next birth and the questions will come again and again there what happens to the human being accounting to their world what table what one should do to reach to the level of God that they was they said they were they were is not the the God that with the conception of God the Devers are the the being that is in between the God and the human and they are having tremendous power on the phenomenal world so that is called Eve as many people wants to go up to that that they will be different the controller of the air controller of the light controller of anything so that's called the Devo condition so they go into that then it continued in this way asking the question Sapna rush to Eber now giving the example now you in the dream if you see that your body is running and you are perspiring and you are tired and you are hungry then suddenly some sound and your sleep is broken and the dream is also broken what happened oh I am relieved that much but just before that when you you are in sleep when you are seeing that dream you were associated with everything isn't it you never thought that oh it is a dream I need not to be so worried about it time it became so real to you similarly this life also sometimes the bad things are coming something good things are coming we need to worry about that why because it is our dream let me conclude with the story of Raghavan Saddam Krishna and he said that one farmer he was sleeping in the meantime something happened he is only one son he was bitten by snake and he died so everybody was crying the white was also crying and she came and saw the farmer is nicely sleeping they she pushed him up and said how come that he was sleeping your son is dead the farmer got up and went and saw that dead boy and he was quietly standing over there up to this we think oh my god the person is a matter what no having no sympathy for his son but he was a Gani so how then when the same with his wife reacted that can't do even cry for your son then he said no let me think about it just before you pushed me I was seeing a dream and in the dream I saw that I am a king and I am having seven sons and now when the dream is broken in this life I see now I am a farmer and I am having one son which is true let me try to understand that is bad out there so you have to understand the truth and the moment you can understand the truth don't be get attached all emotional try to understand with the judgment that is true and I was imagining in the dream and when I'm away I am also happy imagining and this is the two lives that is all possible only because of the consciousness and if we are having this knowledge then there'll be no suffering in this life why because you know the suffering the please all criticism all these things misery and suffer and the joy is nothing but the same thing only two wheels that is happening that's okay so that way that is called the pedantic Drishti the pedantic Drishti this way if we can develop the hundred-person the mind completely detached from the present light and also the dream life what will remain only joy and nothing else but will remain that tremendous courage that nothing is going to change and I am thinking that I am going to lose no nothing is going to change friends it goes on asking this type of questions so next day again the question and truck will try to answer if you are interested please go to this other second skander 8th chapter and from 7 to 23rd verses if you read and all these questions will come seconds come that the book is called second and then it will be a chapter from 7 to 23 all the questions are there and from the next chair skander and we will I think nine skander the sugar they were is going on giving the answer we will try to understand that the answer part of the sugar diva thank you very much let us join this man radical conclusion now you started with a personal God and we conclude with the impersonal same God as a personal and impersonal so this to total is in Risa young [Music] what do you mean Rudra the student a deep barista ye be the sound but the drama Upanishad I guarantee young Sarna was theta that Nikitina manasa pasyanti yam yoginah yes yonder Navi do sudo su Tigana the

already full we won't be able to invite you to go to that retreat where our capacity is maximum hundred fifty and third and ninety-two maximum 95 people can be inside the campus and others have to stay outside in different hotels and motels and come to attain that including this too we are now having nearly 160 1970 so increasing more will be difficult because the fire marshal will come and will be in great difficulty because the system rules we cannot do that then the kitchen accommodation and all those things are there so some people who could not or will not be able to go to that Ganges retreat we have arranged two more lectures of the same Shami seprieono energy over here in Hindu temple on 26th evening 26th morning it will be over in the Ganges 26 evening lamont in the
