[Bhagavatam 080 : Kah Pantha ? Sri Krishna Show The Path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4eMyJ1bzCk)

good morning friends today is sunday morning here in chicago in america and will be the sunday discourse is the bhagavatam and today is a very interesting topic the krishna is giving the guidance what is the way so krishna will be guiding us let us start with this [Music] sure was preparing to end his krishna avatara leela so he was ready to depart and we have already discussed majority of the people of his own clan they killed themselves fighting among themselves and few they fled from there and only one or two like the uddhava they were with the krishna so uddha was asking the krishna and yudhov was worried about the dharma the righteousness the practice of the righteousness so uddhava he was thinking the krishna was the guide christians to tell people what to do and what not to do if that lord krishna is not there the vedas are there but only handful of people they will practice that what about the majority of the people what about the whole society and after the devastating war in the kurukshetra what will happen to the righteousness in the war the mind of the people that goes down to the animal level they try to teach each other and then they will be killing they'll be looting and just for the survival so that was the temperament now how to restore the righteousness the dharma what krishna will do of course the pandavas they were ruling but still uddhava was anxious he wanted the guideline from the krishna so he asked ka panta what is the path is the vedantic question there what is that path and here also in bhagavata the same krishna and you know the krishna in the bhagavata and krishna in the bhagavad-gita that's very interesting there some people they like the vaishnava the way so they will say the bhagavata is their book but it's the same krishna who gave the highest philosophy vedantic philosophy in the bhagavad-gita whatever it may be and moreover we know it was expounded by the great rishi and the and the sannyasi sukadeva and it was listened by the first the it was listened by one pariksit king parikshit was ready to die there was no a desire in his mind except the god realization he knew that after seven days he is going to die and whole this thing within the seven days only now we are in the almost the last part it is the 11th skanda we are reading there is this 12th but that gives the explanation of many the families so that is not that we we are not going to study but in the 11th and we are concluding almost in the that shri krishna is giving us the guidance so he is asking the what will happen being a realized soul himself he knew that this world this phenomena is utterly temporary attaching the mind with this elusive creation of god and forgetting god himself bring misery life after life so lord krishna already spoke about the path of knowledge practice of the dispassion and discrimination but even then the krishna has also in detail given the injunctions that are to be followed by the people at different stages of life swadharma astrama chaturbarna we have already discussed those this is all done even then the uddhava is asking pantha what is the path for the ordinary people now those who are capable for them it is okay but those who are not shall we leave them like that let them die no that cannot be and that is the mind of a sadhu sadhu doesn't mean that he's a monk saddam is a good person and how can you consider that he is a good person he thinks for others he feel for others they are suffering their joy everything is reflected in his own mind so that is a sadhu and his mind is so soft so kind so he always thinks first for the people they are why they are suffering and how to and then he is asking how they will get both enjoyment of this worldly life also the success the self-confidence the respect and at the same time the spiritual knowledge so he is asking the uddhava chair this is the 19th chapter eight verse and it says so he is asking that uh oh lord of the universe we say swara ishwara israel means the lord visa is the universe lord of the universe whose form is the universe this is very interesting and bishop you are the lord you are the creator at the same time you are this phenomena you are this bishop so in two words everything is very clear and that is hinduism so those who are actually thinking about hinduism practicing hinduism interested in hinduism should understand this the god and his creation but this creation is also the same god you are the this world maybe this world is temporary and you have created it so if i transform this bishop as your murthy if i transform this world as your different forms then i see god every moment every time i live with god that is the idea so god has become so many in different forms names in different places in different times but that is the same god and what will happen i cannot criticize others i cannot heat others i cannot fight with others so that person will completely change because he will see god in everything that is the ultimate goal of the religion to become one with god so he says oh lord of the universe and your form is the universe please tell me how this pure and ancient knowledge coupled with dispassion and realization becomes td we have the idea about it we have the knowledge about it some intellectual conception about it but we want to live with it that is called vikyana so he has used the word bigana sirama krishna bhagavan srama krishna again and again he said about the big jana big gyani means one who is living that life understanding and living are two different things i know that there is some when a good things are there in the milk but i never drank milk i never got the effect of the good effect of the milk this is the difference i know about milk but i didn't get that within my system so that difference he says so how this pure and ancient knowledge pure and ancient that is eternal knowledge the knowledge not that it was created at that time not that shri krishna created that knowledge no it is eternal knowledge it is there there whether the people remember it or not it will be there this pure why pure because it takes my mind towards god so pure so pure and ancient knowledge coupled with dispassion and realization why he used these two words this passion and realization without the dispassion dispassion for the world and worldly things the creation of god i won't get the god if i am happy with my father's property i will never get the father father will say okay my son is happy with my car and my these and that let him be there but if i would like to go near father the company of the father love of the father like to be one with him i have to give up all his wealth and say father i like you i love you i like to be with you that much so either god or god's creation god creations well you will get some joy but temporary again the misery will come so he says the pure and this purity means thinking about god thinking about the world is impure thinking about god is pure it's a pure and ancient knowledge the eternal knowledge and it gives what how we get that knowledge through dispassion dispassion of this detachment of these worldly things and realization it is not only knowledge it is also the use of that knowledge in my personal life in our lives that is called the realization becomes steady maybe i will have the glimpse of god in my meditation but i want to make it steady i want to find god all the time every moment also tell me about the devotion which the great souls practice so here is the devotion on the basis of this that sometimes some people will say that the bhagavata is the book of devotion no the first nine chapters of the bhagavata there is no god there is only vishnu and only knowledge knowledge knowledge and there are so many incidents and so many stories and the conversations all about the knowledge and here also we will find what is this without devotion knowledge won't come so that is what lord the lord said well yudhisthira also wanted to know this religion of liberation of liberation so i have given the name the bhagavata a guide to liberation liberation the mukti mukti from what from ignorance and what is that ignorance i me mine all this is the ignorance and because of this ignorance i am getting attached with these worldly things and this worldly things are temporary i am trying to hold and it is sleeping all the time i like my son i like my daughter i like my father mother wife family and my society but everything goes away and one day i'm also dead and my the soul which was attached to that since it is not getting their company it suffers and that's called hell what is the hell suffering why is i suffer because of my attachment so this we have to understand this is very important hell and heaven what is heaven joy without attachment and what is hell suffering because of attachment so these are the two differences so uddhava asks this question the it is having the two parts what's that moksha dharma the religion of liberation religion-based practices and those practices will take us to liberation and when the uddhava asked we you can find that there are two parts are there one about the knowledge and about the devotion the first part the uddhave the lord is giving the answer the sri krishna he's quoting the bhishma now this is a great teaching bhagavatam krishna also again and again you will find in the gospel he said i heard it from so and so i learned it from so and so is never mentioning that this is i am giving no so this is not claiming that thing that is not mine there is a first thing the truthfulness non-stealing that's the first of the religion we quote many other things i have heard so many people simply quoting sirama krishna and vivekananda's ideas and ideologies language only they are changing but never ever acknowledges that these ideas i got it from bhagavan si ramakrishna are swami vivekananda very few and sometimes they mention about swami vivekananda because vivekananda is so popular and vivekananda's works are so well known the people will say oh these are all known but from krishna's ideology they don't acknowledge why with the subconscious mind that i will be appreciated by the people that desire is there when the desire is there that means you are not a pure soul any desire and the worst desire is the desire for popularity the spiritual life the worst desire is desire for popularity a people will appreciate people will clap and people will talk to me that is all for the desire so loko ishana in sanskrit it says krishna the god himself and he gave everything even then here when they asked the question that uddhava he said see after the krukshetra war yudhisthira also wanted to know it and we all went the yudhisthira the sparing spearheading the yudhisthira we all went to vishma who was then waiting for his death and then we went and asked him bhishma was a a man of knowledge so what he said i will tell you so from the vishwa he is quoting so so this is the knowledge and what is this knowledge and very interestingly he is explaining about the world and then he is telling it is not real how he says knowledge is to know this world which is the combination of 9 11 5 3 if you can remember first is nine what is the ninth it's called you can count purusa prakriti mahatma means the cosmic intelligence ahamkar that is the individual intelligence or ego and five tan matras so this is the nine four plus five nine then eleven what are the eleven five organs of knowledge added with five organs of actions plus mind this is eleven then again five five elements and that is called bhuta in sanskrit five elements is the earth water fire air and ether and three finally what are the three is the gunas satya the students of vedanta and those who are observing are listening to this talk you are all acquainted with these terminologies this total 9 plus 11 plus 5 plus 3 this is the total world this whole universe is the sum total of these and nothing else but they are all lifeless until and unless it is added with one what is that one that is brahman this is the god created these and then entered into it because the god the consciousness entered so i feel i am leaving i am talking i am giving the knowledge to other people i feel proud all this thing comes because of the reflection of the gods consciousness on my intellect that's all so this is the world what is the knowledge understanding the world is the combination of only these but without the one it is nothing the bhagavatam krishna therefore he said if you put one fast and then add as many zeros it will carry the value otherwise there is no value only zeros no value so one means the god if the god is there then only world exists if the god is not there then it is dead and dry and nothing limits so that is the first knowledge then second part of the question is the devotion friends the 11th book the skanda 9 19 chapter from 20 to 23 these four verses 20 21 22 23 these four verses total it contained about the devotion and how to develop devotion and what is this devotion i won't quote from the sanskrit rather i will give you the meaning of it to develop devotion to the supreme god one should with faith one constantly listen the words of the god this is the first thing you have to go on listening that's why this bhagavatam krishna said that you have to go to sadhu sadhu sangha and all all scriptures they say satsanga sadhu sanga what listen listen listen about god and listen about that that analytical way and at the same time emotional way you listen about the god the constantly listening the words of the god meditate on his activities meditate on his activities this is also very interesting unless and until we know the qualities of the god then we are constantly thinking about now the ganesha chaturthi it has just a study to us there there are thousands and millions devotees they will be worshipping that image of the ganesha is that ganesha now this is quality the quality of god if we don't think or meditate or ponder over i will never generate those so this is bhagavan sirama krishna again said nama guna kirtana nama is the name of god only name of god or the form of god won't help you his guna the gods qualities and also kirtana kitana means with all devotion with all respect with all faith when you are going on remembering then only you will get the devotion so fast constantly listen second meditate on his activity third analyze and explain to others so when we are explaining to others we are having the dialogue with others then my doubts also goes away because i was thinking it is like this then when i shared my idea with someone else you'll say no it should be like this you get another viewpoint and you can understand oh yes that will be much more better so that is the reason why so many varieties of religions are there because of this different view views are there obviously those who are trying to develop the devotion faith in god from different angle they can analyze no problem but one thing should be there i'm not going to hurt anyone i'm analyzing and then i'm thinking this is the path that i should follow these are the activities that i should do you are welcome to do those but don't hurt others if those activities are hurting others that is not religion that cannot be the path of devotion then the fourth feel joy in worshipping god sometimes the people are there worshipping god in the temples and other places but not finding joy it's a short of a job that they do that perform that and get their salary and maintain their families not like that it should be full of joy bhagavan sirama krishna he accepted the puja of goddess kali and when he came to dakshinesha if you read the background of sudama krishna he's an open book and the book of religion each and everything that the different scriptures are taught talking about telling us it is all they are demonstrated in his life so it is so important the life of bhagavatam krishna and when he is worshiping the goddess kali before him his brother used to do that after him till now so many people are doing the same thing but what is the difference that these people worship and bhagavan sram krsna's worship he did it with love and with great faith the mother i am offering you food if you don't take food if you are just standing like a stone image then why should i offer food you have to partake you have to take you have to talk to me you have otherwise this conversation that all the time i am doing so this is called the worship with love the feel joy in worshipping god then chant the hymns this is also very important southern india this tradition is there they will learn so many chanting even the children i have seen over here in america also the parents young couples whatever they have learned they are now teaching it to their children and sometimes they take to some other astronauts who are teaching the chanting so they believe the chanting is very very important in the spiritual life of course but the meaning of those chants sanskrit words that expression that i am giving through the words that should i should feel those also that is also important so chant the hymns should be happy to work for god swami vivekananda said think yourself blessed that you have been chosen for this particular job that is called one should be happy whatever the responsibility i have been given by the authorities i am happy with that so that happiness just murmuring oh why this work has given to me i am so and so i am so educated i am so capable these people are not giving me the opportunity so what happened many of the times those who come to the organization after sometimes they go away and they start another astronaut no problem they can do that at the back of their mind what is there and suppose they are in the organization that i joined to develop my spiritual life in the immorality they are practicing of course i should not be there i can leave if there is immorality but if there is no immorality just because to satisfy my desire when i am going is it not that my ego is working my impulse that i should go out i should start another astronaut and i should show the people that i can do is not that ego so those who are in the organization spiritual organizations should remember this the moment you are joining an organization as a spiritual religious organization you you are no more that individual you're a part of that organization so anything good for that organization that you can bring yes that you are really giving something to the organization and anything bad that you do it goes to the organization not to you people won't remember your name they'll say oh so-and-so organization they are not good people because of us so one should be very very careful should be happy to work for god not to satisfy others for god so friends i remember when i first joined in the chirapunji as a hilly hill station in the northern northeastern part of india i was very picturesque the very beautiful but from there and when i joined this 1975 so that time the road was narrow so many difficulties and there was no market nearby but we had a school and and the hostels so someone has to go down to gowarty a long journey to purchase so i was given that so i went and the the vehicle that was given to me and the driver both were very old so i had a lot of troubles we went over there and being a brahmacharya i'm not supposed to eat outside so somehow then i came back and it was late night because of the fog is so dangerous to drive all those things were over when i came back then i found only one plate of food is left over there on the dining table and no one waiting for me i had to share that food with the driver also because he was also hungry and i was not very happy why these people should do like this they should at least think in this way then next morning after the prayer in the breakfast table the injured swami he started asking before others there are other shmongs and brahmacarians and other stops are also their devotees hey you have purchased this thing oh you have oh you are not intelligent enough it could be purchasing much less price and these and that again and again he never said and you have taken so much of trouble so he never said that like a young man of 24 i think oh these people they don't know how to appreciate the work the sincere work that i did so i became little angry and when you become angry that you stop eating food to me bring to notice to other people that you are angry so that i practiced and then no time the swami came knocked the door took me over there fed me then he took me to his room and then that is the teaching i never forgot he said you are angry and you are feeling miserable you know why because i have not appreciated you do you work for me and if you do that you are going to suffer if you work for a person who is in charge just for his happiness you are going to suffer work for god god is the jagannatha two big eyes constantly looking and observing everything will be noted by god so work for god that was a great teaching he said should be happy to work for god be humble before god admire other devotees of god when the other devotees are coming sometimes we feel they should not come because my importance will go away if they're coming and doing that that is the worst thing god never likes it so the god is the any person coming and if he is doing something for the god i am happy that they are doing for my god my lord and my beloved that is the devotion but majority through the time you will find that among the devotees who are attached with the astra or among the monastic members also a little bit of jealousy little bit of these things are there it should not be so these are the teachings we should not only read but try to imbibe admire other devotees of god then you look upon all beings as god always be active to serve god always remembering god sometimes what happens we get attached to some particular person and we serve him and we think he is my god that is okay but he's not individual he's an organization i'm talking about the organization we are a part of the great organization ramakrishna mission is a huge spiritual organization so obviously the devotees who are coming to me serving me i should also try to help them that it is not only me it is the whole organization that you should love and if the person is constantly only one person and not others no benefit no devotion is growing and the blessings of god god knows i don't know the concentrate your mind on god give up worldly desires sacrifice worldly comforts perform unselfish work do charity and homa uma means the offering constantly repeat the name of god japa be honest to the promises there is also a very important be honest to the promises once you have taken given the world you have promised you must have to keep it once bhagavan salaam krishna gave a word that i will visit your house then he forgot and the person who was supposed the neighbor just as adjusted to the dakshinesha he also forgot krishna went to bed it was night then he remembered oh i gave the word and i didn't keep it and then he took a lantern and then walked that the uh the whole path and the dark night reached their house and then placed his holy feet on their door and said oh i came i kept my promise he didn't disturb them because they were sleeping but he kept his promise by this way this is the way we learn this is the here in the bhagavata the lord is telling be honest to the promises and is anybody practicing it yeah bhagavan sirama krishna that's why suramar krishna is so important his life is so important whoever comes i always say read his biography that that is the way we learn the religion practice austerity that is also very important so many things people are giving that doesn't mean that we have to all the time enjoy that those who try to realize god should practice austerity and perform all activities only for god concluding so these are the 20 things that if we practice we develop devotion in the bhagavad-gita the chapter 12 also from 13 to 19 verses it also says that who is a priya the dear one for the god all these qualities only so friends this is very clear and we have to make our mind very clear the religion means a development development of the human personality how by accumulating by practicing some good qualities and nothing else that is religion and we fight in the name of religion is it not foolishness the childish we do not know what is religion but we are fighting killing and not once hundreds and hundreds of years we are fighting just stop in one place and try to understand what is religion is the transformation and that's why i appreciate so much vivek on this this world religion is a process that makes a brute unto man man unto god the very selfish soul the brute who live only for himself coming in touch with religion is transforming and becoming a human a concerned person and from that position it becomes god and what is god love and unselfishness personified as a pure love and completely unselfish that is god if we understand god in this way religion in this way can i heart others can i criticize others and can i blame religion for some of the defects in the society no so this is the way it goes now let us continue and in continuation we find the lord the god sri krishna he is giving the answer to those questions that the uddhava asked and very clear what is that what is dharma uddhaba is asking and what is knowledge what is dispassion and what is extraordinary power why certainly extraordinary power because majority of the people they think religion means something miraculous something that if you can't make the perform the miracle then you are not a religious person so as a brahmacari i was traveling in a train in india then a family was sitting just in front of me in there and then the young the girl maybe hardly 10 or 12. she was looking at me for some time and then she gave her hand to me and said can you read my palm i don't know i am sorry oh you were a monk and you can't read the palm then what is that then i understood so this is the conception of the religion that you should have some supernatural power some extra knowledge something like that you should always contact with the god and talk and because of these wrong conceptions people are there they are cheating in the name of religion and bringing down the religious the dharma into a very bad shape many people they don't try like dharma because of this the modern minds they don't like dharma because of the wrong way of application of the dharma dharma is not nothing like that dharma is acquiring the wonderful good qualities divine qualities and then becoming a very wonderful personality person in the bhagavata again in a 27 verse 17 and 19 chapter the lord krishna he is giving the answer what is dharma what is knowledge what is passion and what is that power dharmo gyanamcha one two three four what is dharma it means those activities that enhance devotion any activity that enhance develop devotion to god love for god that is called dharma second what is knowledge realization of the unity of the self that is knowledge unless that knowledge is there you cannot develop devotion that they in the in the list of the 20 that you are reading one is there you must see everything in god the god is in everything so that what is knowledge the realization of the unity of the self that self that consciousness my god is in every being that is the knowledge what is this passion if you like to take the god if you like to realize god if you like to go to god you have to leave the his creation so that is dispassion non-attachment to the saints objects that is this passion non-attachment to the same subjects so sometimes some people would say hey being a monk why should you have a car why should you have room why should these or that is also a wrong conception because when a person a monk is serving the society as swami vivekananda organized that way they need it it is essential but they are not attached to it that is also we should have to understand attachment should not be there the moment you are asked to go and take charge of some places you may be having so many things but the next moment the authority will ask you to go somewhere else then there you have to walk there is no car nothing is there then you have to accept that so that is called dispassion no attachment to sense objects why would the box these questions so there should not be confusion about the religion then what is power the subtle yogi capacities that is the power animadhi and we in great length we have discussed about this power it is in the youtube maybe you will get it so what is the power the ashtashidhi then the pancho siddhi etc etc so this power means he mentioned about anima anima means to become very very minute a tiny that is the power of the yogic power that is the isharia that's called the power to utilize the opportunity of shri krishna's guidance uddhava requested him to explain the spiritual practices without which one cannot realize god or atman the god and atman are the same the god is a personification of that same object which we call atman why because it has been noticed unless and until something is there in front of us we the ordinary human being cannot concentrate so our mind goes here and there it cannot cause and unless and until i can collect my mind and put into something and concentrate on that meditate on that there is no spiritual development concern concentration meditation is the basis because it is the mind mind goes away runs away and it is attaching with all this trying to enjoy the external objects unless i collect that mind and put that into in one particular thing that is divine i cannot develop the spirituality and that is the reason the hindus they have given this opportunity you will find in the hindu temple so many varieties of gods and goddesses do you think hindus are full no they are very very intelligent and particularly at this spiritual life through their experience they have understood the man needs an object to concentrate in the beginning and the object there is no limitation whatever object you like you can and that means object that particular thing is not very important important thing is the development of your concentration you like ganesha okay durga okay or just a stone that is also all right is tree all right so that is hinduism not that they don't understand they understand but they are utilizing the psychology and so that anyone from any standard they can come and develop their spiritual life that is the reason so so many gods and goddesses of the hinduism sometimes some people say if we had only one god then we could be very strong united that is a social thing becoming strong and then fighting with others and capturing the others land and poverty that is different thing but the spirituality is completely different it is love and unselfishness and in the love and unselfishness the grabbing the power and popularity and this it cannot come so we have to concentrate that's why in the bhagavata is also saying like that but some of the things that one should practice otherwise they won't be able to develop what are those i'm not going for the the questions that the uttaba asked because the god is given the answer i will give that the answers the lord says non-injury truthfulness non-stealing non-attachment shame non-accumulation of wealth faith in god chastity silence patience forgiveness fearlessness purity of mind and body purity of body repetition of the lord's name austerity offering of oblation in the sacred fire faith in oneself hospitality worship of god visiting holy places working for the good of others containment and service on to the teacher this is called yama and nyama yama and nyama are the two things without which spiritual life cannot start at all the first and foremost non-injury we should not hurt others i don't physically hurt anyone any thing but i go on thinking against others and i think nobody can understand my mind apparently i show that i am with such a holy person i don't hurt others you see i am eating only the little rice and nothing else not hurting others no what about your mind so today morning only we were chanting from the 17th chapter of the bhagavad-gita the physically and through the word and in the thought in the mind so these are the three types of action only physical action that is known that is we can understand you can see but what about your thought and what about your the words that you are using and sometimes people they will use the word in such a way it would have been better to slap that's so pungent words they will be using and they think no i didn't do anything i was just converse having the conversation but in the way they will put it the other person they will suffer so non-injury all these things come under yama and nyama then it says calmness is a steady attachment of the mind to me uddhava was asking the question what is shanta bhava what is the calmness and the lord is explaining calmness is a steady attachment of the mind to me just sitting without any thoughts sometimes some people because of the some uh the disease they'll be sitting in one place they can't move then somebody has to push him his wheelchair then only can move and he's a calm person no the calmness means a mind which is constantly thinking of god that is calmness self-control is a control of the saints organs self-control means organs so my eye my nose my ear so i should control them some bad words are going on i'm not listening to it not participating in it and then not having even the words if i am listening i am not at all enjoying it and fortitude is the beginning of grief patience is a perfect control over the ballot and the self sex impulse and that should be controlled the highest charity is the relinquishing of the idea of violence towards beings that is called charity and penance is the giving up of the desires valor is the conquest of one's own nature sometimes they call the heroes because they they go and kill thousands of people they are the war heroes now that what is the valor valor is the conquest of one's own nature honesty is looking upon everything with an equal eye that is called honesty truthfulness is true and agreeable speech which the sage practice that is called truthfulness satya so what is that truthfulness sometimes we say some words hey you are an idiot and i'm telling the truth no you should not say like that that one that the satya means it should not be pungent you should not hurt others agreeable speech when you are telling that the the other person should agree to that that means when i am rectifying the other day i think yesterday we are having the zoom class with the austin people devotees and the question came the not finding fault with others how can you work if the children are doing something wrong can't you find fault you are not finding fault you are rectifying them it is not finding fault and finding fault means even a person is good but you cannot see anything good in that human in that person that is called finding fault because of your ego because of your impressions and you cannot find anything good into that person though he's having so many good qualities that is finding fault and here one should be very careful about using the words purity is non-attachment to the work that is called purity so how wonderfully sri krishna is explaining and renunciation is a giving up of the work what i am giving up my ego i am not the giving of the work this one should not misunderstand the work doesn't mean that i should not work only i should see it and eat and i do nothing not like that i should do everything but not attachment to that religion is that wealth which mean may conveyed what is that wealth that one should covet it is religion and the imparting of knowledge is religious renunciation and giving that knowledge some people they acquired knowledge but they won't share it with others it says religious renunciation tiago is the religious knowledge the highest strength is the control of prana then it says fortitude is my divine state the best prophet is devotion to me learning is the destruction of the idea of multiplicity in the self that is learning what is shiksha learning to know one again bhagavan sram krishna he said what is knowledge to no one is knowledge to know many is ignorance here the krishna in the bhagavata says the same thing and what is shyness abhorrence of evil deeds now beauty consists in virtues what is the beauty it is in the virtue not the physical beauty and what is the happiness is the transcending of the pleasure and pain that is happiness misery is the hankering after the saints pleasures and that is a misery suffering if somebody is having some popularity i feel jealous that is the misery you are suffering that man will be like that only whether you like or not so that's why one should be careful sometimes the the singers or the actor actresses the commit suicide even we are thinking oh those people are becoming so popular i am not whatever your capacity that is all sufficient and you should be thankful oh i am like this i am and many people are there who like you so should not give up so why we are studying the scripture for our own life and what the scripture can teach us to be happy how to understand that i also have some good quality and i should not be jealous of others and i my best friend is god and god is all love so this is a scholar is one who can distinguish between the bondage and liberation and that is how the god is teaching then i will conclude in the 43rd verse it says what is hell what is naraka ko naraka hell is the rise of thomas in the mind tamas means all negative ideas negative things that is called hell but is it not so clear so we should be understanding if you are interested you can read this book we have this book in our bookstore by swami madhavanandaji uddhava gita and in page 214-15 all these wonderful discussions are there rise of thomas thomas means of negative and the teacher who is a teacher is no other than the god himself who can teach who is a teacher means the guru who can become a guru only god the human body is the home look at it that's why one should take the good care of the human body swami vivekananda said every monastic member should do exercise at least for one hour in a day so this is the home because without the strong body there cannot be the strong mind and without the strong mind we cannot realize god and he indeed is called rich who is rich in virtue so all these virtues that is called the richness thank you friends the this is how the uddhava through the christians got all this knowledge from the god the sri krishna himself then ultimately what is religion dharma the dharma to acquire some good qualities and what are those good qualities and listed over here just to rate and slowly slowly every day we should practice to imbibe this cro so many are there already only we have to be aware of those and we have to practice those and what will be the ultimate gain of practicing religion so naturally this is utilitarian theory so what is the gain what is the benefit i am going to get this is peace i am going to get happiness i am going to get and not only that if i need the success in this worldly life if i need the appreciation from the society all will get by practicing religion thank you the question foreign telling the hinduism means it believes that god has created this universe not only hinduism almost all the religions and out of what out of god himself and naturally if the god has created this universe he is remaining in that isn't it there is a milk and giving an example is a milk and out of that milk one sweet they have made the confectioner they have made the sweet and the sweet means the milk only and if i criticize milk and i appreciate the sweet or i criticize the sweet and appreciate the milk wow so that is why as she is asking the god is in present everywhere how i will practice that that is a very important question you know this is step by step we have to practice that first i have to understand the god is within me and then the person with whom i am behaving is also there and the animals birds so everywhere but god in different forms and according to that i have to behave and in bengali i will tell that their mother and bhagavad-gita also said the god is there in the tiger but does it mean that i should go and embrace a tiger no so i have to shun they're like one of our swamiji swami kilpa he said that and when he was talking that god is in every being one person asks if a burglar is coming breaking into my house and what am i going to worship him then the swami answer sure but your worship should be by calling 199 or 911. so by calling the 911 so you should call the foolish and worship him so that is the first is out of knowledge and devotion which should be given first priority in a very yes yes yes so you got the point so the knowledge and devotion are actually goes together the practices are little different but it goes together otherwise if you don't have the devotion devotion means your eagerness to perform you won't get the knowledge also and then what if you don't have the knowledge no question of devotion the god is there and he has created this universe and he is there in different form in this universe if this knowledge is not there how the devotion will come so knowledge and devotion should go together and bhagavan sirama krishna he has prescribed for the present today he said naradiya bhakti is the path is the way what is the naradiya bhakti is the knowledge and the devotion clapped together means that god but here the narada is not telling he or she tad this means the atman the consciousness the brahman giving or offering akhila all the work that i do physically mentally and through words i offer it to god can i offer bad things to god so i should work the way i'm speaking it should be very very helpful to others i should control my thoughts also and my actions should be purified so and then comes tad vishwarani and when i forget about the presence of god i feel oh i am breathless like that that bismuth the next question is from tana there are infinite qualities of god should i meditate only on few of those qualities i have infinite qualities of god friends that tohin we just discussed the god wanted that we should develop these qualities if you read the 12th chapter that is called bhakti yoga in the bhagavad-gita 13-19 verses i think seven verses and the god is telling over there like that those qualities we should imbibe and that is god thank you the next question is from i want to know how to meditate deeply on god so you must have um as you are mentioning this that means you must have taken the initiation from the guru and he must have taught you how to meditate so just concentrate on that practice that so when you are meditating try to think that you have become stradivari forget about your person the existence you you think only ishta deva is sitting and there is no one else your whole body your whole personality is nothing but that is to deva that is the best way of meditation thank you the next question is from how can a person remember about serving god when he is working under not so moral person and he is being made party to his miseries i can understand but when you are working go on praying to god mentally god i don't have any other option and whatever maybe for my past karma follower or your desire your wish i am now in this situation so please forgive me for the thing that i am doing i cannot say no to these because i have to have this job and earn some money but at the same time i am not supporting mentally to do this work so please help me please help me if for sure you will get a better option and you'll be free from all those things the next question is from charles field man you say to please god how do we know what god how do we know what god wants us to do as opposed to what people say now god has already said again and again church that here we find god again and again is telling that once again if you go back to the the talk that i have given today that it is the god warns us that we should help others think positively about others and also try to understand our own minds and in the mind where there is a desire for different things we have to cuddle those slowly slowly we have to come back and for whatever maybe in one word i can say through word through thought and through physical action i am not going to heart anyone that is exactly what the god wants us to do all others work is all right the next question is from realization of god makes us seamless that is no subject object how do they conduct in this world no subject object as a that from the vedanta telling that that there is a subject god cannot be the subject because something is the object god cannot be the object because is this always subject so when i realize god i become god right and what is that realization what is that knowledge now again i will request you sima to go and open the biography of bhagavatam krishna so he was a god intoxicated person he saw god all the time every moment but how he lived look at the life of maha sharadamani devi how she lived after the realization of god after the knowledge of god a person can live in that way i see god in everything but those people they don't understand that they are god so i go and behave with them the way they expect it so i do like that but at the back of the mind i am always very clear i'm not going to harm that person that is the way one should leave thank you the last question is asking how humility comes ah that is the practice that slowly slowly the humility if you go on thinking the the intellect that the god has given to me and he has given intellect to so many other people also the success in my work that i have done it could be done through any other person also so you'll become humble so that is the way we can develop the humility thank you very much thank you friends thank you for the wonderful questions now let us go back to that the chanting and we conclude that the supreme lord who is all pervading and he has created the gods and goddesses the human being animals and reptiles and birds and also the trees and everything so they all praised him a [Music] yes that's it you
