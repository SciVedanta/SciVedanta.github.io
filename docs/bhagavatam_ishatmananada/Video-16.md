Oh God would you go share now but Sudi shown be shod harem gaggenau attrition me shuhang Laxmi gone [Music] servo we are worshipping a great god vishnu why to get Pavo paya harem so he will bless us even guidance that will be free from the fear what is the fear fear of death the only death know there are many people very courageous don't bother about fear about death but this is the circle of death birth and death it goes on and on so dad she is going to guide us how with the excellent - today we will read the bhagavata which is considered the book of devotion will teach us be Noble and today we'll study that bhagavata here this is again the third standard the third book twenty ninth chapter and we'll be reading from some of the divorces but in the third book we have already listened the wonderful spiritual conversation between the modern devotee and the mother devotee was the daughter of Shyam Manu and she was the wife of kardama muni and hearts on the Kapila - by this tradition we should remember but is coming down this Kapila was none other than Vishnu himself but he promised that he will become the son of the kardama and the diva booty so this Kapila in the ninth chapter we find the devotee wanted to know about the devotion so she got that knowledge about the Purusha and prakruti now she was interested to know about the devotion what is this devotion and there we find the Sun the capella is the link but what is devotion Queen by a mere hearing about me the Supreme God the mind of an individual streams forth unmotivated need Barcena I'm restricted near endure and one pointed a cockerel towards me who is presenting all the that is love and that is Shakti now we should read this passage once again but this is very very important history what is this what is that devotion she was asking about the devotion and what is the definition of the devotion the Kapila is giving the moment you hear about the god the name of God repetition of God the three things started happening immediately the mind become very one pointed strong flow of mind it goes the gives an example as the Ganga is forcefully flowing to meet the ocean similarly the mind also ganga is a long river very big river like the Mississippi over here it goes on all over the India but the ultimate goal is to reach the ocean like that the human mind the moment they listen about God hear about God read about God think about God immediately rushes up forcefully but without any desire near the asana without any desire second continuously unrestricted and one pointed it don't go anywhere so that love that devotion that process of mind trying to reach God is known as bhakti is known as devotion the when you talk about the devotion of your resting or devotion means a lot of emotion of course it emotion is there but at the back of it there's knowledge what is that knowledge me who is present in all beings so friends this is the point we should try to remember the devotion the move mostly then afterwards we'll read how the Kapila again and again that he is hammering the mind that out of just emotion we are thinking but this is the worship all over particularly the Hindus all over the India we should read this passage the third scan the twenty ninth chapter and start from the back of it the 20 21 verses then you understand how what is the devotion it should be one pointed strong flow to makes me to come to me but at the same time knowing that I am present in all being that devotion but it differs why according to the different type of qualities that is present in the human being what is it Dominic birthday now it goes the Bhagavad Salam Krishna also mentioned the different type of bhakti here Thomas eclectic worship with cruel purposes in our country the dacoits dish to worship goddess Kali that's right so much more bad names of the Kali they feel the Kali they saw the image of Kali Krishna and Adam baggage is a great saint he imagined that his auditing dream and he imagined that and unique the image which explained the whole thing the Vedanta and the samkhya through the Don treeger at the process but these poor fellows they don't know they saw the lady is cutting the head of their enemies and then putting the world end of the skull should be the heart this is fearful the goddess must be our card must be have a goddess why because we are the decoys the people are afraid of us so they started worshipping the goddess Kali and it has nothing to do with then that's that is also octi the devotion it failed to believe but with cruel purposes sometimes some people they'll worship goddess Kali the purpose to take the vengeance on others and also the jealousy and other low tendencies that is called Thomas a commodity what is rajashekhar bhakti the worshipping image with an intention to fulfilling worldly enjoyments wealth fame majority of the temples the rich people they are constructing and worshipping this is the idea the this is the logical they are not promised occur but their rajashekhar so all people would say oh he has constructed temple and these they are doing etc etcetera and not only that that they in the future generation they should not forgive so they will put a tablet over their inscribing that so-and-so in such-and-such year gives so much of money to construct the temple etc etc this is all rajashekhar but it is also devotion and what is optically worshipping images now all that we are worshipping images and Spartacus is also worshipping in images but wonderful liberation the worship for liberation from the bondage of the government this type of thing we saw completely demonstrated in the light of Palawan see Ramakrishna and Saddam Oh Krishna worship goddess Kali and very close to very near to Calcutta within capital of India undivided India and in Calcutta that educated people the high so called high society people they were going on criticizing the goddess Kali of course a Hindu religion were criticized but Kali was highly criticized why misunderstanding so that God Himself came in the form of bacha bazi Ramakrishna I am very close to the Calcutta so that people can go over there and making the whole thing is nice laser subtle way then he started worshipping goddess Kali the temple was constructed by a low caste lady and the images also was there others so Brahm means the refused to worship Saddam Tichenor accepted of course his brother and then he and by the side of the Ganga the traditional Hindus they always believed that you must have a place near conga he was there our traditional way he was practicing and then for what mutti mutti mutti it give me liberation that was thus article pooja same goddess Kali worshiped by the dacoits goddess Kali worshiped by the reach but arrogant people and the same goddess Kali worship by a devotee like cinema Mishnah only loved so there are some swastika Baptist who do not accept even tried forms of MOOC shift the curve realize me mentioning because in the devotional path there are struggles of their nuptials of the earth but at the musha's solid kiya living in the sphere of God living in the area of God that is the only idea that mostly they say this heaven the all good people will be there God will be there so that is the place we should go mostly the devotees the thinking that it but this article devotee you don't care about it and trustees having God's power Sami people living close association with God living very close to God Sami till the Granada is - he is leaving very close contact with the God constantly sorry Pierre having a form similar to God and saw you journey being one with God they go and mix in the presence of God these are the five goals of the devoted people devotees of the position of us particularly these are the five Great goals but this article devotee they don't bother about this file this is no we don't want all those who don't like to be marching in the God the Bhagavad selamat is to say it I don't like to be suger I need to taste sugar so likely enjoy the company of God and his dealer so thats article of thee what do you want the only thing they want the opportunity to serve God and nothing else service to God serving God that is the only opportunity that the one and nothing else did he have realized God they can march with God we can go beyond the circle of birth and death it is all India in command but they don't want that they'd like to be in the service of God so that is the ultimate there's a beautiful story in Ramayana so in Ramayana Rama Chandra is going to cross the river he ramen we know that some people arranged in such a way they plot in such a way that Rama had to leave their dad so he walked and then the last night he was spending on the bank of the salut and the next morning he was supposed to cross Rama had him framed what the earth who was the leader of the board means and all others then everything was planned and there are so many Portman's they already got to take the Rama to the other show but one person came to the king and told once I helped you and saved your life didn't remember that for sure and he promised that he will give me a boon whatever think that I will ask he will give yes that also I remember the king said and now is the time I like to pray that you should give that boon to me the chaotic as a bad abort man he told the king and then he said okay is that remove all the boats and the port man from the village only my boat should be there so that in the tomorrow morning when the Sri Ramachandra comes with Sita and Lakshmana it was my boat it should be my boat so that he can count that that is my prayer so okay so arranged in that way our boatman they went away ports are not there next morning went wrong these are the only one bored and his friend King he was also there he told it's okay no problem is a very good the vote man he can take you the other soul so the blind and that the moment Rama Chandra was coming to flying on the board he said no no no no you cannot touch my board with your feet I know that story the moment you're touching my port it will become gold and I lose my job I don't like to lose the job so I really take you on my lap and then carry you to the board and there is a special type of the blade that he escaped you have to keep your feet on that the rushman became very angry why this man but anyway there was no other board so the last Martin okay okay so he took the Ramachandra with devotion and tearful eyes into the homage and on his lap and then carried him to the port and the Ramachandra was sitting not touching the board because there was a plate why because the touch of your field immediately the whole thing with gold I have heard it in different places Rama Chandra Lakshman Ishita they said he started during the board the river is not very wide so he could reach within a short time but instead he was going on roaming here and there then after some time he did they were enjoy but after some time the national tour a what you were doing we have to cross the river when he said I know I know even cross the river but these person who is sitting in my boat he takes millions and millions of birth to cross the ocean of samsara he is also a board man you know this Ramachandra and with his blessings only the human being they can cross the samsara so when he takes so much of time to take us to the liberation on the other side so why I should not take little time so I have to then he was dream like that then Sita and Lakshmana slowly they became angry then ultimately there is two other other Shore and once again he carried Rama Chandra the other Shore and washed his feet and put his sandal and all that thing then Rama Chandra looked at the large funnel Lakshmana took out a golden coin wanted to give it he said no no no the same profession you know I am NOT going to take this the his all support man I must say both men the same profession people they don't take from each other Lakshmana it was too much for him it drew the short you know you think you know who is he the Prince Arya and is a same profession the now Chandra told wait wait wait you do not know in the past life as a rich new form when I was sleeping under Shh Naga he came as a taught wise wanted to touch my feet but the never allowed the  was taking care of my feet so she didn't allow so she was this fellow was going on trying that ultimately with great wish that he will worship me one day he died and many many birds passed and in this bird he has taken this life only to certainly you do not know so don't be angry like that so this is the devotee he could take the liberation but he is not ready to take only to serve the God that love ordinary people won't understand because majority of us are so selfish we like to somehow or other we like to wash our hand and go away but they retreat devotees who didn't mind to take this type of birth boy again and again to serve the Lord the solution may be Bacon's estate but I will come down again and again and take the human birth as long as they'll be a dog hungry dog on the street I'd like to remove all the banks and the miseries when the hearts are improving the way he said that is the devotion by this power of devotion Jeeva overcomes the three gunas of the prakruti this tremendous love for God that gives him the power to control the properties sattva Raja Tama they control their how one can develop such devotion now the capella is going on giving some of the information first information Michelle autonomy Tina SWAT Fermina Mohini Asad this is a 15 verse of the twenty ninth chapter missing Nisha vitani Medina so attorney in Israel perform your duty with detachment that's all very fasting perform your duty with detachment so we think in so many ways religion means so many things and some people they are so intellectuals they say no I am NOT ready to practice I don't like to practice the religion because I want the philosophy of the spirituality they don't know what is religion the religion is practicing here once a Dharma and without in hankering so without which detachment secondly says installing my image in a holy place one should worship it and must feel my presence in all beings the two things having noticed the Hindus after the worship they will feed the people the same Prashad on secrete the people why because of this mostly we don't know not knowing we do but if we can understand this teaching of the Kabila and perform that worshipping the God in the image why in the image because I cannot other concentrate my mind so in the image is in front of me I collected my mind from different objects and put it into the God and I like to feed God decorate God worship God and that all those things that I will do but only with focus with that image particular image I like that I love that some in Carly Sam in do girls are mean Krishna some in Ganesha that so it so many gods and goddesses so many images hundreds of images but the Hindus they do why because it helps me to concentrate I like that particular image but at the same time I know that image the consciousness that I am trying to concentrate through that image is not the image it's not a storm the consciousness that I am trying to constrain concentrate I tried to focus is present in everything so in the second verse it says installing me my image in a holy place should be worship and second is my presence in all being should be recognized my presence in all beings should be recognized what happened when the people they come and attain after the worship we go and serve them why this time I am doing the worship in a no knowledge way the Barrentine way all the that presence of the God in every being but I have seen in a very holy place there throwing food this if you go to that place and they have pure began tea oh he had belonged in you don't wash it but when the people are sitting will be throwing parties and the braids from the distance why we are Brahmin we do not know what you are so they were throwing I was also thinking in the same line sitting and they were throwing I thought okay you need to throw on my plate you may miss I will catch another problem so I was just joking with them so that way they throw do you think they're really worshipping god no most of the places that mistake they do the same their whole life in worshipping the swing their mind they spend their energy the sprint and money time everything but just because they do not understand that that sweat is bhagavata is so important and I am trying to get the gist about that there's so many wonderful stories in the next scandal the story of the duck shot miss Sita Daksha and all that and also the true God so we may touch it a little and we go to the knowledge part why we should learn their stories we all know there are so many books are there and the three worlds beautiful book for the children but that is not the thing it's not the story is the teaching the teaching means you worship first in the image then you must go out and serve the living gods butI issue man Hibernia saltine asan gain miniature in 16 vertices and courtesies speak for holy people maja Tom Bowman inna the holy people should show respect to them Martin Bohm on ena they are most highly respected so I saw that I went to Pune and long back they were having that temple inauguration many Swami's came from all over and the day I decided to come back and in the temple in northern asked my everybody was busy nearly 300 400 Swami's and said for 5000 devotees who prepare my food for the I will be travelling in the train I went out to the shop and I thought I did purchase some bread banana and these and that so that I will I'm troubling that I can eat I'm going to the shop and you sure the things were hanging the small shop I touched a banana bunch and told how much is this the gentleman with all the damage okay show me okay show me in his own language the Marathi language is telling is no problem and then I touched that break I wanted to see whether it is soft or not and then I told that the biscuit and these and there afterwards on when I told please and give it to me he took out everything and then back then give it to me in the mean time at the back of the soft shop is a family so their wife and other children also gain they started offering for now I thought it's ok then I told how much I have to pay pay don't say like that because you know the Living God you have come to my shop I don't announce it because there are 300 living gods over here if they found the order but I really really appreciated the devotion and that is original India that is original India not that they don't know but the devotion for the holy people I don't know whether how much only I am a good hand but the devotion of that person really forced me to become holy enough that you know my partner they become so much of Deveaux devotion just because I was putting on the girl their sway in India now it is some people trying to get some power political power using this curve that's not good they are holding this girl and telling see this is all holy but at the back of the person or inside that dress the person is in truly holy good person but our people don't care about that only the gave you a bad person give you a flag they will march tremendous devotion bar frames we need discrimination to otherwise will make the mistake we stop the color of the cloud is the character of the person who is putting on that should be checked and then accepted and he said show respect for the holy people why because you have to develop the qualities of devotion and the first devotion is you must perform your duties which you have accepted without attachment without waiting for the result second you must worship God in image but at the same time you should know that the same God whom I was worshipping in the image is present in all beings so the same type of respective should give to those people present over there with the poor or reach educated or uneducated because every being is having that purity and the turn receipt for the holy people madam boo hoo Manini health people were in distress deena now our new camp our show compassion to the poor those who have read the biography of ceramic Tichenor so you know particularly on this point when he was explaining the bhagavata ceremony Schnur he was talking about the bhagavata when he uttered the word on Ocampo daya so manu compar when he said then he went into Samadhi came back and he said no you're a humble human being how can you show compassion to the other being no Savior Seba toward you to show compassion you're a tiny little being you can show compassion but you can serve sosa domination of the God himself once again again the Avatara of the lord vishnu he came and explained warren in the form of kamila he said long back that encumber one competent mean the compassion it must be the service service to the people shiva shiva and this is the teaching swami vivekananda hard he was a young guy of 16 17 years and they're not in the Nam when he heard that the ceramic history is explaining in this way who are you to show compassion you must serve people and he said immediately oh what a wonderful teaching today I got if I get it in time if the God give me the opportunity I will teach it to the whole humanity so the Karma Yoga that Swami Vivekananda explained and he forced the Hindus and Nations to perform through the ramakrishna mission on the base of this and evil should be treated with friendliness equals the same type of people another storm is coming usually same profession there being immediately or don't ask them when a group of people I am not mentioning you know in Chicago they invited me to their program and and the super Swami from the India he came you know that you have to show different way otherwise why the devotee will pay for you for the ramakrishna mission we don't bother because it's the organization not so much to impress the devotees but the poor people what they are alone they are constantly eager to impress the devotees so that they get the services from them that this man came when I entered he told why you have invited him he spoke in that language but easily understand why he invited him and you know that wrongly he pointed the finger to me and and one of two words his for in English he doesn't belong to this organization he shouldn't be invited so the number I said by his side and as if I couldn't understand but this is the jealousy automatically comes to see here capito instead you should not feel like that because it doesn't matter I what matters is God and God is all pervading my mind is constantly going towards God who is getting some respect who is not getting we is getting some popularity movies don't bother about that whoever comes equal to you the other strong means must be very much respectful to them if you go to bed or not they are a separate building for the Swami's who is not from the Ramakrishna nation coming from outside they will feel them give them different type of clothings and umbrella shoes whatever they need and also if they want to stay they are allowed to stay the respect is there always we try to serve but India is very difficult because of the population you know if you serve 5:25 will come and stand over there you serve the fight now you have to do that so because of the population is very difficult but we try over there here also waiver comes with great respect a because I know these and that's why I am careful about my sadhana to the whether he likes it or not knows it or not it does not matter I know that I have to give respect to these people equal should be treated with friendliness mantra Java Atma to English Atma to live you may get Raja IVA art Malaysia if I go somewhere as I expect that love attention services I must also give that control of mind and senses your main new manager with the 17 verse we get these teachings the third verse and in the fourth one he says study of scripture practice of Java straightforwardness sudden less attitude should be cultivated also and again he said finally you must must have holy company so these belong to societies and the temples in different places they are giving this opportunity the churches the mosque and that the Tabernacles and the temples what for so that the people who are dear in the world they are doing a great job so that the human society surviving they must be the opportunity for the holy company it is a responsibility of the ministers are the charge authority to give the Baba spiritual teachings to the devotees who are coming over there not the Narrows at radiant teachings never if they do they are only destroying their own life not understanding so I follow this path if you like please you can come but I'm not going to criticize anyone this how it is possible study in the scripture and when you study we are now studying this picture the very excellent spiritual power over them and when starting together and we are thinking and explaining in different ways but if I read myself maybe that have been reading some translation and the wrong person translated and my idea will be wrong so one should be very careful when studying the scripture practice of japa many of the people the theme that we need to take initiation the what is the necessity of guru but in the spiritual light it is a master in the mundane life also guru is necessary anywhere so here in the spiritual life that is also very very essential straightforwardness this is also the great quality service attitude should be cultivated no harm color something less attitude I am really thankful that I am getting the opportunity to serve people that should be 32 not that I am a great scholar I go and deliver the lecture and give them light to the masses no you cannot do anything in journey no one can do except God so that's why one must be very humble I got the opportunity to do in this way there are so intelligent people he did come and explain the same bhagavata the three hundred times better than me but by chance God has chosen me over here so that I can talk to you people explain the raga better in my knowledge so I must be humble so these are the teachings and finally he said must must have holy company who is the holy person who is completely unselfish that is a relief and who has a tremendous love for each and every one unselfishness and the pure love that is the criteria of a holy person by practicing these qualities one will gain purity of mine and will come to me that is the final way is it in the third standard twenty ninth chapter verses 21 to 27 we find the best teachings of the bhagavata given by the Kapila now we will study that portion 21 to 27 these are the verses the best teaching why the Picanto pure Vedanta the Kapila is giving the teaching a home selfish booty issue butanna Abbas theatres cigar one of a kind mom Marta crew team Orchard aluminum this is the derivative 1:21 sloka and it says show me wrong another language is to coat it again and again in many of these lectures white disappear began to show me Vivekananda item in Kumbakonam or some other place away he was supposed to give a talk inside the Krishna temple very famous Krishna temple but as because there's a lot of crowd to listen to him so student outside he went upon the top of the carriage and from there he addressed and he said the Lord is reciting over here inside the temple and that is also in South India very Orthodox the Brahm means very very Orthodox and that I do almost hundred years before the Vivekananda was addressing them and he said the God who is residing over here inside the temple they are also reciting over there look at them in the small small hearts go and serve them the living gods and goddesses give them food give them clothing give them education this God in the temple will be happy support words nowadays we can say like that coat like that but standing before those people who even never allowed even the shadow of those people who the Swami we become those at dressing as god and goddesses the shadow of those people and so called a holy body of the brahmins they never allowed even the shadow touches immediately to go and bathe that was the conception the vagrant is breaking on the basis of a heart just emotion we become became very famous he was a great orator he know on the basis of this spiritual and the future is a colander and the parameter which is teaching us to worship the Lord Vishnu and then the prisoner is giving us the excellent pedantic knowledge aha salvation who - I reside in all beings brutal obstacles sudah as their innermost soul I decide in all beings how do the art man has a soul of those beings disregarding my presents - an above dime and you are not caring for that move away move away move away for hundreds of years in our country things to do like that and they'll be even the so called low and the past people they should have to have a bell in their hand and they'll be whenever they are traveling through the villages they'll be ringing that they are going to clean the toilets of the so-called Brahmins but even the Brahmin by mistake come out and see him that will be a sacrilege that will be seen so this person should go on ringing the bell announcing that I am a holy person coming and you the I am an unholy person coming and you the holy people began to get it and who are they great Bootes they'll be sitting like this and explaining the bhagavata is it so they have not read the actual passage are avoided this passages one hour gaya mom Marta you the people you have disregarded my presence within them the people who worship my image in vain if you are watching you are chipping my image only even your worship is in vain it's the father of the stitching you mom started me to booties you Shunta at mana ashram get into our our charm budget a modem Bushman David Jyoti Sabha he said as if he were pouring the the clarified butter ghee into the ashes and expecting the fire will come about it the if you do not know the fire is not there when the fire is there if you put the deal to that then only the file will come up but when it is purely ashes if you are going on pouring that is only use with station see we you are doing you moms are they should with issue Santa at MonaVie Shura he to our charm the one who disregards me presenting all has their soul and Lord but ignorantly offer worship only two images such worship is as ineffective as sacrificial offering made in ashes again and again and again and again the hammer Mohammed girl said that hammer is coming down why because we are very shellfish there's so much selfish we do not think anything else and because of the selfishness Kiko and when the ego is there I think whatever I am doing is the correct is the right thing so this is the problem the I was hearing from a person I went to new world I stayed within and he was telling about how in the villages even today his maternal uncles and others that he loves them respect them but still they cannot understand anything about it and he wanted to send some money for so that their uncles who are there in the village can help the poor people who actually made the earning is for the small small team so they live in the corner of the village outside of the village so he turn I can send some money but if you can organize something for them like - some good robes some hearts and cleaning and all at all then them the maternal uncles are in bad serving those people it's a scene to serve them one should not do that look at it even today 21st century people are planning to purchase the land in the moon and even then so much ignorance in our mind it is only one the incident that I heard if you go to many many places the I was reading suddenly some weather the messages comes in the - there and someone in the church he said that if you practice meditation and practice yoga you are actually inviting the power of the table look at it first you practice and see what happened and if the devil comes there is a you are already having the cross mark there who need to think the why were afraid of but he cannot understand you need not to practice see the effect on the people who are practicing the error and people are becoming calm quiet so wonderful people can't understand seeing the effect of it before taking the medicine you go and kill the doctor having applied this medicine on some other people who yes nearly 2,000 people I have a blood and everybody is it very good result okay then you give it that also you can do why you announce without knowing that this is a simple thing ignorant and ego because of this ignorance and ego so he said over here in the one desires me presenting all as their soul and the Lord the God but ignorantly offer worship only to him ages he will find that almost everywhere so that is the reason the baton to society we are very small another in presence very small hardly 15 of 16 in the North America and one one Swami will be present in epicenter and we don't have the farm to reach out to the people going and telling things distributing free books we cannot do that because of all this but this is very very important for the human society they should you know and why in America I am talking not that I'm here because the people here are educated people they will understand it quickly so this is the reason we should do when a person who is Manini proud but the by Rossio feeling enemy to others Minnehaha having other ideas namahage on diversity will never attain peace of mind so how we will know that these people are not getting the success we will find they are not having the of mind so that is the main thing the peace of mind happiness catalyst a rich person but no peace of mind they are going here there everywhere they're thinking by visiting this person that person going and getting the touch of this and that will help me know who these things if you read the kapila's advises only four or five follow that you see the wonderful effect in your own mind in a man disregards ephraim and disregards and persecute fellow being but worship me in images with numerous rituals and rich offering I am not at all pleased with him the 24th birthday same these disrespecting others and worshiping with great many many other things you know that if you go in and see you can't see the image the small image but the offerings are so big to the images at the back you can't see and that man boastful even say this is worship I am doing know for sure the Prashad that you take is not a compression only food if you go and purchase from the shop and eat and if you go and take from there we say anything no event prasad is completely different thing if you read the gospel of ceramic east and marshall of the Divis books when the god is very pleased with you when you are offering with great devotion in tearful lives God I know everything is yours what I can offer to you but these are the small little thing that I could collect and I am giving it to you please touch it a light comes from the eyes of the God and goddesses that touches all the food and that is called bachata anyone taking that partaking that food will get the effect for sure you know long back when the UNAMID was not at all popular rather the local people they stood out about this young monks who were there whether on the bank of the Ganga seanyb vehicle of this American disciples European disciples they keep some money so we they come to purchase a plot of land and the young people who were interested to come and leader monastic life they started living over there view poor condition manager was preeminent the ceramic each dimension he is as pure as the rather because he was the unsure of Radha and prime Ananda he was the manager when a believer didn't finish their food very humble food only rice was the thing because that was not the best food and maybe one curry or little doll and that's all but the preeminent that he will go and sit better sample on the bank of the Ganges when the people going towards Calcutta mostly dish to go by boat they he will call the big come come come you're tired take some food over here and he would be inviting but there are poor people belong on how to treat them some who will cook some cat you tiendas and at the odd time when there he's inviting the guests and he himself will go and try to live at the oven and all that the naturally young Brahma Charles young monks they will come and help ok Swami but they are not at all happy then one day someone told why you were feeding them thing this way then he said no you have not given them food I am giving them Prasad I am giving them food and giving them prasada and this Prasad is just like the seed of devotion these people you don't understand now this moment but when they are taking the food and going away someday the devotion will glow in them for sure if not in this bird next part that was the great confidence and that is called the prashanta so whatever the people are bringing we should sprinkle Ganga water on that because such salamat is named subset Brahma body the moment to spring click on our that becomes poor whether we believe it or not Ramakrishna said believe in those words and in
