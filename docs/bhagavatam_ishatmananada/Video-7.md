they are mentioning DJ Varsha shitty Shia chick she means advices they used to give him the advices it is the better way so the team is successful if all around him could feel that there now he married in our body the daughter of King Goethe and in due time became the father of four sons the eldest one was John Major we will come to know about the John Major again and once the king pariksit in course of his tour of victory came across the evil Kali who though had addressed like a king but behaving like a no cultured person torturing the people and destroying the righteousness who where in the form of a cow and the bull this it goes the story in the allegory so then through the story they say when he was going now that was the the time that he was had was the king but now is it ninki so she must have to show his mind so the other Kings used to go and challenge them you like to fight with me he said no ok next next next next his like this used to go wind is to accept all the all the Kings is to accept him then he was an emperor just because he he inherited that drone no not like that he also showed his mind that I can also vanquish him fight with you and capture you so that was the Kshatriya power after that when he was returning he made the story says a cow and the white boom it reverses the white cows is the white bull but was having very peculiar standing on one leg someone has cut the three legs and it was trembling and a cow the cow was crying things stopped to hear their conversation if you stop over here and think oh this is all and bull stories so that is why the Hinduism is nothing but all this know the way they expressed that is different the cow is the representation of the people of the art and the bull is righteousness dogma we will come over here and see for exceed heart from his ministers that the curry has entered the land of guru and jeonggi now here again they would say it has covered the whole land known only two part one is guru a small part of his kingdom and also jangula another part under his administration so these are the two places the Kali has entered French we have to understand it has been written for thousands years before the language was like that presentation was like that things to say say things in a different way but also we have to be very we must be very clever to understand why not they are telling that all over the collie game what is that Colleen it's a kingly dress but behaving uncultured me that means they are having the money having the power having the control but at the same time they're uncultured people so that is called golly we have a picture of Colleen this is sitting on a horse and with a dagger in his hand a sword in his hand he is charging there is all cubby Kalpana there's only the poet has drawn like that in reality Kali means the back type of qualities we will read over there and brick she's hard the conversation that's why when all the bad things slowly come only in to part of his whole kingdom it is entered that means the people of those plays are behaving in a very peculiar way they are not properly behaving as they should have all these days they are doing now they have given to drinking and fighting and many other things we will learn from the bhagavata and but it should heart the conversation between the lady and the holy man does a cow there is the art and the bull that is Dharma Dharma is asking as if Oh mother art why are you grieving why are you grieving then he is let me quote from the original in the 16 chapter 21 verse it says order a Samana stria will be belong or a shaman Austria unprotected women and would be belong so just a tool Purusha 3d art on and the children neglected and tortured by the quill mothers this is Colleen the what is curly when the women are not protected that means they are not getting the proper respect not getting proper education not getting any things and we know that history how it came down all the time every time whenever their bad things are happening the first two only of the society are suffer only suffer why what first is the women and second the children so here they are mentioning the women deprived the protection Iraq Shabana stria would be Milan so just to Russia Audrey Barton Purusha kirusha means the real fathers are done then he says Brahman are serving under the characterless Kings bottom the Umbra Mowgli Carmen brahmana logically cool aground and intellectual people the brahmanas now for the money for the name for the fame the amar serving characterless things the rulers were the kings and these people now if you look at even the intellectual people as because they will get some something from the government they are supporting the government the powerful newspapers they could keep the proper picture to the whole the world instead will be always the TV news they bring the media all these people always siding and we say oh this is politics what politics kali-yuga and what is Kali these bad qualities the intellectual people if they say no we are not going to serve you what will happen if you of them will be killed but majority people if they say no we are not going to serve you these people will be weak if modality of the people they say now we are not going to do anything wrong why they are doing it because they are deluded behaving very foolishly so that is the influence of the colleague the always gives the ego dilute the mind and the people start behaving very peculiarly and the women our children are tortured why this women and children because the children of the future if they are tortured then what will happen they are not getting the proper education not properly growing up what will happen the human society will break down now here we find the people who are husband wife then one or two son suddenly there now we are due divorce and all that is okay you know we can do that then what will happen to the children who government will take care this is called Kali the parents are forgetting their responsibility I am not only given the birth of a child but it is my responsibility to see that is growing as a proper human being so that is also the society the schoolteachers and everywhere we have to see the younger generation is properly growing up why because they are the future of this human society so that is called Kali and here it means bottom there being Brahminical a march of the women Saraswathi that with the intellectual people educated people and the Brahma means the thoughtful people and what Cukor Manya they are supporting the the kings and doing all wrong things people in general I am NOT cutting from the original the people in general who are interested solely in eating drinking and decorating themselves and other physical concerns and that too without any discrimination so that is company yoga we can look around and we can be convinced that this is Kali you all around like this a great debate is going on I am sorry to say but I think many of you have also noticed if we must lady she went to a bar without putting on the dress is mine ergative my freedom whether I will put on the dress or not who are you those people didn't allow hard and now all the social media supporting our freedom what is this freedom and even even really sugar I don't know whether you have noticed or not in India a group of people they have taken the interview of the young people from 16 to 19 in five different metropolises and the interviews to this boys and told what you think about the girls of your age how he will behave with them majority seventy-three percent to know what they say we must beat those girls and slap them hard otherwise they won't be a properly if this is not the Lee Hooker then what is the colleague and who is to blame we the seniors because we could not give them the proper training for education so this is the bhagavata that we are standing is not a whole scripture this is a picture of the present day even in the present day society and this Kaliyuga it goes on having this this way oh great king we are not really able to apprehend the root cause of all our troubles now that they say in the description sharing all this brick shield who was just team and very and from the clan of the Pandavas he took out his sword and say show me these people and when to punish them then the Dharma is telling oh King we are not really able to apprehend the root cause of all our troubles now comes the philosophy even though in the philosophy also we are confused what to follow and what not to follow in the name of religion we are becoming very narrow sectarian well if anybody wants to do anything now you have to follow my path only my idea should be there otherwise who agency me and they will go on telling the lie is after lies after lies of the lies the media is lying other people are also getting the feedback that's also false and ordinary people just out of emotion will be going on sending now it is so easy SMS whether you like it or not your phone is going on ringing and sending this amaze and bad things these are happen that it happened when you were asking how do you know now I got from my friend ask your friend went from he knows he are again got it from another brain there is not truth but indirectly these people are also taking part in committing scene and that is the reason we should not unless and until we are sure take part in all this friends those who are here already handful of people you must be very very sincere because you are interested in your spiritual life all these things will change the all scenarios will change the great kingdom of the Rome that also have done so naturally all these things will change what will remain your mind and your karma your thought don't be carried away with all these and the philosophy some rationalistic say that the maker of one destiny is oneself others saying it is the planets till then others maintain mention there it is the Karma and there are materialistic s' who find in nature the cause of it all so this is the problem people are confused what we should do and what we should not and at the same time as because the confusion is there different type of narrations are coming explanations are coming what to do Mahayana got sapanta in Mahabharatha says look at the great people great personalities what they have done do that and that is why we the senescence of the ramakrishna mission and our the he'll swami vivekananda he examined totally thorny from different angles this person whom we have accepted as our God see Ramakrishna and Vivekananda young boy from the Calcutta University very intelligent and free mind and used to go on examining this guru so-called that before accepting him as a guru so many times if you read those books even wonder and then he said this man is nothing but God the God needs all great qualities owner of Dharma what you have spoken is a secret of Dharma immediately the King understood that this man is not an ordinary person who was giving this his opinion you must be Dharma it is prohibited even to describe a Dharma the king is telling is better not to discuss about the other now why after hearing and listening other people ordinary people they don't think so deeply they may follow that so that is deny the other ma sometimes in the newspaper they will go on giving all details how the one person killed another person and what happened other people respect not that they are afraid it becomes a curiosity for thing and they will follow that that's why a Dharma also should not be pronounced long long King Erik shield thus icon of the mighty Pandavas he said it is prohibited even to describe adharma austerity priority fellow-feeling and truth are the four qualities of Dharma friends what a Dharma we always talk about the righteousness about talk about the religion there are nothing but the qualities it is not that something we will get so that we can just float from here and go and this one should be very very careful major notice the time the people even educated people highly qualified people they do not understand and they take Dharma means some mystical thing will happen and we will see the light we our body will float and we can walk on the water why should you work unnecessarily on the water we can just purchase a ticket and can go I mean the nice beautiful the ships are there and it purchased a ticket and so many companies that they had even flying from here to any destination why you have to use your yogic power so this is dealing only for austerity what is this austerity austerity means in our mind constantly different type of thoughts are coming we have to control that that's close charity hostility doesn't mean that I should not eat food or walk bad food and should not say the beer and all these things are austerity now there has only physical austerity anyone can do even the poor people that do impaired food and walking you go to India thousands and millions will be there walking barefoot attending austerity because they cannot afford to purchase a shoe that is not austerity austerity means controlling your mind your emotions so that those thoughts that may harm others it should not do that controlling that is called austerity what is theology unselfishness is purity the purity doesn't mean that go and bathe in the Ganga again and again I say like that and if it is so the great soul wants that say the so many fishes are dear inside the water then the Ganga are the all pure souls know the purity means unselfishness feel no feeling love thy neighbor as thyself why the Jesus think that feel you feeling this is also because I feel for you and that love when I go and express that and the whole idea becomes my family whole neighborhood becomes my family in our childhood days we can understand and win those days of course we didn't like it everyone in the whole locality there our Guardians anyway you are doing like this work I will tell this to your mother and then we couldn't do anything because of all the people constantly watching so that is the failure feeling oh that is their son let him go to dogs do not no problem for me know this fulfilling also is called our bond and truth Satya now he is telling Oh Dharma my daughter force of a Dharma austerity by egotism purity by attachment fellow feeling by blinding passions your three feet because the cow on only one feet standing so that now the king is telling this three feet it has been destroyed by these three things one is egotism is attachment another is binding passions so that is that when someone is poor his poor whether what Dharma is what religion he belongs to doesn't matter I should go and help because that man is suffering should I go and ask are you in my caste all in my religion then only I will give you the food that is a Dharma we should understand these and reading from the the history if I say Oh in 11th century this happened so I am going to take the revenge you're going to repeat the same thing again there's somebody did to some mistake and now again you are going to do the same mistake so we have to understand this Oh Dharma now they remain only one of your field namely the truth to sustain you but even the evil spirit of the Kali they are depicting curly as a personality no Kalia the ball bad qualities the depicting Kali as the personality is the wrong thing flourishing on the untruth is now how to cut off that food also the only one food now remaining and that is the truthfulness some of you those who have read the biography of Raghavan see Ramakrishna you can remember the cinema Krishna he was giving away everything at the feet of his divine mother only one thing he said no mother this I cannot give it to you even to you what was that truth Satya Oh mother I cannot offer this to you so the subtalar that is the only thing by which we can fight with the Kali Yuga you may remember that show me Vivekananda Saint with the advent of the vagabonds ramakrishna Sutter Yuga has started and people sometimes there are there are so many bad things are happening why because just before the dawn just before the sunrise the darkness is more deep so that's why so we have to understand the wonderful implication of the advent of the Bondurant Tichenor was nothing but the truthfulness we will discuss about the other things there's a discussion that happened between the great king and the great sage that will be over in our next class we will discuss that the great king is brick she that bridge sages our sukadeva the son of the Vyasa so what type of discussion happened and how many questions this thing is asking brick sheet is asking to sugar why is asking this question we will discuss in our next class but here about the truthfulness of vagabonds Lam Tichenor two incidents very funny for us she said to a person his neighbor I will visit your house neighbor also forgot ceramic is no also forgot that day at about ten eleven twelve that time the night suddenly he got up and he said I can't take the breathing the suffocation why then he remembered okay I keep the word that I will visit to that house I must go to that house because I gave the world so he wind all the way to the neighbor's house if you visit there janeshia you can find there's a little distance but he had to walk in that night in those days there was no electricity he had to carry a lantern and in the darkness he went over there and all people are sleeping in that house and he kept his feet on that door and he said hey I kept my promise I came when you read this is why he did like this it's not necessary just to keep the promise about the Googler reduce adultery I promise repression Magi those who can understand the Hindi must remember this the pupula that means the clan of the family of the Ramachandra the Guru the clan that is the redeem that is the tradition continuously coming down generation of the generation and what is that that even if we die we will keep our promises and that is called Dharma that is called Satya not that all the time humbleness and going like this it is not that is okay good but Dharma is very powerful really powerful so we do not understand that and he is telling and another example of strong Krishna's truthfulness maybe some of our devotees can say he used to take ordinary women squeezing that one or two drops of that on his food and the master of that particular tree he allowed you can take so one of his disciples used to bring only one lemon a day one day as usual the devotee brought it and he gave that to the slam vishna he tried to squeeze but not a single drop fell then he said something wrong you go and asked whether the master the owner of the tree as we changed or not the disciple the young boy said no no what is there that I can help you and now first you go and see there with the same owner unknown he had to go he enquired he found just other day the ownership of that particular tree lemon tree changed the new owner has not given the permission and Salaam Krishna could not take the one drop of that we are the followers of that great soul Salameh krishna we have to be so very careful so very careful and that is the Dharma remember the for that is the air it says austerity the control in your own emotions priority unselfishness fellow feeling love for all and the truth Satya that these are the Dharma thank you very much and next class I am sorry I'll be visiting the Edmonton so I won't be able to keep the class in the next Sunday and then after that and the Sunday we all many of you will go to our retreat in the Ganges so these two Sundays our garden and she will give the class so he'll be having different subject so we have to wait for again that you lie to listen to this wonderful discourse at discussions question answers between the Great King and wonderful the money so let us conclude with the young boy named drama student deeply stop i'ii be the song but the ground Upanishad ee Guardium saga Donna was theta that did the Tina manasa pasyanti yam yoginah yes young Tom not be do surah surah Ghana the thus mean AMA about God it is so difficult to understand so he is explaining we are praying to that God about which the Yogi's meditating about which the the Vida is singing so that we is so difficult even for the gods to understand him we offer our respective because he is very subtle and he is present within our heart to that God who came in the form of Shri Krishna is so good for us that we can to him reach to that great God [Music] chandi hurry you
