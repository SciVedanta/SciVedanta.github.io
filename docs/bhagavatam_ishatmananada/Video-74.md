[Bhagavatam 068 : Sri Krishna Removed Uddhav's Doubt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k3BoaHDFhh4)

good morning dear devotees and friends let us begin with this mantra Shantaram booyakasha unum button on our solution we Swart harem Goggin Assad regime mingi Birnam shabanam lakshmi contemn Kamala jnanam you will give he dr Nogami 'm bundy business baba higher harem cerebral okay [Music] you never lost sunday discourse we have discussed about wood there was doubt doubt about the sudden mark what is a sudden mark mark means the path sudden is the austerity the spiritual practice the sudden mark the wood the wars bit confused as because the christmas-tree Krishna told that this is the gonna mark this is the gana a one should follow this again the same see krishna he said you better become a bhakta like the Brindavan gopis so that way would have little confused and while discussing we also discussed that the major three paths that is the the yoga and Jana and bhakti they have seven stages all the three paths they have seven stages you know in Hinduism the God is one but that God or the Supreme Being has been termed in many different names in the beta as the sate a COMSAT be pro Buddha Abaddon T the set is Iike that means that eternal which never changes people are the the people who are trying to realize all those who have realized Buddha Abaddon T they named in many different ways the for the Yogi's it is the art man for the ghani's it is the Brahman but the bhakta it is the vagabond in the chaitanya charitamrita also the same jay tandem operable he is also mentioning in this way but the person is the same goal is the same only calling in different names the pads are also different but the goal is the same that is exactly what Krishna wanted to tell you Dawa odubel was little bit confused because he was thinking which will be the best band the naturally when a young student he's supposed to choose the path of the what is the engineering or medical or some other path so he's little confused senior people guide him so this is the way you can go he can go like that when the hood thava is bit confused than Krishna told him okay now let me tell you what actually I am and what is this universe today would there was doubt was the Sri Krishna removed oh there was doubt in a very unique way what is the unique way why it is unique instead of telling all paths are leading to me no he said about the creation and that is very very interesting in the science and in everything all the time the one curiosity where from this creation came and so many wonderful things all around and sometimes if you see that some of the the movies that come our world I was observing oh my god so many varieties of things under the water so who has created this how he has created it and if you look at the the the world of the birds my god animals so many varieties human being so many so who created it is a one person and naturally this curiosity is the eternal curiosity each and everyone wants to know it in every generation they try to understand it clearly here in the bhagavata eleven Skanda that is the book twelve or die that is the chapter and seventeen birds the bhagavata it says like this and mother bondages book if you are following it is the seventh chapter xvii words if you are following the bed anton and this book it is two objector 17 verse verses 17 the chapter is changing because of the arrangement the unique way he is telling that this creation has come from me sir Rajeev herbivory Presutti browning ago she in Agawam Provost monomial sukshma m-- koopa troopa m-- mattress or obernai et stubby stir so he is telling that supreme consciousness that param art man our main source of living but we are not aware of it that is mentioned as I saw some is that it's not male or female is a consciousness so no gender saw the that supreme consciousness the permit man this giba individual being manifest itself in the centres of the spinal column so this sentence is very interesting that is manifesting in the center of the spinal column of the jeevers and yoga Shastri also says human has seven centers then Paramatma out of his own will manifest as Eve with the help of prana source of energy on the plexus in the Sushma column those who have studied the yoga you know they have seven stages mooladhara swadishtana Moni put on our oughtta be should our God chakra and sahasrara this seven it says that it begins with the mooladhara which is at the end of the our spinal cord if you open with the the doctors if they open no they won't find it but it is the yogi conception and when the Hindus the meditate they always for thousands of years millions of the Yogi's they have meditated that we D in their spinal cord and then called sushumna a channel as if coming from there down to the top from the bottom of the spinal cord up to the head out of the human being and is coming so that is slowly slowly manifesting seven and they say flowers the Lotus it is manifesting the moment you are energy is coming up your mind is coming up and when it so see Ramakrishna's book is also telling here the Krishna is not mentioning that he is telling here Asia gee Bobby Bora Presutti this giba individual beings manifest itself in the centre of the spinal column Paramatma of his own will manifest nobody dictated just you wished and sometimes it is said iike a humble Shah movie he I am alone I like to be many while he taught like that that we cannot ask it no one can go and ask the question sir why you have thought like that and because of the thought of this manifestation and because of the manifestation we are and because we are the human being our karma fella and because of the karma fella all these problems are coming why you thought you cannot ask because it is he only he thought and then the manifestation came but manifestation is of what of the same Brahman if this point is little clear because of the confusion of the Maya the in between the Lord Himself it is his Maya is a power confused us all of us are thoroughly confused some thinking that I am very intelligent some thinking I am the king some thinking I am the reach and all this now the one of the other problems are coming in the world the rich people are worried that people will come for the donation they are saving their money what they will do it that money any day anything may happen god forbid god forbid but anything may happen then what the money will nothing but this is Maya I have to save my money and I should not share with anyone because my generation should be happy what is your generation do they care about you nothing like that but the thing all people think about this so this is the way that's called Maya and heed the surplused form sukshma this super fine form of the sound that is para or nada our own from here begins that mystery how it manifested a sound the superfine form of the sound shabda all this creation is nothing but the shove the manifestation of the shut that the sound the superfine form that is called para para means the highest the nada nada is a sound which creates itself and ultimately it took the form and the name now popular as oma the owner is the nada that the knee the different names it says and passing through the less subtle forms perceptible to the mind only first the sound is a very very circle then slowly slowly the sound is manifesting passing through the sushumna coming up and then the mind can only understand or see or hear so that weight is going it is a very subtle mind then ultimately manifest in the gross form as syllable and pitch and later and the sound the word that we speak to express a meaning begins with para now the Hindus so see how when the religious scientist we call them the Rishi's the Moonies that the religious scientist some of them they have constantly like the modern-day scientist some of them concentrating and these some of them that are different and then together the science similarly Bader in our the beta is also the knowledge that Gianna the Gianna of different way not only Obama's at the jagan mithya no not that ultimately out of the beta the last portion they say yes Brahmas at the jargon me and that is the ultimate word of the Upanishad and the Upanishad they have given this truth in different through different stories and different language different different way expression that is called Upanishad but the beta means knowledge and we're from the knowledge came through analysis what they have analyzed the nature external and internal now if you remember the Shamir awakened and this that wonderful the statement each soul is potentially divine the goal is to manifest the divinity within by controlling nature external and internal now they understood the nature but instead of controlling the external nature they focused on internal nature and when they were researching they came out of the wonderful truth that everything that is manifesting is from the sound and in the sound the first that manifest subtlest of the circle which is no ear can hear that is called para they have given the name this a script named para para ms absolute that para it manifests in mooladhara mooladhara as we were discussing the basic of our the source that is an end of our human that spinal cord that is mooladhara then it comes up to mony put the Nabal stage and dear in the it name is push aunty para question t then it comes to the chest and heart and there is called madama the heart is known for the yogis anartha in Anahata it manifest as Mitama then in the contour condemned is ultimate the vocal cord and we are speaking now I am talking and the sound is going out you are hearing it and understanding and that is called contr that be shoed friends today we will concentrate on this this is a very interested thing so I thought about the why the Hindus are all the time chanting ohm Cara in the way that they say ohm et Brahma whom Cara is Brahman we will try to go through that a little it is not in the Bhagavata but I'm trying to read from there the son of the Xiaomi some of the people they have discussed about the Omkara the supreme being one would double known as three Krishna in reality for a Brahmin it manifested through its power Maya in Word form hints prop injure preferential means this manifestation of this universe perp ensure manifestation is known as nama and rupa the nama Rupa what is this jagat only they see how they have made it nama rupa they have divided the consciousness in five five parts or steve harty priya this was three then come nama and rupa then total five then they said oh steve harty priya this three the first three is the brahma and nama Rupa is this jagat coming from where their consciousness we have to remember this all the time and that is Vedanta that is in division the same Brahman same consciousness it has been divided into three five parts first three Steve it is there it is there it is there existence it never changes it never transform that sometimes it is big sometimes it is small no it is as it is us the party is a knowledge knowledge that is the manifestation when you come to know now the whole human society is breaking their head to understand what is this Quraan abiders because we don't know about it the day we will know about the coronavirus what is this where from it came how we can stop it how we can kill it that's all in the Hindu mythology in all our Puranas you will find almost everywhere the fight Hindus are very mild and docile people they don't fight but in the scripture you will find in the bhagavad-gita in the Chandi and also Puranas all the time war is going on and in that war there will be a good person and the bad person a hero and also just opposition so that way the fight what is this coronavirus the Hindus will write a story over that the coronavirus is a dyke there is the devil and is a bad now they are asked coming and fighting and everywhere it is going people are dying then the God came and then God understood it if you read the Chandi almost the same way the doctor visa there was a the bad the Ashura and it has the capacity to grow once again from a drop of its own blood when the goddess durga i am little deviating from the subject but is interesting and when the durga is killing that Ashura and the blood is coming out from one thousands are coming up then this then those thousands millions are coming up then the goddess durga understood it is very difficult she took out another power from herself fiscal collie and then asked that collie you sprayed your tongue and when I am heating that Ashura not a drop should touch the earth by that way the same Duga out of her own power but a separate power as if the goddess Kali as if separate as a long tongue and they're all over the ocean could not go anywhere is the she was holding the shooter on Hart tongue and when the Durga is killing the blood is spilling no no other or shooter could take birth the same way our scientist they will find out some medicine and that we can term as the Chamunda the Kali at holding all these assurance otherwise somebody is just shaking hand with his friend contaminated coming little close to talk hey how are you contaminated the human is beings are starting how you live we can't believe each other we can't go too close to each other even a child cannot go to the mother of the father those who are working outside as a doctors and nurses know it will be the problem will be solved goddess Kali will come from the power of the goddess Durga and it will be solved why nothing but the Maya and it all the time it goes like this the brother bond also over here he also did because it is the same thing from the same thing two different types of coming up coming up good and bad from a thought only all this is coming up the adi boat iike a DI beaker and a dark mica the nada nada means the sound manifest action from the sound manifest action have you noticed that when you ring the bell particularly in the churches at the big big bills are there when you are making the sound what happens the whole bill is trembling that means from the sound the action comes then the motion comes then expulsion comes smiling comes testing comes seeing touching hearing cognizing and knowing identifying all manifestations this is called the nada and nada Brahma own Cara is the Brahma nada is the Brahma Y Brahma believe all pervading the all-powerful and from it everything is manifesting to remove the doubt of the would Daaga Shri Shri Krishna goes so deep to make him understand it is in the Bhagavata that would ever get the conversation between the Krishna and the with dhaba so obviously so what it is he is tailing why you are confused whether you follow the path of ghana or whether you follow the path of bhakti or yoga or dianna all are leading to the same goal but I am asking you to follow the bhakti why because you can enjoy what is the enjoyment the game the play now if you are sitting in one place and then closing your eyes and closing the doors and windows and not mixing with anyone isolating yourself alone and then finding the joy within your heart that is also possible but same you go out and then you see the hundreds and thousands of people watching the game and the players are nothing but the same God and the spectators are nothing but the same God the all over and you two are sitting over there a different type of joy different afer why people go to the playground they can watch in the TV when he was sitting with thousands of people and supporting your own team and then the expression of the different people and that is the joy you can see it in the TV and more clearly than in the field why people go there they purchased it the joy the proctors they say like that the devotees they say I like to see the play the game of the God how the God is becoming a dacoit how the God is becoming a brahmana and how the God is becoming a rich person the brahmana is poor fellow he is going on praying and the reach is a different way earning money then the dacoit is coming and looting from him same God but all these things are going on suppose you did disassociate from these and he was sitting in a chair and looking the same God is playing in that way is not a joy that is exactly what the buck does the same the yogi says no no no I don't want that I want only liberation the Gani will say all those things are the wastage of time I like to know that I am Brahman and like to March temperament they don't like to go you will find some of your brothers some of your friends they don't like to go to the movie no I don't like the movie I like to go to the game or I don't like all these things I like to go to my room and I will spend my time in my own way there are different type of people the same way when you are approaching to the God and all these things are happening would dubber is the friend of krishna and if he goes directly in the knowledge paths and gatorman the liberation he will get but the God wanted him to enjoy the play that the same Lord the same param brahma in the form of Krishna is playing or in different other avatars the same param brahma he is playing enjoy that so this is the doctors part and for the doctors they are explained that is why he is explaining so CDC's the way the manifestation and the NADA from the sound the Manifesta action and from the action the motion the expulsion the smelling tasting seeing you see everything covered the income the manifestation of Sutter Raja and Tama what is this saturation Tama three different qualities that's all and nothing else if you have the good quality immediately Hindu will give you a mark oh is a septic man and if you have mixture of the good and bad is a rajasic man logistic person and if it is a bad then thomas iike the hindu will always say about the thomas occur he is also god but at this moment he creates problem he is actually acting as a villian villain so don't support the villain always go to the hero so naturally we don't like that rajesh iike very difficult to be friendly with sometimes it is angry sometimes it is good sometimes it is not so very difficult why because of the ego Rajesh Iike means manifestation of the ego I will help you but you should remember all through not only that your children also should remember they I helped you Rajesh Shigure SOT tika quietly they come the help and quietly the go away and never want the name fame or anything you like that person Shakti girl only love he doesn't know the person whom he is helping but still he loves if anyone is suffering anywhere he start crying Swami Vivekananda one day he was crying weeping and then inside his room he was pacing up and down someone noticed and said show me any trouble shall I call the doctor Shoshana she turned and then shouted how could you sleep all people are suffering millions are not having a motional of food children are crying how could you sleep this is called Swart occur there all the time thinking bhagavati ramakrishna praying to the divine mother he knew well that it is nothing but all the games but still as long as we are having the body mind with us shall we not feel for others now in India a devastating cyclone the many over here they are writing to me Swami ji can we send some donation we can arrange sending the money to our balloon Mart or to the Astra MERS who were directly working over there there are four or five as rumors are there and in the affected area they were not affected he said the sannyasins they were also affected but still the next day when thousands of people came to them because they are sannyasins the main of God they said Swami we are hungry you know 1500 people are getting food in our Sagar deep that is the island as a little away from the main India Calcutta so that is the place immediately they have started and they saw me I found that he has given out there can you please help me like this and many other places also from the morning till night they will be serving whom they are serving for both for anything and at the back of it nothing nothing nothing why God the God is manifested in that the God is hungry coming to me do you believe it that is Vedanta if God is everything he God has created everything then believe the God can come as a poor as an illiterate the tears come when we read that the poor laborers who went from different parts of India to work in different other places they don't have to train they don't have the money not even a shoe to walk and they're walking thousands of miles to reach back listening that hearing that how people how people can it is troubling heading sorry so this is the way one should understand one should understand and we know that it is nothing but the God and is the play but at the same time we should serve the people as the manifestation of the God I'm also God but at this moment I'm caged in this human body I have a mind I have a body I have a feeling I have ignorance I have knowledge I have my try but still that try should go in a direction where I will realize my myself and at the same time as a by-product you can say I will bring happiness to all people I don't know I deal all of you understand Hindi or not that is the national language of India and it says monarchy is a Harco Gulshan occurs a ki khatti talk which kamiki a good you AG there serum I admit that I could not transform the whole world as the flower-garden monarchy is a Harco Gulshan Kurosaki Gulshan means the flower garden but I have removed the thorns from wherever I have gone Carty took which come he ki have removed on my part I did some people coming at my back they won't be hard that is sufficient for me and that is called ceebar yoga that is called Karma Yoga there is also yoga but based on the knowledge I am serving the living gods in the form of the poor when I saw the little girl she is sleeping tired keeping her head little heat on the shoulder of a father who is walking for days and days without food how a human being can stop and and then go on counting his own fun who made this much money I am having these these are not people at all the Swami become the said he only leaves who lives for others he only leaves who lives for others rest and more dead than alive we believe in that and believe why because we know the secret what is that secret ohm kharab inducing victim victim died aunty Oh Gina come Adam moksha damn Sheba ohm car Jana Manu maíam now I will go through this how this ohm Cara could become the source of manifestation and that is why the Hindus they respect Ankara so much the Yogi's constantly meditate on this symbol ohm composed of the O and ma M o and ma o and M all fulfils all desires and leads to liberation all Hindus whatever may be the six they believe and accept the Brahman as the absolute and this absolute is very difficult to express only direct experience through direct experience you can feel and that is called that's why they say not that Chuck Shu got Chetty nabob gotcha D no mana ha neither I did the I or the words any expression it cannot be because beyond everything that is called the brahmana all helps to connect the Brahman with the self here the self means jivatma ohm is connecting the individual self with the supreme self is like a bridge I'm Ritesh to say to who shutter shutter Upanishad it termed this is a bridge the eternal bridge and it is connecting this individual this world this manifestation which is creator the unborn the Brahman so it says indeed way the giba burn my but now opera the G bar the individual cell at the Brahman and nothing else the pure consciousness the bat is the Brahman with the inner art band the self this truth was discovered by the great mind sanctuaries before grammarian panini panini he was five hundred years before Jesus Christ so this pawn in the before panini this was discovered so that he is there telling now it is 2020 you can imagine that before 2500 years this truth was discovered he referred this phenomena as fota we had to remember this particular word is photo this photo was discovered what is this photo a sound what type of sound you cannot hear you cannot you can feel but it is the beginning of the sound it's so subtle but still it is there so you have to imagine in us with a scientific mind you have to imagine that something is going to come up like sometimes the scientist clear that earthquake is going to come how do they say how did they predict D they have the apparatus they have the machines they find that some changes are coming we march below inside the art somewhere and from there slowly slowly a vibration is taking shape it has not yet taken you can compare that particular knowledge as the scientist are finding is as photo this photo also in our body the spinal cord at the end of that in the beginning there something is happening some changes are coming it's not visible we are not hearing we cannot touch it you cannot see it as a feeling that something is happening you know sometimes the people will say the rain is going to come the village I have seen the people who say let us go the rain is going to come the sky is clean where why you predicted that the day will come they look at their hands in all the groove in hundreds our ends are coming out from there the holes that means and somehow could feel the rain is going to come and if it is a rain then they will all die so they are going to some higher places the scene that the man because of his experience he could say rain is going to come because answer rain is coming from the sky and he is predicting the rain in the clear sky by seeing the hands look at it the same way the Atma gyani they felt that sound is like this forty are Tamiya smoth this photo is a route or the terms Porter is to burst the verse this is a photo this photo is the burst behind every there must be a meaning every word must be a meaning meaning is a form up Cheeta Shakti the two-three these words if we very attentively understand the word has a meaning any word must be having a meaning it cannot be anything like that and that is the meaning is the chit Shakti behind every word there must be a meaning and meaning is the form of chit Shakti power of pure consciousness now the consciousness pure consciousness and the power of pure consciousness how it came the power of the pure consciousness is not working if the pan consciousness is working is thinking then it is limited you don't do anything then what happened this shabda how the shabda the vibration what is that vibration unseen unheard but it is creating and that sound when it is manifesting slowly every sound as a meaning and that meaning is nothing but their analysis is our Muniz Rishi's are telling it is the parasha Shakti this is the power of God now the power of God slowly separating as if separating itself from that supreme consciousness supreme consciousness don't do anything that's why if you look at the same same idea expressed in different way in different Hindu dirt paths the baton thing they will say like this but if you go to the Tantra they will show you two different Shiva paramah Seba Sadashiva Kali we see only one Shiva and Kali that is the manifestation manifested form but the Paramus IVA is there what is the Parramatta supreme that being the supreme being is doing nothing as if date but from that supreme being a vibration coming out and that takes another form of the Sheba that is Sadashiva and the sadasiva is white and the eyes are open and we bet eyes keeping that in view the work is coming that is the power that is called Kali it could be another Sheba but instead they said it is the Kali mother form because the creation is going to happen so this same way it says this fota from there the vibration is coming sound the sound as a meaning and the meaning is that the main power so word all sporter means brahmana ohm and photo are inseparable Shama Vivekananda expressed very clearly he said all these expressed sensibly universe is the form behind which stands the eternal inexpressible Spota the manifestation is the universe but where from the creation came from this Porter is going back not even the brahman but in that's fota form behind everything is that photo the manifesto of the logos our world now so many word I am now telling over here one is this Porter then comes the logo then comes the word then is the own a same thing how it came we'll come to know the Eternals fota the essential eternal material of all ideals or names is the power through which lord creates the universe nama Rupa the that Spota this eternal and this is a power the vibration the world what is the power with that power God is creating how it is creating nama Rupa the first giving the name then it is taking the form this photo has one world and it's only possible symbol and it is that own phota is that power and then it has been expressed those instead of telling this photo it has given a name to understand what is that name oh oh oh ma but pronounce that 0:01 and this photo are inseparable the this photo was that discovered as they say five hundred years before and a panini is the 500 years before panini so we can say and the six or seven hundred years before panini it was discovered by Sam Rishi no name now slowly slowly we came to know in the time of the Punisher they gave a name to this photo the main power from where the manifestation is coming as the own up to this is clear now this universe have been created out of all this photo is the material of all words yet it is not definite word the material of the word but is not definite if all the peculiarities which distinguishes one word from another be removed then what remains will be the supporter we are giving different names so will allow the god jehovah but the quran different words different names but it has some special all that we can set the peculiarities now remove the speaker is the peculiarity Allah is a different world and it in the guard is English word like these if it is there then by that way if you remove there all the peculiarities what happens is photo only Saudi beautifully is explaining photo is also called nada Brahma the sound Brahman due to nada Brahma people everywhere can communicate and understand one another this photo is a concept with a dual form shabda and artha and the beginning it is this photo and it is the to form what is that one is shabda the sound and artha the meaning every word not one American boy has written to me can you please give me a Indian name and I found that his name from a Greek god so I gave him that the meaning is the God's grace that I gave the name David atta this david that means the gift of god see the greek word same meaning sanskrit word same meaning so the word shabda and the artha but when I say David at the Greeks won't understand when the Greeks up pronouncing the at their word I understand but if you remove those peculiarities of the world meaning is the same the same way sporter is having this dual form shabda and arthur granary and panini accepted shabda as the primal energy of the universe and recognized its identity which fota the panini is very important because it is analyzing a word the linguist they analyze different type of languages why because that is very important for the human society if you understand understand why from this word actually has come then slow slowly slowly you will know that all things are going to the same goal one goal Shami Vivekananda very wonderfully he mentioned though all our knowledge is all science it is having only one goal what is that goal to find out the one behind everything the in that this world also the panini the grammarian and he is also trying to understand the different form and it says in this way the grammarian panini is telling in the vitru hurry the famous philologist and grammarian in the Sanskrit villa resistant grammarian mentioned in his back up the back here padilla bak Kapadia it says o Nardini Donham brahma shabda rupam yada aksaram bieber Totti our Taba Vina Prakriti gato yatta the Brahman who is without beginning and end who is of the form of the in destructible world is apparently transformed into object and this is the process through which creation takes place photo is the in device' bill idea with his dual form chapter and arthur behind the expression of the divine sound ohm is the divine idea and behind the divine idea his Brahman the divine itself Upanishad clearly described the ohm is not only means but also the goal of the a spiritual seeker I am NOT going to dad the ohm is the goal itself the own is the path an ohm is the end so that is different way I'd like to mention over here the parish of de the shabda it Ibaka according to Shankar Acharya parish after the primal sound comes out from mooladhara now here again what the krishna said is the mooladhara at the beginning of the spinal cord the sanskrit name mula mula means the root the original odd Hara is the holder he is holding the original thing what is that original thing the life his original thing is the knowledge so that for our shabda the primal sound is comes from mooladhara as prana unmanifested sound of brahma then it becomes Prashanti the circle impulse of sound then it becomes madama the dynamic part of the sound and the word so four words are coming slowly slowly it is manifesting in this way para for Shanti bath para person t like this it is going on bug boy Brahman and all that so it says parish uptil then the person T then the madama and then ultimately it's going create engaging earth and I will conclude by saying these boy dig symbol ohm and the Sanskrit term Bach may be the same as the Greece logos another culture is there the Vedic culture and the Greek culture but the knowledge goes to the same they say that it is thus phota and sported the name is ohm and the sames fota same vibration that has not started yet but that is the source of the vibration there is the source of the word that's the source of the creation the Greeks said it is the logos the l EG oh that way they pronounce and afterwards english the bible they took it as word etymologically the greeks logos hindus bach shares the same meaning to speak greek philosopher Heraclitus used the word logos to describe the principle that control cosmic flow of movement they say sometimes the Europeans they will always argue that ours is the ancient civilization and the Hindus represent the Hindus they are actually by diga dharma and they are say no ours is the ancient whatever it may be a few years plus - but the thing they are developing the same conception that is interesting the Hindus they are sitting on the bank of the Ganga Jamuna Godavari and the Greeks they are in their different places in the Europe and they are thinking in the same way and they had come to this the big fellow philosopher the Heraclitus he says that this is the same thing the control the cosmic flow of movement and what we were discussing cosmic flow of movement the famous philosopher Plato he interpreted logos as an idea or thought connecting God creation who created God so he says we don't have in there any idea about God the Plato but these connects us to the God we say God has created we say but how the beginning of the creation is the vibration that makes the sound then the meaning then the manifestation as I was telling then comes the smell that touch and everything movement the Greek is also telling and Plato said we can call it as God is the beginning of the God the connecting the God in 4th century BC the strike described the logos as logos super mushy cause meaning seed of the universe is strike another group of people they were also analyzing these gives a wonderful idea that if we are researching the spiritual research that gives the same result as the scientists they are researching all over the world in the modern designs we can understand but when the result comes the same result comes similarly the ancient time wind all this we can call them Rishi's the philosophers the play - and all others and before them there was a group term Stoics they were also trying to understand and they said the seed of the universe is that this is the God connecting us to the God that logos Jewish philosopher fellow it is 13th century BC he said a contemporary he was the contemporary of Jesus try to harmonize the reason of the Stoics with the transcendentalism of the plato the fellow the logos become to feel the Lucas become the first manifestation of God both immanent and transcendent this both immanent and transcendent there's logos the Greek logos became world for the Christians Saint John wrote in his gospel in the beginning was the world that is the logos there is this photo that is the own so a same way in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh there is the Jesus Christ and dealt among us full of grace and truth who is Jesus God we're from higüey came from the beginning but is it any difference in Hinduism and Greek philosophy Indian philosophy a little bit here and there in the explanation but if you go to the basic the wing our Shri Krishna he was removing the doubt of the would double every humble question sir you have telling about the iana and also bhakti and the yoga and so many parts please tell me which will be the best path then the Krishna went to the root see any path you can choose but actually the creation is like this and when we were discussing that we entered into the realm of the Greek and the Christian traditions and what we come across the same thing Shani Vivekananda from his pedantic point of view explained the external aspect of the thought of God is the world and as God taught and wheeled before he created the creation came out of the world Swamiji a complete works first volume he is very clearly his mentioning the
