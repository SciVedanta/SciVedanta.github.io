[Bhagavatam 041 : How To Recognize a Realized Soul](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PVYCkT_P1nw)

today in the beginning of this discourse I should congratulate the father's a very happy Father's Day and the father is considered in our tradition with a very very high position even above the heaven bottarga PETA Herman PETA hapara Montebourg so he is higher than heaven and he's the Dharma listening to him serving him accompanying him supporting him helping him his mind Duty spiritual duty so that is an very very high position in the society the father is one who gives us protection love guidance leadership everything is nothing but father but mother don't lose your hearts because we have already celebrated so this is the Father's Day and the Guru's are also considered as the spiritual father because the Guru also constantly pray guide spiritually for the betterment of his life the meta betterment of the life of the children and we consider those who have taken initiation maybe by age or in education or social status their higher than the Guru himself but still they are the children of the Guru the Guru is also considered as the spiritual father our spiritual mother so this is the day and today is a 16th June this Sunday is a very very auspicious day why you know not only the Father's Day this is the non job daddy thus non Katraj a Burnout general Nath is their Lord of the universe but when you see that a lot of the universe he's the master of the universe is all pervading the Hindus are not satisfied we need a God whom we can serve so we have made that God juggle norther the name if you can understand the meaning of it he is the master of the whole universe Jagat but at the same time is very close to us and today they'll be bathing not only jagannatha also his brother and sister and this Germanotta balabhadra and Subhadra they will be paid with 100 film a golden picture from the water bill to take bath maybe once and here they take the path but the Jagannatha is sticking the butt today and then the juggernaut won't like it you know just like a baby don't like to go for breathing and you say no I won't go so he'll be sitting like this as that they say the Ganesha he is not very happy so he'll be sitting like this and the kanesha fall and sometimes they think as a elephant fall and all these things then the Pujari's will go the devotees will go feed him and keep him all his choice food slowly slowly after few days he will come out etc the discharger not the Hindus consider it very very holy and they and the whole thing all people can see on this particular day that you will be very happy many of you know this - nature Kali temple that was constructed that was actually narrated on this particular team this is our and this is Shyam who Manu he performed in Yangon the spiritual urban and the jaren not manifested over there so it is considered as the birthday of the juggernut also on this holy day one very rich woman lady and she was considered as a very influential in that did they in Calcutta the capital of the undivided India she was thinking she saw other dream she should do something the spiritual so she was thinking she will go to Kashi the Kashi is a very holy place for the Hindus so everything was ready she was ready to sell in those days days to go by boat by Kashi but suddenly she saw the dream the goddess Kali is telling no you need not to go to Kashi you better purchase the plot of land over here and she showed it this particular plot you should purchase and make my temple over there I like to be there and that particular plot is the ducks in Asia they purchase that plot of land irani and constructed a huge temple over the earth in 1855 it it was constructed completely and it was inaugurated and in those days this pain 9 lakhs nine hundred thousand that many faith in those days the Rani the Queen rush money is pained for that and the first person that way into worship over there is the elder brother of Sri Ramakrishna and also cinema Krishna followed him he was there he was practicing the austerity so this is the Kali temple and afterwards you know just centering that Kali and the temple Saran pitch nough became the worshipper of the first the Vishnu of the one then the Kali the Shiva and all the practices for the last 12 years that happened over there so this is very very important and today is also the birthday of a person who is considered as a realized soul the first disciple of swami vivekananda swami Peterjohn and the village analogy he was the first disciple of swami be vehicle you know Bhagwan see Ramakrishna he initiated these people and the sannyasa and they started an organization over there but in bingo they never heard about the Vedanta the Tantra never that was famous in Bengali do you add the first so naturally people were an area about this pedantic way of meditation young people they are meditating day and night and sometimes going out with the begging bowl and then they are taking some food and eating that was for the absent begging why these people should be the moment you are begging means you have lost it all everything so that is to be considered at the very low the behavior there's a bad world but now these people they are going and baking's and obviously people's to wonder so this is the first the pedantic the movement started in Bengal through them and after they were realized and all the slowly the young generation started visiting them the first young man who came to them not to become a monk but to learn mathematics so he came to a Swami is afterwards he became ramakrishnan and the G and Ramakrishna energy was a very good in mathematics so he came and told said do you please teach me mathematics my summer vacation is going on few days I can come and from you it will come and stay with us he started staying with the Wong's and you know that it is very very dangerous to stay with the monks because you get immediate influence by them they're getting up in the early morning taking the name of God and chanting and the holy life that influence that young God and he started also practicing meditation and following their routine much more than practicing mathematics so afterwards he told his father know I like to become a monk before his father leaving that room and locked him in outside so you're not allowed to go like these all influence he was initiated by Marsh our Ataman EDB and he was practicing meditation this is very important we must know some of the teachers I should say so cover teachers a meditation the teach meditation over here and sometimes in between the two eyebrows now this is very dangerous because that is the last stage of meditation this is the sixth stage according to the yoga that this is the sixth and this is the last and the final stage without preparing without making your mind and body purified and ready for that if you start from here this naturally this is not good but Dave and this boy this village analogy he was meditating on the center of his hail and after some time he lost his sleep he couldn't sleep and he was suffering and no doctors could help him then ultimately he went to Marshall a hominid TB the moment he said that this is the problem immediately see asked my son where you are meditating concentrating your mind he said on the centre my head no neighbor don't do it always meditate our friends we will come to this great soul once again in reference to the answer that a novel the yogi you know the nine Yogi's and they were there in there called chakra chat room is a place where the debate was going on spiritual discussion spiritual debates these nine brothers they all of them they were realized Souls so they came to visit they're sitting over there and the king who organized that he asked the first question we know the first question how to realize the Hartman and with the those who are attending this class regularly you know it how to realize the apartment friends we are reading bhagavata and the bhagavata means is a book of devotion but almost in every page we come to these questions our knowledge knowledge and knowledge almost in every page and here the King nimi it was his name and he asked that and according to the tradition the senior one the first one should answer so the first brother of the nine brothers his name was Kobe he gave the answer how to realize Hartman very simple answer surrender all your actions perform through body mind and words at the feet of the Lord that's okay then you will realize the Hartman look at it so it is a half man it is not God that is earth man the soul and he was supposed to practice the the Ghanim marker but here the instruction is just dedicate a everything at the feet of the God very recently Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna said what is the practice should be the practice the best way to realize God Nadia Nadia bhakti what is the nadia bhakti that means the devotion that the Narada is teaching what is that devotion that Arpita Aquila our charitable taught the Bhishma ranee for Amma Bakula eating living let her play so that is this is that the present day we should follow that because see Ramakrishna is suggesting and this is very very effective what is there that whatever you are doing through your body physical actions that we do mentally we are thinking and verbally we are telling all should be given at the feet of God surrender it and then in the Bhagavata we learn from the kebee against the question there how to realize the Hartman do everything and the cause of bondage that we should know by mistake we take this world this universe this phenomena which is actually inert as consciousness as permanent as a source of joy and that is the bondage we think that if we are learning if we are getting some certificates from the best universities we can get all the best things in the world and go and see those who have achieved those certificates still suffering and then again if you go to themselves what can bring us the joy no one knows everybody's trying to pursue that and then ultimately the presentative world will say that if I become the president of America perhaps I will go and ask him in private he will also say no sir nothing nothing like that no joy why because this world this phenomena that we see everything is so temporary it can never give us the permanent happiness so separate the consciousness from the inner things unconscious things so these were the answers against the first question how to realize the Earthmen and the answer was that whatever the action you were doing surrender it to the Supreme Being second this cause of bondage is the mistake accepting these manifested thing as the permanent and the source of happiness so completely separated so that was the question the fear of bondage why so that he said oppose me tea and pepper Jaya to Sanskrit words forgetfulness about the soul Appa Smitty Smitty means depart the memory smelting and this memory Appa Appa mis- when we forget that we are the soul and not the body anger the mind and the moment we go and stand before the mirror at all this is me this is not me and what is me I do not know that is the mystery so a personality and B / Jaya considering the body and the mind as me so these are the two so slowly we have to and the second question - naturally the last in our discourse we left it and the nimmy asked so there are very practical type of people so they are asking well has anybody realized following this method otherwise it is not proved I say if you prepare suppose sometimes you are exchanging another the met or something so if you can do this then it is good and it is good but has anyone already practiced and got the result then only we will do it so the king is asking how to recognize the realized soul so you say that this is the way we you can realized and has anyone already done it following this method realized how to recognize this is the second question so the second brother he started giving the answer the second brother of the novel yogi the nine Yogi's is Hari Frosty's kabhi second three and he replied suribabu tisha Bashir Robert Haugen at Mahad boot ani haba booty art money Asia Bhagavad Utama Alberto dalla raga what means the great devotee would turn the supreme the greatest devotee who now he says he who sees the Hartman in all creatures see completely the words of the knowledge he who sees the Hartman in every being and also sees the creatures in the art man the Supreme Being no he is the bhagavad Ultima the best among the devotees are the realized soul that means he sees one and not do the art Minh the consciousness in every being and also every being in that consciousness because there is only one and it is there is no - so Hinduism though they are teaching the devotion they are leading us ultimately to the one mr. Raghavan Slavik is now all through his life he actually was a devotee the cricket devotee he worshiped the Rama he'll worship the Krishna you are Shiva Shiva you were Kali but again he said there is only one there cannot be two everything is that consciousness Sallu bhootish young ashamed in all being and when he look at being a person what we see immediately by mistake we go forward his identity the name and other qualities but the name and other qualities we always think but actually I think he came to examine it came to examine the weather I also consider it as a garden gnome and I don't sir I maybe consider it as God but it doesn't know I haven't careful so this is the always it happens like this that we have to be very very practical you should know what is what so this we find cervical tissue ARPA shield yeah one Hooper she sees cell phone booth issue in all being what consciousness so this is the technique we have to understand each and every being different name different form different features but all and nothing but the same Supreme Being if we can really understand that realize that then we are a realized soul how to recognize a realized person some other to all this is simple he will never ever differentiate some other she enabled the moms means what is a practice to become some other she same subject nurse to sometimes some people they always think every in the morning no the moment you become a monk you are above all those religions they're supposed to be that is the practice my path is in tourism my process of realizing and all the reach over there is Hinduism that's why Shami be waken the same do you think I belong to India do you think I belong to Hinduism I belong to the human so that is the idea the some other that there can never be any differentiation so this is the when how to understand a realized soul that and what is the same some others the same means art math self no Ewan get this same answer in the bhagavad-gita also and we find in the sixth chapter 29 30 and 31st verses very clearly he is mentioning sarva bhuteshu Atmaram salvo bhutan each effort money art na means the soul the consciousness in all being when you see that consciousness in all being then there is no differentiation and again and in 30th verse he says in the same chapter six you want Bocchetti sarvatra sarvam Johnny machete I really wonder those who are worshipping Shri Krishna how they can become so narrow so sectarian closed or how it is possible because their God is teaching that you should see me in every being - well show me become the same the greatest and the lobster loftiest I told og that was given by the Hinduism but the most bad and almost very bad way they practiced and what the practice don't come don't touch don't eat don't love this so that was the really really very wrong thing hinduism means these you mom the god per sheet is Roberta sir a bunch of university that is in tourism sort of a brutal hit on human body acre the mass theta now Tony I see everyone has saying no you have to go and help them serve them without any differentiation a very practical way only theoretical years okay no problem how to prove you have to go into action then only you can prove otherwise no servomotors become human in the ramakrishna mission they started serving the people usually the hindu sannyasin Hindu monks never did and it was not necessary in olden days the king is to take all the sponsibility of the subjects and the citizens but now after that seven hundred years of the Sultana and then two hundred years of the Britishers rule the India became poor and there was no administration so some people should come forward to help these people the Swami Vivekananda oxd is the sannyasins go and serve this living beings why in Vedanta we see the God in every being so what why then you have to go inside a cave and close your door and close your eyes go and see the living gods and goddess has served them so that was the practical Vedanta Vivekananda introduced and son of a Buddhist Rita how it was possible you know most of the people that think that you hear Hindus but our missionary work started by serving the Muslims and the first direct disciple of Sabanci ramakrishna the brother disciple of swami ji he was passing through a district in bengal Skog Murshidabad and he found a little girl she's crying the Shami went to her and asked her what has why you were crying that she told I was having only one Arvind borde to keep our water drinking by mistake I have broken it and if I go back to my house my mother will kill me she'll be so angry because we know that anything else no other utensils only this one that the Xiaomi felt very bad only our 10-part and so cheap come I will purchase one so she at the Xiaomi took that girl to the shop and purchased one our 10-part and also extent that the shopkeeper to give some something maybe some biscuits and something to eat so the girl was very happy and then he turned to see hungry faces all are coming to show me we are also hungry we need food we need food so the Xiaomi sat over there praying to God I am having only this much and how can I serve these people then he heard the rise of bhagavati Ramakrishna pushing him to sit over there and ask be here and serve these people he started serving slowly there he collected some food and serving so we started our still if you go to that place still there are some eyes there in the mushy debod if you go steal those people we are serving now this is the broadness how it has come the Danville how it has come because of the true understanding of the religion and what is the true understanding servomotors system you mom a jetty then you have to go and serve and do the worship not only oh you are a good guard not not like that you have to serve physically and you know servicing physically so difficult if you offer your foot to the God there is a picture and the image you will never see anything and you do not know what you are offering maybe it is displaced but the gardens are anything but the Living God if you go and give the dual distance AAA this is tasteless go and prepare something good and you have to be very very patient so you have to serve them so mom means the mean it is capital M me the God the supreme here Shri Krishna so that is the art man so Artman as consciousness is present everywhere how we will know let us go back to that age-old practice what is that a bustah TRAI shark she a pasta Draya bechara the avocado tree pasta means the condition TRAI means three the three condition what are the three conditions waking dream and dreamless sleep so we can dream and dreamless sleep these are the three condition that always every day we are passing through so through that we can prove one thing what is that we are not this body we are not the mind and we are the consciousness the serve how when you are awake you have the body and the mind is everyone knows when you are sleeping you are your body is absent only your mind is active so you see the dream and dream you are not dreaming also but sleeping and coming back and reporting to yourself I slept without any dream who was there body was not their mind was not there but still you were that you were sleeping and you slept without any dream so what is that that is called consciousness so that is the proof so they prove three stages waiting stage dream stage and dreamless sleep stage and then say when you go to that condition it is actually you are going through ignorance you do not know you reach over there but without knowing but if you go consciously when you are meditating in the meditation slowly you forget your body then you forget your mind then you go to that condition where there is no party there is no mind and the supreme consciousness and you come back slowly and that is called to do so they say it is the fourth stage fourth Chatterton so by that way we can understand the one only that is the Atman the consciousness we can prove in that way and one can challenge and that Hartman when reflecting on our intellect fiscal jivatma the jivatma means all this all of us the old being what is this the consciousness is reflecting on our body but the means our internet the reflecting on that and immediately we become so powerful the moment we become reflected with the Hartman we become powerful we see call it the jivatma the individual self and individual self start with the doer ship I am doing the de stewardship and that developed the ego the torch it means I am doing this I is the ego and then the ego associated with Maya creates this world so what is this the ego the to achieve the I associated with the Maya or what is the Maya ego of the individual self it is nothing but still we feel that I hide in a one person is telling I am these I am that and the next step he gives on the stair got four wheel he slipped and fall and die but one moment before he was telling IRI as if he is the whole powerful he doesn't know what is going to happen next moment so this is foolishness but still each and every one of us we are having that ego so this same way it is completely nothing but our imagination I am this I am that is all our imagination and suppose you are not disclosing that you are a doctor or engineer or a great officer or maybe the the administrator of a country if you go out here in the air people don't recognize you and that is the reason all these people they go with all that other people and they will be shouting hey the king is coming then only we know some king is come other risking looks like me only the cool looks like any other person so how even recognize ego and the ego through that ego I we are making the great mistake and because of that mistake we are coming back again and again taking different type of form either sometimes you meant for more animal form of birds or the reptiles according to the Karma and he goes circular birth then death birth depart and death so we the Maya at it binds and the bondage is nothing but the desire what is the bondage nothing but the desire there is no actually rope or any string is only the desire that is binding us so the aims up when the desire is there it ends up in misery this is the problem so once at another what we were what is the originality Hartman what is this art man the source of joy source or existence and it is all-pervading all-powerful now slowly we get the reflection of that Hartman in our booty and then we develop I am that suppose the moon it declares hey I am giving the light in the night like the China has developed a moon so that it will give the light in the night so they did turn to burn so many lights so one light will give sufficient light of the city so like the China is developing slowly maybe the wind we will not have anything to get the power that type of things will work will be habituated see in your room there will be a moon that will give the light after that will put up the moon and then go to bed so like that it will be so this is the way what is this moon if the moon says I am giving you the light I don't bother the Sun is just like that I don't believe in God I don't have any faith in God and just like that at the moon is telling that I don't believe in Sun I don't care for the Sun when some people they come and say I don't believe in God I don't have any faith in God I always say if the moon says is what will happen and some day the Sun will say ok ok you don't like okay I won't give any light to you what will happen to the moon so just like that if the Hartman says okay you don't believe me you don't believe that God is there with him okay I am going out what will happen the cremation ground so this is the way always we have to understand we are so interesting and we are denying the our Creator who is within us and that brings all the misery so egoistic person sees meaning in one the egoistic person he sees mainly I am going to rule I am going to make the rule I am going to do these also many he sees but the realized soul will see only one image so this is the difference so second brother of the nimi the second brother of the nine brothers real he is describing the different stages of realization you know one is fully realized another partly realized in us not to fully living how very nicely in the bhagavata we find it says is Shari that Adi nature policy issue the should suture prema my tree Kripa aphasia yeah karate some Ultima the one is the highest to realized soul he sees the Artman in all being and seeking a little bit how he said he who love God he has the complete faith and love God and friendliness with the Odie's kindness to the ignoring people and also indifferent against them to death antagonized people those who doesn't believe as something so little away from them that the second grade people so God is there devotees are there another good people are also there maybe they are ignoring but still is okay or some people oh my god no I should not mixed with them so these differences are their their second group people Shami be vacant and the when he was along with some of the devotees he was walking in Cairo and by mistake because all the devotees were Americans they were not knowing the Cairo so they went to a bad place so and all the ladies over there they started laughing and and showing different the we they do usually so that was a very difficult situation the devotees immediately asked the Swami please let us go back now the devotees saw bad people bad women all around al shami Vivekananda he went step by step towards them and soliloquizing oh my mother's where have you have brought down yourselves why you are all here in this condition why you have made down yourselves in this condition so he saw the divine mother in all of them his guru walls of occupancy Ramakrishna he also saw the same no differentiation but the same people those who were going along the sharmaji they were ready to run back because they are thinking oh either at situation we are so this is second grade the believe in God the love the devotee and they also have the kindness for the ignorant people they like to start people apart they like to avoid some bad people and this is the second great realization and third grade they will say or Chaya Ibarra who jamia Satya yachty not a teacher and nation some of the prophetess returned it says in the eleventh can book 2nd chapter xlvii verse of the bhagavata it says that the great Saint hurry again is telling that the realized person the 3rd those who worship God with great devotion only in image alone and do not love and respect God's devotees and also the other beings that are great so you will find majority of the people unlike that they will worship the God were there and doing these and then the moment you are trying to intermediate of last a are you in America please not but even if you go some of the temples there is arya brahman then I'm gonna Hindu then are you all these questions they'll be asking you're not allowed to the guard and were you standing at the door of the god me and my god who are you but these so that is there called the third grade they have love for God respect for God they worship God with all devotion but the thing all other things are all dirty they should not come over here should not can do all these things so friends what should be our the process of rapid evolution first understanding that we have a self soul which is actually the reflection of the original self the art man the brahman reflection it's not original but through the reflection we can go back to the original how understanding the same reflection is there in all beings so there should not be any discrimination or narrowness so slowly slowly we must go over there we must wash it the card and also we must love the devotees whoever is coming this way we always keep the door open from morning 8 - evening 8 because by the grace of God we have some devotee who are always here they help us to do that some of our barranco society can't because the only Swami and that's also nee a building so he lives on the fourth floor how can he come down every time to open the the door and Indians for Indians Asuma and the temple means 24g should be over anytime I can go to God of course when I am sleeping let God also sleep no problem for me otherwise I should go anytime so when you are serving you have to handle in this way understanding Weaver is coming must also understand slowly slowly but I should know he has got a call from God so he has come may be whatever the idea so this is the final great seeing God in everything seeing the feeling Artman Eliza Hartman in every being but at the same time we should remember that one must behave in a very practical way as if I go to a tiger though the Xiaomi said the tiger is also having the same soul as I'm having and I go and he tried to embrace the tiger think the tiger how it happy it will be licked all the devotees come one after another every day so they so we should not be fool like that we have to understand in a very practical way this is the theory but to reach over there we have to understand and then step one step second step third step we should go and then inside will feel two things one broadness of our mind accepting each and everyone embracing each and everyone at the same time a joy and happiness if it is not there then you are only showing up some people they will go and embrace each and every one but that is also that show you know that is not the true that is not the original so we have to fill ourselves you need not to go to anyone to ask am i progressing in the spiritual life even feel yourself how in this way huggabug with Dhamma and why we are feeling separation then the answer is Vishnu mayam etam vision because the God the Vishnu the all-pervading consciousness he has made this he wants that we should play we should have like this the Vishnu my arms and turbans Ramakrishna is telling in one place if I knew this world as true I would have covered my birthplace the command who could with gold but I know it is nothing all this thing that you see and all agreeing on changing changing and changing nothing remains now now the sage hoody is also say if you find someone who can remain even minded and calm this in another way is trying to give us the same idea the her means body indriya means the senses prana the vital forces mana the mind the intellect and also the actions like janma the birth B Naja dead should have hunger fire field and Trishna the thirst it's not worked out by all these then only due to his constant meditation on the Supreme Being he is not partnered with any of all this so what happens because of our body we have we are having all the power hunger or thirst our fear is a deer but the person who has realized the Brahman the ultimate how he will know that was the question how to realize then he is telling there you will see this completely unperturbed no disturbance why because his mind is constantly merged with the Brahman friends now I will talk about the Xiaomi I mentioned whose birthday is today Xiaomi Peter John on the G he was a very close to Xiaomi Vivekananda he was a very good cook and very good administrator the Xiaomi Chi is to depend on him Xiaomi Vivekananda and show me we began this theory was fast and perfect any work will be given I will do it not like that very fast you should completely and perfectly you should do and because I was doing so quickly some mistakes no it must be so you must be very attentive know that Tommy was there he was loved and blessed by Xiaomi vivekananda and he got the blessings of mother to marshal tamanna TV then afterwards he went to a Himalayan Center that's called Maya body in the Maya body is a place of meditation and slowly slowly this show me developed a love for meditation now he was meditating and suddenly a call came from the president didn't president of the real North Xiaomi shivananda ji that you should go to America in those days India and America you can imagine the India was nothing and today's India and America almost equal I would say because some of the many many many of the things are available in India sometimes we take something to give there to some of our friends hey we are bringing it from a miracle what is this another thing is better than this is here so nowadays we don't take any gift for our Indian friends because they are having better things so this India is a totally different but in those days can you imagine the people who stood dream we are going to America to usual I like told you the funny story the people to think in this way not nowadays in those days if anything foreign is very good very special so one lady was having some trouble in the eye so she was taken to a doctor the eye specialist and he doctor to Lord nothing if foreign particle is there in your remove it and immediately the lady jumped up for in particular plan to remove no no no foreign particle is so difficult to give let it be there so that much of love for the foreign things because we were really and now it has all gone in those days this Romney was given the offer that you should go to America and who the president of the order and you always considered once he says he says there is no other anything if he says call we must have to go do we must have to do like this but this show me he could say no you know what he did he hide in a jungle and from the Maya body very close to that morality is called Shambhala table if you go you can visit now it's the Astana the Shambala tall tall means a big big pond and here in he wing nothing was there he made a small heart he started meditating out there no food sometimes is to come down and drink the water go and see to cut there the villagers are very good the moment they will see there are very poor people but still leave them it want at the roti one brave they'll make it half and offer it to the holy people so they are really very very even today such the Shawnee is to get little food and to avoid that where were people maybe one or two occasionally they were coming even to avoid that used to climb on a hilltop and whole day used to meditate on there and come down because of the cold is to come down and spend inside the cave and night and then again in the morning is to go today I visited that place when you were climbing on that is so difficult and in those days all alone is to go and meditate and meditate but in the meantime you know administration and if you are not obeying the order so naturally the punishment so the president of the order he told no he is not listening to me we should be punished another Swami was there his friend see he was Matewan and lychee mother 100 he was loved by many respected Swami's mother she told show me please give me a few days let me go and find him out he must be somewhere near so he came and he was searching and he was searching to the villagers you know the in villages the words they always craved and if you say something into the hollers and something special means all people in discuss so he went and so he's there he was going on asking the villagers his theory monk who is not eating not drinking only sitting like this like a stone he says there is there so they immediately found he went over there he found his friend by that time he has drawn the big beard because who had to go and he further say be so long here big beard and he was meditating he told me what happened wasn't known I am very close to the God realization I am NOT going to go anywhere please don't request me in that way this Swami also realized so he came back and told to show me shabanam the G let us wait for some time he's in the last stage of his sadhana and after one month this Swami came down he came and stood before the President of the balloon mod Shami Cheban and the G she vanished looked at him embrace them with great joy you have achieved you have achieved and that is called at McConnell the moment you realized that everyone will realize and this show me afterwards became the president of the order with a jihad on the G he has written a beautiful book it's a small small burner ideas how to develop the spiritual life if you are interested you can go to that book towards the gold supreme param art brush anger towards the gold supreme by him about him another Xiaomi has written a biography the name of the book is the story of an epoch the shamans are done and the G certainly was here in Sacramento and all the dedicated circles of Swami Vivekananda dear life very sparing life each and every one of them so that it's written by youjin energy the name of the book is monastic disciples of Shami Vivekananda now here we find it says in the 50th verse karma karma Bijan omnia cheetah c-sam Papa Basu the vehicle Nanaia Sabri bhagavata otama he is the realized soul he is the highest devotee who is not having any single desire in his mind any single dessert Shami be vacant under the lover of india he came here in America he saw the America is a educationally and all that they developed and sharmaji wanted some organization so to help the Indian people so he was exchanging his views with his followers his devotees then you know Americans immediately they will make the whole thing systematically the sharmaji should do these and we should do that very systematically and Indians are not at all systematic we firstly do it then we think oh we have done this that we have to change it like that but they have very systematic when they to Swamiji appreciated that systematic way so he was trying to learn from them they were also eager to help him but Swamiji was in a different moon one day when there was promise you are not paying attention to the idea that you are giving we have to contact the rich people we have to get their support and we have to organize the volunteers we have to go in this way to develop then why you are not planning that Swami just replied was this is very important the Shabbos reply was I never do any planning I only execute my mother's command so that is the highest stage of realization we cannot say that majority of us we won't be able to say that only the realized soul like Vivekananda brahmana that they can do that and he said I never planned I only execute the mother's command so then when he but the mother will ask me to do whatever they know only I will do so this is not karma karma be jo naam yes sure Cheeta see somewhere in his mind there is not a single desired seed of desire he is the highest devotee Bhagavad otama he is the realized soul and we this way we find sorry Babu Tazawa Shanta Savai'i bhagavad Tama this is the last he is telling in the fifty second verse Salva buta saman all being are equal to him if it realized soul claim that I am realized soul at the same time in his behavior if we find that he is differentiating he is not developed so I shan't oh he is all calm and composed and tranquil and only wait for the command of the Lord then only he does he is a realized soul so the second question and the Ark's friends many of you those who are studying the bhagavad-gita you know the same type of idea that crossed the mind of Arjuna in the second chapter Arjuna is asking and Shri Krishna is giving the answer but it it was not the realized soul or bhagavata with dhamma the terminology used citta procure the sita property abraca means the internet theta means is calm the test you can also go through that the second chapter of the gita verse from 54 to 71 this question was talks to bethere so thank you very much thank you for coming over here once again I pray to the God the Supreme God because the holy occasion only time and very very pleasant time the Jagannatha may be now getting the bath and he is blessing each and everyone and let us pray to him the supreme god of the universe mean all our prayers be answered me all our prayers be answered so can you please repeat with me today we didn't churn the Shanta Karim we started with the jagannatha and the Germanotta is he who is

and today they take it out and then just like the jagannatha they'll be building their Slam kitchen also whether the traditional way the body is not only water they'll be milk they'll be yogurt then be honey and of course the water so that we they mean and thousands of people they will wait after that all that collected water they will take little little to see and they feel that they are blessed they get purified to resolve thoughts and some of the actions and some of the rituals that goes on increasing the thought that I am pure I am pure I am pure so this is this is the reason the ritual should be followed and through the ritual the goal should be to reach over there where I see only one in all permissiveness so okay so we will meet again but you know that the coming the weekend it
