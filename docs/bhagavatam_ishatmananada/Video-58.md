[Bhagavatam 035 : The Exchange Of Sri Krishna and Yogamaya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZK-2wqc4mzc)

you're good for you know but sedation vishwanadham governess attrition me shuhang gum looks me [Music] you give me dianna yum yum Bundy mission [Music] we chant this mantra to get an idea about the Supreme God who is the supreme god Shanta Karim is very quiet calm composed this Shanta calm sitting in appearance why because when we are agitated our the body language also changes and when we get agitated when we are not sure about the thing which is going to be successful or failure then we give the agitation after the God who knows everything who knows what is going to happen because everything is he will be doing so obviously he shan't Accardo so once I was going to give a lecture the three days spiritual retreat in a village of Bengal it was going from Puglia and to the Venice called the place I had forgotten so theorems mean and I am the person who was supposed to receive me he failed to come and the teacher who was accompanying me he got agitated what will happen because the time is passing at will who is going to give the lecture till they go there will be no lecture so wait they will come so for in you know that everything is you who is creating so there is no problem so I was enjoying or the c-team drinking tea and those people came of course is a big long story and very funny anyway this is the way it happens we are educated because we do not know what is going to happen at the time of examination children are very agitated why because they do not know what will be the question people and all this but when you know this will be like this so there is no problem and another group of people they are also not very agitated and they don't like to do anything in the examination I am NOT going to appear in the examination so no tension at all it is not like this this is a completely positive but she Shanta karim but very peculiar Fujioka shayana he is sleeping lying down on the serpent why yoga is constantly immersed in yoga the serpent is a symbol of the yoga so that is the reason unless and until you are attached with God of the supreme through Yoga Yoga means Union then you cannot control your mind agitation will be the problem will be there and all these things so Shanta Karim would you - I know the related if you are all the time connected with God through meditation then naturally he'll be tranquil but monogamous relationship issue is that even the god of gods or gods we sure harem is holding the whole vision because he is the one from him everything is coming we sure are and gagana attrition they could not explain how big is the biggest thing is governor Dunham is this the Parliament is not only the sky the bigger bigger bigger than the sky the parliament governesses region they're using this word gagana to give us an understanding that it is very vast whatever you can think the bigger one bigger than that to me harbour known why made Habana mega means you cannot understand him properly so this dark the complexion is dark so why because we do not understand that completely so it is dirt flux me condom he is the Phantom is the master husband the husband of the Lakshmi the goddess of wealth so when we think about the religion it is the two different type of prosperity one jothika at the article the java tiga if you want i want to get everything in this world you will get it all success all wealth all name all fame everything and at the same time you will get if you want the spiritual development the Lakshmi is always with the God himself so this lets me contemn come other jnanam you give it the our nagamma who could understand who could see God only Yogi's because they withdraw their senses can concentrate on that tranquil mind where the true God reveals dianna gong-myung if you want to see the form then only the form will come otherwise not if you want to get liberation then no forbit be there one day Vishnu who is he Vishnu Vishnu is all-pervading consciousness whom the barren theme called as Brahman and he is also known as Vishnu the same all pervading power way of our own and once you understand the Bishnu then there is no fear at all baba baba means this world leading by the harem there'll be no problem all these things are happening in this world everything is happening you know all people are rushing in the early morning to attain the offices Aksum individually they are you happy to it in this office if forget about that the boss that fellow neighbor comes in right time but always keep an eye that we are bringing about the end right time so because of the fear of the boss that we are going to have fish fear of losing the job because we want money to sustain why we work byah byah byah fear fear fear everything is beard who will go happily to the doctors and hospital get the healthy person do you think do we go they do not know anything spittle unwary doctor as long as they are healthy the moment something calm the knees deigning damon they go on everything is happening here the buyer in harem the Hara it moves away he takes away everything for the baby child is very much afraid goes and hugs the mother mother is scheduling and patting slowly the buyer fear goes away if we are really accepting this god this is the Vishnu and now there's almost more than one year we are studying this slowly slowly and I am not reading all the verses only some of the important incidents and then explaining their skull and here today we will discuss a very important and very interesting incident and I have given the name exchange of Shri Krishna and yogamaya I should I could give exchange of God and his power the priest of the god and the yogamaya is that whose power is a tint scandal the longest section sorry the tenth section this taint spandy is a book taint the longest 90 chapters are there describing the Lord Krishna why because this is the main theme of the whole bhagavata though they have dedicated nine chapters nine skandhas to Vishnu and only taint for the Krishna but it became very cold so the position of a card the may be in the next class will discuss about the the bush novel card how they came and how to spread it and they took this particular portion of the book this dozen Skanda and it's the best part of the Bhagavata Purana why this part because it teaches bhakti or the divine love this is a new conception is coming completely new conception all this time we were going on thinking thinking and thinking what is this God and how to realize God and why God manifested in the world and all this it was going on the argument and the answer is going on and this time only in the tenth chapter they're offering us something else don't go mother have only one thing fate have failed that God is there and just go and embrace the God that love so this new thing they are introducing it because it's teaches the puppeteer the divine law through the method of bhakti Jeeva the individual being individual soul feel that the almighty Lord as his own this is the speciality he's feeling that the God is my home that's why even find in the Hindu temples in the morning they will cook and many of the ladies they are very fond of cooking for the God if you go and say I'm hungry we do please go go and purchase somewhere but for the God immediately we have seen when you are asking for $50 a donation Miraj $50 ok we will give you but if you ask for to cook but God and 500 people will come to hit 500 no problem I mean why cooking for the God why love for God the faith in the love that is combined and beautiful thing that was offered to those as in English they always say faithfuls the one who truly realize God the faithfuls Almighty God is mine I am keeping as I've seen some of the ladies him even here in America young ladies hardly not even 35 so they will be caring they are Krishna the small little Krishna and they are constantly carrying over here at all you can keep your bad it's not bad it's my Krishna and okay okay all right it's very difficult you cannot touch and she won't keep anywhere and what my love and what is that the small little image of Krishna and you do not know where the Krishna looks like that or not but I think this is the love is not the way it develops it is the unthinkable all love it goes and King patient he was listening to all the stories and you know that him parish it the son of the young hero of the Mahabharata a vimana and he dedicated his life for the to save to all others he knew that you won't be able to come back but he wind and just fought and died over there to save the others this is a women we were and also the grandson of the original the great hero why I am mentioning because even when his father was a great hero and his grandfather was or Juna great hero and brick sheet was also a great you know how and he is not going to kill but he is going to give away his life to know the truth this is also heroism real reason doesn't mean all the time you have to take out the short and fight kid reason also means you give up everything and then patiently wait for the guard but if she did that he was a king mighty king just he made a little mistake and that because because of that a young Brahmin gave a curse he could go and tell him please withdraw your curse the he didn't do that he never wanted to survive rather he wanted that this is the time when the death is sitting on your name this is the time to realize God because the mind don't go anywhere else I don't need anything else I can't think anything else immediately he gave the whole thing to his son John Major and came and sat by the side of the beautiful river and he was meditating when the death will come and slowly all people came around why because this is the brick shiiine he was in I mean in his mother's body unborn child Krishna saved him those who have read the Mahabharata you know that that one brahmana he became so angry his brahmana but he was in practicing as a Kshatriya so that trinitarios son he wanted to kill all the progenies of the pandavas that was the only child unborn child so he wanted to be christian king it was impossible even for the original to protect when the water came running Arjuna would not protect only Krishna understood and Krishna entered into the person of that lady Uttara and protected that foetus and that beautiful way he was born all these Rishi's they knew it so he's a blessed person so obviously when now he is going to die is Krishna coming back again to protect him or the origin ah will come what is going to happen it's not ordinary death it is very important so all they came and assemble to see what is going to happen and what happened those who were attending all the classes are great the bhagavata you know a great sage King the shoe Knievel and he went on telling all the whole history how the God the Supreme God was all alone and then he thought that I am only alone let me be many and out of himself he created man half woman and arthanori sharra and slowly the creation began and this creation slowly slowly became so complicated so the god it needed the God to come back come down to guide the people on the righteous path so last time we have read about Sri Ramachandra again the Vishnu he came in the form of Sri Ramachandra and this time of even knew without taking even water for last three days he's waiting to listen about the Trishna the god he has seen when he was a unborn baby I saw that face I cannot forgive and he is Krishna please still about that but before telling about the Krishna he was clearing the ground the sugar and on the third day he is giving this issue Connecticut the saga of the solar and lunar dynasties and also her the bright you esteem you do the you do puncture is came from that king and now suka mentioned that to protect his creation Mahavishnu incarnated furry shield now fervently requesting please please tell me about that biryani to see our Canadian underbelly Purusha called Rupa he really said Oh ready to move a rattan chair my amana sure but the shabath duan now three these three words he's mentioning about the God as the Maya minutia and he is asking but uh she please tell me about that who is that my ominous here and who can tell that withdrawn and no harm the truth who can talk about the God who can talk about our daughter only those who are with the one those who have read the biography of Sri Ramakrishna even home the one disciple of sri ramakrishna doctor his very famous man in Calcutta and he was a disciple of sri ramakrishna and he was going on propagating in the the city the Saddam epistle is not ordinary person He is God he is avatar and he was doing on arguing with other people listening these see Ramakrishna was not at all happy weenie came to visit him he told wrong what do you know about me that you are telling the time Avatara any ordinary person cannot talk about Avatara you simply going and to know this is Avatara he has come know what happened and particularly if you go some of the people they exaggerate so much that is the problem lose them my elder sister when I became joined the order she became very angry and she told all these moms are very bad and then slowly slowly she understood it I am NOT going back then she changed her mind till now monks are very good and my brother is a very good mom then one day she came to visit me in a Drita's term I was a brahmacari that's how other people came they were sitting they came to meet other promise waiting for the trauma to come then my sister told you no he's my brother and when he was young he used to do like these used to do like that we knew right from the beginning we create fun then afterwards when everything is over those people left and we were she was alone then I told I think you were talking about Joelle no problem [Music] all those beautiful things only happened in the abu talib rucious not even in my life then she told when you were a small boy how you will remember what happened I know that so sometimes we need people love you and they will go on exaggerating things that is the main problem so ring the Rama he was the disciple absolutely Ramakrishna I was going on talking about Ramakrishna revelation understood he has no capacity to understand only one person that he gave that empowerment that you can go and tell that is Swami Vivekananda even then the baton was assistant to talk about ceramic isne you know bringing him over here he neighbors or ceramic is not only one or two lectures he delivered my master the small book available they only he talked about the ramakrishna boy is very difficult so he refined the brick sheet he is asking whom sukadeva the sugar the British it is the King has left all this everything look at it the other when you are not having anything whatever you can do so brick she to do the dagger he gave up everything and then he was waiting for the last moment of his life the dead and he was asking to sukadeva the master and he was asking build one who learn it one here the learner doesn't mean the certificates from the universities Lord even is the realized soul and you are the realized soul you know everything about the God please tell me about the Supreme God appeared as human it's a very peculiar very special very difficult to understand and very difficult to explain also here the Supreme God God but the God is looking at you God will punish you is so easy to say whether God is do or not I do not know and that person also doesn't know only I am making him afraid that's all but this way when you see that God has come down as a human being and he's living with you and behaving as we really do it killed everything and this God that my prediction knew it as I was telling in the beginning but it was not an ordinary person the brick she used this word Maya and sure that Maya Muhammad appeared appeared as a human being and the next line the person is sitting he's the in Twitter she's the invader of all being then what is his work two different only two what is the two world protecting the good people punishing the bad people miss to work when the avatar comes only these two things he does nothing else he is telling over here showering immortality showering as if like a rain immortality Amita toll on those who take refuge in him I am yours Oh God once you see the God is protective but you have to tell it with all faith and second giving death that doesn't mean the conception of death is just dying and passenger not like that tremendous punishment the pain so much physically and mentally so that ping the giving debt to those who go away from him those who know the Bengali I must have played the blame of la revisión arteaga he is mentioning that the wendi-go close to you Oh God in protectors and we away from you we find every moment the pain of death this is a realization supreme she also telling like that this is the supreme god who showers blessings and immortality because difficult mortal look at those pictures the episodes of the Jesus they were all ordinary people they were all many of them they were fishermen and now people are reading their instructions the teachings the immortal how because they went to God they went to Jesus these people ordinary young people they were as are many others these two go to schools and colleges and then slowly they came to in contact with see Ramakrishna they become immortal so this immortality he will give if you go to God so prediction is asking about that can you please tell her then he says porridge she is telling I am curious to know why God took birth as a son of a sister Devaki and then killed his own mother's brother comes Devaki is a sister commissions the brother the God became son of the sister and then killed the brother the mother's brother maternal uncle why they are from the same family so this is the Christian protecting the sister and punishing the brother the modern mind also will say the same thing the question will come what is happening how it is possible God is seeking the sides how it is possible he is protecting the sister and killing the brother can this be here even the person like Arjuna we find he was confused he wore Juna was so close to Krishna every time he put together so close friends even then when the Arjuna sawed the hue you figure the guard the the Bishop Bishop rubra in one form the whole universe was there just right imagine when you frame so close to you just like you suddenly stand before you and you can see the Sun the Moon the planets and all stars in his body and everything all around everything in that one person how you will feel the aura Juna she was made many of us will see immediately fact no problem for us we won't see it the moment we'll see that but we traitor but Arjuna could at least look at that and he analyzed that and being his or Juna the person like Arjuna became very much afraid to see that the peoples are seeking from the teeth of the god they are going to die and he's old all this enemies that he was thinking he will kill they're all already dead and all the entering into his mouth the terrible form and verjus Nadine said autonomy over a group namaste Libre proceedeth Virginia spring when now Burton is not thinking as a friend they able para proceeded please be happy on me and come down I cannot look at this form of yours become each army Bob and Martin now he preys on Amitabha victim I'd like to know who you are I cannot stand you it's so difficult I cannot understand you you know there are many many people they were also confused about province around Tichenor and one person he was a great spiritual leader in those days and he went to Dhaka at the capital of Bangladesh present Bangladesh Sri Ramakrishna was in Calcutta - in Asia but he saw the sea ramakrishna is sitting by his side over there named Agra and he was wondering how it is possible how could he come here and sitting by my side not only there he caught hold of his hands on Krishna's hand and then Salama Christian slowly went away this man came back Vijay Krishna Goswami he was a great scholar and afterwards he formed the spiritual path the gachami Parivar they say this Vijay Krishna the Shamy he came back to the Shanaya and then he told to see Ramakrishna this time I touched you and you cannot deny it this thing happen Salameh krishna at the same time in so many different places when they say the krishna was dancing with the thousands of the Gopi knees then some people will laugh oh it is not possible but why not because all-powerful God can do anything sending out His image he said is true and same way the window or tuna is telling I am confused please tell me who are you I cannot understand you after living with the Krishna for such a long time so close frame and is advisor and their relief tips the Krishna but even then he said no I cannot understand you and this is also known as the avatar Maya minutiae means the avatar appearing as human but in reality God is unborn so Bhagwan Shankar Acharya he is explaining about it this is a very very difficult question in the philosophy how God can create this universe first secondly he has created that then he must have been exhausted but how he will create the material is he himself so may be that he is making out of his own this whole universe we can understand that but then they'll win no nothing will remain because he has exhausted himself in different names and forms is it true they said no Poornima da poornamidham poornaath poornam udacity from the pune if you take out punah punar remain so this is a very special mathematics the how God can do it then the realized soul felt that there is something like Maya illusion the power of God and it gives in such a way as if it is so true the my arm ownership the Maya minutia means he's creating the human form but it is completely illusion you do not know what truly tease now that human being can understand it how it is possible you cannot explain what is Maya you cannot give the definition of the Maya why because it is impossible but you can feel the effect of Maya you can understand the effect of mine some people when they are very thirsty when they are crossing the desert to see the Mirage many people they have seen there's a mirage and in America we found when the on the top of the road there is a restorer they calling me Raj maybe there may not be there but it is always there so this mean give the name there are because you are coming to the road you are hungry or thirsty okay the mirror edges here just take it turn and go and stop and so many shops are there so this Mirage but if you go over there you're thirsty and you see the water you see everything but when you reach over there nothing who saw the water you and then who experienced that nothing is there you how it happened then they say Mirage means the Maya and just like this it is the Maya and when you think that this will be wonderful so many times in our lives we think this is the best thing for my life I embrace that I accept that and they another time you know it did not this one not this one why in the beginning I was thinking this is the good then again after some time I think it is not why I thought in the beginning that it is good Maya every time it is happening Maya Maya Maya this is the way it happens in the ramayana we find Sri Ramachandra also he is mentioning but are some Ravana see her promise to mana Sheen to noon look at it promise you I entered into the form of a human being as a Rama Chandra why only with the purpose to punish the Robin ah but oh um Robin a steerer promise you I enter into the mother once Rama Krishna also many times he said enter into this body this moment we won't be able to understand that but we know from our lives experiences so many times in our lives it is all Maya and that's why with we happened suffering in accepting as the property and then we suffer Mayan so this Maya is observed about the birth of sedition we find in bhagavata the teen chapter first look taint book first chapter xxi loca it says brahma heard a message within his heart and then he communicated that to the dealers what is the message that he received from the supreme god the lord is going to be born as the son of Devaki and Vasudeva drama he is announcing this before the birth of the krishna that the lord is going to the art to take but as a human child of Devaki and Vasudeva our decision the another the powerful God will be gone as his elder brother rom Lord's own power Maya will perform the some prescribed duties what are those first to change the unborn baby from devaki's seventh child that unborn baby and to ro Heaney the second wife of the Vasudeva it is I'll see how things are happening the Krishna will be born but before that everything is said and the announcement is going out as we send out all our Flyers the police come over here things are going to happen and in this opportunity let me announce in the next Sunday they'll be very good singer is coming is a very good singer and am currently I won't be here because I have to go to Boston and Providence but he will come and even sing please come down with your frames and all the time per capita this song is good so you can come and enjoy the songs that he will come and we are announcing it all thing ready exactly the same way the brahmana is sending out the news to all the Devers get ready you do have to go down along with the God and all the celestial beings they should also go and be there to support the God so all this they became took the human form Krishna is coming down and his own power Maya this Maya has been turned as Oh Maya the yoga Maya Maha Maya Maya these are the three different words sometimes and the bush never Stacy Mahamaya is for the thumb triggers a - actives yoga Maya is ours only Maya for the Vedic team so deadly they say but the be daunting the only Maya and you know the Maha Maya is that the goddess Kali and Oh God there are also the power of God and for this Telugu Maya what is the yoga Maya he's an associate with God but performing all those things that God wants hard to do and what is their power of God this is little bit confusing the power of God how it can work separately than God from the God the power of God working separately why not the moment you go to any place in the world and you see the symbol of America and you go and show your passport I'm an American passport holder immediately the treatment that you will get the other zone you go to in Italy and I showed the passport American Transport come to this line this just directly you can go for others come over here seat over here open your bag so everything is going on wipers power who is the power that America the America is not present there how it is possible similarly the God's power is also present everywhere and can work on behalf of the God the God's power is working in that way that power is changing the foetus from the Democratic Rohini the seventh son was that the elder brother of Krishna and still it being became hirsute to birth as a daughter of Yashoda and the London then under was are not a king but a rich person had a very wonderful person so the nanda and yasoda they got this a daughter a baby child and here that daughter was the power of God herself on a minor yogamaya and the T then the Krishna told I mean the God told then you must apply your power to put all people to sleep because I have to go from the prison to the numbers house and they will bring you from the numbers house to they working you know that story the many of you will be knowing very interesting story this happened the exchange of power is God exchanging power truly know everything is happening as he wished and why the very peculiar thing the brother he was so happy when his sister was married and he himself was driving the chariot he was so happy driving a chariot was not a very another respectable profession but the brother told no it is my sister I should so Devo he was married with the the buso diva and come she was himself driving it was alright for suddenly do you pavani happened that means someone from The Haven told a the fool you were driving today your sisters and you are very happy you know her son will kill you someday immediately the person the concha he becomes so angry is it truly going to happen he was loving his sister so much but till that moment why because his own life was in trouble the announcement came and immediately he said why God announce that sometimes we feel why God had to announce that otherwise everything would be done but no God never does like that so this is the way he was announced he was known that she hard son is going to kill you and the eighth born son so before that son seven will be there the culture wanted to kill sister dinner dear the boy who never told why you're killing her not only she's your sisters is a lady and the person like even if you are killing a lady how people will think about you so you should not do that okay do we never the child is born I will send the child to you come sure okay no problem then his ministers they advised him you should not allow them to go we do not know consumers having complete faith in virtual table but she's ever never told any lies in his life but then they concur arrested they put them in the prison and a he was waiting for the newborn child and come sure when the baby was born the first baby and he was taken to come she comes you don't know no no I am NOT going to kill this baby I'd kill only the eighth one so you can keep the baby with you and naturally the father and the mother are very happy you know who came Narada he came and he was telling a day to come sure how you were counting from one to eight he may be different we also eight to one you do not know this some of his son will kill you and you are counting from one to eight it may be the other world anyway it is up to you I am just telling you this way why not as I said like that because he wanted to finish that chapter with the Commission was the tyrant as long as he will be surviving you will be torturing people and nothing can be there and moreover it will take for the God to come and dig birth and kill him so now they wanted to take God quickly back to heaven so he gave these advice to the come share and Commission was confused about the mathematics is it not I will kill all of them so he was going on killing you know the last one and he was transferred from the devil k2 Rohini he was safe and the eighth born child that was Krishna himself and what the first thing that the mother saw not Krishna but the Vishnu she saw the Vishnu and she was very much happy but at the same time she was worrying about the God what will happen to you God because the conscious per kill you you should not have gone to me the law he laughed and smiled and said no you need not worry about and this thing will happen slowly slowly when they saw they saw the door is open how it was open then his father the bar suitable carried the newborn child crossed the Yuna all people who are sleeping guards were sleeping no one could notice that the eighth born child is going away and then when it is to patear to Nanda's house he found it was all announced by the God that a girl child she is sleeping by the side of the mother replacing the boy over there took the girl child brought back as was asked so he came and gave that child the Commission Commissioner was wondering the announcement was a boy is her son will kill you now it is the girl but anyway is better not to take the chance so he wanted to kill that girl and she slipped and took the form of a divine lady and announced who you are thinking that you will be killing there a third child no I am not that the original ignorant child is somewhere and he is green now so here I have a question why he announced that otherwise we could save at least many of the inner sense life and come sure the ruthless fellow he window children the first of all new born one day born and not only that any child kill kill kill that happened same thing happened here also at the time of the Jesus the same thing happened so these are the happen and is very difficult to explain why the yogamaya had to announce otherwise at least innocent babies could be saved but the God's inscrutable way now the question is is it truly that innocent babies were killed no they were all gods and goddesses and they came down as the brahma announced brahma announced you have to go and you have to take birth along with the god so things will happen like these and the whole king miami not here they were also not original but when we look at things with oh my god why he should happen and sometimes some people had criticized the hinduism because of these terrible killing the innocent people and we become really emotional but not like that we understand in suitable way of God and His divine leela friends today we conclude over the very fine the exchange of sri krishna and his power yogamaya the god is giving the you go mining we are thinking that we are punishing God or breaking this and that only yogamaya you know swami vivekananda he was a he was a hillock he went to see that Shiva Bonnie there's a beautiful temple in the Kashmir the sheet Bhavani was having seven storied building why because of the yoga that the seventh the levels are there so on the top towards the mother that was the ancient time then a group of people came the Islamic in invasion came the Muslim the king they came they destroyed the whole temple when Swamiji when he found that they have kept that goddess inside the water of the well and he was telling if I was there at that time I would have fought with that king and stop him to break this one and if he was telling other people are also encouraged but that night he heard the mother is telling do you protect me or I protect you from then on I said no it is you it is you it is you friends that is also the thing sometimes we think that I must have to do but we must remember but some things are happening all around there may be some reason we cannot understand the reason that's why God wants Ramakrishna say you have come to understand the truth and life span is very small you dedicate your whole energy concentrate your mind to reach to that all around things whatever is happening don't bother about that the spiritual person should not involve in the social movements because it is completely two different things those who are feeling that we should go and we should protest we should fight they are separate they can but if you are thinking that in this life I must realize God thing your duty is completely different your focus will be to realize God and nothing else whatever's happening on the round and sometimes some people the educated people they come to become the monk monks ideologies completely different they do not go for anything of this world name fame property nothing that should be the idea but sometimes because of the Maya they will drag you and you are thinking I am doing this I am doing that it is not that so we have to understand I am trying to tell to my certain stand my cell and also to you that if you are sincerely trying to realize God and don't be carried away by all the things that is happening all around in the society this completely different thing our only goal will be as Bhagavan see Ramakrishna say only the concentration and God how it is possible first listening shadow Shankar then bechara discrimination then what all these things are happening is true and I must try to understand this but the leader of the god it is up to him I didn't bother about that but I know God is there and he is true and my concentration is only on God all things around it is happening whatever comes before me as a duty I perform but I am NOT going to be involved and the third complete faith and determination then whatever you want it is possible after realizing God whatever you'd like to do it is possible thank you in next class we will also try to understand some of the things about the God's incarnation and how it works because it is really really very interesting and very difficult to understand to and in the bhagavad-gita himself the Krishna himself is telling that it is all my Maya that is happening with my Maya until I will draw the you won't be able to know me I only can withdraw the Maya they know it is possible for you to understand me so our only thing that we can do through Chikara prayer prayer prayer oh please be gracious on us that we will do we will try to understand now let us chant this mantra and we conclude yeah balloony the group drama route soon indeed mr. baby the sanger but the drama furnishes a guy Andy Young Saeng novice Tita that the Catena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah yes young a pseudonym [Music] [Music]
