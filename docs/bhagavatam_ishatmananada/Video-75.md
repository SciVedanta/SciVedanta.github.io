discharge who Joker Shire now but the monarch solutions Mashhad harem governess attrition me shuhang Lakshmi condom gamma lion you died on Monday I am servile okay today's discussion are God's incarnations bound by karma is a very interesting topic and we know with the sage RB hora he completed his reply regarding the Karma then the very intelligent and enlightened King nimi he is asking this question but what are these incarnations can you please tell me about them the gods incarnations you know the Hinduism the main point is this incarnation reincarnation theory and along with the reincarnation comes the karma theory so because of the Karma because of the karmic result and this different type of bodies and vibes we are having and it goes on and on yesterday I went to a place and in the temple I was talking about the Karma and then in the question answer session all the questions are related to come on and it's so difficult to make people aware about it and they think why the God should do this why the God should do that so ultimate who is doing actually god history of course but when his dream for God because God has created this universe and God has created himself in different forms so the Karma and all those things which ever is going on is nothing but God's creation if you can understand that point and detached yourself then there is no problem and if you are not then you are always in that you have to go on searching for the result in every get desert one after another fallacies will come here he wants to know his question is very simple as a cannon please tell me about the incarnations of God God means the supreme god and you know in the Hindu tradition there are so many incarnations one after another I am NOT going to do to read those things and in different times when the evolution was coming up and different type away the God came to save these creation history he came in the form of a top twice he came in the form the bow he came in the form of a small little boy that is the brahmana bomber then slowly slowly the final and the perfect one Ramachandra so these revolutions we can understand how slowly the God is evolving his God evolving in that way you know because a time needed that type of thing when the time needed God to help it to lift it so naturally it was half the mostly water a little art the bore was the best so it is it was holding it and like this I am NOT going to go into that that yogi drew Mila she was going on giving the answer but he said it is impossible in the beginning of the answer he said it is impossible to narrate the qualities of God why infinite to infinite other qualities how a human being can explain that it is not possible but we should go to to understand what is this incarnations of God we are also ethology we are also incarnations but it's a result of our own karma all beings the human beings and all animals and the birds each and everything that we see including the stones and the trees believe it or not Hindus they believe this is because of the car Nevada and slowly once again we come to the point of the human being and again the human being if they are making the wrong actions we'll go back to that circle it goes on and on so someday I will give you the calculation that has been made in the Parana how many trillion billion million years all these things went on and on so this now let us go to the incarnation those who are very much interested to know about this incarnation I would suggest you better read Shami ceratin on the g's book which he has written about the introduction only we will do introduction the shamans are done and thus the great master before giving the biography describing the biography of sri ramakrishna cinema Krishna's the incarnation of God and if you have noticed in our dining hall there and it is written one who was Rama one who was Krishna in this time as the Ramakrishna so incarnation in different name and form in different times so it is you can say it is a Billy is a three or at the same time we can analyze also so this analysis even find in the introduction of the great master and Swami Chidananda ji he has translated that in a very simple American English that will also help you so things is first thing we have to understand the impious religion is based on the direct experience of God otherwise if you have not realized the God directly you have no right to speak about God you're following a path you are discussing about that is okay but unless and until you have realized god yourself you have no right to start a new path so that is and when one can completely free one's mind from the desire can fully withdraw mine from the same subjects and can concentrate mind of the Supreme Being that your focused mind realized the truth the one without the second what is the truth one without a second the arm challengeable unchangeable external and eternal all-pervading all-powerful existence now what is God it says in these leg words one without a second unchangeable and eternal all-pervading all-powerful existence so this is the concept of God and the be daunting the colleague Brahma constantly expanding all consciousness all over so that is Brahman would you realize that anyone can do that how first you have to free your mind from desires there should be no desire without any desire that is the first thing and a little desire even won't allow you to realize God so the first is completely free from desire and then fully we draw from the Saints objects the wind there is desire so obviously your sense of JYP's of no use so naturally let me draw it so you are completely withdrawing from the Saints objects and that you're and concentrated mind so this is the condition to realize God so this is the first thing what the when we are going to realize God the moment he will have this two completely free from desire completely withdrawn from your mind is withdrawn from the Saints objects and completely focused on God these are the three the moment anyone anywhere anytime will have this and what is this God all-pervading consciousness so this is fast these realized Souls are known as Rishi he means the seer of truth the rishi the sanskrit word means the seer of truth and what is the truth remember that the truth is unchangeable eternal all-pervading all-powerful consciousness there is a truth so in one word they say realized the truth and they call it Rishi also they called him after you said after wacha after or is this after realized soul and then sometimes it's a party guarding a deterrent means is it eaten with artery I realized God I have the authority to speak about God the teacher with the authority yes Khiladi God the one gentleman came and he was going on telling me about the balloon month I was in Palomar this is days that I couldn't say anything he was going on and he's so much I I liked it because he loved believe God and then what is our home so naturally I liked it but he was going on telling then I just told him in a funny way at will are you the otic re to speak about it did he was confused no I am not in the Air India the managing committee or anything unknown or dakari this adhi curry is one who has realized how he lived over there every day every moment all those experiences Odegard the chicory means is a authorized teacher without authority and another is Pro pretty lean Purusha that is the terminology that they have taken from chamku philosophy prakruti is the nature Meena he is an empowered with that nature and that is the pollution one who is having the complete control over the nature there's a probability lean pollution a free soul absorbed in the primordial nature property a free soul how do you know that they're realized Souls again then apparently you won't be able to understand because when they saw marks are the money they be heard Raghavan surround Tichenor the God himself he's walking on the Calcutta street and people they never cared about him and sometimes they were criticizing him so many things the teasers he came and this to true stone so in the last day they were throwing stones and Jesus can you imagine now millions and half of the world can say half of the world they are now leaning down before the person whom they were seeing in person and that week storms criticizing how unfortunate why knowledge so with at that time who if we had been in the time of Jesus God for me Jesus for me maybe that you got the one who were running a strong so how do you know it is the knowledge so how to know that these people have realized God because apparently it is impossible now through the careful study it has been noticed that in the course of time the rishis of the Voytek age came to be regarded as the polling age about ours and divine incarnation and this incarnations after realizing the transcendental reality they demonstrate extraordinary powers this is the one thing no one will be able to do that no one extraordinary power and we tell the one thing that many of you those who have read the biography of the roundest you know with the young boys 16 7 came here the years and the student of the university they came are in there now he was joking and he was having a lot of fun and criticizing Saddam hawkish Nizam additional told everything is nothing but the consciousness I saw the act and after hearing that he came and he was sitting with another person he was joking Oh even though the utensils they're not so hard Oh like that diversity then some Tichenor came and he touched him that's all hey what what fun what what you were talking about then he'd simply touched him three days and three nights this young boy he was in the realm of a toy tatiana a traitor knowledge anyone can do that it's impossible the really difficult they want gentlemen went to one of our senior army entered romney can you please touch your hand on my head he told why but i know you people are having the power so you can transform me you see if i was having that power i would have kept my hand all the time on my head it's not enough so he sees is not so ordinary people cannot of course we're good people of course we are religious people of course we have traveled in the path of religion but not being that where it is called Avatara this Avatara is completely different they can't do anything tremendous power will come to the another the incidents in the life of and Serrano fish naw he could do anything so after realizing the transcendental reality did demonstrate extraordinary power how to understand these people they are realized soon Avatara extraordinary power meaning power Liberia as because anyone practicing meditation concentrating having little power on the nature they can something they can do an extraordinary power so that they are selling and how the this Rishi's they became Avatara because slowly slowly those Rishi's they were also having this tremendous power extraordinary power they could do anything if you remember when the Ramachandra his father they were not having the issues the children so he was thinking what will happen to me the naturally father and mother so ultimately they invited some Rishi's to perform the young chaos and in the yukti all this thing happened and they came and get the porridge and then that was distributed and Lord Vishnu himself appeared in the form of Rama Chandra lakshmana bharatha and shatrugna like that it is possible why not so this through the power but who can do it not everyone ABC cannot do only the Rishi's can do any time if they do because they tremendous power divine power this is a there one lady started visiting the Ramakrishna praying my husband is not looking after the house or he is just drinking fighting with others is very difficult to control what to do and order in the modern times they're simply not they won't come to the holy man they will go to the court that's all my husband is not as political but in those days there naturally they wanted to so he came to see ROM teach the cannulas L say I don't know I am NOT going to do you better go to the ladies dating over there living over there so she went to Ma da Dada Moni daily mother with humbleness no no no no afterwards seeing the so much eagerness the she gave only one flower and bindhi and told carried simple one flower and in one game he carried everything all right that man changed knitting is it so easy simply a person completely changed change the new mahaprabhu there are two terrible people they were there too broad july and matt i prefeer created like jagai madhai and chaitanya mahaprabhu somehow they got the blessings of joy enema from completely transformed completely hungry-man one person who's to kill the people and cut the finger to keep the count how many people have cleared the imagine they the Lord Buddha came talked with him it completely transformed so this is the tremendous power and Lord Jesus he went to a village and he found that people are crying what happened that they have they have so someone is killed someone is date and they wanted that man to come back to life Jesus called him simply from outside the keyway come back and he came into life so this is called Rishi's who afterwards came to be known as avatar so these avatars are the Rishi's are the problem Purusha are the Adhikari are the afters they are having this tremendous power now sage kapila the founder of the Shanta philosophy who did not accept the existence of God acknowledged the existence of the Rishi's he didn't accept the existence of God Kapila but accepted the Rishi's now I will read one passage when in the Shanker philosophy that giving the introduction about this Rishi's in sumter philosophy we find I quote in dude with the oddity you remember this endowed with purity self-control other divine qualities and capable of attaining the full illumination those great Souls keep in their minds an intense desire to benefit humanity our discussion is the whether the incarnation bound by karma or not now these people though they are completely free but in their mind there is a strong desire to help the humanity this Rishi's for this reason they cannot even for a moment march into the infinite glorious earth they want no they if they want they are not the Rishi's ordinary ordinary people that saw once in hama krishna saying that the ordinary people after a lot of practices even if they get the realization of the self they will survive only for twenty-one days to think whether you like to realize God and on only twenty-one days so the moment you realize that oneness you don't see to so obviously who is going to keep tip the body thinking about the mind body and all the maintenance and nothing so they constantly enjoy that wonderful please and then after 21 days they could dry leaf the fall but this productive in Busia this receives these avocados they have the tremendous desire but to control themselves and do not march into death for this reason they cannot even for the moment margin the infinite glories of the self but by the power of the desire they become United with all powerful property and experience our powers Astaire's productively impure shankha the same they don't say the reach the same protein lean a Purusha and what are these they're having the tremendous power as the patisserie now remember in the Mahabharata or Juna he promised that if I cannot kill this king Geritol today before the sunset I am going to kill myself I'm going to commit suicide you know this the people like to do like that so they had the tremendous confidence that I am going to kill because Jarrett was the main person who killed his son but anyway now we find these but problem giant rota and he declared if I cannot kill him I'm going to kill myself so naturally the upper opponent they Toki now this is an opportunity they guarded that charity in such a way it became almost impossible to reach to your death now in the evening if it comes then Arjuna will have to commit suicide so the krishna came over there in the scene and looking don't worry and what he did he made that day into night the whole world saw who suddenly became evening and naturally jayadratha was very happy and he came out from that from that they called the cover he came out to see how or Jinnah is going to commit suicide he was very happy immediately the Krishna removed the darkness from the face of the Sun again this oh my god this is the mid day and people will wonder all know this is not possible why not it is possible you remember the Krishna when the drew for the US bring through Buddha all the time taking the help of Krishna the Draupadi he was crying because that they were taking out all the cloth and there was no one to help Drupada pray to Krishna and the flow of cloth continuously they could not complete that this is the power of the nature avatar can do ordinary people and again the true pootie was in problem because thousands of the brahmanas they came too hard and asked for the food and there was nothing left in her kitchen and Krishna came and told give me at least one just one piece of rice and then and he ate and doll oh let everybody who satisfied everybody got satisfied how it was possible because of this thus equipped with the six divine power knowledge strained lordship power and fertility and splendor they do good for Humanity in various ways for a cycle and finally march into death so these are the avocadoes the doctrine of the avatar furnished in Pirani age a florist in Quranic age having his route into the Vedic age the scripture like sweetie and purana say an avatar like god is by nature eternally pure illumined and free so who can be called as an avatar anyone that because we like someone that is an Avatara i would rather know it's not so easy so this is the way the wind the Hindus they say he's an avatar nowadays of course who is going to check those who say they don't know about whom they say he also doesn't know and those who reasons they also don't know so no problem but traditionally if you have to say the avatars Ramakrishna avatar abolished I shall give agency do you think he was not challenged of course he was challenged so this doctrine the Avatara that it actually the avatar the world it came in the purana and before that in the Vedic and it was the Rishi's and scriptures like the splitty and purana and avatar is a eternal pure now friends do you know that what is the purity and not having any connection any desire for this worldly objects that is purity as because I am not having that ego in me I don't have not having any desire for this worldly things now I will request you to go through the bank Rafi of Salama Tichenor even fine he steps he was completely free from the desire now his mother and elder brother told that you are a Brahmin boy and our profession is to go and perform worship in different household and to India give are some money by that way we survive you must learn this puja the pramana that is there we are already he too refined huija I'd love to just but not to our money Charlie Cola gotta be - Ivana Charlie Cola the rice and an another whenever Delta puja there'll be some rice and bananas in the offer and natural after the puja the Brahmins they with the Pujari's he will collect all those and make it back and go so it will no you cannot we should not so this is what they say so this is the way see Ramakrishna she must not at all attached to it the worldly things so from the beginning they are pure the purity doesn't mean that they are only eating this this thing and all drinking this way now purity is only the desire desire for the worldly things so they are completely for you you don't mean why how it is possible when saddam krishna was not having any money he used to are only eight two rupees as a wage to work as a pooja d and theirs to pay eight rupees and he was having a wife and the family and all that he never trusted money he's to us go and keep that money and spain eight rupees of course a true breeze was sufficient in those days at that time one person wanted to give him ten thousand rupees think of it a group is a man he is getting the salary ten thousand rupees and he drove him out how it is possible that you were offering this now I am NOT going to take it and the joining the the landlord the motor table who was looking after him and respect him in so much he wanted to give a big plot of land and it really got to bother anything people will be there they will cultivate but you will get the money for you maintain suppose I die what will after in imbecilic krishna told after so many years living with me you understood me in this way go away from here so this is called no desire at all this is called the avatar from his birth taboo Torah is self-contained it from his birth the avatar is self country and Avatar never forgives his previous births that this is another thing so avatar is a power of God manifesting now what is the special qualities in them can we not call ourself Abu Dharr if you have these qualities first no desire for the worldly things second tremendous control power over nature and tired remembering your past birds also good remember five hundred birds can imagine and other once Adama Tichenor saw two brothers and immediately they were very young in those days 1718 maximum when they saw immediately told oh you were in the group of Jesus Christ I saw you two in the group of Jesus Christ can you imagine and this Swami Rama brahmana and the G about him he said he was a limit of Krishna say Ramakrishna's if there is nothing as we can remember oh I saw you there the medicine I can like that he's going on telling so he said he saw them as if nothing so that is the power serum Krishna he could say anything about our people Krishna also said because his very close brain or tuna was confused when he was telling I instructed all these new girls to the Vikash one you know how come the eruption is much older than you how it is possible you to teach him you are young almost like my age then this famous local and it is in the bhagavad-gita fourth chapter 50 verse it says Bhoomi me batty tonnage and moneta Bachar Gina Tana jambe the ceremony not to impede the parantha BA parantha / Juna you don't know you don't understand you don't remember but I remember each and everything every time what happened but who knew me batty darling many many times I took birth and now this is the question that is naturally the people hope how it is possible it is possible only thing you cannot understand this because your mind is not prepared so this is them then some people even ask my father has passed away really come back again in our family will he take birth again of course because unless and until you are completely free from desire he gently episode will take birth but I do not know whether it will be in your family or not friends I will take him tell you the small story recently I read very interesting story of the carnival ah so one very another spiritually enlightened monk he was travelling and he reached a village and over there and no one was helping him he was hungry but no one was helping him they everybody told we are all war we cannot share our food and he went to ultimately a very poor person is a small shop owner he was there he went to him he just sacked to eat and he told see I'm very hungry can you please get that food to me the brahmana he say they dismantle okay no problem because you will be travelling you need some food I am also not having food but no problem I can make so he gave his food then this brahmana told so I am having some power I can give a liberation do you want liberation like to go to Krishna in the heaven and he told oh yes I can't the heaven is a wonderful place I think go to heaven so he was very much interested then the parabola - okay come right now I will send you to heaven he said no no not now because I have two little cubes I have to help them to grow up when they grow up and they can understand the whole business and can help themselves demon will come along with you he said okay after 10 years oh yes after 10 years I think they will be alright again after 10 years the monk came because he gave the world to him he came and he told so no no no no show me I cannot go now I have to give a please give me I know Hemant another 10 years because these two one is the drunkard another is good-for-nothing so I have to somehow stablish them and then you see as a father I have to take care of them well okay another ten years and then second time again came after ten years then that man told see I am going to die and at this moment I don't like to leave these people the last moment they won't be able to control so I am just seize it you know you understand we're not going to person before that you come and take me so the last thing that I like to help them again after two-three years he came back and he saw the father has passed away and these two boys they are crying etc etcetera then he took what happened the where is the father you know where the suddenly looked I saw there is a pool he's going on working and he saw in his through that he understood the act was the father he has taken birth as a pool to help these two sons in that family again so he went to the pool until why no no I have to help them please help me so that when I die I get liberation before my death please come but before that let me have this boys again the Dashami came back to keep his words see the carnival ah so much of attachment for the family so he died as a human being and took the form of a bull and he was going on helping them then I again he came after 10 years in the meantime he also became very old Swami and he saw the bull and also died by devote that this two boys they told you are the culprit the moment you visited my father passed away then again he visited our bull passed away now again you have come because your presence is bringing all that woman's to our family so we should beat you ok ok you can with me but before that you go inside the place where he used to lie down your father and mother where these two light down deep that he will find lot of wealth go and see and he was standing this - boy immediately jumped over there and dug and around oh my god a snake is over there and it was protecting something so they came out and told this is name only snake is there nothing now under the same you go and kill the snake and you will find all the world he looked at their Singh became that man in the form of the snake and he was protecting all the wealth that he was hiding over there he buried all the wealth and they over there and thus finally there the Rishi told the mom told the snake at least now you can't laugh at me I give you the word because you gave me the food so I want to send you to heaven not that you have any right or any quality but still I'll because I gave you the world do that but how at least forget about this - I don't know what answer the sneaky but these two wires the killer snake got lot of L they were very happy and the Rishi took the snake and made it free with etc this is the story the the main thing the moral of the story is attachment attachment and suffering whether my father will come or not if you are attached you are surely you're going to born in that so we have to be very very careful when you are completely free from attachment you get this wonderful the life now friends I will like I like to bring to your notice a a wonderful idea I don't know it is not very much well known that his idea of Bodhisattva you must have heard this petition to idea around in the earth Allah the petition that you know immediately from the name is there our good today that that is the Buddhist philosophy the booty Shotter idea this potential to idea we all know the Lord Buddha he was known as the Bodhisattva what is this petition to he seems of wisdom Bodhi softwa the essence of wisdom at the spiritual each stage the realized one field that he is standing the threshold of spiritual and world buddy shelter that is a conception a person when he did risk to that stage he stands between the material and the spiritual world in the life of a grantee Ramakrishna if you read he will come across a word called ba-ba-boom ba-ba-boom Cambodia Torah the same the petition 12 after attaining the petition to hood one become pure wise charming gentle serene compassionate and same sight yet so these are the good qualities so what is spirituality what is realization nothing but good qualities if you can if we can have those good qualities and that is called the God realization the Buddha's of the world there are trained practices to attain this petition stage begins with the Donna parameter and a parameter means extreme in this in the Buddhist philosophy they use the word parameter the parameter means extreme Donna parameter you have to give in charity extreme charity the Shamy be written in one place is telling but the yield good is our but right then he says doubt ow Felina hijab give give but never asked anything in return Taotao fidelity job so this is the first between the first step is this and then it goes on in the last the thing is the Avatar concept of the Hindus is attained steps are there and after practicing I'm not going through that after practicing those things when you reach to that bodies of the wood is seen as the power tada the body shifts to feel that one cannot enjoy eternal bliss while other beings suffer because there is no difference between them and the realized one so this is the main special the padishah turn he never goes for his own personal realization Oh enough is enough I have realized car I know everything now let me now die they would never do that so Bhuta shuddhi is so compassionate for the others you know we know that the carbon ceramic richness discipled Shami be vacant and the when he was young the ceramic is not steam the good works the disciple what you want he said miracle commodity that is the idea stage the neat little commodity we doubt the help of anything I want to concentrate my mind on the truth and then sometimes I will come up and eat something to maintain my body again like to go down instead of being happy the master rebuked him I thought that even become like a big banyan tree so many people will come under you too the have solace joy inspiration you are so selfish want to get the liberation for yourself booty Shotter world there are Krishna was introducing the booty shut the hood and we'll come to Robert again over the air and this body should the worst this is the point I wanted to explain body shut the works in session tree for the spiritual equipment of all human being without attachment the booty shotter he'll be constantly working with the hot any attachment for the liberation for the enlightenment of the people same idea we came here from sri krishna the avatar 'god in the Gita 3rd chapter 22 verse nummy part a sticker tapetum three shoe location in general non about Dhamma Bob debian birthday he bought Germany he is telling I don't have any duty cut the because the Burmese do I have nothing to gain and nothing that I have not gained I have nothing to gain in this world as because I'm having everything so why so therefore I work insatiably the question was rated avocados they also take the human form they also work whether they are also bound by the result of the work that they have done and what type of work wrong gender killed the Ravana not only Ravana the whole Rock Shooter that rest completely destroyed and Krishna again also killed and had this type of karma they have done at the bound by that this is the question friends I will again quote from the Bhagavad Gita the second chapter 48 verse yoga's guru karmani why I mentioned the chapter and the verse so that if you are interested you can go and open and can read thoroughly yoga guru karmani Sangam tetra dhanunjay our city our system some would twelve Somerton you go Chetty what is the yoga Samadhi a guru karmani yoga guru karmani this is the teaching keep the mind always connected with God and perform all actions sometimes we go to different places to give the tour do you think we go as a fund that we are going over there and very nicely there or they are also feeding know the main purpose is to take this knowledge to them they are good people intelligent people established people and socially respected people but somehow they are not very much aware of the spirituality not that they are not doing anything if you go in almost every houses there having small small shrines and every day morning and evening they will be burning incense sticks but still not knowing the secret and it means again and again taking birth and suffering and knowing the truth won't it go to help them it is exactly what shall make me waken the same you must do that yoga's guru karmani keep the mind always connected with God how it is possible it in the name of God that's why the deeksha the initiation constantly if you practice the ones Ramakrishna is doing if you practice as you are having the that to take you some pain you will feel all the time but at the same time you are working you are driving if you are doing everything I need to go on god forbid you should not have the to day it's so painful and you will never be able to forget it and similarly you have to practice in such a way just go on remembering God God God and doing everything the sweeping cooking driving office work whatever you are doing maybe sometimes you were going to the battle brothers and picking up the things mm-hmm whatever you were doing and then go on remembering the God element the god whatever so that is the teaching and I will conclude with this you was the Guru karmani Sangam that was an enjoyer and whatever we're doing do and completely forget about it don't remember it who I cooked for you and these way they know not like they just forget about it and Sita a sister some udoit sometimes even a very good cook and someday you cooked but you forgot to give the sword to mix the sword and all people who we cannot that's okay something may happen so take it similarly don't be agitated Oh see I felt them so many times and only one day I forgot and now they are criticizing me I will never invite them again so not like that it should be that summer is all simple so that is called spirituality see friends why I'm coming and concluding over here because in our life all through your trying to develop spirituality and what is that spirituality this is spirituality working everything doing everything in all functions only detest your mind from that that's all so this is is improvin remark Ramakrishna he rebuked his son the disciple Vivekananda and we began and again when he became guru he said he wanted his disciple that they should become the producer 12 they should become the participa he gave initiation to a british lady margaret noble and kept her mainly visited sustainability' and a very famous and then after giving the initiation into the Hindu way he said go in the way of Buddha to get it go as the Buddha traveled and by following the Karma Yoga prescribed by shauna Vivekananda thus parent of spiritual seekers can also get the liberation and freedom from the bondage and today our question was whether the incarnations get bound because of their worth no the answer is the incarnations are not bound for their work whatever may be the work why because they are not attached that just by that way they are completely free and how come they are not attached because they're illumined what is the illumination the God is everything but what should I do this moment swadharma who this man is suffering because of his karma had nothing to do no we must go and help that man maybe that I know that it is suffering for his own God maybe that is up to him and God but for me I should go and see God in him suffering can I do away with my god is suffering need some food need some help so this should be mine Dharma then today's teaching is steps and in the next Sunday that we know class because they'll be the retreat I don't know if you have
