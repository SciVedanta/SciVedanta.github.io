[Bhagavatam 070 : "They asked God, 'Who are you ?'"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNH82RCCc6s)

Oh Santa Karim puja gosh Onam but the manam sireesha vishwa harem Goggin Assad regime me Burnham shuhang Lakshmi contem Kamala jnanam you give he Hanukkah Miam Bundy Babycham Probab hiya harem sarivola good morning devotees frames today the Sunday morning and our discourse is on the bhagavatam and to this subject is very unique a group of Rishi's we will come in details to that the arcs the supreme guard the Brahmin who are you on the basis of that the whole discussion will be to increase the sattva one should accept everything shattuck the last those who are following the class regularly you know the last time we were discussing that everything that we see is the combination of three qualities the good middle and the bat thus Attica rajasic and tamasic ah I am translating the rajasic as middle because it is bad it is good mixture and mainly is very active now this step by step we have to go majority of us majority of us we are more shall Raja seeker a little shot tiga very very little Thomas Iike Thomas seeker people are very few and we don't talk about them they are in their own way God will take care of them but it is weed our Jessica we have the ego at the same time we have to desire to get the realization of the God this article and I Jessica mixed up now we heard that the God is telling you have to increase this article and then you have to overcome this attica - but let us be Satya first and thus attica is the quality of the Maya and to overcome the Maya we have to utilize this quality of the Maya this is very simple way but difficult to do why because we are in the spell of the Maya as all of us we are thinking oh this is correct this is incorrect this is all right this is not right each and every one why we think in that way and not only that at the same time we point our finger to others and say they are not doing correctly they are bad people they will never go to heaven all we take decision the if we take the decision who will go to heaven and we will go to hell then you are the god why you are worshipping God rather ask people to worship you we don't understand this why again the coverage of the Maya so this is a very peculiar situation and very very critical situation and that's why they say in the bhagavad-gita sri krishna's telling ma Luciana sastra issue cost Rita that is it a and millions and millions only a few handful me they tried to for the realization of God of that small group only a small percentage will get the liberation is very difficult in the bird and also they say Suresh Shannara cheated rehtaeh do gumpa tested caballo Vedanti in the Rishi's the seers those who have tried this part this is the copy they said it is like walking on the razor's age so difficult and how long I have to walk mashita rehtaeh nobody knows how long we have to walk so this is the patience do we have to have but a good thing is there is an opportunity and there is an end of it and some people have got the success so why not we I'll also get the success so that with that and how to get the success success to go beyond Maya what is Maya combination of three gunas and two powers what is the first power covering second power and it covering the truth superimposing the untruth on that and presenting that that is the right thing this is the power of Maya I am thinking this body is eternal but at the back of my mind I know that it is not but majority of the time most of my time I like to forget that I'm going to die this is Maya no one wants to die though it is obvious each and everyone anything that is created is going to be destroyed obvious but still we cry still we try still we do so many things so this is because of the Maya we should try to survive no doubt we should be healthy happy no doubt but that based on the body and the mind we must know that it's not permanent we will come to that God over here also is teaching that now our main question we are in the sway of the Maya mine is having to power and three qualities what are the three qualities SWOT - Raja and Tama these three qualities Tama the lowest one all the time jealous and very ferocious type person very very selfish selfishness is there in every one of us but that selfishness comparing with that is unthinkable they cannot think of anything else but themselves this is we forget that now Roger we have the ego we have the energy to do something but against that we want the appreciation we want a certification we want the clappings okay and then finally sat Toa so we are in Raja 80% Raja 20% sattva we have to increase the shot to a to 90% 100% then only we can overcome how - then it says like this the shorter quality generates love devotion to God truthfulness compassion for others etc the how I will know that I am becoming static this first is love love we are having but it is selfish love I love only my key tank in my family my nation my linguistic group my religion no you have to go beyond all those barriers that is the love the first is that again and again we should try and that is the reason nowadays and most of the places they are trying to do the inter-religious a discussion dialogue to develop to understanding so the love will generate the head rate will go and we are also understanding because of the advancement of the technology we can see what is happening in Africa in Asia in other parts of the world and they feel pity for them oh my god the small little baby suffering we have to help them but from it come knowledge they're also just like us to the love is developing and that we devotion to God what is the devotion to God understanding that there is something and that is powerful whether I call it as God or Jehovah or Buddha or vagabond whatever Allah is not no problem you can call in any name but there is something which is very powerful and that is beyond all this thing that conception I don't have not realized I am only believing why because the best people of this world the best minds of this world they've accepted that so believing on them just said Dada on the words of the scripture and also the words of the guru so they said that they should believe I will believe that is called the faith in God and the love slowly slowly praying to God going to yesterday one young lady came and then I told do you go to the shrine she told no I took from tomorrow will you please go the moment you get up in the morning go to the shrine whether you believe it or not whether God is there or not just as I am Telling go and pray to God God have mercy on me please bless me just work that much the beginning and I'm sure she will understand slowly the presence of God and then we will understand at least intellectually the presence of God and then finally by the blessings of God we will realize the truth and then we can turn towards the world and see Cygnet Vichy I'm Ritesh saputra ha ah read harmony be honest to me da hominem pollution mahanta m-- addictive Arnhem tomisaburo start beyond the darkness I have realized being a self which is the glorious and Illumina illuminated by his own this way the realization comes so what is SATA kikuna love love without selfishness then the faith in the existence of God and love for God devotion and then truthfulness this truthfulness those who have born in a free country he will notice that they are very truthful because they are not afraid that young lady yesterday she didn't try to hide and she was not ashamed also she told I don't have the belief in God nothing wrong in it so this truthfulness and never any hypocrisy I think in the mind is something I say something epic crazy for the hypocrite no chance to realize God that's where amoeba condensate I can stand everything but hypocrisy what I am NOT I like to present that that is the hypocrisy so thus truthfulness then compassion for all beings compassion for all beings the love for all beings understanding that their problems this is called Satya guna in small there's a big list of the Sapta guna in the bhagavad-gita now how to achieve it [Music] the Dharma that is the righteousness the from these comes the made it come from righteousness the win we are practicing truthfulness compassion love the very good thing that we are doing so these are the merits and from it comes the righteousness that is the Dharma and from the Dharma the conception of me and mine that goes away so what is a Dharma ego what is seen any action through ego so we talk about seen tons and tons we are going on telling seen scenes what is seen anything that we do from the ego stick from the ego that's all you do is take action so obviously we have to understand oh this is from the ego I am NOT doing it from the love so this is Raja chic the Raja chic karma that is all right but it is not going to help me to realize God I will do the same action but with the dedication the God you have given me the opportunity to serve I am serving a very small little thing that I am doing please accept my service as your worship so the same thing you are turning because of the conception so me and mine goes away that means Omkara the ego goes away and then from the gross and the subtle physically now the gross thing from there Tom Cara will go away and at the same time from the mind which is circled and which is very powerful which is the storehouse of all our karma it is also getting clear clear and clear and finally the knowledge will dawn this this is the way boggles ramakrishna very nicely he explained there was a very very poor farmer and the rich king he wanted to visit him farmer was that you know what to do the small heart so dirty there is not a single chair to offer to the king to see it what I will do what I will do then slowly people noticed the Kings people are coming officials are coming they are making the room big and they nicely make everything then the the chair for the king proper chair the throne we can say came then the carpet was there then finally the Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna stealing when the Hubble bubble that the King used to smoke that reached everyone understood there is not much time for the King to come let me everything is ready what are all these cleaning of the mind how I am cleaning through love through faith in God to truthfulness through compassion when all those things more and more is coming within me that means that it is time the God will reveal within my heart I should be very careful I should not waste my time what I should do that is also guidance that giving it is the advice that one who wants to realize God should read only holy scriptures that scripture that will help him with only Holy Scripture a person who is of devotional temperament if he goes on reading the austere bucker Samhita and all those type of books then he won't be able to accept those teachings and won't be able to fall these those teachings no you should understand what is your temperament and then you should read those books and read the biographies of the holy people you get the inspiration how they were very ordinary and from there how slowly slowly they became the great personalities that is fair the balloon Mart they have a big list for the young people who are joining the novices there's a big list these are the things that you should read why the organized way the slowly making a name maybe the 100 young boys have come so they are practicing early morning you should get up go and sit in the shrine meditate do the cleaning work do this work do that work and when you are doing it you are making the mistake and the simiiar people will make you understand that and the ego is going away so to preparation for the ultimate goal that is God realization he's not in one day it cannot happen like that and when you look at the Ramana Maharshi the personality like that he have done completed all there suddenly in the previous birth that's why in the beginning itself they are so pure and if we just behave like that it will be a great mistake and Swami we become the state follow what I say and don't follow what I am doing who was Vivekananda seeing that young man Raghavan see Ramakrishna stood up and welcomed him he's an ordinary person he is one of the subterra she he was the Shiva himself how can you compare and he's cubing the pawn and he is going doing these these dad if we follow that that will be a mistake he's not an ordinary soul but what he is telling instructing that we should follow the similarly we should read the Holy Scripture drink it says like this only water pure water nay wine why because when we drink the wine we lose control over our mind that is the reason those who are drinking is very difficult for them to concentrate their mind it's very difficult for them to practice the spirituality the drinking and meditation cannot go together but some people they enjoy both their thinking they are meditating actually going in slumber because of the effect of the wine so it says the drink only pure water and not wine have the company of holy and good people not bad people the company of holy and good people how can you know that the holy person unselfish person he is dedicated to some good ideas and he's trying to practice that there's a good people they are good people so you can go you can talk to them and our the the teacher who recorded the conversation of ceramic is no master Marche after the passing away of the ceramic isne when slowly all the guru wise guru wise means the brother disciple of all the disciples of the ramakrishna they were practicing tremendous austerity and slowly swami vivekananda with the help of two american ladies but purchased the plot of land the balloon mart and slowly those monks are staying over there practicing spirituality master MA chère died that time used to stay in Calcutta and luckily they're the descendants they have given that house to Ramakrishna mission it is now a Ramakrishna mission Ostrom it's really small but that that is a historical the small room he said meditated and wrote all those things so this master masha used to tell the young people wish to visit him go to balloon art and have the holy company of the monks but not in the daytime why didn't they are all working in those days days to work in the garden and then taking care of the cows and doing these doing that cooking everything this to do themselves they don't go even today if you go it has become very modern all the Swami's they are sitting in the offices because of the all worldwide and we don't have the paid people majority they're monks and Brahma cherries they are taking care all the work so if you go at that time how they can discuss with you with us about the spirituality and you find that they are cutting jokes with each other just like all our fish is going on so you know this is the monks you will lose the faith that's why master mush I used to advise you should go in the evening time in the early morning time and if you go in the early morning you will find that all the sitting and they are chanting the Virgin meditating not talking to each other and they are going walking all these holy temples all around in the balloon mud compound campers follow them you will learn you will get the blessings so that is the moment the company of the holy man means you have to happen when you come suppose here anyone can come talk to us but if you discuss about the present day the world what is going on naturally we will also feel that you want to discuss about that but if you are asking some genuine spiritual questions we'll be happy to answer according to our understanding and knowledge so that is called holy company have the company of the holy and good people not bad leaving quiet and clean places not in a market place or the place where they play the game neighbor why the marketplace means completely different environment the people are trying to get extra money from the customers and customers are also thinking how to get the best the thing from that is the place is not good for meditation it should be a quiet and clean place the cleanliness this is also very very important meditate in the morning and evening when the sunrise and the sunset that is the best time and another time it is mentioning there is the noon time one should meditate at the time noon time perform those actions which do not harm anyone the actions the activities performed those actions which do not harm anyone take spiritual initiation from holy guru without the initiation it is very difficult difficult to make the progress but the majority of the time people they think today I should practice meditation and the next day it isn't one day he will take the name of God whatever name they think and they will go on after some day they will get non get the interest they will changed that mantra the the flittering your energy is fleeting you cannot concentrate but when you accept a guru and a good good person and we will give you the proper direction and the name of the God you it is channelized whole energy is coming to that so that is called take the initiation spiritual initiation from the guru and practice japa taking the name of God regularly this taking the name of God this has a tremendous power though apparently we don't believe we don't we don't feel Oh going on repeating the name of God but you don't believe how strong it is that's why is a tradition of the 10,000 years the one thing all the time they say japa japa Hajipur take the name of God constantly within your heart the ticking the name of God is very powerful and if you have noticed that almost all the religions their differing in many other things but all have introduced among their faithfuls of followers the main mantra japa the Muslims will also they'll find the Sufi people they are counting the name of God the Christians are also taking the name of God Buddhists are also taking the same thing not God but money but may home and Hindus so many gods and goddesses different names but mantra that is do those activities that purify your mind do those activities that purify your mind what is that visiting holy places pilgrimage and doing charity when you find some people if you give them some food or clothing or helping them with the money so that is called charity now in India the bring all the people are suffering because of that tremendous type cyclone came and we won't believe that a morsel of food is not there no home nothing is there how they're surviving and even today are too needy bur waste of water that with the bamboos they have made some high places living on that the open sky if it is raining with that they are surviving a little money if we send to them that will be great so hundred dollar is nothing if we give the 100 dollar for them am I really losing anything but 100 people are 10,000 people if they are giving $100 the whole village can be reconstructed this is nothing but you don't think about that when we suffer we always expect that everybody should come to help me when somebody is suffering we don't feel that is why charity Jacques art the Dhanam again in all religion why they've introduced this because you become unselfish you become compassionate and by that way you are developing Satta guna just that feeling for others then people will be asking question is this money going to be properly utilized how much money you are giving $50 $100 properly utilized who are you to ask that question so this is the foolishness the one should be open minded and you of course you see that money is going the proper but sometimes I feel because I was there I see sada the suffering of the people before me and the helplessness so naturally when little donation that you give and take the hundred questions the these are the thing we is going to spend where it is going how much that is that is not way that is not Dhanam have the faith and with great humbleness you donate charity going visiting the holy places and taking the snaps and taking the selfie that is not pretty much pilgrimage means read about that place what happened over there all the incidents that happened over that particular place and then go and remember remember remember if you go to Baylor Mott the moment you enter you will feel oh this is the plan where Shami be waken under walked Brahman and the G walked mother came from this side hundreds of people for large hundred years they're meditating so naturally the environment is so pure I should imbibe it I should try to meditate her over here and dear the holy Ganga is flowing so I should look at the Ganga and if possible go and touch the Ganga make myself holy the at least half an hour one hour two hours in the holy place invite the holiness that is called pleased image the charity service directly doing something and also chanting and budgin by this way we can move or we can eradicate the Thomas occur and rajasic equalities and can increase our Stratego trains that is only the place from where we should prepare ourselves to plunge into the spirituality the swatter guna cannot take us to that goal Raghavan Sudama Krishna told the story you must many of you have braids and you know that one man was caught by three dacoit in a jungle and after looting the one person one dacoit said oh now it is over kill him this is a thomas iike man the second dacoit said why to kill unnecessarily ordinary person will bind him in this over here and go and it is his luck if you can survive because all the animals are there the Tigers are there if he can survive let him survive or if he died let him die so they left then after some time the third dacoit came back and he opened all the Rope and made him free and told brother that is your village go through this way he took him in the age of that the jungle and showed him across this field that is you village go over there this man then told oh he was such a nice person why don't you come along with me and stay with me then he said I am also a dacoit so I cannot go the police will arrest me you better go by telling the story the Ramakrishnan is mentioning the thomas iike guna they are very ruthless Roger sticker that is in between but the SWAT teacher can take you to the border but not inside the house to go inside the house you have to leave the sock tick equality also so that now we will enter into having these hearing these words the would double arcs through Krishna now bhagavata the 11th 13 and 9 now you know the skanda attire and the sloka the 11 13 and 9 and the english book that some their people are following that is 8th chapter 8 verse and bhagavata also 8 after hearing these words would double acts 3 Krishna why people knowing all these do not practice to develop such toka letís why they behave like animals in reply the Sri Krishna the Lord said it is because of ego the ego generates Raja quality raju generates desire desires dragged people to bind with worldliness result suffering but everything is not green then the Lord said there are chances what is that then bhagavata 11 13 12 verse it says Raja Tom opium yet o P withdrawn big ship te puna ha attend Rita mana Union dosha Drishti nos a jetty those should rest in acid jetty all do not sway away by the trauma Sir Roger know some people are dear they have the discriminative capacity with that that faculty discriminative faculty what they do they are alert about the evils they concentrate their minds and do not get disturbed with the worldly attractions Roger Tomic p.m. had Opie though there are there are Roger and Tama we do on a big ship deepen aha there are be drawn intelligent people they understand what is happening what are the differences this man is thomas iike maybe he is my brother maybe he is my very close I should avoid otherwise those qualities will enter into me if I'm having the company of a bad guy then if I am going somewhere if he has done something wrong the wind the police will arrest it they will arrest the good one also so one should be careful so this is the way one should understand the thing what will do autumn determine Oh Union yet the Lord is asking us to practice meditation meditation is the only way how we can reach to God what is the meditation withdrawing the mind mind from the same subjects and where the mind will go to God I am taking the mind out of the God's creation what are the same subjects God's creation I am taking my mind out and then that mind which is also created by God but the God is reflecting on that on my intellect so I take that Dre and go back to the original try to reach to the original that is meditation so when you try to attend the terminal Union dough should reach Deena's a jetty don'tcha Drishti when I see all around this and I have to discriminate to all things are so horrible why again and again I have to practice this the one gentleman came I'm sorry to say and he was preparing for the third or fourth marriage it will why well as fast was not adjusted second was also like that then I asked him do you think why do you marry because that is the way I will get there joy I'll be happy but do you think that third or fourth can help you to get be happy when the faster you could not second you could not you're going on trying like this there is also another way that you can survive all alone why didn't you take away the mind that is not the only thing that we have to do but he couldn't understand so this is the way people think why so much of attachment to the worldly objects and they cannot think of anything else except those worldly objects to become religious to become spiritual the fast and foremost thing is this discrimination and this discrimination will take your mind away then where will go in the jungle and in the desert all alone not living not like that at all leaving in this very world leaving with everyone but knowing that all that is happening all around temporary that much that is the yoga so all are not swayed away this God said they concentrate their minds and do not get disturbed distracted by the worldly act attractions worldly attractions what are the world Leatrice attractions the five things only Hindus are very intelligent they have also many millions of things are there they are analyzed and the shortlisted only five things the beauty the in the form that is chuck shoe that goes and the sound sometimes people are praising and you are very happy you enjoy those words and smell whatever the smell you like when you get that fragrance you are very happy your Chuck shoe karna Nausicaa Juba the test and tuck the touch so by that you only this file so when you we drove their mind from that where the mind goes it goes back to the consciousness so it that is way in thirteenth and fourteenth verses Lord mentioned the yoga at the right time morning noon and evening those who can sit in the proper posture and control the breathing asana and pranayama and concentrate the mind on me the God they slowly overcome Rajas and Tamas so from the bhagavata we learn why should we meditate why should you meditate so that we can be free from the circle of the birth and death which is the work of Maya so this is the way we should do early morning at the time of evening and in between when it is known time after the lunch take little rest and then when you get up if you do those who are having the time those who are in the office is out they will do it those who are having the time they can do it but retired people is a best time you are not very sick you are not very weak and you are free practice this three time meditation and every time you can sit for one hour night for sure you'll be fresh all the time your mind will be so happy so that is the teaching of the God now this technique I taught to sonica etc this technique the Lord said to Dawa I taught to sanaka and four brothers on occur sananda sanatana senate kumar they were the mind born children of the brahma the lord the supreme lord vishnu he created brahma the fool that's why brahma is known not brahman brahma ha that's why the brahma is known as the first born he was the first born and then he gave the knowledge to brahma and asked brahma to create and he created this fourth and they were highly spiritual the sanaka sananda Toddie the lord said i taught them this yoga we draw your mind from the sense objects and go back to God now who'd ever like the Arjuna at the doubt how krishnakant taught it because that was very very and the old thing and Krishna is with me I am talking with Krishna I am standing before Krishna how can he claim that he taught the yoga to sanaka sananda to clear the doubt with Thurber oxd but he asked very cleverly hey I don't believe this they will never say like that he said sir o my lord I wish to know the time and in the form you taught them look at it so it's not oh I don't believe you it never said like that he said will you please tell me the time when and in what form not surely in Krishna form in what form then you thought they would double watcher this is the 13 chapter 15 verse yada traum sanaka debut in rupee nakisha ba Hugin are Disturb on eated roopam each a CBD tomb will you please tell me when you taught the sanaka etc this yoga yoga routine acacia in a rupee in acacia beam with what form and netted rupa me child Alecto know that lord and narrated the story behind the yoga teaching supreme being wishing to create he created the Brahma Brahma created sonnet chimeric cetera and they wanted to know one question that David it was in their mind so they all for one all the four they went to their father Brahma and told father can you please tell us our mind is attached to the sense objects and those sense objects are also present within the mind now you are asking in the yoga to go beyond this through this mind how it is possible the mind is always attached to those objects and objects are also inside the mind otherwise you won't be attracted when I see a flower I get attracted to the flower the flower is already within my mind I know this so I am so this is so interrelated how we can take it out the objects how can I take it out from the mind and give it to God how it is possible so they were asking this put raha hidden Agabus semana sonic RDR and proper chew peetam sucks math yoga we can take him go team the very subtle question of the yoga they asked whom to their father who is the father now another word has been used this is a speciality of the Indian Scripture hidden negara now we are confused who is again he didn't know that we were having the Brahma Brahmas mind bond so on and the day where all the the heat heart and they devour all character who is this didn't occur the same person here in Minerva and Brahma are the same so they wanted to know the will born children of the Hiranya garbha they requested what was the subtle point of the yoga now in their seventeen verse it says the mind is attached to the same subjects again same subjects influence the mind and what type of action can seize it at that moment Brahma was busy in creation and Brahma you can see the four hates the Hindus always make an image so that he can understand the Brahma is having the knowledge of the Veda the God gave him and beta for bigges so therefore aids and he was thinking how to make the creation perfect and the Karma follow and is really really difficult so what to do when they asked this question he could not actually concentrate on that particular question and he understood I won't be able to answer these because my mind is busy with the work then he remembered his creator Brahmas creator that is the supreme brahman and he pray to him will you please come and give the answer to this question to our my children then the Lord is mentioning saw Mom or cinta young the Baha Prasanna para TT Jaya Tasya hon Hamza rupena sakaram argaman hamsa droop in a league in a form of a swan whatever asked in what form and at what time you taught them that these Supreme Lord it is not the in the form of a Krishna but Krishna that Supreme Lord Supreme Being so he this time he came in the form of Hampshire so in the why because the paramahamsa is a highly spiritual people hamsa means the paramahamsa see Ramakrishna is also title as a paramahamsa all people cannot become Paramahamsa means the highly spiritual people they live in the world but not of the world majority of the hindu sanyasins they try to go inside the jungle or in the the caves to be lonely but the paramahamsa they live with all people we belong to paramahamsa a clan that is the Raghavan see Ramakrishna that's why we work in the cities and mixed with the people so this Paramahamsa rupena he came and then seeing the Swan before them Brahma even could not recognize the Brahma and his four sons they went forward but the understood this is some someone who has come in this form so the first will come him offered in the water and other seat then asked October aunty this is the question the arcs the Supreme God was you and the God taught them in and very nice way so we will touch that in our next class again we will discuss kha Pavan et what you say they asked the Supreme God who are you the Brahma and his sons sanaka sananda they are not ordinary people they are reaches and they were led by Brahma so obviously the God was amused that these people also could not recognize me what about the ordinary people so God will give the answer you made a shape in OT 18 Allah pure why they could not realize unless and until the Supreme Being discloses it is not possible for anyone to understand Raghavan see Ramakrishna also said you cannot see God only God if he reveals then only you can see him so you can only go on praying again he is giving the example that is the uniqueness of Salam o Krishna he told that in the station in those the olden days the stationmaster is to show the light so the driver of the train will understand and he will go if it is great he'll stop with his green then he will move the train and the light was focused on the front side back was Dirk the people in the front could not see the face of that stationmaster if they want to see the face of the stationmaster then they have to go and pray to him request him said will you please turn the light towards you we like to see that is the Ramakrishna said if God is gracious then he will reveal not that just because he will stand before him you'd be able to see him no and the venetie katha Upanishad also says yummy body shape Brynna tea tree in Olympia very famous verse when he is thinking that he will reveal he will reveal otherwise not so it seems God was amused and then he started telling this will only read this much doughnut dough appeared in the form of the Swan and cannot be described as a realization of the brahman is possible only by removing false knowledge bechara so you like to know the God so you have to discriminate you have to remove the false knowledge ignorance then only you'll realize so the god started it is in the 22nd verse he said whole sages  bobbin who are you this question is not valid so how he's arguing you were asking me Who am I this question itself is not valid he was talking to the great sages they are supposed to know Brahma the firstborn they were supposed to know but he they made the mistake to ask God who are you how God can so he says among the Meany you can ask one who is this it is possible but when there is only one and you are asking who are you how it is that means you do not know that except me there is nothing then you claim yourself as the Rishi's you claim yourself realized people you do not know except me the brahman there is no second one so asking me Bob on her coban is a completely wrong question I am not having any second one so naturally being the inner self of all I am one hence you cannot ask kebab on second osage's if your question refer to the body if your question refer to the Othman I am the only art man and all-pervading so you cannot ask the question I am NOT meaning and of the many you can ask who is this when he is only one then how can you ask second if you are referring to the body then also it is not valid question why the body is composed of five elements that you know what shitty the art oper the water teacher the fire Murata year and the bloom of space so obviously there are five elements and all the five elements are very much present in the body and if you are asking the body what is this then you should use the world kayuu iam plural is not it should not be singular so your question Devon it is singular who are you what do you have to ask in you of course plural and singular both goes but in sanskrit it is it should be you young who are all these people who are all these materials who are you that is in plural sense you can ask okay UUM who are you all it should be proven not singular so obviously your question is not valid maneuvers
