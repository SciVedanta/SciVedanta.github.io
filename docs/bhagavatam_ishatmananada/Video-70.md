today's a very special day because on this particular day the Lawrences aunt is no worshiped marshal de as a sure she so sure she the Kali Puja today I think in India now they are having because it is night so they must be performing that Kali Puja will be reading from the bhagavata but as a specialty we have already announced that it will be a conference of the kadhi and Krishna the little bit of Tantra also he will discuss first let us chant Shanta God whoo Jerusalem for tamanna' Judaism wish water governance attrition meet her renowned shoe hung Lakshmi condom Kamala Lionel you give me the Anakim young Bundy Vishnu harem sellable hooker [Music] the confluence of kadhi and the prisoner we started reading this party bottom on a fourth March 2018 so one year is passed and almost another year is going to be and this in the very first verse of the bhagavatam we found the goal of the great scripture the every scripture they fix the goal what is the goal Saturn param de certain param param is supreme certain is the truth the eternal dhimahi we meditate so we meditate concentrate worship on the supreme truth our supreme one which is eternal so that is all of the bhagavata and what is that supreme truth Brahman in the Vedanta they say it is the drug man that is the supreme truth in the scripture we find that the truth that means this Brahman it creates its esteem and also destroy all the three actions is done by the same Brahman same consciousness and we must have to remember that it has been turned as so many varieties of words so Brahman Atma Paramatma shock she sucked M so many so like this it goes here we are finding the is creating sustaining and also destroying its best creation is the human when he created the best creation is the human in almost all the major religious scripturally find that they have given a lot of importance in the human in the Christianity they say manuals made out of God's own image and in the Islamic tradition we find the after creating the man the Allah the supreme one is inviting all the celestial beings to come and pay respect to that human but when they are denying now widely one of them he denied so he was banished from the heaven so that is the greatest respect greatest honor has been given to the human now why because human as the kappa to transform into God human only has the capacity to become God that actually the human has been given so much of importance and the Supreme Being he also gave the righteousness Dharma and unrighteousness other both and just to play then sometimes the mother they will create that the demon lose the baby and on the carpet and say come to me and then they will create some problem for the baby to overcome that there is a game that the mother can any time take the baby on her lap but she wants to play with the baby similarly the God the Supreme Being who has created us the whole universe and he has created human being also to enjoy his creation in the phenomena we find so many beautiful things and God has given us the five organs to enjoy that the eyes to see the beauty of the nature the ear to listen this nose to smell the tongue to test and the scheme to touch and feel so these are the five organs that that has been given by this that supreme God to enjoy this world but at the same time he has given that he created some great beings like the drama then Vishnu and all so that they can come and tell us and also the only being they can come and tell that be careful about it don't get marched into it the deer comes to her struggle otherwise everything is alright but the animals it was alright the green grasses for the grass eaters animals was so nice and the birds some here and there some flowers and fruits birds are happy but for us but the human being our thirst unquenchable it goes on increasing and increasing isn't it it goes on increasing and increasing why who has developed God again why he is given it for his plate he created us and he has given us the desire and that desire that never ends up it goes on increasing the more you go for the desire to specify the dessert the more and more it comes back so what is righteousness and unrighteousness Dharma and adharma the control of your senses God has given all the phenomena all the things to enjoy again God is asking us and roll yourself there the struggle and who can do it only human being because the God has given the human being that particular strength and not only that also the teachers they are coming in and again and teaching us and the spirituals all these teachings that is recorded in the scripture again and again you can go back to scripture to get that feeling how to do what to do etc so this is the wonderful game God has given to us and party even than you know the human being because of the this and sometimes some people who are having the sukkah the doctor told and the family people told don't eat sweets he said no no no and I promise no problem but I said beautiful as all people say today one you can taste one is nothing and then somebody will say suppose you are eating the sweet today then you can control the other for any guesses so he starts eating why very difficult to control very difficult so that is the weakness and when that witness grows up then God hims comes down there's no other way to save this humanity from the paths of unrighteousness now let us get it clear what is righteousness what is Dharma to go back to God that is that one that is righteousness what is Dharma attraction to these worldly things God has created these working things but again if we go to that near bound and we suffer we suffer and suffer but then death circle goes on God doesn't want that so he slowly slowly from the amoeba stage it will be coming and then finally a full manifestation is the human life and that took the best human life and they have the culture they have the knowledge they have the intellect they have the capacity to understand all that human being then the God comes to them and say you should know so God had to come again and again so we find in this way in the think scandal then that scandal means the book the first chapter dire we find King per se very we bring to the sugar those who are following this class they know the sugar is a great rishi who heard the whole thing from his father vyasadeva Nevada don't confuse with the bhagavad-gita beta is the teaching of Shri Krishna bhagavata is a completely different structure of course composed by the same way the Piazza and this Veda Vyasa taught it to his son his mind was pure and one pointed so he learned it then he came to meet the king was ready for his death because he was cursed by a brahmana boy we know that story and here this person was going on listening three days passed and he knows seven days on the seventh day on the eighth day he is going to die so naturally he was eager to listen about the life of Shri Krishna who saved him so he was sitting I have heard all these things from you the last three days now today is the fourth day will you please tell me about biriyani tester Alcala de navarra entire body Purusha callaloo ke Priya chat ultimate injure Maya minutiae Shiva - repeat one Maya minutiae he never say how he took the human form this is the word he used the king himself knew that God can never take the human form it is not possible he cannot board like hers so how Maya minutiae what is this Maya Marissa Shankar Acharya he said the moment the God is taking this human form like earth is becoming limited so obviously we can describe this God when he was born whose son is he where he lived what he did all that is coming the finite it is becoming them the Lord become finite is destined to die God cannot be taped that cannot die so naturally how the God manifested he said Maya Manutius here but of Shiva Duan which one means the whole learn and one but us - please tell me about the one who is present within all being who is present we did all be so the king pariksit was aware that the Krishna who appeared before him who did reason who did that in the whole of Mahabharata he was in reality the Hartman that is pervading the hearts of each and every one akela dijah rajim hunt aha akela akela means no number infinite so each and every one in inside the heart they are having this true or just he mentioned like that friends in Hinduism always the test is there that is the beauty maybe they have seen but all is testing examinate then only accept it - what he meant by that the one who is present in the heart of each and everyone what is that Hartman we have the body about which we are aware we have the mind about which we are aware but most of us are not aware that behind these there is the Hartman the self the calm justice with the help of which mind and bodies are working so that's up now sometimes I say in this way when you go to see the the great painter has painted something on a piece of paper then we go and see who the Sun is rising birds are flying and cowherd boys have come out with all their kettles and and the river flowing and the boat country boat is also sailing over there we go and you see and we appreciate the whole picture and the scenario but we forget that paper on which it is painted on which it is drawn that paper is holding the whole painting we are aware about the painting not about the people similarly we are ever aware about this body aware about the mind aware about our thoughts where about many things that is happening all around us except that consciousness which is actually holding us to understand that when that consciousness leaves us our body is there but we cannot enjoy this phenomena so then he is telling a healer they her pajeon inside each and every being he is present and also we doubt and also outside as time caller as a caller time is there each and every one the moment someone is born time is fixed this much it will go and then you have to go back no way so this is the reason they say the king say Krishna's such an attorney brother please tell me about the life of the Krishna Krishna surgery tani cherita everything in Sanskrit means the life krishna's dear cherry tony brothers here but assuming still please tell me about the life of krishna he didn't say that he rather he said Maya minutia surgery tani but this year we have to remember these when the God is taking the form of the human form at venting he is actually not like us is completely different though he behaves license to relieve like us everything just like us but at the same time my initiation nowadays the science is developing and is developing in so fast inside we they were telling the Sunday as we are now talking in the Skype you need not to bother about that the person will visit you talk to you just as you are in front of you you will touch a machine and you will come and stand before you with dot and then you touch the machining vanishes the three-dimensional now heating is it possible no no it's odd but they are going to do like that the same way that God with this tremendous power which is known as Mayan projecting himself so what is this God who gives depth and also immortality prayer chatham adam muto of return to prayer chatter milton utter Amrit Anja it gives the debt and also immortality what is the dead whatever that we are doing certainly began none nothing so that is the eel is there anything that aims is having the death but if it goes on eternally and that is called emerald in Sanskrit Amrit means eternity she'll be eternally there so this eternity vote you can give from this question the prediction is clear that he knew well about the Krishna the human power he was the Supreme Being now it is follower ethically puja day let us talk about this Krishna's birth and also Kali how it is so we fight you know that there is a great all the time even today in the modern day even today there with people who are worshipping goddess Kali will never turn towards Krishna and those who are worshiping the Krishna can never think of mixing with the people who are worshipping Kali that much in sitting in America you won't understand so much orthodoxy this is here even in India if you go you in find those who are the worshipper of Krishna the vegetable if you go and tell that this is the prasada that the fruits and other things that we offer to the God that please can you please take it now they may if they work you will never touch it so this is the problem but if we go to the scripture we what we find we find that in the 20 sister Chandi the divine mother said in Chandi which is the book of the Tantra is the book of the power goddess goddess and his heart power there it says none the Gooper greeley jata Yasuda gazonga wrong that is sooo not released yummy be jaja let me varsity win Dodgers anniversary the dead power if you have read the seven and eight verses of the Chandi all those creations of the power the goddess and she did so many things then afterwards Easterling I will take birth in the Nanda Gopala he had born as a daughter in the home of the cowherd Nanda Yasuda will be my mother so this nun that appropriate Yatta Yatta got a verse on baba who was that now here we find again in the multi-router there is another book mortal Asha it says Nanda gravity nama yeah obesity in and aaja Nunda job Jam is the daughter the Nanda Nanda's daughter will be known as nun dog in the life of shri krishna he was the son of the Devaki and when the newborn just that moment he was born she was exchanged with another little girl that she was also was born on that very moment Krishna was born and the lap of the day looking and then the God Himself said please exchange me with the daughter of Nanda she is also there how it is possible now we have to go back to once again to the and the probable they find the description this incident happened the whole art was crying and praying to the Supreme Being we are being tortured tormented by some of the devilish people the kings they have bought over here and they are torturing us now please save us Hindus they believe it when there is no one to help us then the God will come to help us that is the great faith we are having so we are not worried about anything so they are doing all these things that God will come and punish them and truly it happens then the pretty be with him it means this art she we into it as if the lady she went to Brahma and prayed it is impossible for me to bear this do something the Brahma told okay let us go to Shiva the Shiva also told let us go to the Supreme Being again then all the gods and goddesses following the Shiva and the Brahma they all went to the Sheila Samudra on the bank of the shield sama to the place called she is a mantra and they wind and debride over there to the Supreme Being for the health how deeply how they conveyed their message of the Supreme Being through meditation when they were meditating and they slowly and stately they were sending out their prior to the Supreme Being and he heard it and then the bra he heard the voice the message came to his heart and he said he has taken the vow the oath that she will be he will advance as a son of vasudeva and devaki then he commanded that all the gods and goddesses also - should take the human fall and born in the Mathura and Vrindavan as Gopal and go peace so that the whole said to us the air the drama everything was set and we think this happened that happened why it is white it's there everything was all arranged not only that the supreme he asked that his own power to take birth as the daughter of the copa and go Peking so she also the power of God she also took that birth now in the solution gathered were there when the time came the Krishna's we bought all the Celestials they came and gathered me and the prison of the culture where the positive and Devaki were imprisoned the earth and deep breathe how deeply so the whole story is going on suddenly they'll give the truth how their prey the praying set the return Satya param three tsardom such as a yogi should be eaten chasity successive satyr Rita Sultanate run such an account on sharanam appa' now and this is in the tenth book second chapter 26 verse at the bhagavata subtype return brother means the wheel you will is the truth you can never to anything else such a Brahman and you are truth is the your form three certain in three eases you were truth what are the three phases siddhappa three davekeli all the time that we see ah this is the past present and the future this three past present and the future all the time you were the same no change so that's called 3sat them you are the creator of the truth such as a uni unit and just a deal you are the creator of the truth suggestion saturator certain etrem you are embedded in truth truth are your eyes we take refuge in you tuam sharanam proper now so we are taking refuge in you everything that sucked air Shammi Vivekananda he at least India as subject why because this is the please where everything was followed asserted the continuity of the truth never broke the present is a society the present economy the condition that is all aberrant but in if you go down and you see that a strong full flow of the truth is there the Nima deity never break so this is the truth we find over here and the began the teachers the Brahma is such cheat on endure against earth such means the eternal the truth truth means again brahmana eternal truth so we have to remember this term such as ethnicity means brahmand remand Brahmin or art man now who is this Krishna and we find that Brahma Samhita they are mentioning about the Krishna as ishaara Barama Krishna then he said sat-chit-ananda bakr krishna is a farmer he sure is supreme god such cheat on and the big club become means the image such cheated on the satchitananda brahman as because brahman cannot be explained is beyond time space and causation so he give a hint it is like this so what is that such cheat on under so suppose you won't be able to go some place and then your friend has gone he will say it is like this you know someone coming from Washington DC and your body how is this white house everything is white inside white outside right Allah what then he will tell you if you go from this corner it is like this from that corner edges like this from that corner it is like this but that is not the white house he is only giving the hint of the white house unless and until you go over there and visit you won't be able to understand but we did some claims some idea it is like this what is that Brahma sir chief anandam existence knowledge and please say and what was this Krishna the human form a person searched on and the bigger this is the beauty of the Hinduism we worship the personal God and Goddess we and not only that we believe so hard that this is the God but at the same time we know this is only to and first the Supreme God with all pervading who is the consciousness has taken this form the who is Krishna Tsuchida onon the big girl and we Scully [Music] Shakti but Pavan Saddam Krishna say again whom you call Brahmin I call the mother Kali so Kali is also nothing but the power of the Brahmin and from that Kali or the Shakti which I should nursing Kalyan Lee is a Shakti the power and the power full undivided you cannot separate them the God is the shaktimaan and God's power is the ship T at the different they have seen the power and the powerful are the same you cannot separate the moment you separated the both of them they will lose the importance if the God is not having the capacity to control to create to destroy then is not no more God Rama Rama Krishna he is telling one person came and they were telling Raja he is Raja when we were addressing him Raja Raja again and again then some occasion said what Raja he is he is not having any Kingdom he's not having any any control of anything so why unnecessarily you are calling in as Raja in those days the crew t-shirts that you could keep that if you keep 10000 rupees you will get entitled from the British Raja so and that was that way people used to but Salam peace no didn't like it he said unless you have a team down how can you call it some Raja you don't have the power you don't have the well don't have nothing properly called the similarly here also you cannot call God if he is not having that power so the power and the God inseparable Tantra they took that power of God and wish never they took the God Vedanta what they did and conference of this boat they took the essence of this boat the conference of this boat Shakti and shaktimaan both in the vedanta-sutra prale's three beginning there's a beautiful place in India very holy place so they are the people they go to take bath why three rivers are flowing ganga jamuna and saraswati are see the sheriff city but flow is there they believe nowadays so the three confluence of the confluence of the three rivers the Shiraz Shetty now it is a non name is proud this frog if you go the three confluence why just like that in Hinduism it is nothing but the graves of three thoughts Vedanta Tantra and wisdom we won't discuss the Vedanta or Twitter than today but we will talk about the Tantra and vegetables we're from the country came from the same source Veda in the Rig Veda we find that mentioned were in the tech tree Upanishad they talk about the vidya Davey and atharvaveda even the mantras and they used that was also there in the atharvaveda and vishna besom based on the Vishnu and when we find the Vishnu in the pivot and we file the disdain'd Vishnu and the meaning of the word Vishnu all-pervading one we start beta fish-- Nahar all-pervading one Tantra is the knowledge what is the knowledge that power and the God consciousness at the same and they are also all pervading the divine power the supreme power of God and the God are the same this is the knowledge you must have to understand or you won't get the liberation so Tonya they be story of the Ghanim Annina ET donc katana Tantra also says Tantra is only a philosophy a path a spatial lead they have and some people they follow that path only they like it so that also says you have to get the knowledge that the consciousness and the activity at the same same person when not working is known as Sheba and the same Shiva when working known as Gavi so they are the same don't think that is a male and a female in the same and wife even because she's creating so the female form has been given mother for has been given that much and nothing else just for art well-tended but it is nothing but the god and the gods power so the Congress is if you like to realize God you have to first understand the power of God then it will be easy and we should never say if you have to real God ought to get liberation you have to understand Vishnu who is all-pervading and not only that Vishnu is sustaining the whole thing and how because the Lord Vishnu he creates himself as an Avatara again and again and comes down he came as a Rama he came as the Krishna and this tree is protecting us sir this is the Vaishnava and the thunder and shri krishna came in the form he in the human form to do what in the bhagavad-gita he explained everything Robert eita it was delivered on a Warfield when the people were ready to cut the throat of each other standing on that particular moment he delivered a unique message eternal audacity and what is there in the bhagavad-gita in the beginning if you find all you have 18 chapters and all the chapters are termed as Yoga Yoga means Union you have to go to the God in this way and the very first chapter of the bhagavad-gita it says Arjuna Machado yoga Virginia is representing the human being and he is powerful he's acquitted his self-confidence at the same time he's confused and he's confused what to do and what not to do that is the condition or you will being unlike that we have the power we have the capacity we have everything at the same time somewhere we think if someone could help us that is good so that is the confusion that always in the mind of the human or Jinnah is that the symbol of the human being and he's confused that is the tremendous power that is whaling within Machado no I don't like to do when the so today one gentleman came and he was telling anything now he has reached a very high position and he was telling his beginning just from a humble village and the schools and the colleges he was mentioning I was wondering reading into that school and colleges can one become so successful in his life and now he is researching on some power and physics he he in he was telling can you please help me I am frustrated I do not know what is going to happen to me I told stop over here and turn back close your eyes and go back and see your whole life you seek not that you are overcoming so many hurdles who is helping you you and your God you and your karma so here going on so why you are thinking in this way but still you know the human mind we need someone so that's why the Krishna that's why the Vishnu that's why the Rama so when they are there in front of us we are so happy but how do they help us sometimes as nowadays in our country Ramachandra means a muscular body they have not yet made the pressure as a muscular but I think they will so muscular body should be there and the very the fighting and all that they were fought like that Krishna if you look at these bodies are so beautiful there's no muscular but what is the strength strength is the putti strength is the realization is not the physical the tactics that we have to understand what is the strength of Sri Rama how he what he taught if you read between the Rama and his guru vashisht her beautiful that is exactly what is Ramayana Rama and is good when they are conversing and the earth they are conversing about these and his guru say Rama can you please tell me where the God is not the Supreme Being is not the yoga Vasishta that is a beautiful book very wonderful book of the pedant oh then the same Rama understanding his own responsibility as seen he was God but at the same time is behaving like a young man and again confused and he went to his guru and saying what shall I do we do believe in that time heal Rama is telling I feel like committing suicide Rama and he's telling now the Rama is so you must be like God he and all those pictures are coming that Rama he went to his guru and he said I am so frustrated I do not know what should I do when I went out and saw everything is changing and if everything is changing the little boy who is born now he is going to die someday then why should I become a king and rule this country are you there was a you which country the kingdom but Rama - no I don't like this I'd rather I will go and meditate on the Supreme Being then there is guru say where is that supreme being everywhere and you are born as the Prince and you are going to be the king you are supposed to maintain your life in this way and then realize god we must have to so that is the same way the Krishna is asking Arjuna you were a Kshatriya you cannot say no to this fearful work but other people won't be able to do the brahmanas are not they are intelligent but cannot do this but you sure don't be able to do they're businessmen they'd know how to do the business but not the war the military technique and the fighting you know em you must have to do to stablish the religion please come harmony that is your duty and if you don't do that everything is disturbed and do you think God will be happy with you so the karmayoga we find in the Gita karma yoga we find in the dialogue between Rama and the school and what is this Karma Yoga again Krishna see you only be able to do realizing God without going through all your duties you have to perform your duties and what is your duty according to your nature obviously the duty will come I never wanted to become my myself I'm telling never wanted to become a monk rather I had I wanted to find out all the defects of the moms one monk was visiting and he was having a tough year and the moment my mother Anna aunty is there you know that in our culture they will go and give the hugs to the holy people and I went on the top and to see how the water is coming the moment someone is coming as a blessings he'll be putting his right hand and say Shiva Shiva and the water will come from his matted hair no water cannot come like that so I went on the top and see and I found yes the moment he is placing his hand then only water is coming otherwise not then afterwards when he left then I came and told the mother is actually cheating you he was pressing over here then the water mother told I know water cannot be there but he has put on a gala which is the shooing that life of renunciation we respect that I to logic not the person we respect that I to nology I do not you giving him so that is Hinduism not that we don't understand we understand but still we respect that vital RG and then I wanted to become in the join in Indian Army I did but they didn't accept me because and then I have become a monk not that I will to become a mom but I was this team to become I went to visit a place and then the Shami met me and he told me why you were wasting your life like this I was planning so many things and then University gone everything on moment he gave me the call dedicate your life of the service of the humanity I felt oh this is the world I was waiting for the reason this is the call and truly I felt the day I joined the awesome I felt this is my home well from it came and I liked so much everything they asked me to do I did it with great joy in within one room we can say ten years I passed within what small room ten years and that way and I'm so happy in everything where from it comes that is called destiny each and every one so the Kshatriyas as a destiny they won't be able to sit anywhere they are courageous people their heart is constantly thinking that I must go and help the people so the same way the wishes the people who are doing the business and the same way the shooters who are needed the God so we must take up our own the path swadharma there's a beautiful word the great work in the bhagavad-gita your own is your own duty and responsibility Bard there's a big parties there you know in always they in Hindi till say everything and at the end inseparable to that means God parantha means into our board what is that part is that you should not hanker for the result of the world that you are green as a monk of me as a householder you as a professional a doctor or a soldier or a businessman you one should not we should do the work and then we should winter from that result Carmen Nevada gaara's de ma Felicia garage Anna so this is the teaching of the Krishna and what will happen you realize that Brahman if you want if you go to God if you want you will get the fall the God in the energy of God if you want solid pure solid pure sarsti all these places are there and about the Kali what is this Kali Kali puncher gursha burner for a neighbor Navy charcoal what is the sponge etosha 55 Zealand and if you count this skull that is hanging as a girl and fifty what is this 50 vowel and consonant sound speed wobble and consonant 50 from ah then call up to be circle that use the knowledge our knowledge is there in the nature so what is that knowledge consciousness and the activity goes hand in hand and what is that consciousness your Chaitanya which is already there as we were talking about and when you discussed Vedanta consciousness is always there now quickly we can once again remind about that how to understand the consciousness is there who can say what are they our supply of each other you have attending the Vedanta class for so many days and our stock tray of each our what is that our stock rail chareth sadhna answer something bechara we have to examine these three stages Japeth with body and mind schockner without body but with mind in the mind only we see the dream the body is not necessary but sometimes we go beyond the dream stage and we sleep and come back when the body is absent mind is not there then who reported you that you slept nicely without any dream that consciousness that proves the consciousness that means every day almost every day we are going to that same truth unknowingly and that's why coming back the bargain saddam on of his story is stealing there was in a great in a very precious stone was there but most of the villagers they never knew that this to go and this to watch the clothings on that and something rubbing their they feet and on that and they never knew so costly once only one person came and understood oh my god it's so cause it's don't and the huge so he told the villagers I will make a another nice place over here with the cement and bricks can I take this yes he says you can take that so he took that so we have to understand every day when you were sleeping going there not understanding that we are reaching to our mukthi route reaching to the knowledge coming back so we meditate again and in the meditation first we forget the body then we control our mind and no rhythms will be there no imagination no dream and when the mind is still very go to that supreme the place which is the consciousness so that is the reason it says stitute thumb is a fourth stage jabra sadhna Susu the-- and it's called to do the studio at the fourth stage to do them then we have to reach here also we find in the country you have to seat and then you have to meditate there may be many other things before you but you have to be through your mind first you forget your body then you forget your mind then you become completely still and then the revelation of the total video and that is this Tantra the Krishna a drama at the Bishnu of the wish novel that flow where it takes us the same consciousness and the Tantra in the same consciousness and example we find in the life of Provence Ramakrishna the Salam Krishna twin from his childhood days it was vegetable this - used to worship the Ramachandra then he came to - Nisha he became the worshipper of the Krishna and then afterwards he started worshipping goddess Kali so he knew the busines the colleague and in his person in his mind in his realization both the flow mingled and that's why the conference of this and also the Vedanta so friends ultimately in this human life which is very worth because we can become God we can get freedom but how pickup in one path either Balanta art under our Western ISM any path if you like whichever is suitable for you take up and then sincerely you proceed towards there ultimately all the three will mix in one place and they will find all paths are leading to the same goal as Saddam additional said you have to bother dr. Park all paths are leading to the same goal as many faiths so many paths thank you for today so this is but today instead of having dad's mantra we will offer our monitor pranaam to Krishna and also to college caption Akane so please repeat after me ohm bar sediba soo-dong the bomb concert or no Roberta nom de ba Ramon and krishnam vande jagadguru now this should be a little difficult because we are not habituated in Chan Tilda the Tantra mantra so this will be bones remot surah surah our dear jaren on guru Artyom John Archer jagged tawdry Holly calm no mom golly calm run Amamiya home so the tally today and also the prisoner from our tradition and Raghavan C Ramakrishna said today is a very auspicious day and the moment whatever you like to breathe you can and that will be fulfilled by the goddess the power of goddess wife Allah Harini all the bad Karma's that we have done if you today you pray all that will be taken away most of the monks today to be fasting and meditating the whole night they'll be bring the devotees they play like that all night and when you are doing that with a field follow re me she will take because she has the power and how Maya Maya has the two different power she can take so with the faith only is all depends on the faith the believe and when Saddam additional the personality like him say it must be true so we can pray if not for the whole night we can pray for some time not now when you go back thank you very much thank you for coming and our June retreat about that let me announce you so please register it is online you can register Rami Sal whatever and that you'd be coming and the retreat will be and two drops of nature so that is the retreat topic as usual Friday afternoon then hold Saturday and the Sunday Thank You Shanti Shanti Shanti
