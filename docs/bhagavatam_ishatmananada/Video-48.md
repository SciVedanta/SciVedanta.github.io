[Bhagavatam 075 : Swadharma According To The Bhagavat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jv91oYpqesU)

good morning dear devotees and friends today is sunday and let us begin our sunday talk on the srimad bhagavatam and as usual we will chant this mantra and then we will start the discussion [Music] [Music] m friends we were studying the uddhavagita the part of the bhagavata uddhava the great devotee and the follower of sri krishna so he was anxious that what will happen when the sri krishna leaves the this earth sri krishna decided to give up his body so we know and he was asking some question those who are following these bhagavata classes you know the whole situation so in there and almost in the last part uddhava reached to him and he was asking so when the pure mind would have understood then he was worried about the dharma why without the dharma the human society will break down he understood that so naturally so he wanted to know the spiritual responsibilities of different categories of people different categories of people when you say that that means at that time that different categories have already come the brahmana then sudra bhaisha shatriya and this all so these four categories who should do what when the krishna was there he was a paramount figure so obviously he used to control all this now when he is going to leave what will happen oh lord you have advice to put our minds with devotion to you but some do work without devotion the uddhava putting the question to the lord what will happen to them moreover there are different types of duties in human society how by following their own responsibility they will develop devotion to you and achieve liberation so two parts of the one question he is asking yatha onustiyam that is the last part of the question there are different type of people they have different type of responsibilities and what would be their spiritual responsibility spiritual practices how they will be distinguished and then you say after practicing swa dharma my own the responsibilities and duties how i can develop devotion to you or i can grow in spirituality in society there are different type of people there are administrators and there are spiritual teachers and there are business community and the working class these four always every time there are there now in india they developed some special responsibilities for this type of people and every responsibility duty work was assigned in such a way so that slowly they grow into spiritual life that is the beauty that is the specialty so they whatever they are doing they are growing into spiritual life but why they were there were divisions because of the tendencies so now the uddhava is asking krishna you have decided to leave this mortal body and when you won't be here who will be guiding these people if the brahmanas are doing some other things or the shatriyas are not following their own responsibilities what will happen so yatha anusthiya manina sadhar vena when the practicing the swadharma the human being developed devotion to you that's so devotion to you means the krishna means the god it's not the person that is sometimes some of our friends they make the mistake they say it is the krishna is only god why because the uddhava said this is meaning the krishna it is not the krishna in that particular form it is the god the god who is having all those qualities god who is all pervading from the god everything is coming everything is sustaining everything is dissolving that particular concept is known as god and that at this moment in the form of a krishna so this we should not forget otherwise it will be a narrow sectarian view so this he says that how they can achieve the liberation the 11 skandha 17th chapter second verse it is like this then the uddhava very intelligently putting this up in the sixth verse of the seventeenth chapter krishna as the madusa said you are the only originator karta avitra you were the defender and you were the expounder prabhakta and when you are planning to leave this world soon then religion will also die who o lord will then prabhaksati advise us guide us so uddhava's idea was clear uddhava very much knew who this krishna is though they were almost like friends close friends and the behavior and all that they were growing together but he knew krishna is that supreme lord in the bhagavad-gita the krishna said again in another verse he said one who has understood me truly that truly the what is the truth the krishna though in this human form he is eternal he is all-pervading he is all-powerful and that is the conception of god when we forget that we like only one particular form of god and then we think that this is the only form that's called sectarianism why it comes because of my ego it's not the god it is my ego my ego is promoting me what i have thought what i am thinking and what i am doing whatever path i am following that is the only path it is not god's it isn't god's will it is my ego so those who are doing like that they cannot reach even if they reach they go to a particular small part of the god so that's where religion is always open hand covering each and every one embracing each and every one every path and the very recently the same god came in the form of bhagavad-gita and this time he is the avatar the incarnation of the combination of all religions so this ramakrishna also taught this here also in a different way we are going to understand from sri krishna how in this world different type of people came different responsibilities came why it came now everybody is putting finger on this particular thing of hinduism castism casters everybody's complaining not understanding misunderstanding wrong understanding all going on complaining about the casteism but how it came why it came so let us go to that so uddhava requested him why i am asking you sir o krishna because you are the only person who can answer this hearing lord appreciated him for his intelligent question uddhava is not thinking about himself is thinking about the all people friends you may be hearing a sound now that is the rain torrential rain and the water is splashing on the the wind screen our wind was clean so that sound hearing this uddhava the lord appreciated him for his intelligent question why the intelligent question i am not quoting that words is not thinking for himself he is thinking for the others and he is thinking what will happen if there is no religion in the human society dharma or righteousness is the core of human life some people they will attack religion only dharma only constantly criticizing but they do not understand what actually religion is they are seeing something that some people they are misutilizing religion misinterpreting religion misleading that religion just a one or two percentage maybe and seeing them quoting them they think that this is the whole of religion this is in the same there are there are some doctors who are in the they know what is what they are going to do they are cheating the poor people illiterate people and taking their body parts telling it are they not it is there in the society now are we going to condem all the medical knowledge for that there are some engineers who are using inferior materials to construct the bridge which will be used by the thousands of people just for little profit the greedy person are you going to stop all engineering sciences all engineering knowledge that that should we should understand that there may be one or two bad administrator bad king ruthless people are you going to condemn everyone all administrators then why if someone somewhere making some mistake in the name of religion we have to understand that and we we have to understand that that is not religion is the misrepresentation or misuse of the wonderful conception what is religion religion is holding without righteousness dharma in sanskrit dharma this remain no difference between human and animals the whole human society will become only body centric and absolutely selfish what is religious person unselfish religious person selfish what is the punya unselfishness what is the proper selfishness the sin is selfishness and if i am not having that training then how i can hold myself so in the human society we feel hungry we feel sleepy we feel thirsty we feel many other feelings are there and all these feelings are present in the animals too there's a beautiful sanskrit words so they are same thing only the dharma that makes the difference without this dharma and what is this dharma we'll slowly understand that in bhagavad-gita sri krishna used the word sadharama those who have read the bhagavad-gita or reading you know that sadharmi nidhanam sriya para dharma it is better to die performing one's own duty than to take up some others responsibilities the others responsibilities if we try to do that will be terrible and we have seen that the religion should be propagated leaved and propagated by the monks the dedicated people who are not having any family ties family bondages who could come out and live a holy life and then after realizing the truth if they come out and teach the society they are the only people from whom the human society should learn religion but one who is a businessman and whole day he is doing the business and evening he is coming and giving the discourse and bhagavata maybe that he can expound it because he is having the wonderful control over the the language and people if they are following him will be in the ditch in the upanishad it says it will be leading a blind leading another blind so that is the problem so this we should understand before we enter into the wonderful discussions of the lord krishna let us once again remind ourselves about the truth otherwise we will be confused now who has created human being god why human beings are different the god's qualities out of which he has created them that is satya raja and tamar three qualities who gave dharma to human being god dharma means the injunctions and the instructions and the guidelines so that is also god what happened one practice dharma goes back to godhead goes back to god so ultimately what is this in the whole circle we find it is the god and after coming back it is god so keeping this in mind let us start reading this the 17th chapter in the 10th verse of the 17th chapter lord said the total creation period has been divided into four parts and the every part is known as yuga y-u-g-a yuga and the whole creation it is a long period of time and then it is divided into four i don't know why because but the ancient hindus they were very fond of four maybe those the neurology numeral logical the people they may say why these four the four parts total period the complete creation that is divided into four parts and the fast part about that the lord is telling in the 10th verse it is in the beginning it is krita yuga krita and also known as the satya yuga is very popular as satya yuga it is also krita yuga all people were righteous so krita krithia krita kritta means they were satisfied why they were righteous what is the righteousness they knew the truth the god is only existing and all the creation that is in front of us is all false majority of the people almost all people so when we read those about the rishis about their children brahma was the fast created because the supreme lord created brahma gave the knowledge of the veda that means the knowledge and from that knowledge brahma started creating from his own mind he started thinking and he created the rishis the thinkers and also we know the four sons of the brahma sanak sananda sanatana all this creation that was in the beginning of that beginning of the creation satya yoga all were very righteous all were very good people so that was the total picture and there was no problem but the god never wanted that he wanted some something to happen now unless and until every day someone is having the little milk and then that much again next day little milk next but at least one day out of that milk he can make something else maybe yogurt maybe something else and that is the joy the god also wanted to that joy why he said i am alone i like to be many why he said to enjoy how he will enjoy because out of accepted the god there was nothing so he divided himself you'll find some people who are alone they're playing cards and they will put a two or sometimes that they will be playing some other things so he is giving playing here and goes to that other side again playing in that from the other side it goes he's enjoying by that way there is no other other people like that the god was not having anyone else so he divided himself into different parts and in the beginning what happened all came just in the image of god they were so pure and so intelligent so naturally everything was the same that was krita yuga or the satya yuga not much of activities in the satta yuga only om was the most curated knowledge omiti brahma so the om was the only coveted knowledge there is no rituals actually practiced so they used to meditate on their own they knew what is that and they were standing on four feet and that was the dharma what is that dharma is the austerity tapaha then purity sha then forgiveness daya and truthfulness satya these were the four parts of the dharma so they said it's like a bull standing on four legs is a very powerful why they give the thought in that way because bull was very important it was a the land of cultivation that they needed to cultivate the powerful bulls so obviously that way they thought the god is a bull and it is helping this way and the four legs are dharma satya tapu means austerity what is this austerity again that is also giving the exam the definition the mind and all the senses should be controlled and put into one direction that is the question in the modern time mahasaratha mani devi i've said that many times masharada devi said what is tapasya somehow to keep your mind at the feet of god in a simple language he said somehow to put your mind at the feet of god that is sabasha so that is the way you have to collect your mind and to put to god mind is running this side that's you have to control that again and again that is called tapasya tapa then shocha the purity what is the purity love and unselfishness what is the then comes the forgiveness they are the forgiveness i can do i can forgive when i don't have the ego when i can understand the other person oh that is a poor man he behaved like that it is okay so daya the compassion at the same time i live in that the soul that is living with me the same soul is also in that so that conception that idea that knowledge so comes the daya and truthfulness satya whatever is happening all around me that should be followed the truthfulness these four were there in the second part of the creation now the first part gone in that way so they were known as the hamsa hamsa means they were not attached at all we have said that hampshire means the swan means the dark the they were not attached at all so give the symbol what is the symbol the duck the swan the floating on the water but not at all wet by the water so the in the satya yuga in the all people are like that very wonderful people very good people so again and again you'll find in the indian the scriptures and the literatures they talk about the satya yuga so we will go back to satya yugari why people are very happy but god in this from the second now we have to remember the creation the creation god created brahma brahma created all these people and now they started creating praja praja means all this creation and this creation came from those people they were having three goona satya rajyantama so when the three gunas are there so obviously this as a students of vedanta you all know these three gunas always change the characteristics of human being the different type of people a different type of behavior thought processes so it started coming in the second part of the creation which is known as the treta yuga satya treta dhapur and kali the total creation was divided into four satya yuga are krita yuga then yuga dwapara yuga and kali yuga these are the four now we are talking about the yoga in the trita yuga now the lord is telling in the second part which is known as the trita yuga lord said tribidya appeared from his heart and the great lord manifest as yakya now the yakya so some activities in the name of religion it is if someone not interested in religion but goes through these you can understand how the changes are coming in the human society in the beginning people are all so good so happy and then the second part in the trita yuga the god told i gave the education i gave knowledge to all in the beginning the knowledge was only with brahma the brahma the first born the creator now in the treta yuga that knowledge was distributed among the rishis among many people so many people started understanding because of that knowledge and what happens so where from the knowledge came in the yuga in a very dramatic political way the lord is telling three vidya the three vedas appeared from my heart and the great lord manifest himself manifest as yagya and the yanga was known as vishnu yaga vishnu this is the 12th verse of the 17th chapter it says like this so what we find knowledge and activity in the human society two things are necessary knowledge and activity so these two things are happening if you look at the goddess kali the tantrika afterwards another fraction another way of reaching to god another way of understanding the truth is tantra in the tantra power the lord's power so they gave the form of a mother ma kali have you noticed the from her west their hands are hanging human hands why karma the karma and gyana so these are combined so creation is happening and the moment we are performing the karma the way we are doing in a manner we are doing naturally producing different results in the trita yuga actually this started happening the rituals in the form of yagya became prominent in the in the satya yuga it is only meditation it is only omkara there is no other rituals now the trita yuga according to bhagavata purana vishnu the vishnu means all-pervading god vishnu means all pervading that all pervading conception is there but to help people to concentrate there was the yankthya and this yangyang is a fire the human mind the simple way they don't like to do it they'll go on increasing these that paraphernalia and make it more complicated because the human mind simple thing they don't understand they don't like if you go to a doctor doctor looks at you and say oh nothing has happened go and take some banana it will be all right you are not satisfied banana every day i am taking banana if the doctor say oh no go and have this taste and you have to spend nearly two thousand three thousand dollar then another after month you get the appointment you go to the doctor then god doctor is checking then after all this thing he says eat banana and you are satisfied after spending five thousand dollars that is the complication is they are always present in the human mind we have to understand the simple thing bhagavan sirama krishna said call god as a child is calling for a mother we are not satisfied anything else what should i do shall i not practice austerity shall i not fast simple thing but we don't like that so the god created the yakya and it was so simple but afterwards nowadays if you go all the brahmanas they will be making it so complicated so the lord buddha came and protested against that then it all goes on everything goes on in this way so ritual in the form of the yagya became prominent in the place of four practices of dharma what were the four practices tapa showca daya so if you practice that then you realize god you are transformed into that beautiful wonderful god conception is god again and again people will ask have you seen god as if some object that you go and see it is not it is the quality that is all all the time inherent there you have to manifest those qualities in the satya yuga they said tapa satya that is the purity forgiveness truthfulness austerity now the next yuga people were not satisfied okay now start practicing your yanka then pouring the oblation then doing this and different type of mantra developed different gods and goddesses came all this thing came from so in trita yuga from the cosmic body birat cosmic body of the supreme lord four burners and four astramas manifested those who are not hindu those who don't have the idea of this hinduism or the sanatana dharma for them this is little confusing the majority of the people they don't have the caste system it is only hindu they don't have the astra system it is in the hindus of course now they mother hindu they don't bother about their majority they are not practicing but still it was there how it came and why it came this is very very interesting in the bhagavad-gita we don't find these we only hear so dharma your own responsibility swa dharma but wherefrom the sadharma came what are those responsibilities very clearly the same bhagavan krishna in the bhagavata he is explaining and he said that from the mouth of the virata what is this biracter the birther is the combination of the some all the total body all this body that we see right from the ant or maybe and maybe i can say and up to the supreme great rishi all this together and the reflection of the consciousness that is there in each and every being total that is called virata so sometimes those who read the biography of krishna you know salaam krishna couldn't pluck the flower because the moment he was thinking that i should plug the flower to offer it to the kali he found that the flower has already been offered to the birard the sanskrit word virata means all pervading huge so that biraat so from that bidata as if the barna and astrama these are the two words i'll request you to remember one is the burna another is the asrama so four so we are having four yugas then four burners and four asramas so all these four it comes the what is that four ba varna first we'll say burner from the mouth of the great manifested god bidata is the manifested god from the mouth of the virata sprang brahmana then came from the arms of the virata came the shatriyas from the thighs of the virata came boys and from the feet of the virata should that there is a stoutrage in that the people that developed the rishis and the holy people they composed in a nice way so that we can understand this but in bhagavata a simple way they say this burnas different categories of people they sprang just like that so it came from that also the asrama astra means the whole life of a human being was they thought it is a hundred years then they divided into four parts again and the first part is the brahmacharya then goddess then sannyasa so these four again the astra asam of where the people are leaving and varna the responsibility that they are performing so this is the difference the people are living in a particular position in the life the life span it has been accepted as hundred years maybe more so how 25 years the first 25 is the brahmacharya student's life then from 26 to 50 against the goddess the life and they'll be householder then again from 51 to a 75 it goes like to the bana plus the retired people and from then onwards is sannyasa this is the four steps stages of life according to the temperament that the people should follow we'll come to that maybe we'll take one or two classes to explain this but this is very important particularly for those to understand what is this burna and what is this asrama so the burners first was the brahmana because they came from the mouth of that virata god why we will understand that afterwards what are the responsibilities the dharma of the brahmanas then from the arms the shatria why again the god given all details then the from the thigh of the guard came the bushes and the feet here the comes from the heart of the god comes the brahmacharya then from the thigh comes the grihastha householder then from the chest calm banaprasthi the retired after the retirement and then from the head the monastic life sannyasa so four barnas and four astrama then the lord declared in the clear terms the qualities of different burners this is important what are the qualities of the burners responsibilities of the burners the qualities of burner control of mind this is the fast if one says that i am a brahmana the first thing is the control of the mind shama control of the senses dhamma the contemplations is a stupa cleanliness containment santosha forbearance shanti straightforwardness arjubam devotion bhakti compassion daya truthfulness satyam so these are the total qualities of a brahmana anyone claiming that i am a brahmana must have this only some trades hanging from from the on the shoulder is not a brahmarka brahmana only keeping the tough and then going and doing some puja is not a brahmana brahmana means qualities the human being is nothing but the qualities and the fast and foremost is the control of the senses mind and sense organs that is the brahmana shama and then stopper contemplation they will be constantly the brahma if we read the biography of sudama krishna a little portion comes about sirama krishna's father sudhiram and he was agrihasthi but he was a brahmana so the brahmana if we like to know what type of people they should be righteous straight forward very frank and without any fear they will practice there the one gentleman came to suramar krishna's father he was he was the landlord of that area the litigation was going on so he knew that this particular person should chat is respected for his truthfulness satya he he told him gave him the offer you only say one word in favor of me in the court before the judge and i will give you lot of wealth and if you don't do it it threatened him being a owner of this whole area i am going to snatch away all that you are having i will throw you on the street you know what he did he never gave up the truthfulness that is called brahmana that is called satya and he was having and very prosperous way grahasta dharma grasthastrama he was even today if you go that particular place a little part of it our devotees they have purchased and developed an astronomer over there you can go and listen you can see for yourself how used to live you know in the villages they were having the cows they were having the pond the fishes and they were having the paddy fields even naturally it was everything was there and a very nice life they used to live comfortable life but in just because he didn't say that untruth the false in favor of that landlord they forced him to leave everything over there and with his wife and children he was on the street not knowing where to go and look at the wife also chandravani devi she was also a very righteous lady and she told whatever happens to our life even the death we are not going to birth from the responsibility of a brahmana we won't tell the lies whatever happens and that is called brahmana if one wants to say that i am a brahmana should know whether they are having these qualities or not the control of the mind shama control of the senses dhamma contemplation and the brahmanas they are very clean neat and clean the house and their body their clothes the way they leave very neat and clean it must be otherwise it cannot be a brahmana very dirty way wearing the clothes without washing and it cannot be a brahmana so one should understand before putting a finger and complaining against this caste system one should understand who created this caste system and why he created so this we understand that a great wonderful people they are the leaders the thinkers of the society think tank nowadays they use that word think tank they wear that this to leave that live holy life very contemplated life very sad and all the time happy life and then they used to inspire the other people in the society so they were the brahmanas then the second qualities of the shatriya after the brahmana comes the shatriya fast and foremost quality is the taja indomitable spirit in the shatriyas indomitable spirit then the strength of the balam the patience driti valor then fortitude titiksha broad-mindedness odaryam enterprising uttama and steadiness respect for the holy people brahman and leadership is are the qualities of the shatriyas and majority of the shatrias only shatter because of their ego and they think that they're keeping a big moustache and putting on the costly dress is the shattriya wrong so that is why again and again i feel the more i grow more i think that when we are complaining we are complaining without knowing when we are criticizing the system that the god lord himself introduced we are criticizing without knowing and by that way we are destroying a beautiful system in the human society the god developed that so the ultimately these people they go back to him and going back to god means the peace the joy the happiness so here we find the patience you know that story in the mahabharata the karna wanted to learn the special type of the war and he went to vigo big was a though he's a brahmana but he it took up the arms to fight with the shatrias because the shattriyas became very egoistic and they were trying to break the society's law so we think the bhrigu and there is a bad person no so he actually considered as an avatar why he was establishing the dharma the dharma means that all different groups should practice their own responsibilities so that dharma anyway the karna he went to the bhrigu bhrigu by birth he was a brahmana and he was fighting for the cause of the brahmanas to bring back the respect of the brahmanas from the shatrias in this context when he went so naturally he said see i teach only the brahmana boys i can understand that you are a very good student but i don't teach the shatria people i teach only the brahmanas karna told lies gardner said i am a brahmana and ok they accept it because he said that and then it continued the training was completed the last day that karna will be graduating uh from that training so guru said i like to sleep keeping my head on your thigh on your lap so karma sat the guru lied down and they were he was sleeping and he was sleeping profoundly when suddenly one insect started entering into the body of the karna and his terrible pain was there the insect was cutting through the whole thigh you can imagine it's going on cutting through from one side to another karna could get up no he didn't do that because the great respect for the guru the guru is sleeping he now i should not disturb guru so he was bearing that pain after that the guru got up and saw that you know immediately he said you cannot be a brahmana you must be a shatriah so bearing that pain it is not possible for anyone else but the shatria then he said whatever you have learned that you can use but when the ultimate time will come you will be in front of the death you will forget all this training that i gave to you so this is the qualities of the shatria the satrias should have the valor and they should protect the whole society they should have great respect for the brahmanas friends i went to some places where i found even today the soldiers indian soldiers i went to some border i was in arunachal pradesh i went to that border that the soldiers are so respectful and some of the indian so far i knew they don't disclose these are all secret things they practice jungle warfare so the all young the soldiers will come recruits will come they will practice the jungle warfare they will go inside the jungle like that months after months they will leave over there without water and food how they survive i do not know one day so happened when i was there it was the winter night midnight suddenly i found a big group of indian soldiers so they were there but when they saw me in the gerua in the beginning they couldn't understand but when they came to the light and they saw me in gerua immediately the leader he respected me and there was a image at the statue of swami vivekananda vivekananda is well known to everyone so one young soldier came running to report to his office and said there's a statue of swami vivekananda immediately whole thing changed so you are the followers of vivekananda so they respect it so this respect is always there for the holy people that is the the valor that is the courage and that is the quality of the shatriyas now it comes to boise who are these boys who can be considered as bhusha first is faith in god astikya if you go to any of our business houses you will find the most of the houses very beautiful wonderful the buildings but the moment you enter there is a small temple of ganesha so they believe if the ganesha is there he is the shiddhi dhata he will give all the success to my endeavor so the astikkya that is there then donna charity the business people they always do the dhana if you read the the biography of the live life of our lord buddha all rich people switch tea this to support him this to feed his children their disciples so this dhana even today all this business community they are helping people humility odamba if you talk to them they're always very humble service to holy people brahmasavanam they always do like that capacity toward money artha they have the capacity that is the specialty as the satrias they know how to fight they are courageous and the bushes they know how to earn money it is not for all and the special quality that they are busiest always remain dissatisfied that is a very peculiar characteristics of a boshya he's not satisfied he has earned so much so much so much still dissatisfied nowadays a group of people they're enlisting the richest person in the world all the business community business people they try to be in that list and they're very happy if they are there maybe the third the fourth can you imagine of all the people of the world they are in the fourth they are so rich but they are dissatisfied why i am not fast and once you become the first next year also you like to be there this satisfaction is one of the characteristics of the boys then comes the sudra the tendency to serve and remain satisfied with whatever they achieve some people are there they don't have the effort to reach the higher pleasure they can come they can become a vaishya they can become a sudra they're shattriya they can become a brahmana even if they acquire these qualities obviously it is not that what a tight compartment you can never come of course the other people don't like them to come naturally it's natural but you have to fight back you have to gain knowledge and you have to go into that position you can do that so that is the brahmana position one can achieve so friends these the way it was going then the lord said in the 20th verse there are some people they are not coming into this any any category the four categories brahmana shatriya basha sudra apart from these four categories they're a group of people and they are ashokam their uncleanliness they remain they're always unclean and physically mentally on rhythm always say the falsehood false thing stim they don't hesitate to take away others things nasty come they do not believe in god or any holy life they're very cold some any little thing they will be happy to call and fight with others karma full of lust growth full of anger tarshish they have this tendencies beyond the forecast that this type of people they don't come to any class and that is called jabana in the hinduism they always say jabana what is this javana sometimes they say javana means other religious no that word was used javana is these people the auspicia in sanskrit they will say don't touch me because if you go to this type of people because of their the way of living because of their thought you will be affected that is why they call auspritia a spirit sometimes in a in a society sometimes the misusing of the things are always there so naturally some people will come to rectify that the our gandhiji came he wanted to remove that aspirishata bhagavatam krishna himself also but whom we we should avoid sometimes some people used to visit bhagavan ramakrishna when they will come and they enter into the rooms ramakrishna is to shrink like that and when that person will leave he will ask the others to pour ganga water on that particular place why because this type of people they are constantly telling the false thing and then the or unclean they are non-believer they're qualsam they're full of lost anger and greed so this type of people they should one should not entertain the i should conclude by saying that the lord with this today and then we'll continue we have discussed about the burners and the responsibilities and the next class we will discuss about the astronauts how to understand and what are the practices that the every astronaut should do let me conclude all the four burners that we have discussed apart from that god has given the some qualities that every human society should follow every human should follow what is that ahimsa all they should practice non-injury aimsa truthfulness satyam non-stealing austerium free from last akama anger and greed akroda and lobata and always active to help others to always try to help others for their betterment these are the dharma of all burners friends sometimes people when they criticize dharma they should know these at least this part of bhagavata they can read the 17th chapter and 21 words this is the dharma of the human being the dharma definition tarati dharma it holds and how it is holding with these wonderful qualities otherwise what will happen the jungle the law of the jungle if you have the might you can survive no human society is completely different and swami vivekananda very nicely puts like this he said in the beginning you were animals now you have become the human and your goal is to become the god so that is the journey of the human and how religion dharma and swami vivekananda again says religion is a process that makes a brutal man man unto god and dharma means keeping the words keeping the vows keeping the promises thank you very much let us chant this mantra and conclude today's talk is there any question is there there are many questions yeah so the first question is necessary for realization yes tanya that is sure a bhakta through his devotion he goes and completely merge into the god and forget the that person his own person the obvious call the samadhi niribi kalpa samadhi means the samadhi the marching into or becoming one with the consciousness without the help of any object now you use the word bhakta bhakta means there is a god and if you can understand that god your god is nothing but the all-pervading consciousness of course through the devotion you can march into that consciousness and that can be called as an id because quickly i will give you the hint bhagavan sirama krishna was worshiping goddess kali and if you read the biography you will know and he was as a devotee praying to god worshipping god goddess that is kali then ultimately when his devotion becomes the extreme then the goddess kali appeared before him how not as that image but as the light effulgent light and all complaints all pervading everywhere so that is called nirvikalpa there's no kalpa no object but merging into that consciousness yes i will say yes to your question so the next question is from how do we take rebirth once we merge with god do we take birth again no the the if you know manohar that is your question is once we merge into that god do we take the rebirth no the birth the rebirth comes from the desire that some people are there who like to come back to have a part of the game of the god so they come back even after realization of the god and sometimes some very high spiritual personalities they god send them back to work for the people they call avataras their different categories are there but your question when you go back to god and margin god and forget your personality no there is no coming back i will give the example if a drop of water falling in the ocean can that particular drop come back from that ocean again the water will vaporize again the water will become an another drop of water will fall but that cannot be said that particular drop first fell into ocean and merged so no no coming back the next question is from srima biswas srimati is saying what is ego how do we how we escape from it ego is very difficult to explain but everybody is having everyone is having that i-ness you know that when you say i so that is called ego and how to go beyond this bhagavad-gita krishna taught very nicely you have it is very difficult to go beyond that because all our suffering all our births because of that particular ego but though it is no basis actually so how to eradicate how to go back krishna said turn it towards god say i am the daughter of god i am the son of god ego but it goes to god and then whatever you are doing the god god god by that way only we can be free from the ego the good question thank you next question is from samir kumar chatterjee samir bhagwa is asking i have found that satya raja character in me is it possible yes there is satya raja tama not only you everyone everyone is having these three goonas and it may be the variation maybe that they are in a 25 percent 50 percent like that but some people who are very good people very holy people they may be having their special that sattva guna little more and another good people but a little egoistic i am doing for you i am having these etc they will help you they will guide you and all that but i am doing there's a raja is little more and tama of course they will never help you so it complete tama is a very rare type of people whom we call auspritia just now i concluded with that aspiration but these three gunas are present in every human being our goal should be to develop to go or increase sattvagona but then finally we have to give up the satyaguna also to become liberated thank you the next question is from dev jani thor she's asking is it possible that kali yuga can come after no sorry satya yes that that is the you'll be very happy that whether you believe it or not we believe because swami vivekananda said the swamiji said from the days bhagavan siddharama krishna took birth shatta yuga began again kali yuga is over sometimes some people give the picture the kali yuga means very bad everything will be they will kill everyone etc etc but if you can you can explain in this way the kali is coming on a horseback and which a sword in his hand some people they are describing it is the symbol of damsha destruction why it can be speed and knowledge kohli is coming in the if you have seen that just in imaginary picture who will go and take the snap of the kohli so kohli is coming on a horseback horse is a symbol of speed look at the present day so much speed i am sitting in chicago i am talking to you and immediately you can not only hear you can see me isn't it trinidad not only the speed the sword that the kohli is carrying is the symbol of knowledge cutting the ignorance and the knowledge had it been possible if that knowledge was not there the technology was not there to reach you like this so the curly has come kohli is going on and in kohli some bad qualities will be there some death will be there but it is also good because it is so slowly fading out and again the people they are loving to listen to the holy talks they are loving to practice the spirituality there is also so many people they are writing to us and we are sending them the books why so many people so slowly it is satya yuga is also coming i believe thank you the next question is from shauna croix shauna babu is asking what is advai brahman is it duality bard concept uh i couldn't get to it can we read it again so no 2 it is 1 and then brahman that is called supreme brahmanda parama brahma so advaya brahma means that parama brahma the supreme brahma the inactive brahman so bhagavan sriram krishna again said the brahman when inactive is called shiva and brahman when active creating sustaining so it's called kali like that i think that may be the question the next question is from czech made diabetes why did why did god create a world with so much suffering normally the answer given is karma but not even a leaf moves without the will of god so why is a human to be blamed for all his mistakes and suffering if you have listen to me today's talk in the beginning itself i told the latest first know what is the truth then we will enter into the discussion so who has created the human being god didn't i say why human being are different because god has given three different qualities to them the who gave dharma or the teaching of the righteousness god again and what happened when they practice and listen to god go back to godhead then ultimately it is god in different forms if you can see in this way then there will be no contradictory i don't know whether you know bengali or not rabindranath tagar he mentioned it in a very nice way tomari deva pranay tomari deva dukkha tumari deva money tomari anubhaba it is your mind and it is your feeling and it is your karma and that you are suffering so it is all god only try to think in this way but at the same time also imbibe the spirit the god has given this teaching that i should become god and i should follow that so try to do that so dharma what is this responsibility try to follow that the next question is srima vishwas what is the name of avatar in satya yuga there was in that way there was no avatar in so that is the industry ramachandra came afterwards in satya yuga all people as today we have discussed in satya yuga all people were known as hamsa they were all the very good people just like very very holy people so it was not necessary to calm the god to come to guide them when the dharma the righteousness the guidance the people are not following then the god is taking the human form and appearing before them to guide in satya yuga it was not necessary the next question is from milan we talked about that was saying how will we maintain our swatharma in 21st century why not 20th century 21st century the swadharma means you know the whatever the responsibility we take that is about so dharma now my brother he is in the world he is a grihasti householder so he is performing his dharma as a householder and in the next class in the next sunday we will discuss about that what are the householders duties and how they should leave now i from the same parent same same family i have become a monk my responsibility my swadharma is to dharmapalam dharma shiksha to practice the the righteousness and also to teach righteousness to the society i am doing that from the same family two brothers but one in this way one is that way you have to understand what is your swa dharma and you should try to practice that the next question is from mishti gopali mrd is asking does the atman carry samskara or samskara are in the mind we are not the mind but we are the atma so does one carry samskara to next birth if you think that you are not mind then you are already liberated and as long as you are thinking that means you have a mind otherwise i will you will think so when you are thinking and cognizing that means your mind is there and mind is having four parts and in the four parts your chitta is the storehouse so obviously this storehouse is a part of your sukshma subtle body so after the death it carries that and atma that we say individual atma is the reflection of the consciousness on our intellect the vedantic term so i should say either this terminologies about the vedanta we should be very clear then only otherwise we mix up the ideas thank you the last question is from tanya tanya is asking swamiji thank you for your wonderful words i wish to know that when we go beyond dharma that is beyond worldly matters do we enter spirituality uh beyond dharma that is righteousness you know the righteous beyond dharma we go that is called the nirvana we can use this word nirvana but before that before we are merging into that and what happens after merging into that no one can say again i will quote from sirama krishna he said one the doll made of salt when to fathom the water of the ocean from the ocean only salt comes from the salt that it doll became as if that doll when go is going to that water to ocean is naturally becoming ocean itself melting into that same way when you cross the dharma reach the ultimate then there is nothing remains nothing so in the ram prasad he said understanding these that everything is nothing but the maid of god i have given up both dharma and adarma and what is other man what is dharma when i understand that everything is nothing but the made of god so we have to understand that but at this moment as long as i is there we have to practice dharma thank you very much now let us chant this mantra and conclude [Music] foreign om peace peace peace unto all may you all be happy and healthy and remain very courageously you have to face this time now is going on this shall also pass as they say in english this shall also pass so try to develop spirituality in this time thank you very much you
