[Bhagavatam 073 : God and His Miraculous Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPvNVn-Y5WU)

Namaskar dear devotees dear friends let us begin the very bottom and bhagavata as usual we will chant the mantra and then start Shantaram gujja gursha unum but non of solution be sure Dharam Goggin Assad regime mingi burnham Xu Hungama Lakshmi contemn Kamala jnanam you give me dianna cambium Bundy Vishnu babu-bhaiya harem Sarah Valu quicker he's the master of all Lukas cerebral Luke we cannot am NOT is the master sorry belukha what is the server Luka in very very broad sense we can say serger Martha and potala of course there are so many patellas are there then the different circles are there and so naturally the serger Marta potala or Selva lokanathan he is the master of everything everywhere and he is Shanta is quite calm he is the creator but at the same time he is quiet he has come when the creation at the time of creation when someone is creating something there is a rajo-guna usually that reveals activity so rajo-guna prevails but at the same time we find the Supreme Lord the Creator he is not that we agitate it or rajo-guna sump'n he's calm and composed why he's thinking and the creation is coming so that is the reason so we are many times we have read the meaning of this now today we will go to that passage where the Lord will be giving us the list of the supernatural power a devotee can have a devotee I'm using the world but the devotee true devotion become a yogi usually we know there is a beauty powder beauty powder in the Patanjali Yoga darshan and the beauty powder there are so many varieties of power that comes in strong awakened in his Raja yoga there also he has described all this power almost the same power but the devotee can also develop this power so that is the speciality and in the Bhagavata he is telling and we know whatever in one point of time he asked how to meditate in one what aspect and in what form if we are meditating how to meditate second do we need a form or without form and if it is a form what kind of form so that was the question - rudaba asked and the lord supreme the krishna he gave the answer and he said that you should meditate on the Bishnu shankha chakra got a padma bonham allah beeboo shittim so that bonham allah vivo shittim he is decorated with the beautiful flowers at the girl and the flowers and shankha chakra got a Padma that is the best news the four hands on that you can meditate or any God so you can meditate on on God so that is the asana pranayama that also he taught how to sit and how to control the breathing and then we draw the mind from the same subjects and concentrate on the Supreme God which form without form is very difficult those who are practicing without form it is so difficult it is possible but difficult our goal is to concentrate the mind so why not take the help of the form and when the Lord is prescribing so that is why the Lord said that is better that you first practice how to sit because you have to keep the body erect for a long time you have to keep the body still so you need to see that is the process of posture of seating different ever it's called asana in sanskrit and the hata Yogi's they have developed so many varieties of asanas so asanas are there whatever is comfortable those who are not being able to see it squirting on the floor they can sit on any chair not very soft not very hard a comfortable chair but we should see that our back is straight for the meditation that is very essential and keep the back straight and our sana meditate and then another thing that disturb our mind is our breathing and in sanskrit it is pranayama prana the breathing control yama control so the pranayama the breathing control why because we know the power general knowledge and experience when you are running we breathe so fast and when you were sitting it becomes slow when you are sleeping it goes much slower so when we are slowly slowly controlling the breathing and then almost so slowly it goes then it is not disturbing our mind so these are the first two processes third we drawing the mind from the same subjects and then go add the mind we will keep we are withdrawing from the outer all objects and then keeping on the beautiful form of the Lord that is why Hindus they have introduced different forms the Buddhists in the beginning the Lord said Atma Depot Baba you must be your own light don't meditate on any object the giana Yogi's they're also not meditating on any objects but again they are making themselves as an object and in the Buddhism slowly slowly different type of forms have come particularly the Tibet Buddhism different forms have come there is not possible today and then sometimes they will meditate on some jinnah some that like the we can say that the dopes or the cross or Omkara they're like this different type of symbols are there so they Jinnah they will meditate here the Lord said meditate on the beautiful form of God as because of your withdrawing the mind and if we can keep the mind at a straight beautiful form and then also the Guru's they have introduced the Manas aputure mentally you are performing the rituals washing the feet of the Lord and then offering flower and sandal paste then putting the girl and then burning the incense sticks and also chanting before him offering the food and you were imagining that you and your Lord and one around so that is also process of meditation and slowly slowly it goes back and when this meditation is possible so that we can say that meditation on my beautiful form first he said the from the form it goes we doubt from how firstly but now the Lord is telling you are meditating on my beautiful form and when the form is you can imagine very perfectly and it says that you must meditate on the feet of the Lord first then slowly his body then his face then the whole body the one two three there is the four there's a four step then you can imagine on a beautiful lotus flower maybe sometimes it is rate sometimes it is white the Lord is sitting and you can imagine he is sitting reading your heart and you can see his face and he's looking at you and that benign face that attracts him completely this is the way the meditation goes slowly slowly slowly the Lord is teaching the second step will be forget the whole body forget the flower the body only the face and then ultimately the sometimes the gurus the teach only to I is looking at you and nothing not even the complete face only two eyes so we began with the flower and all other things for the puja for the ceremony and the God is sitting the feet and the body the face now ultimately goes to two eyes of the God the beautiful eyes looking at you and then finally it says forget that too and you the person who is meditating marching with the God the object of your meditation so this is the way the God is teaching the meditation very simple but this meditation gives a wonderful effect to ultimate merging with the God how light you can see that you are not the body you are light and you are marching with that wonderful light that is God God that the object of the God that we were seeing his form now there is only light and nothing else and the one who is meditating on that God also become the light and merges into that so that is the way the duality one can reach to the monism are we can say become one that is the ultimate so Shri Krishna's teaching meditation step by step we can now just to remind us sit properly first is the seat then regulate the breathing the second third we draw the mind from the external objects and concentrate on the beautiful form of God fourth forget the whole body only concentrate and visualize the face and the eyes then the change meditation wit form to read out form by thinking that the Lord is a divine light and finally march into that divine light and forget that you are meditating become one with that Supreme Being so Dion and data the in sanskrit DC deanna the process of meditation that we have learned data the person who is meditating the eye are you dear the object of meditation that is the god and now it is the divine light so it is merging completely there are some many many people they like to learn the meditation can you please teach meditation a lot of leakers to come this is very simple the people they are developing in different form and different way so to make people interested but this is very simple and the Lord God's we Krishna he is teaching so obviously in a very perfect way we can learn it what happened when one become perfect in meditation that is the discussion that we promised that we will do this time jeetendra Jie Hyuk Tasya Natasha Sasha yoginah ha we re at a cheetah who put his 10 T City AHA city city means that the in Sanskrit is a city austere CD other like that the CDs means the success or the power supernatural power it comes that to supernatural power in the book 11 chapter 14 verse 40 secretion I described the form of Vishnu so that one can meditate on the beautiful form then the verse 42 to 46 this five verses we have just discussed in the first verse of the chapter 15 lost Krishna he just now I quoted from there he is describing the how to control and then when you control you get the supernatural power the Lord said sit down or star - a prokta 18 power 18 different powers are there sit down or stir the Shiprock the cities have been described as 18 by those who are perfect in yoga dhaarana yoga power ye those who were perfect in yoga and they got this 18 power and then only now sometime the modern people the doubt they say this is not this this is not that it cannot be sometimes you see without any practice but now we can understand how the Yogi's could predict how the Yogi's could know all these which is where everything because of this power when we are controlling the nature and a power comes within the person who is controlling meditating so meditation the power of meditation we cannot imagine so much of power and one person can have it for what are the powers first are the eight powers that the God directly gave he says it is directly associated with me eight powers then comes the ten hours where the God is not giving but the yogi when he is developing is SWAT tika quality that is is good qualities we can say the best qualities the purity then he achieves so eight and ten total 18 first is anima my Newton Asst yogi can make his body in the size of an atom when he read this we think how it is possible but this is yoga and if you have read the Ramayana those who have read you know at the behest of the Sri Ramachandra Hanuman was crossing the ocean and when he was crossing he made one devil who said that you have to pass through my mouth then only you can reach to the soul of the Lanka and that is mandatory you have to pass through my mouth and it is not possible the way you were entering into that mouth immediately that he will close it and to eat you Hanuman I said okay no problem the he then fathom the huge mouth and who navona the great yogi that's why Swami Vivekananda said it cannot be the monkey of a tree an animal no is the yogi yogi only can have this power how a monkey can have that monkey cannot control their mind the yogi means perfect control of the mind and the first thing that he he's getting as a power of his control is the aneema aneema is a minut nurse hanuman became so tiny he just entered and came out of the mouth and this demon could not close them out and naturally Hanuman said I entered I came out you couldn't catch me so now you have to allow me to go is in there is a story form so obviously the modern mind may say there is doubt but this is possible to make the body so subtle this is possible second Mahima Mahima immensity is a huge say mana mana the yogi he can increase his body and if you read the Ramayana again and again these powers that the owner showed over there though we can see some people came to the the Ariston you mana in Rama another story Hanuman has reached another Shore and naturally the Ravana wanted to arrest him so those people came to arrest Hana Hana became so big so huge so how to find him it was not possible the whole state the country was not having that long rope to bind it man the hanno monitored no let me go and make the Robin and see how is he so that I can go back and report to my master Sri Ramachandra properly so again he became normal to tired him took him and before the in the court of the Robin ER and rabiner was sitting on the throne on the heart and that was naturally high most of us we know from the movies and the pictures and the King is sitting on a high pedestal on the throne and all other servant below that was the system of the Kings Court Hanuman arraigned and he found that Robin is sitting on high and under throne and he as a representative history Rama Chandra if he is standing on the floor it doesn't look good but no one is going to give him that high seat what to do he started increasing his till and it makes so big it became equal on the same level of the Ravana and he sit on that to the funny stories we read and we enjoy and then he forget but if forget that this is the power of the yoga and this is possible so immensity Mahima the anima and the Mahima this is possible then laghima lagina means lightness anima Mahima and laghima am i am giving you the sanskrit name because that is very interesting and if you can understand can remember the sanskrit name you know the meaning of course that is called laghima there is a lightness you he become very light whole body start floating those the students of the Wannsee ramakrishna you know in his biography some of his disciples particularly his young disciple the knot was very eager to take a photograph cinema Krishna was not very interested in the photograph but because of the Narendra and northern there's frame Sri Ramakrishna's too loving also so they were going on requesting we need a photo now the new camera has come so we must get it photo he agreed one day those who have visited the Dakshina sure you can imagine the goddess Kali the mother Kali's temple then is the Bishnu temple in the Vishnu temple at that particular area that is paved with black and white marble the cross-checked and if you notice carefully majority of the photos they have now changed those things now because of the modern things they can change previously we have seen the original photo you will find the ceramic it is sitting on that floor the marble floor and the black and white marble that is very clear he was sitting Cabinda that God at the back and when he sat and they were arranging the camera in those days the old that old-fashioned camera the particular the cameraman used to go behind a cloth and then hues to give a flash and the light will burst and the smoke will go but then only so that photo can be taken so it was a long process so obviously salam o krishna was waiting and you can imagine his mind the moment he sat he went into deep meditation and he's the face particularly we can we can see the mouth slowly turned to one side now I don't know probably not or Vivekananda someone or the cameraman himself he came to make it right position so cameraman perhaps he came to see then afterwards he saw us because his kilted is just a snake is little left side then he came and wanted to make it alright the moment he touched the chin and wanted to force it to make it in the right position the whole body came on his finger Sri Ramakrishna's whole body he lifted just because he was touching the chin and making is all right and the whole body lifted from the and he became so much afraid he left it so this laghima the moment one is meditating the whole power goes in such a way his body becomes so light so that is exactly that we can understand these are not simple words these are the truth these are the facts it happened then comes the property in the property attainment through senses any object can be achieved any object can be achieved through sensors that is called property you know because of these unless and until one is having the special control tremendous control on his mind so obviously they anything you like to do you can do I have heard I have not read anywhere that one of our Swami ji he was doing the general secretary of the Ramakrishna order he went to visit the kamar puku center and there another Swami's it all was the same age they were friends the strolling outside and they saw a poor villager maybe that he was having some skin disease or something he was sitting by the side of the road the second show me of the kamar poker he had the power to heal who seen that condition his emotion rose and he thought maybe he thought that to heal that man through that mantra Shakti the power of the mantra when he started chanting that mantra to heal that man the other Swami was the design Journal circuitry immediately understood his mind and saved this is not our job don't disturb the prakruti don't disturb the nature he is having all these things because of his karma Fela as because you have acquired some power don't disturb the nature now whether it is good or bad wide if you have the power you could make him all right that is a different argument but my point that this is possible one was trying to do it just mentally he was thinking the other how could he understand that and say you should not do it so that is property through the senses it is possible there are so many examples are there in the life of Raghavan see Ramakrishna the moment you are trying to do something good you just think and that comes to you it happens to many people those who are practicing meditation and concentrating it happens automatically it happens and then come bra Kamiya broken your capacity to enjoy everything physical or subtle capacity to enjoy everything physical or subtle suppose someone has heard that something is there he has not seen that only hard and he heard that it is there sitting in one place he can enjoy that particular thing if he wishes and it is possible that is called prac amia capacity to enjoy everything physical or subtle physically of course it is possible and certainly also it is possible the Ramprasad he was as a great sage and he was a tantric but the Tantra as we know he'll be going to the secluded place and not like that the he'll be practicing austerity in the burning heart not like that he was having a small beautiful image of Kali in his own home and he used to worship that and he dedicated his whole mind into that but it was a family man he was having a daughter wife the wife came and said I am sorry to inform you we don't have anything to cook today I don't know what I'm going to offer it to you and to God and to my daughter and the wives are so dedicated they never talk about or think about themselves she is thinking the lady is thinking what to cook so that I can offer it to God and to my husband and to my daughter the child Ramprasad in pray to the mother divine mother and those who know the Ram Prasad the song he told oh my mother give me some money and I promised that I don't forget you because the moment the comfort comes the money comes people usually forget God the Kunti great prayer Kunti told I want to pray to you O God to Krishna the toll give me all the time trouble so that I remember you the moment I am in comfortable life I would forget you that is a different wave the very great that was the love for God is so much they forget everything and they want to remember God and for that they are ready to accept all the miseries and pains and sufferings and here the RAM Porsche told give me some money but I promised mother I won't forget you a mighty motto bill daddy I mean Nemo Karim noise shankari so that pro karma the moment he thought like that he got a job and then he started earning money but his mind was completely dedicated to that mother so she he could not maintain the office accounts and all that but the landlord the who gave the employer was very happy it'll you need not to do anything I will give you the salary you only come and sing in the glory of God in the glory of mother that will be sufficient so it goes and one who is practicing meditation always get this opportunity anything and everything he can enjoy just by thinking then he/she tois capacity to influence and control anything and any being capacity to influence and control to anyone that is called a sheet wah this is the seventh power that the God can give and through the meditation and when that power comes we know the in the life of Lord Buddha the Lord Buddha was walking and it was the jungle then the villagers they told said you should not go because there is a person and his dacoit he will kill you and not only that he will cut your finger and by that way he's keeping the account of how many people he has robbed of and how many people he has killed there's a terrible man you should not go in but the smiled and said let me see and he entered into that and that ferocious P person also came made him and many of you know that story in the life of Lord Buddha the ungli mala he was transformed into a holy person the Buddhist stood before him talk to him and whole thing changed so capacity to influence and control anything and any being another I just remember the rothsburgher bans Ramakrishna he used to visit in Calcutta back badger that area and he used to go to a lady she was so devoted salam Krishna's to guide her but her brother taught this Brahmin maybe they slowly influenced my sister and we will acquire hapa party she was we do thinking that her brother arranged the attack we can say every strong man on in those days and till go and talk to see Ramakrishna and frighten him if necessary to beat him see Rama Krishna usually used to go with all the devotees that particular day he was all alone and when he entered into that Lane that the small narrow the road one gentleman came he was a very strong powerful and he came and stood before Ramakrishna to threaten him the in-state Cinema Kushner touched his chest with one finger and the promoter Gunda be completely changed so these are the stories that we read in the lives of the great soul of what are these the power this power is called Ishita mr. Mukesh never having all this power but he never showed it in the life of master Dada Moni Debby also there is an incident that when she was all alone as a widow in the kamar poker there one young man he went mad he was a devotee but when mad couldn't understand what he should do and what she should not and when the mother was alone coming back from after bathing in the pond he started chasing the mother you know that story mother started running and she was trying to hide itself but this man he found a game he went on chasing are ultimately our mother so soft so kind so she became so strong and pushed that young man of strain good great strength on the floor and then took his tongue in her hand and started slapping him what from the power come yogic power this call is she to our capacity to control and it is possible this is possible then come push it to a capacity of self-control this Kalba sheet Toa Shami be Wakonda when he was traveling all over the length and breadth of india in sanskrit it called parivrajaka they'll be the holy people they'll be traveling from one part to another carrying the the religion and culture and this to teach the morality that was the norm even today there are people constantly going but nowadays because of this the different type of way we can communicate over telephone over camera over the YouTube and all those things have come so we can communicate but still the people the Swami's they travel from different parts carrying with them different culture so the mixture of culture that we see in this vast and variety land of India is because of the Swami's the Shawnee become those walking and he was passing through a jungle and one day when he was sitting under a tree very angry and thinking what to do then suddenly he found that one tiger is approaching the when the tiger was approaching he quietly looked at that and afterwards jokingly said I told that tiger the other the disciples the actual meteor unit were you not afraid at that time no no I told the tiger see you are also angry I am also angry and I cannot eat you but you can eat me okay later some one of us become satisfied but the tiger didn't like me went away so can you imagine the self-control even at that time when there was no one as Tiger is approaching and the schwa me show me Vivekananda unperturbed never tried to save himself by climbing the tree and all that nothing this called self-control there are so many wonderful stories are there there's Ramakrishna static disciples in those days they had the habit of smoking from Hubble Baba that was a great fashion and and this the Bengali particularly and all over the India Hubble bubble was very popular smoking there and even when they used to go by boat and arrangement for the Hubble bubble was there the one direct disciple of bhagavati Ramakrishna shot at Mirage he became afterwards jamesha redonda and the first general secretary of the Ramakrishna order he was sitting and suddenly the storm came and the people thought those where the board that they are going to capsize and die and naturally people are shouting crying and addressing the boat man take the boat and to the shore and sabers like that then suddenly one noticed that this young boy shuddered he's smoking the other lover hey man what is this we are going to die and now he was smoking he said sir when in the normal time you people who are using this available I didn't get the opportunity now I'm smoking and now tell me what I should do if their boat capsized I will try to swim or whatever will happen happen why should I be in the anxiety self control that is called capacity to self control - there's no ordinary capacity sister these are all yogic capacity and ultimately out of the eight Karmapa Cerreta kama vicita the power to satisfy one any desire power to satisfy any desire come over Sita many of you know the stories of the trail anger swami here's a great sage see ramakrishna made him and many others also mainly used to leave in the Banaras kashi and on the bank of the river ganga used to leave never care and is to move here and there a living Shiva people noticed him whenever he is hungry he will go to the Ganga and he will cry like a child mother I'm hungry give me milk and they saw he's sticking out the water Ganga water and drinking and when he is drinking Ganga water is becoming milk in his palm so that is the power and trail unga Swami he was most of the time he used to float on the Ganga in the water is a huge body then one boat carrying the king of that place was going it was sailing on that trailing go swami he went in and caught that boat and went up nobody said anything because he was highly respected then he saw that the golden the the wonderful very costly sold that the king was having usually the king this to hold one sword trailing gachami wanted to see that the king gave him with great great respect he knew the Xiaomi and after seeing that for a minute or so he threw that into Ganga all of the people said whatever have you done then the Kings that the sword is so costly then just like a child in the great great game that is playing he is it you want that so he put the hand into the water and brought to exactly the same soul and showed it to the king now you choose which one is yours this is all the power of the yoga the friends now the as the god said he gives God gives direct power that is 8 that is anima my Newton s Mahima immensity laghima lightness property at attained mint proc amia capacity to enjoy anything chitra capacity to influence and control bashira capacity of self-control karma bizarre eita power to satisfy any desire now the Lord said and there are ten other power that comes as the purity grows into the yogi the first for power is power to control hunger and thirst the mainly those who practice the yoga they practice it Katia Baba there's another Saint in India he went and made his guru and guru is to live inside a cave he is in the Himalaya and this young man he went and told please teach me meditation then in the beginning he was refusing then now when he was going on pestering then he said okay this is the posture you should maintain and sit in front of the fire for a long long time the whole night you have to sit then the young boy is started sitting like that as it was cold outside the Guru was inside the cave and the disciples were outside he never allowed him to go in then after a few days he came out and said you should not burn the fire because you are getting lot of comfort so that was so cold and he said no it is the very much comfort there no fire sake just like that so obviously it is so cold and there's no little fire that was also not there and what to do he could not concentrate he was standing up you're sitting he was pacing up and down then the Guru told you were not sitting in one place and even if when you are sitting you are dozing so I will put a wooden belt around your waist so that you cannot lie down he cannot sit on that so that was a katya katya means the wood the Katya Baba afterwards the name like that the Guru gave him their and slowly slowly he developed the capacity to get beyond the suffering of coal and heat and sleep all that that is the Katya Baba the power to control hunger and thirst this is the way the practice power to hear from distance do rest Ravana do rest Ravana a yogi can hear many things and this comes if you are practicing sincerely the yoga meditation concentration one pointedness in any way may be in the path of yoga may be from the path of devotion may be from the path of knowledge the moment your mind become concentrated 1.8 all this power start coming one day from serum Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna he was very sick and he came to Calcutta for treatment those who read the biography of Sri Ramakrishna you know that is one place called shampoo core and he was there in one house there is known as shampoo cool party and that particular house has been given to Ramakrishna mission it is now a center of the ramakrishna mission and see ramakrishna was sitting some of the devotees they were also sitting in front of him suddenly he said this Surendra is crying as because of my ill health I cannot visit him and he is having the Durga Puja the celebration of the durga and he is crying because i cannot go over there you people please go it is nicely decorated so much of light is there he gave the complete description of the pandal that the surrender erected for the Durga Puja sitting far away he could hear the cry of the his disciple salindra Mitra when the other disciple went they saw exactly the Surendra he is crying and lamenting that his master is guru cannot visit him exactly how Ramakrishna could hear so this is the power and then third power power to transport body as swiftly as mind that is called mana Jabba in the Hanuman ji also if you read in his prana mantra mano Yaba did WorldCom you know yama means he can transport his body along with the mine mine can go and reach anywhere even when there is no visa and passport you can travel any country with the mind but your body cannot go my god he also because we are not Yogi's but the yogi can transport their body even there was a great person in Calcutta lahiri mahasaya this lady marsha used to work in a office his boss was a British gentleman and one day the light emotion noticed his boss is not very happy then he said sir can you please share what happened to you then he said what to say for a long time I am not getting any

the one Indian gentleman came he stood in front of me in a little distance and when I stood up and wanted to talk to him thinking that you're you have seen him with a message he banished I couldn't see him anywhere this happens and this is the power called mono Yabba the Duras Rana and mono Yabba the power to assume any form at will , rupam power to assume any form we know that in the life of Krishna and Rukmini they were sitting when the Ravana came to visit them Hana mana was the one-pointed devotee of sri ramachandra very very went he wanted to see that form of shri rama he knew this is the Krishna and Krishna and Rama are the same in essence but he wanted to see the form of Rama Chandra the Krishna told the Duke many you better take the form of Sita and I will take the form of Rama and they did and the only one who was so happy how it is possible that is the power gamma roopam the power to enter into any anyone's body for a kya probation kya means the body para kya it is not your own kya it's not your own body but you were entering into the body of someone else and it happened in the life of Shankar Acharya when he sat for in adi 'but the person he was debating was a married person so obviously he told you are the you were the person claiming that you have all knowledge right can you please give me the knowledge and that usually the husband and wife they have Shankara was a brahmacari he was from the young age from the eight years old he became a monk he never knew that life then he said give me some time but to claim that I know everything you have to prove it what the Shankara will do he went and asked his disciple to maintain his body you take care of my body so that the animal should not come and attack it and he left his body entered into the body of a king who passed away in nearby kingdom and then for a few days he lived into that body and came back again went entered into his own body and went to that house where the debate was going on

Nazareth come up and come to me dead men he got life back in came Jesus had these powers so this power to command friends now we were interested to know the eighteen different varieties of

the effect of heat and cold pleasure and pain power to read other stars barrace toddy a big guitar the Sri Ramakrishna could read whatever people are thinking he knew so you could immediately answer that and this sometimes I have seen many Swami's and the ramakrishna mission Swami's here in mind that my guru to the sannyas guru and the diksha group both were having this power but that is a different story the para cheetah do big gotta power to stop the effect of fire Sun water poison we know in that Prahlada you must read the life of Prahlada there's a beautiful live beautiful story his father was against God he wanted to kill prelada because Prahlada was a great devotee of the Vishnu and he gave him the poison he put him into the fire threw him into the ocean everywhere Prahlada was saved mera and that is a historical the meters that are her relatives they wanted to kill her for what whatever may be the reason she was so good so kind but do you know the other people they always feel why she's not like us so kill him killer so when they wanted to kill her they gave the poison and said your husband and said it husband had saved it to you to drink and a devoted wife and she knew this poison and she prayed to the Krishna and said you are my husband and they say you have sent it to me let me drink it she drank it and nothing happened but don't try this even though you are having lot of devotion to any Lord but don't try this just by hearing this you should not then power to remain free from others influence opera Jaya no one can influence and you can read in the Vagabond see Ramakrishna he was apparently so simple used to ask different questions today but you could not influence one of our Swamiji was there he was the president afterwards Swami bhootish and ldg apparently was so simple just like a child and other people just to think that if we say twice or thrice we can make him influence and then get the job done but nothing he will never so that is the ball power that we have friendship and quickly I wanted to finish but we will do it in our next class ultimately I can say today that C Ramakrishna is to speak again and again and say mother don't give me all this trash again and again is to say all this power is trash for a real genuine spiritual seeker when Shami be vacant there was a young boy Oh hardly 2010 Raghavan C Ramakrishna offered him all the 18 this power do you like to take all this 18 power you know the answer he said what I am going to do with those he refused so we will discuss this in our next class I think there are some questions Samir Babu is a nice question very good question when you are taking the name of God japa what is happening your mind is becoming purified that is the result of the japa the moment your mind will become purified if you want all the list that I read not the first eight but the balance ten and five all this power you will have one can have after the repetition sincerely repetition of the japa that one can read I am giving the discourses the question that you have bhagavad-gita and Osterberg gita of course people are reading so you can also read I give myself the classes and provide Gita and also the austere bakra Gita last question so with super-deep Sinha you think that we should always shun completely these powers that come yes yes that is correct you are correct super deep and I just as I said in the last sentence see Ramakrishna one day master master I noticed he's spitting on the floor and very disgusted way he is no no no no like that he was telling and spitting and then he's refusing the offer that the divine mother wanted to give no mother I don't want all these trashes so we will discuss that a genuine seeker of spirituality should not hanker for this power why because these are also temporary and when this power comes the people forget other things once you start giving the supernatural medicine and are some some people out of emotion they may say oh that is good you are helping people but helping people is not the job of a yogi that is the doctors are there they will treat medicine is there but the yogi is supposed to reach to the goal and that is God realization thank you friends we will discuss it once again in our next class let us conclude a do with this daughter young Brahma Barone Indra Roop trauma Rooter student ID blister by BD song
