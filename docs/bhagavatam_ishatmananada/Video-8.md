[Bhagavatam 024 - A Guide to Liberation:  Purusha & Prakriti : Kapila's Interpretation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5fzY1XSS_7g)

huija share now but [Music] Solutions rishaad harem gagana saturation me the Burnham and - me condom Kumada nayana you Bondi Beach para below now we are starting the main position portions of the bhagavata is a great book now here we find the conversation between the mother and the son and mother is asking question and the son the great sage kapila is giving the reply mother devotee he requested Kapila her son to guide so that the people ordinary people like her can reach the supreme goal of the goddess and Kapila advised her to give up Eagle that was nice Gabriela said give up the Eagle that is in the thoughts come the 25th chapter 16 verse the Peter say mother you give up the Eagle what is the deagle me and mine this is the ego because from the ego comes lost and greed , and over aha mama this is the root colors and from that comes comma and lower now this is the brave simple see the whole thing the spiritual life so many religions of the diffidence office so many are books but what is the air that's when our God's the Ram Krishna see army Mali which evasion job in Bengali say if I that goes away all problems are so but the problem is the air that I will go and moment the eye is there and I comes with me and mine and along with that comes Gama and over the last and greed desire and greed Gama and low cupola then suggested you better go faster if of the ego and then he suggested you better develop three things knowledge renunciation and devotion so we have to understand here the villa is not telling only devotion history knowledge renunciation and devotion what is the knowledge knowledge that God only exists and nothing the wind that type of knowledge comes what happens I renounce what I denounced whatever I think that his mind I renounced that then the last part automatically comes the devotion to God these are the three steps we need to really discuss about this within religion is so easy realization of that or to reach to that ultimate the knowledge or the please eternal that's so easy so Coppola is asking you better develop the knowledge what is that knowledge God their God is existing and then you renounce all that is me and mine and third developed a love for that God the goal and he will get everything that is devotional and to develop these you need some people to guide you so he suggested camellia suggested the holy person you better go to the holy person and then he said a very wonderful thing that were afterward for once Ramakrishna also said turn them all your anger your passion your love hatred everything towards the holy person all these things just turn into that only person whatever you want instead of the ordinary people better turn it to the believers then they will find everything is changing sometimes some people do come for advice as we always say instead of telling ours you better go and sit with the elderly to the girl directly only thing you need a little faith the God is there and he's listening so I must talk to God that way when you just believe and the answer will come for sure so that is what Coppola is also suggesting and instead of telling God because Coppola never believes in the God there is shara body they never believed in God they said that if you are performing in this way we did the result why in between what is the result the ultimate goal so here he says shall do shew you better go to the the shadows moksha Dharam of our rhythm in the 25th verse a twenty-fifth chapter 28 verse he saying that this is working and Kapila emphasizing that iran even oke asleep Bhushan mystery a charcuterie rod tip Brina bhakti-yoga nimona my heart becomes the 44th mercy saved the highest spiritual goal of human life is to reach me the Supreme Being through 1.8 devotion how much the same thing but once in a magician is stealing the God realization is the goal of every human type ultimately copy disease mean the Supreme Being is not the God the prenup of the yoginah is you have to develop that one point of the devotion attachment so that way you have to come to me the highest spiritual goal pumsam miss raineesha this treasure is the ultimate highest who they are how how my heart becomes theorem you have to give your mind to me and then continue indirectly in everything there are some people even in the villages before even drinking the little water they will take the glass Oh God then directly without remembering God they won't do anything sometimes it becomes a habit they don't mean actually then that would be the result won't be good to that way if consciously we are three each and everything even as one step when you had me remembering God angry that what happened the practice of the presence of God when we were practicing the presence of God every moment every time whatever you're doing you know some people who enter into sleep even in the they call it source of us see aza inhaling and exhaling all the time they will go on taking the name of God so that the repetition of the guards name then slowly they will go to sleep so this is the way it goes and he is telling that you must do in this way and capito st. Gianna by Rob you clean up to you in you inner shamaya pardon mullah main provision t akuto i am [Music] akuto i am direct the completely free from fear what me God is there completely free to take this thing the true devotion clogged with knowledge and renunciation ocean should be always knowledge but is God who is God what I am going to get from God what is my achievement doctor Oh God then they are the other Robinson and Krishna he said what is the air in the bhagavad-gita 700 smokers and he said go on repeating the name quickly becomes Gita becomes their ghee renounce renounce renounce so that is the main thing when we were born we were not doing anything then slowly we developed an association with this people society and then slowly slowly according to the situation all of our desire comes different type of things come on things at the earth but a different type of things comes if you go to replace any backward country backward society their only goal is to go somewhere where life is good they'll be reading about the medical reading about the Germany reading about the Great Britain and pictures and all that why because they are not having those those who were living over there they don't bother about it London Eye is a great word for the backward societies done denying what is that learned enough over this is nothing but those who are living in the London they don't look at the time so they look through their own eyes not to that but this is the symbol of the London Eye and thinking so I am from the desire comes Association also so if you are having holy men's association whatever bridge that will come the alga renunciation the debt is very important very important so renunciation they are the void our dear love devotion sometimes I always say I also when I say I practice try to remember it remind me to what commune here in this holy place awesome are the center the Vedanta society that the spiritual retreats so many things are going on forward to remind we don't belong to this world what you see something else and how to move at the end constantly reminding me that I don't belong to this I have some other place and where there is only love there is no competition there is no jealousy well because it is one so that is called knowledge so devotion dada parag give you clean bhakti yogi no and who can do it yogi no mr. yogi constantly at the street god yogi doesn't mean the moment we says yoga and particularly in India they won't email immediately they imagine a picture the man is sitting in the squatting position eyes closed and that is a yogi now that he is practicing this good but tell them you cannot sit like that and close your eyes may be out of 24 hours two hours some people the developed okay four hours then what so this is the reason we have to the constant Raghavan ceramic Easter's again that rise in his picture you read immediately if you have the background of Saitama Krishna's literature is a price completely he will get very simply stealing but closing your eyes you can see God fantasy garden appear open eyes this is the beauty because most of the time we are awake we had a mom in the society mixing with so many people talking with so many people and if that whole time is converted into spiritual practice yeah that is the thing so let's show in Reverse Ramakrishna instantly what is karma yoga it's nothing but constantly remembering God and performing the world and women performing the work I know it is done but I have done it for God so Kavita is also telling she my father moon Li Mei provision tea then ultimately they will come to mean that in is captive the mean means the supreme being so obviously the moment he says they are coming to mean then what happens question is if me is that ok for our it's not God that they don't say god but still we are so accustomed in the word God let us say if that being the supreme being the god is there then welcome we came so this question obviously come again and again everywhere any philosophy any Arab thoughts this question who is the creator and what is this creation and the relation between the creator and that relation that this question is coming okay in brief we can say that kapila's advice a devotee guitar then the Supreme Being the GR in between the knowledge Gyan Gyan Giotto and giya this tree I and my knowledge and the goal these are the three things so key on is that which is helping me to go and who is doing me where to my goal the Supreme Being so beyond Gionta and young these are the three terms they always use and they say you have to take up a bow and arrow and should in such a way this tree will be pierced in one L in one shot so you become the knowledge you become ultimately transformed into God so he seemed bother only you come to me me the God how to knowledge what is that knowledge you are completely different from me or you are with me this is the question here Kapila he said you're completely different from me it's not verandah the Shanker & Schanker they see that transformation is a permanent transformation we shouldn't sit down so we will come to that and this question comes the where from we came from the philosophy not from the bhagavata the samkhya philosophy they say such Korea Barda South Korean bother bother means the philosophy the theory what is that theory of causation and this is very very important to understand the Kapena this way because this computer system is the oldest system in aggregate to relate he's the firstborn person and he is the God that is Vishnu himself Vishnu promised that I will take the human form and he chose the cardamom and the devotee as the father and the mother and this Vishnu who took the human form got the name Kapila and naturally that was the first philosophy he was narrating what is that he said that such Korea bother and afterwards the philosophy developed and this Kapila is if you will find that this kapila's ideas reflected in everything sweetie sweetie purana everywhere no can deny this after taking that idea then they have developed their own that is different but Kapila expressed his philosophy briefly in his first book that is samkhya-sutra the first book that he gave is a sample sutra then it is very small then he elaborated that became Sankar professional suit first a Sanka Sutra the son Suda in the thoughts come 26 chapter a bhagavata it gives the definition in the work of God and His divine power nature famous in the philosophical world as purusa and prakruti this word Purusha is coined by this capita and also the purgative copy received a 30 some production means Kitana lucky on embrittle yet within 12 be mutually lucia bracketry Kooning is the 26th chapter first verse we were studying 25th now we are going to 26th and the 26th with a scandal the book is third as 26th in the new chapter we are introducing in the first verse and the first verticity say I shall tell you the characteristics of all the categories separately by knowing this the spirit Purusha becomes free from Universal nature property so the French we have to remember these we are slowly entering into a very excellent but complicated philosophy that is something the Sun Camila's R P this is the basis of almost all the because of me as we were discussing that this sumter philosophy it puts forward to comes kirusha and the Purusha is the creator and property is the creation so this copy destiny I will tell you some problem Shami taught to honor Rukhsana protect Rukhsana characteristics separately ability can't be by knowing which women chatting you will be completely liberated the word crucial but this foucha is not the original Purusha of the philosophy this pollution in spirit individual being so Balanta developed wonderfully on the basis of these so this guru shah as they mentioned over here in the first verse of the 26th chapter this pollution is the spirit and what is the spirit that is within us in every being that will be completely liberated what from the liberation because the comma and crota and what all these things that is attached to this war so from the air they are getting the liberation completely explained about the purusa so let me once again remind that the purusa and prakruti these are the two words that is explaining everything but sometimes in some of the slow curse the Kapila has used Purusha like the first one this is a spirit individual being but when you say the Purusha again this solution is completely different and he gives the definition in the third verse of the 26 chapter on Rd art MA Purusha nila guna Peretti Brava protect ah ma SE ma ot mission ena cement it'll be shown the whole universe ena from eat someone Nitin manifested from these all these whole universes come and what is this uh Nadi first is beginningless there's no beginning is completely beginningless on Adi he will notice almost all the region there is always clean that the truth that has come down it is beginningless though they will say the founder may be the Buddhism the pounder is Lord Buddha and Christianity Jesus Christ Islam from Hazrat Muhammad but it's alone you go beyond because it is eternal that eternal knowledge came to him this eternity beginning less this conception is presenting every religion so when we are trying to find out the commonalities of all the religions that this is the thing if we don't understand these why again and again every Sunday everywhere in charge in Temple in most why of course maybe the marks they do it in there in America they must be Sunday mostly they prefer Friday but even like we're doing these drink these otherwise if we don't know it so what happened in the Pittsburgh and all this area the people they were praying and someone entered and then sprayed the bullets killed so many people why this man is thinking I am performing religion by killing the enemies what enemies some people are only thinking in this way doesn't mean that they are enemies so this we have to understand this why devotion should be with knowledge without knowledge devotion is dangerous without understanding what is they should go so the first thing that goal what is the goal according to the copy delusion that Purusha again in the confusion in the Sanskrit the pollution means male body it is not like that pollution means that which is reciting within what is that consciousness that which is reciting within every being that is consciousness there's called life called prana so in different words but this they say it is an army it is first is beginningless and middle gunam this point we have to remember need guna no qualities probity paratha and it is completely beyond the nature it's beyond the nature para is about Prakriti in the nature so all these things that see it's pro Kitty and what the pro kitty the main feature of the property changes and then in the nature what we see there's all changes everything is changing constantly changing so that is called parity and it is far beyond that it is not within the change it is beyond the change all of our reading practice Dhamma protect Dhamma is all in Siam you certainly believe why always use this type of special words because you know him to know something you must have some idea that it is here no it is not here it is all everywhere then somebody must be revealing about it now this IOT is they're revealing in the self something that is coming out are produced are taking birth of something is a priority is a temporary but it is completely different so this conception on our the beginningless ninguna without any qualities attributes portrayed a para beyond all changes practice the AMA on pervading soil majority cert manifested and vision ninasam undetermined and this is the distinct form evolution together set so self supreme self is known as pollution that this is one one site supreme self is as pollution capella is giving the answer to his mom mother mother said okay I have understood it but you talked about someone which is Supreme Being if that is so who are we right from we have come then the communitarian you are in the property you have to go beyond the property what is the prophetic change the simple world predictive is changed you have to go beyond change about the change no changes will be there the what will remain this beginning layers self-effulgent all-pervading this this is the pollution the chancre at means ultimate reality as the Sun not God they are at meeting the ultimate reality as the self but not as the God now let us go to a little another side of it all schools of philosophy accept the self some say from one Sam Sadie Sam cetera let us speaking from the charvaka with you know the six systems are Indian philosophy Java fellows at the very interesting and materially if the people like it without knowing about them what is that materialistic what is the self this body they say this body the mind and all this thing is the self so don't bother about God don't close your eyes or open your eyes and enjoy the world they say so they also use the word self they also accepted the concept of observe but completely different way so we were studying the Indian reserve Indian religion you have to understand these when the charvaka mention they mention it is the body and other people particularly Balanta they will say no nobody even the shampoo not it is changing it is priority charvaka will say the materialistic of this thing now what is the latest thing but as long as it is there enjoy so this is the chakra transition buddhist what they say they say stream of consciousness it is not one consciousness is the flow of consciousness that is the Buddhist way then Naya and which are schita they say self is an unconscious substance look at the name and vaisheshika they say self is an unconscious substance sometimes under certain condition appears like conscious so as if it is conscious it is not nagging basically moksha mimesis a self this eternal consciousness which is also a blissful existence such as Ananda no sorry my mom she says self is conscious entity sometime become because of ignorance appears as imperfect I'm sorry so my mom Shania say it is an unconscious substance sometimes under certain current appears like conscious and mimamsa say self is a conscious entity but sometimes because of ignorance appears as imperfect exactly opposite niya and but nyesha sheikah and mimamsa then comes on Twitter but it is very clear about it self is pure eternal consciousness which is also a blissful existence the some here they differ over here there is no consciousness has nothing to do with the blissfulness consciousness is conscious it has nothing to do with joy the please the happiness so here the Vedanta & Schanker they differ but these two go together their frames the Sankar and without always even seeing that Indian philosophy they would always say like this nya Vishakha and the Sankar Vedanta you some Kappa Delta goes very close were hand-in-hand but they differ there's a drink the seeds the pure this consciousness eternal but it is also peaceful & Schanker it says self is conscious spirit always the subject and name of the object pedant also says is only the subject name of the object so you cannot understand you cannot know the self because it is always there so I cannot go and know the self it is already there so what - no so this is to say like that self is pure consciousness above all above all change in activity it is an uncaused eternal all-pervading reality but unlike our Twitter shankar says sir is not blissful consciousness to shunt herself is pure why I am mentioning this when they are reading the bhagavata because we always make the confusion when you go and listen to some of the Swami's from which point of view Thais explaining you do not know so obviously when they're talking about the consciousness the self you know how do we know it we only study and we listen about it but there's a little differences of the earth niya and all this of course they are not anymore but the heart waiting and of course the sound care Theory must deal so when you go and listen if you listen to these there's a little difference when they say such cheat on understand you progress with under and they will say only certain some kill only existence only consciousness and nothing else now even the self the pollution spartak kapila's terminology is above the change in activity free from all attachment and unaffected by anything then what is this world how this phenomena came into existence this question raised sage kapila answered this question with one word he said prakruti mother devotee the mobsters kameena see that this is the beauty of the Indian Way of teaching in the bhagavad-gita Arjuna is asking question and here in the bhagavata mother is asking the question to Kapila marketability said please explain the characteristics of purusa and prakruti now I understood there are two realities okay one is Purusha it does nothing so I don't have anything to do with the pollution because food is not going to help me pokemon see ramakrishna he said in a funny way one gentleman came and he was dating she said I am in a great problem I go to that such-and-such officer but the officer is not listening to me but he is not helping me go to his wife and through her st. he refers to him things should be done so in this way only order stuff you used to see and you can understand it very easily purusa and prakruti Salaam distance to worship goddess Kali there's a symbol of purusa and prakruti the purusa is the shiva all consciousness but no modification is doing nothing but just on that top of that Shiva it's not detached mother Kali is not separate from the consciousness in some of the pictures they show but mother is always at rest with the consciousness all the time standing on the shiva without that attachment we that connection of the evil we cannot do anything that consciousness is necessary so this property this consciousness is working so Salama busines always is to give this explanation Prakriti is for me then he said in another story easily haven't got noticed that in some of the houses when the program is going on function is going on the lady of the house is giving all the instructions to the people who are working over there go and do these do these duties like that and people the thing that she is doing actually but in the corner of that house someone is sitting and smoking sometimes this lady will go and ask this is the problem shall I do it this way then he will not utter it say yes then this natively to the Heckman is having all the power and that is called pollution and this lady is working everywhere is known as prakruti this is ceramic ish nails between the example from the purely Indian social condition so where the husband is the supreme and the wife is only supporting the aspect so that is the condition now it is changing is both a corrosion rotating the wife would say I am cooking here to wash the dishes in Volusia so but to explain the movie end pollution sit out distantly the example of the husband and the wife because that time the Indian society was like there and here when the mother is asking Prakriti Purusha co-production on Peru he brutally means tell tell me what is the characteristics of Porsche and rockety Coppola is giving the answer it is the tenth verse of the 26 chapter yet that neither gunam app leptin Milton such Assad a mahkum proton on protruding brow appreciation be she's about so this is very simple Sanskrit it says yet the depth which three gunas three gunas so this is a game very important point to understand the Sandow philosophy the computers way of expressing the prakruti the purusa we know is almost same with the Vedanta but the property it says is having the three qualities rest at three gunas were the three gunas sattva Raja and Rama these three qualities three gunas all the same tentative gunas and sometimes they translate epitopes the depth or the crowd is sought to Raja and AMA this property is having these three qualities again of the optim you cannot explain anything about the property that is imperceptible Epton not back-to-back tomates resolve manifested it is not manifested you cannot go and point out but this is pretty is not as possible the medium which is eternal just like the Brahmin just like the pollution it is knit them now it says such a serve makam this art master self at nakum means its nature is sometime it is existing sometimes is not existing service means existence assert not existence the sometimes is existing sometimes it is not existing such awesome art makam it is also known as pradana prakruti is also known as pradana Prabhu Prabhu mean saved appreciation vishal-shekhar without any distinction but all distinctions are potential in that now this is the whole thing so this is property sometimes Busha property publish a property mostly we call like that what is the property it is eternal you cannot say that it is beginning indecent this time now it is eternal all the time it is there and completely separate from the purusa is nothing to do with the pollution so property is eternal and it is Nietzschean having three qualities these three qualities will create will come to that afterwards three gunas and it is existence again non-existence why it is existing when I am bound when I am having that strong bondage of me and mine this rocket is existing for me but someone who has gone beyond dad Raghavan ceramic is no end he is looking at the people and he was travelling in streets of Calcutta he looked at the people and said everybody is bound by property all they're thinking about themselves none of them are thinking about the self the cinema Krishna is observing others other human being has bound people why because the heart under the prakruti so for cinema Krishna property is not present he's about that so that's where it is asserted first cinema kishna procreating is awesome non-existence but those who are there bound for the entities there so at the same time it is there it is not there for some people it is there for some people it is not there yesterday and the Ganges uyghurs day of the retreat was going on I was giving a little small a child came hardly two years and I was giving him small pieces of biscuits and he was so happy getting the small piece he was jumping and showing great joy having the small piece then I gave him a very costly sweets it ruined it never liked it because it was sticking so he threw it and then he was showing the hands like this it's not good so if you give teeth the very ordinary spoke and he's very happy taking that and then eating immediately like that so this for the sweet we have the great respect oh my god the sweet I like that but for that boy is not why like this condition he has not understood the importance of the taste of the swings but we have so we wonder if we'll give the opportunity to take the sweet and the candies in the biscuit ins no I will take this one the conditioned soul or such-and-such at a time and it is official three alternate distinctions but all distinctions all manifestations are potentially there how it is possible Raghavan see Ramakrishna he gave the example snake his poisonous is having the poison the pain but it is having the rain of having the poison it is not effective but we that same snake is fighting someone else and injecting boring that venom he dies so property is just like that it is having that creative power but it is not affected by that now we have to conclude by saying this this property which is having the qualities imperceptible eternal both existence and also non existence without any distinction yet all distinctions are potential in it what is the distinction distant name and form so this distinction as is also known as pradhana it is productive so we got to perfect definition of the pollution and property from the Kapena and almost like Maya is property ease almost like Maya but not mine the villain theme they are explaining the world that it came to mine and shantia explaining the what was created through protein but they have difference what difference the great difference when the shankar says this is the transformation is permanent but the Vedanta says no it is only apparent that this is the two differences the completely change when the property is creating the creation is complete and it is like that but the Vedanta says known through Maya through the prism you see that they Supremes we have to be very carefully we have to understand Sankhya and Vedanta the Sankhya for some carrots they say this creation is true prakruti almost the same like the mind and South Korea or South Korea all this Maya was also there Shankar Acharya is explaining about the Maya but the Maya whatever the creation is on the projection it's not the real creation the transformation is not permanent but the pure you nam of order the complete transformation and it's not like that at shankha see the causation of the famous that it is known as such Korean father it tried to prove that effect exist in the material cause even before it is produced and now explaining actually a mixture the philosophy and this matter whether they don't go for that details because I was thinking it is better to know the philosophy so this is the thing fiscal satkaryavada what is the speciality of this badah badah means the theory Barda is theory what is the speciality of this theory this see if it is already there before the production now in the wound the chair is already there the table is already there otherwise you cannot make the table or chair so that is called satkaryavada see how nicely they have analyzed if that if it is not there you cannot do anything out of that from the water you cannot make any chair or table because the effect is not there in that material from the suger you will only can make sweets but not from the salt sometimes the great disaster happens when the lady cooking and in both the bottles that keep white thing on his salt when his sugar now in the when they are preparing the tea and instead of sugar they will mix the salt and that will be an excellent test so this is the understanding that we have to have that unless then this is so perfectly there demonstrating the effect if it means the ultimate result is already there in the cause so that is the satkaryavada is real transformation not like the Vedanta reflection era man nation Purusha or the self do not do anything then what is the cause of this world how this world came I think in the next class we will discuss about that some here is also known as some cow in a day the Indian languages some car this number and some new philosophy is full of number there's a lot of mathematics is there in the samkhya then this portion is mixed in with these and then the production the result is these all this Sankhya will come and they're very interesting in our next class we will discuss about from the prakruti the three gunas they are permutation and combination and many many paintings came up to this today and next sunday again you will meet and we discuss about the creation according to some young brahma ballooning route drama soon untii did based away be the song but the Graham Upanishad a guy Andy young sama God Dianna was theta the dead Athena manasa pasyanti yam yoginah yes young Dom Navi do sera sera Ghana the by this mean [Music] Shanti Shanti hurry you please have some - shot
