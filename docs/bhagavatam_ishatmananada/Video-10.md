[Bhagavatam 029 : Conversation Between King Prithu & Four Great Kumaras](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErG1OJlZVJo)

[Music] huija show you know but the moon sedation's bechard harem governess attrition me Chuang Lakshmi can't gamma denying you give me Dianna come one day Vishnu I am sir Malika in different chapters in the parable which is slowly leading a human mind to liberation we come we are not going through that this is a big chapter describing about the different activities of trouble Drupada king when a majority of the people they know the story of the troop of the great devotee but rumour was a king too and he had to fight and he had to maintain a big the emperor he was and after the trouble his son would color he is agitated the wood color was completely dedicated to that drum mañana so he leave a like that Kingdom kingship and all that most of his time his pain in quiet meditation used to roam without talking with anyone without looking at anything the people started thinking naturally that he is a mad person being a king he is not riding the horses hitting a shrink is the kingship no papa tres not sitting on the throne he is not a king even the ministers and the advisors of the King they started thinking in that way they couldn't understand actually what he was thinking and why he was doing in that way and this is the speciality we can say in the human society if you are not attached with worldly things the most of the people work whatever they are doing if you will not drink that people will immediately level you as a man he was labeled as man and unfit for the kingship the two things appear this war with this manifestation and another is a spiritual world only one conception of one and nothing else if you are not withdrawing your mind from this multifarious thing which is just all inert and subject to changes obviously we can never go to that supreme goal which is one and consciousness all pervading this would color he withdraw his mind now the problem was he was a king Dougal was also was a great devotee but the true maintain both he was a king at the same time the devotee how it was possible because there through going to think that all that I see is the manifestation of my god so I had to serve them his son would come he was following the path of guiana negation negation not this not this this is the two differences in the Bhagavata we find the blending of these two paths Gianna and opti in every chapter he speaks about this trying to stress on the bhakti the devotion why because what the ordinary people which is easy but the people like you to color was having everything the kingdom and the power and therefore people who they want all this he was having all those but he left it and he was living in that as if he is not and he never mind when people who are criticizing the ordinary he subjects when he was roaming in the market in that blesses the people is to criticize and he could listen but he never reacted his mind was completely withdrawn how it was withdrawn as he is in a dream world I represent were that as a king his doorman used to think that this is the dream world my real world is somewhere else so that was in the dream when you see so many things in the dream we react but afterwards though we just laugh at it he was thinking in that so what to do the ministers then selected his brother but sera as the king in this lineage is a long list he came and this is the other Puranas they will go on giving the dates and the names of the kings who was the king what he did all the history so the karana is clubbed with the history and the same time this piranha as we read in the Bhagavata almost in every pages will be talking about teaching about high spiritual values morality is the way of life all the things and then they will give the stories also so these are the three things combined together comes in the Puranas this Bhagavata Purana is very famous Quran budala means ancient so they are giving that all the description and in that lineage came it one king with anger was a very wonderful King and his wife Sunita this shoe they were having one son Dana the name Hina means tyrant his actual name was something else but because of his time the behavior the people is to call in veña veña means the tyrant that was a very unfortunate in the lineage of the true birth and all devotees we are all trying to practice the spiritual life but how comes again the baina came this unfortunately in this lineage of the great Rugel a very cruel personality like Dana was born after the King anga been inherited the throne nobody tolling he himself went it will none of this is my father's property and people who are very much afraid right from the author is subject highly respected and educated we will always being tortured by him then ultimately a group of Rishi's and headed by the great regime remove the wing to Benin and that was the duties of the Rishi's to go and tell the kings they were not doing the correct thing you should do in this way reaches noon the someone should be there on the throne and he must be a powerful person to maintain the administration but if the head person become cruel and torturing his own subject then where the subject should go there was no Supreme Court the Supreme Court was only the regimes so the Rishi's wind headed by the Regal and they told him this long conversation see you belong in the line linear job the true book so naturally you should behave in this way this way this way this way when they completed they were thinking that they have changed his mind the pain are told you know what you are doing otama why because you have come to teach the King King is nothing but the God and heart so you cannot say anything to King the moment you were criticizing the King you are subject to punishment and he wanted to punish the three she's thin the Rishi's arrive there otherwise there is no other option he wanted to punish the Rishi's punishment miss killing so the Rishi's applied their yogic power and he was killed by the Thunder and he direct Rishi's went and they bathe in the river and they sat for meditation they were thinking that problem is solved venez mother King Sunita and she told now you tell who is going to be the king venez are not having any children and his brother is not at all ready to become the king so what will happen then the Rishi's under 200 years what to do the king is necessary so I am trying to give you the social status of Indian in those days the Rishi's they were the bridge scholars and spiritual people not at all attached with the worldly things but they were very much careful to maintain the worldly status - they need all people cannot leave the heart and home and meditate in the jungle like them so obviously at the normal as we see in the world that system is necessary and for that and at least Rishon is a must so that way they once again came and here again whether you believe it or not the story part comes the history and the sociology wealth things were there but certainly is a mystery comes the game and they squeezed the lead of that date King dinner and from that day there came out a very crooked looking sharp and cruel type of person and they told you should not be mixing in the human society you should go in the jungle and live with the animals that was the bad karma fellows of the Valen so that took a human form the dwarf and he went inside the jungle then they squeezed the right hand of the team and from there came to one Mel another female and the female mainly came through and the few no death he had just come to that name the the veto was a great king and the b2 was the part of not to complete the part of Mahavishnu this is the part of this purana sometimes people did out the Whydah is it possible the because the completely meaningless way they are giving the birth of the children but I think you know there's a strong way of creating things in the universe how by controlling the nature the Rishi's were having that Dementors power so they controlled the nature out of the good qualities of the pre - I mean the Vayner they they brought out the one son and a daughter and the all the bad qualities that became the dwarf so that way the VM was liberated ultimately because the Rishi's - took out all the bad qualities from him now we will think about this freedom the veena that he was dead and the beetle became and and the females name was Archie Archie was the female and she was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi the king who was the a folder of Dharma a low cupola local fauna means the custodian deities protecting the world that skull no Gopala the wind there is a great waves then these people particularly the fishermen they go and agreed to one God to please make the ocean normal so that we can go for fishing and this is our livelihood so they are our local brothers they don't go to Rama or Krishna or Vishnu or Ganesha they worship one type of God who are controlling this nature these they are known as low Koopa friends I will be announcing officially afterwards but we are working to start an online school to understand Hinduism in the beginning in the individual and slowly slowly if God's will we will add other five or six other religions so in the Hinduism I was wondering how it is possible to explain people in this way so many varieties this local power one type of God who are controlling a portion of the nature how they came because those who are practicing spirituality but not getting the realization final realization they get disabled power so they become the local bar sometimes some of you may be look but we all know you're all practicing spirituality naturally we'll get it as long as we are not getting the complete liberation this thing will go on happening that is he was the local father and this great king came to know from the Rishi's that of the four holy coup models there's another manager holy people they were and the fast children that the Brahma mentally created therefore and they were just like the songs but behavior was ethnic children to this sanaka sananda sanatana and sanat-kumara they visited him so from here we get and wonderful idea the Kings coat is all the time having some wonderful gift and there are highly spiritual people this to come and talk with the King and give the answer to his question and looking after the welfare of the people so we can say we were not selfish people only going inside the keeper sitting under a tree and meditating and sometime coming to the villages to collect their food no they came to the locality and through that knowledge they gave the wonderful idea of spirituality the son of Kumar's the four brothers they were created by the Brahma with an intention so that they will go and take up the work about the population and the maintenance of the worldly things they said no it is not possible because they were 100% pure the immediately after the birth immediately for liberation they were already liberated but Ramakrishna is telling this is also possible this type of people they come not for their own liberation they are already liberated but they come and lead the life of a human and mix with the human so the dickery inspired others there he is sitting it is like the pumpkin the fruit first and then the flower mostly the flower and we the first and then the fruit but in this cases they are already realized then they go on practicing spirituality only to inspire other people this son of Kumar came in the fourth scandal and 22nd adaiah chapter we find a graphic description of the group of the four famous kumaras appearing in the code of the pre tool and the used to people is to call them coup models why they were just like babies children till a group of people very very respected people highly knowledgeable people the realized Souls constantly living in that brahmana but the behavior was like children's that's why this to call them kumaras so Agathon booty just fresh tar now the victim is welcoming them in his coat so other than bo d just rest up yet Brittani moocher cherán desert they are de la ba la e ba Briganti boy this is 12th local who greatly brahmana's ye thickened brahmana now there is a create controversy going on in India something like that this go always goes on whether Maharaj ji is a brahmana or not those lot of people they're spending a lot of time on the ornament you must be very angry now sir What nonsense they're talking about and what are the promenade chili brahmana bees those who are constantly leaving in from money what is that Brahmin conscious so they cannot see anything else but the consciousness the oneness all pervading they are prominent so here you see a great brahmana in that sense hanji is a brahmana of course because he was that great height level he was the person who immediately recognized the Rama Chandra who was in the form of a human being others would not one man she couldn't stand immediately so this brahmana living on the highest spiritual plane and selling welcome to you you are completely ego less like the children if you have read the gospel of ceramic vishna life of Ramakrishna again and again is mentioning the holy people just become like the children they don't understand the other things the children will come and they will touch these does that so in this way but the children are ignorant this people are very highly knowledgeable but the behavior is just like that why children no attachment if you give at all to a child immediately you know that it is so happy and they'll be jumping expressing his joy and second moment you will throw that good so that is the children no attachment so you were just like the children you care only for divine life and the austere lives so this is how he is telling the spiritual teaches that the holy people should be served with proper spiritual questions but he presses inna see we are in the Sanskrit they always say to win the holy person is coming you must give him the respect and then there in our country is because these two work the airport and so these two wash the feet and give him the cool water and all this afterwards when he setting then these two ask questions all people who sit in this front and they would ask in question why see why to solve the holy person the best way is asking spiritual questions so that is doubly and sometimes when you go to visit somebody's house other people have come they would hope this come and then they will forget about utilize it outside and you are sitting all alone then suddenly one person will come and what do you think about the Mamata Banerjee whatever body we are all in Chicago we have nothing to do it Mamata why you are asking this question any other question how this they one have another temples are coming this is not good technical discussions very rarely very rarely people will ask Xiaomi can please tell me how to develop devotion for God very very rarely people would say trauma can you please tell me what is this Brahma Gianna because that never occurs in there so for a pristine Assyria this is the great thing and who can ask question who is having the basic knowledge everything can last question so here he is telling the the pre to the king Shiva's began himself pretty the team but we great humbleness he's asking this question Oh honor ones can D be any can barely any happiness for the householders who by mistake accepted the same subjects as supreme goal due to the past Karma to these so many people they accept this particular thing as their lives of goal how it is possible so this is the way then yesterday I went to say check your house you know we are planning to purchase a property inside that Chicago and so that we can have a communication theory sub and library and can contact exited so the palatial house that those who built and lived there are fabulously rich people and I was wondering in one of their the washroom we can nicely live in such a big courtroom and not only one to two percent can nicely live such a big courtroom a huge and then one big room what is this when someone becomes sick they come and live over here there is so many rooms and too beautiful and suit decoration and that way and the things my god one person maybe having 100 shoes there's a big left you should go and check and how this why rich person so naturally they need it the thing that we should leave in that way think about the first one who was constructing that building it was at the I think 9 and 1900 so when shaman Vivek and was visiting these people they were constructing this so the big house and similar brothers are also there so those people now idea selling it no one in the family only one daughter and there's nothing so they're leaving for a small place of some other place where because they cannot maintain this is not necessary also so this way so meaning not only ours the lives time but they for the energy everything is paying for something or is that same subjects and then afterwards what nothing remains with us so this is the only thing we must understand and here it says oh honored once can't there be any happiness for householders who not all householders who by mistake accepted saints objects as supreme gold then his commenting may be due to the past Karma so in the past they always felt like that I should be like these I should be like that so this is this then he say something shape of a 8s mean Shaima keunakeun of it how a person can work out his welfare quickly it is cycle of birth' ended come from here this is a wonderful question and of the four kumaras senator Kumar he started giving the reply then son of tomorrow he said oh you Great King verily you've already know the answer but still asking for the good of all I appreciate it so they immediately they understood that King himself knows it not that is not knowing but is so humble asking this question so that others can understand why see there is no description that there is a good number of people they are waiting for the answer nothing is there but it's one word for the betterment of others immediately we can imagine is a quote Kings code there are many people were there and all they came to see that four kumaras so when we are giving the answer natural it will be beneficial to all of them so then the Great Sage started giving the teaching and dissolved actual teaching of the in Hinduism any scripture you open the same teaching why there's this is the only way you can realize God there is no other big heart sometimes they are using some languages different languages to express it but the same teachers are teaching first and for detachment detachment from the material things and delight Ingram and when you were giving up something you have to accept something you cannot give up something and then remain totally back and non-economic so that is called you have to give up the world and even did God where the mind will go except the world partly so many varieties of things are there from there you are withdrawing the mind where you will put the mind to us the spirituality towards God to us the consciousness so he said these two things together you should do detaching the worldly objects and delight in the brahman and the 21st verse of the depth chart then he said form faith in the existence of God a practice Dharma philosophical discrimination practice of concentration friends this is one after another he is telling the point by point if anyone practicing this it doesn't matter whether Hindu or she correct Christian and Muslim anyone wants to the other is God anyone wants to go for the higher spiritual life these are the practices one should do what detachment for the worldly things does it mean that we should not live in the houses we should not purchase anything why not we must but not that attachment to that sometimes we think we won't be able to relieve survive without this and suppose this computer this is very recent before that how people lived without computer they lived that was all right now we cannot think of when I am delivering the lecture and asking you to detest although I am having the phone in my pocket while the modern way of life you cannot give up and sometimes when the phone hi I keep somewhere I am fulfill wonder though how to contact this person of that person previously which to note down somewhere now everything is in the phone and if that phone is not there then you are feeling helpless so what to help do so this is the way of life but the attachment to that thing oh if that is not there I'm going to die that should not be there that should not be sometimes some young people we've read in the newspapers only for a smartphone they have killing others because they are not getting the money but so much of a touch point for that phone he wanted to get it robbed the person he was protesting in killed him and ultimately he was arrested now spending the time in the chair and behind the bars and read the for nothing so that attachment always takes us to difficulties the misery is so we should be very very careful at the same time we must know that these are the things is unnecessary the doctor write a professor many many many others they leave these things so they should have but at the same time no attachment to that if there is lost I am going to die not like that so this is the and how it is possible first he see the delight in Brahman and secondly say for faith in God see two things side by side one is Gianna and other is bhakti devotion the knowledge is delight in Brahman he never said devotion in Brahman to Brahman he safety light what is the delight consciousness all-pervading so I am also there so that is the delight that is the joy the feeling of consciousness and from the devotion field in the existence of God dear I am having 100% faith oh I have lost that thing maybe that is what the God the horizont so that is to be and the Muslims they always say in Sangha in anything you will hear them in Salah if God wills hey I will meet you in the next ring in Salaam if God wills I do not know I have a plan to meet you but if the God is not permitting so I don't know what is going to happen so do not depend on that and completely which Tommy we can appreciate very much look at that field Swami ji actually elderly lady in Kashmir mother what is your religion who god be praised have a Muslim the tremendous field that particular attitude of mine Vivekananda appreciated so that is and then it says practice of Dharma what your responsibility as a whatever the like the position that you are in the society you must must practice that and perfectly properly that is called Dharma as a mother as a father as a brother as a sister and that is the light we see in the life of Sri Ramachandra the Ramachandra also the same thing reflected in the life of Sri Ramakrishna if you read the biography of Sudama Krishna and Rama Chandra you'll find whatever as his son they were always obedient to the parents very very respectfully the he knew that father is making a mistake his brothers they were rebellious but the Brahma Chandra say don't bother about that our father is very good only one mistake he has done that is natural normal so that is as a son not finding fault the father rather constantly of the time with the father with the why with the children with the subjects as a king everywhere or whatever the Dharma he accepted the responsibility he performed there perfectly that is called Dharma swadharma fill one place the other ones ramakrishna see those who were dirty type of people and this to show the poverty I never visited them I never liked them I used to visit those people who were neat and clean and houses are good so one person he has written to me why you see Ramakrishna said like that has a wrong business as a semillas Vitara why should he couldn't understand what's wrong is name stealing you are a household you must be believing properly maybe you are not very rich but whatever you are having should be nicely kept properly washed and all things should be that power and when you know to and if you go to the Oracle they lives in the caves even if you go and see all the things that property kept one or two things are there still they maintained so that cleanliness next to godliness as the same English so that properly you have to maintain very good when I am serving some food I love my hand this is no problem for me but the others don't so when I am using my hand sometimes I'm putting my finger in the mouth and sometimes in the gear and then the same and I'm using and gives up being new think you're doing so these are the things spiritual things that you are practicing white alertness what is the alertness I am NOT going to hurt anyone by anyway that alertness is helping you to develop spiritually do you understand not that all the times coming and sitting over here closing your eyes so this is the thing very perfectly once you try to follow it that is why he is in telling that practice of Dharma then philosophical discrimination why they use the philosophical the moment to use the discrimination immediately the caste creed color raised no discrimination philosophical discrimination what is the philosophical discrimination the one something is permanent another is temporary permanent is God and all other things are temperate that is philosophical discrimination the moment you say discrimination the naturally the people starting in my god vice talking of the discrimination there should not be any discrimination not in the social labor but in the spiritual level the practice of concentration this is a must and practice of concentration how it is possible every day at least for five to ten minutes try to forget your body we forget our bodies every day not only one hour two five six hours in sleep when we are sleeping with fourteen upper body and all the person who was ready in a smart and when they are sleeping if you take their photo you see how this will be become because that time they are not having that body consciousness so them is living like that so that's why the people the same should not take the photomania sleeping so this is the mean we all the time forget our body every day we do that and one must do that but at the same time when you were fully awake consciously if you are forgetting your body that is called concentration and for that concentration you need an object and if that object is the consciousness or the beloved God you mind also take that shape you can concentrate on anything suppose you like a very good player the soccer player or maybe actor or actress you can consider them to or anything in the world right but you will get the shape of that that characteristic but if you meditate on Jesus material good meditate on Ramakrishna Ramachandra that quality will come the that is why they always say and meditate on that then is it Association of holy people who are the holy people in many places they have described as Sri Ramakrishna said those whose mind is completely given to God that means no selfishness those who are completely unselfish and naturally they generate love for each and every one that is called the holy people and along with that they say avoiding the company of the selfish people because these type of people in the inner society when you are going you must have to have naturally the different type of people are there but the company means you like his company like to talk to him like to swim sometime within that is not a good thing because the selfish people means they will always in your mind will be imprinted with their selfishness and you will also that's why the parents are so careful about their children with whom he is mixing at the she is mixing the children can understand they don't differentiate they're all mostly impressed by some smart guys but mothers didn't know the father's they'll be very very watchful now you should not mix with that boy or girl you should not do this you should not do that do you all the time protecting why bad company so a man is known by his company in English the others say if you are in good company naturally you will develop the good perhaps the singer's if you are in the group of the singles you will learn so many things about the songs and their different drummer and if you are with the doctor you will learn so many things about the medicine the same way if we're with the holy people you'll learn a lot many things about the spiritual life a maturity mostly our the senior devotees a long time associated if you ask them anything good book immediately they know what are the books about the devotion about the discrimination shaman wife because they came and they got associated they'll be quoting from the scriptures there are so many things how it was possible Minister situation and when you are having that good Association so obviously in the subconscious mind it will remain this sometimes when I go to visit the parlour of devotees are houses I always ask them to bring the children let them be here let them be here they're playing taking little disturbances but let them be here why because when they are having listening to the discussion not so attentively but at the same time in the subconscious mind those words are reaching going that will be there if you just close your eyes and go back to your children days in these young that days and those conversations that the inverse used to do this is all there and really what that particular opportunity will come that rise will come up and you will know that would it happen like that I must do like this that helps distribute their situation and he says try to avert the places where this type of selfish people they received the place it also should be avoided then only your mind because it is your mind the mind should be purified slowly shouldn't lovingly practice non-injury and self-control avoid criticism and devotion to Lord these are the teachings of the summit c'mon what was the question how a person frees entangled in these worldly things can in this life get liberation so I have given the name over here the bhagavata that this is the did it take us to the liberation group thing and here there's another come on in a very nice wing is telling these are the things if you practice you will get the liberation for sure the son don't criticize others this is a sometimes you know just and if and we do the friendly way that is nothing no wrong because just like putting the among the frames that is alright but criticizing means belittling or doing something so that when the person reaches over there our other's mind is already having the idea about him oh he's a mystic person he is these is that he already told them in such a way this people are not knowing this person when he went over there the other people who have already said they will be looking at him as the way you have already printed their mind that that is called criticism the one one should not do that so this mono ceremony daily dinner all that rises he told to criticize others why they also belong to you you do not know so don't criticize in that way the whole are traveling towards the truth towards the core maybe some crooked some straight way it doesn't matter he will go in his own way but you are doing you must be careful so none injury hurting others when I talk to some people I behave in such a way they feel insulted on the heart so that he is telling don't do that again if you go to the life of master of the money TV you will find this type of teaching very simple way she is asking the other ladies don't talking that to it don't behave in that way in your world you just showed you the manner hurting other people you should not do that this is very very important very very important devotion to Lord first he began the field and then last he conclude devotion if you have the faith you have the love for God so Salam o Krishna say if you have set up be charged then you have achieve everything God is there and God is going to do everything why should I think so that is a type of complete self surrender is very very difficult now they say these spiritual practices develop power the sway the spiritual people they have the power why because you are controlling the nature nature is provoking you to react and he have conquered the nature so obviously you are in the realm of the all-powerful god all-pervading god the power is reflected and this power now is the link with this power the tremendous mental power burns the subcenter individual which is composed of five aspect of ignorance there all these individual people that we are only ignorance and what five types of ignorance the first is of india with the means a victim means taking something which it is not as sometimes it is named very dangerous but we think it is a rope what will happen so that is the way we take something which it is not that is called ignorance and we you are accepting the worldly things as God all the permanent things is a great mistake that you are doing the result will be suffering as if you take up the snake thinking that it is ro what does think we do it will bite you and you will be in great difficulty the similarly if you accept the world of the permanent and that is the cool of life you are going to suffer so that you see you must burn first ability or the ignorance and then we allow it that comes as Sumita of India second is Asmita Asmita means egoism aye-aye-aye that is called as Mita but have you been closed your eyes and sat in a corner and discussed about among within yourself who are you actually why this I Who am I you will never find any answer so all that situation with these is nothing to the disco asmita eco egoism raga and Asia this is another to raga means attachment and aversion I walk these and I don't want that that is also ignores this raga and Asia at mint and haversian the abbreviation what is that of innovation the great desire to leave I should leave I should leave I should leave please decide to name I heard I don't know I cannot prove the informations at the rich people they wanted to transplant their disembody part and it was not available so there are poor people the first they told I will give you money when he was not agreeing then the killed him and then change that why I have to leave what the cool person is going to do nothing let him die so here it is we are going to the doctor taking the medicine it is not that this elimination means I only should leave at any cost and bother with other people are suffering or dying for me I should leave so that is called of innovation these are all five ignorances and the moment you develop and practices all the spiritual disciplines a tremendous power comes within you and you can burn they are using the world you can burn these five things doctor show you look the semester that goony there is this simple way it says doctor I'll show you they've learned completely and you become mocked-up you become free semester that economy of those bad qualities naive art mana but he on the beach st the monitamon which is an armour which is not the consciousness anything externally and internally all you give up brahman Arya Babbar Haram pure stuff Sonia tar good that'd be Nagi then what happens you see the per our plan you see that consciousness you see that God then if you turn back and think what happened to my son Solomon what happened to my family you live remember why it has managed as the dreams that you see when you wake up all those goes away seeming the moment you realize God only God remains and what about my previous life nothing will remain so when the young Norrin Radd came he was having tremendous spiritual power by birth salaam krishna understood it and he wanted to taste it he just touched him you have read that story and immediately the young boy's mind started soaring high up and then he's shouted hey what you have done to me my mother is there father is there I cannot leave them then some Krishna again Testament said okay okay it would take some time then slowly slowly he himself developed through this discipline so friends now the in conclusion we can understand we are to be successful in spiritual life then these are the disciplines we must practice that's all nothing else Wiener to go visit this man and that man this temple of that temple this holy place at that holy place nothing and nothing and nothing only in your own way just practice these disciplines and he will be completely you know all the past Karma's will be burned and the Paramatma Javad man Paramatma will meet each other and they'll be how it is just like the milk pouring in the milk just like the water a mixing the water just take the oil meeting pouring Lord Shankar Acharya in the pivot to Romani and Allah is telling all these things that you are trying it is actually nothing is there this is the only your imagination because inside the mind it is all there in that mind has gone what remains so I was thinking inside the room there is a ghost and I was so much afraid and I was searching for the light I was shouting for the help so many things happened then slowly the deep broke and the sunlight came and it's oh no I'm in a very comfortable place why I was thinking in that immediately all the fear and the tension it goes away the similarly why we were suffering mind what is that mind the collection of all the impressions we're from the impression scheme these five sense organs they winked out and collected now you have to show your command and say you are all my servants chuck's you garnishee card you are top heel my servants don't forget it and whatever I say must follow it so I am the master and that way you become Swami the Swami means the master he become the master master of leros of senses and then you can say I like to be happy you become happy okay I like to be miserable little bit of missile test again a great day this all under your command and that is so G one doctor that condition is called Jeevan Mukta you are the master living and wherever you go and that is the reason Raghavan C Ramakrishna he is going to all places but never a test with those he was enjoying every all thing why because he has already control his senses that is the highest spirituality and finally the teaching comes in that chapter he says there are four push orders to the goals of human life Dharma then artha kama and Moksa so therefore two sometimes I think if I should come and say this when do people know - why why do you accident so there was a one speaker there's a story I think the he came and he left not at all ready to speak she came do you understand this subject no sir and he's not no use talking with you so he left but these people they were eager to listen to him so again they invited and they divided themselves to one group will say we know how the group will say we don't know they thought by that way they can manage this figure came do you know this subject one group raised their idea cell you know and the group said sir we do not know that you please teach them so he left so anyway the spiritual teaching means as I said on occasion say unless and until you are having the authority from the God nothing is going to happen so what we study we are studying together studying the bhagavata and here we are doing the same thing and finally the bhagavata teaches us Dharma artha kama Moksa give importance to mock Chandi give importance to bookshare why because the life time is very short we do not know what is going to happen so we can remember that one ladies to come and sit on the chair now she is no more with us and she was such a nice devotee anything happened she will be coming and she was very fond of cooking feeding and hold Gita memorized suddenly one day phone called Canaan - no she's not like that one after another going away we'll meet in another in the heaven for here but at this moment it goes away in these and immediately like the in the water innovative if you go to the villages sometimes that in other words that called the power the water so it comes you remove that immediately you see that very clear water you can see the reflection but after some time it comes and covers the world water so that is the way our mind when we talk when we listen when you read when you ponder that goes away and we see the reflection of the Hartman if it's so joy and after some time again that comes and cover so what we should do sasame Christians giving a wonderful example because he is from the village he knew how these to the water you have seen these to manage in the water and they will be putting a banach end near the steps so that the people can go and all the time can get the clean water we I will give a barricade in our mind what is that barricade Ramprasad says go on repeating the name of God go on taking the name of God so that's why diksha is so important any good guru's from the Guru you have received the God's name goddess name just go on repeating and you are giving a boundary so that you can see your own self and by that way time will come when you will see the moog sure the Mukti the liberation just standing before you and you wonder oh this is me are you searching myself and the great joy the jihad man / Mohammed mingle what will remain on the existing us see us D as the I am there am there I am there thank you very much let us charges multitude [Music] young-ran ha balloon indra do drama
