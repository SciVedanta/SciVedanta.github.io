[Bhagavatam - 2.8.22 ( Book 2, Chapter 8, verse 22 -to- Chapter 9 verse 23)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xxS8VpvW79w)

my salute bhagavan sri krishna who is the son of vasudeva who is the destroyer of the demon kamsa and chanura and the dear darling of the mother devaki the teacher of the world and the beloved of the devotees i salute him again and again from peace peace peace so we were reading the raja the king parishion is questioning king parishes is questioning 20 questions so all the questions about that brahman atman atman is the spirit that is non-material how does it then come to be the body it is the spirit how the body came it the solid you see that everything is and spirit is beyond name form it is you cannot say it is solid it cannot say liquid it cannot say so what are these man is seen has so many distinct organs of the limbs now the supreme person bhagavan from whose navel the world lotus has been emerged is described as having same kind of numerous organs and limbs what then difference between god and man god also god's body also have such thing we human body we have also same thing what is the difference so like that one after another so many questions the last question we read and we are still going through the questions of the king pariksit to shukadeva the it's the last question in 21st verse on page 127. squander 2 chapter 8 21 verse 3 read last time speak to me about the creation protection and dissolution of all beings of the ritualistic duties led down by the vedas and their metis of desire prompted rights and rituals and of the three ends of the human life dharma and karma so he's asking the question that tell me about creation protection and destruction of all the beings how it is happening talk to me about the duties what duties you are to perform ritualistic duties to perform which has been said in the vedas and in the summit that means bhagavad-gita bhagavata these are called smithy sastra and what are the things to be done desire prompted rituals rights and rituals you do this you go to heaven you do this you gain name you get fame you do this you'll be a king so all these desire prompted things how to perform them and the three goals of human life dharma ortho kama righteous living earning money dharma and karma fulfillment of legitimate desires etc now 22nd verse speak also about the emergence of jivas lying latent in the power of the lord in the lord's mind the whole creation is there all the jivas are latent sleeping as it were and the origin of atheism right from the atheism the philosophy of non-existence of god idea come of the bondage and liberation of the atman how the atman is bound how the atman gets free and of one's absorption in one's real nation and how one can get absorbed in the real nature of the divine and be ever free tell me how that omnipotent bhagavan who is ever free limits himself by his inherent power of maya for his creative sport and how in dissolution he abandons the maya and remains such pure witness these are all big philosophical questions 20 questions yes put maybe another 50 question inside that 20 question that means these are all deep philosophical questions which has bothered people that get bothered by that they tell me how the omni put in bhagavan 23rd verse bhagavan who is omnipotent omnipotent means is everywhere god is everywhere that everywhere the god residing everywhere who is ever free he has no bondage he is ever free how then limits himself by his maya you say by his maya he limits himself for this creative sport he comes down like a human being how he one who pervades everywhere how can he come into a human body you say by maya and how in the time dissolution he means god abundance that maya when he does not want any creation he gets out of the maya and then remains as a pure witness how these contradictory things are happening 24th o great one it behooves you to give proper answers to these explicit implicit questions put by me who have taken refuge at your feet now teachers should be extraordinary student is also extraordinary student has questioned 20 questions a serious question one after another another teacher will have to remember and now he will go on responding to this my god if someone tells me one question three questions one by one then i forget what they talk they say 20 means another you can include about 50 questions have been injected and he remembered and he will now respond to one to the other to the other they're extraordinarily brave no they are very great scholars and in extraordinary intelligence so it says who great one it behooves you to give proper answer please give me the right answer to these explicit and implicit questions put by me who have sarbaam [Music] o maha muni o great sage i am taking surrender at your feet please give me the answer of all this 25th verse in these matters you are as much as an authority as brahmo himself because you are sukadeva you are ever free soul to me you are like brahman itself you know everything that's why i'm asking you all this question and you're the right person who can answer this you should put questions to the proper person no and if those people who don't know that subject and you ask that question he may answer that will be fully censored and that will be confused more confusing the responses will be more confusing so in these matters you are as much as an authority as brahma himself for you are an authentic exponent of the gospel being in the lineal descent of the spiritual tradition starting from brahma and possessing down to through the narada and vyasa so that's why we are talking about guru parampara the teacher should follow the student his student his student that it should be the lineage of spiritual thought currents flow like a pipe through which the water flows huh one pipe to the other pipe they put it in the socket no and make that long so the flow of the supply comes from very high brahma helps himself god himself when first appeared he gave this wisdom then he trickled down through the parasara to baso to basosan sukadeva and he was because they were standing before me you know everything you are like brahma you are like brahman yourself so give me these answers because you are descendant through this lineage all others here are only saying and doing what the answers have said without any direct initiation into authentic tradition people may talk i may talk something that will not do your buddha should be it is called guru mukhi buddha should be knowledge should come from guru's mouth because there is the authentication comes whether the tradition see someone can give you a direction to come to this hollywood temple but a good gps can give you direction anyone can give a direction but i do not know whether i follow that direction i may be going to some other place but you belong to that tradition which has been tested and verified and authenticated again and again and again so you are the person who can authenticate and then give me right a response oh [Music] in between you go to other place by that time you could have reached the goal but you are going in now and here and over oh you come here we have many times when you used to travel not before gps in this country you have to read very well and you follow some map and follow this and sometimes okay i know i will go this and then you go to certain find certain floor spot and you drove one hour we will reach one hour one hour is gone what is that then you go to the grocery shop or go to the buy gas station and then said brother i want to he said oh i don't know you know you know say no and then afterwards they said okay but but you have come this way you have to go this way and take night after near the mcdonald and then you go and one mcdonald and you get another mcdonald you miss you understood one mcdonald and then you're there also you spend some time and then go back and it will take longer time and what is the guru muhibita what is the traditional wisdom it is verified tested authenticated again and again and again so that's the sure path we call good gps wage or some google map sometimes they do mistake very rarely but now it is at least it's more as much advanced anyhow so to illumine says absorbing the nectarine drink of the lord's excellence my vital energy is not in the least affected by the hunger and thirst caused by the fast i am observing this in front of the king pariksit what he did he has given up drinking water or fasting totally because i have only leave seven days i won't put my mind into anything but think of god and listen to god no so this is saying you say sukadeva you know absorbing in the drink i am listening to the glories of the nectar of the lord krishna that is like a drink that is the drink my vital energy still i'm breathing not eating anything not drinking anything my vital energy is not in the least affected by the hunger and the thirst caused by the fast i am observing the only threat it faces is from the cause of the angry brahmin boy the only trait it faces that only i am thinking fearful what the the brahman meanwhile give the trait you will die within seven days no that is the only thing in for oh i have time limited time seven days only i am in the world already my seven days one hour gone and six days 23 hours one hour gone no so this is my fear my time is short i have to get it no that is my hunger that is my thirst i forgot my physical thoughts physical hunger that's called the that is called the real genuine urge of a student depth suppose someone puts a charcoal burning charcoal on your head with a gun point i'll kill you unless you carry it there so how will you walk you will then smile how are you it's very nice and talk and he's burning charcoal he will run the speed you cannot run just run and just drop that type of birds let's say deepto shira jealous amiibo and then after dropping that you want to run into the water that type of art should be for god realization and asking for god so i am feeling like that that is the urge i am feeling now our only fear is i'll die another hour gone another two minute gone my life is shortened only click click click click click click click click click no so i am concerned about that that is my learning i've condition the only threat it faces means this body faces is from the cars of the angry brahmana boy nami naomi [Music] that means my heart is not painting for anything i don't feel hunger i don't feel thirst my mind is painting for the truth to know because i have to know before i die and the death is clicking at my just clicking like that now the suta said suta is the who is the commentator sutra is sitting there he's observing what naruto is saying what sukadeva is saying so he is the narrator he is giving the description of the incident then the sutu said 27 verse that says being mightily pleased with the request of the pariksit expounded in that assembly this great scripture which is called bhagavata equal to the vedas which is which was first revealed to brahma by bhagavan himself at the beginning of the brahma kalpa the beginning of the brahma's lifespan so this bhagavata was first uttered by by brahma and brahma is the first creation so first being when he created it came out of his mouth so it is eternal truth so this says sukha he was very pleased how why this earnest request of the king at the earnest request of the king pariksit then he expounded what he expounded he expounded that knowledge that bhagavata what we are reading going to read now it is almost like vedas because it has how many thousands of verses how many thousand bhagavata has how many five thousand verses eighteen thousand bahama eighteen thousand verses baba so it has been said by by brahma himself and then retained that knowledge it is coming down and the sukadeva was pleased to narrate that to this king pariksit who is just waiting to die that's why he says i am afraid of the death that why because my time if i don't get this knowledge before death i'll have to born again i don't want to do that i want to have full knowledge before i die 18 000 remember 18 000 verses are here in the book so when shall we finish 18 000 every day if i read even fifty fifty i cannot read twenty five so eighteen thousand verses to finish how many and once a month once a once every week four four times four times twenty five hundred verses hundred percent how much eighteen in my lifetime probably it will not be finished then and whatever question pariksit the glorious descendant of the pandava put these were all answered by the says one by one in the course of exposition of this bhagavad-gita so what we are going to read the answer has been given the eternal question he has put in such many logical way and this sukadeva is going to respond to that question which he got it from his father he got his from his father and it came from brahma adi brahma in his very birth he got this knowledge and it is we are we are getting the benefit sitting in hollywood to read this book [Music] 14 years i am not going to leave another 14 years 15 years but anyhow some classes will be missing in 15 years another 15 years okay jaima now we that is the end of the chapter eighth chapter now i start the ninth chapter book number two chapter number nine and i am reading the verse number one which is the answer of sukadeva to this question of pariksit sukareva is giving the answer now and it will continue the entire book will come in that way brahma commanded to do tapas inspiration of brahma shri sukha said sukhadev said o king who is the king pariksit o king parikshi except in terms of the inherent diluting power of the lord it is not possible to explain how a spiritually conscious entity like the self capital can have any abiding connection with this body it is impossible to have connection with this body which is limited and without the deluding power of the lord we call maya unless like a magical magic stick impossible thing cannot be possible because that the lord is spiritually conscious entity absolute conscious entity become unconscious like us i am the eternal conscious witness but i do not know that how much i hear it turns back to my body or to my mind right bodily age as you said bodily aches and pains and our mental aches and pains or intellectual intellectual some turmoil how possible the absolute consciousness how can it be this way unless there is that it is in deluding power of maya diluting power of the lord have abiding connection with the body this connection is parallel to the connection of the dream body this connection is like a dream body in the dream in the dream you create you see yourself and you see so many people so in the dream body as is the connection this connection is parallel to the connection with the dream body with the self of the dreaming man so you are dreaming no you are dreaming but you see yourself in the dream and a part in the dream play so this is also miracle huh you are lying in your bed there is nothing yeah if one comes and rolls his hand and stick so we should get hit you know dream i am seeing something i don't see any i don't get hurt my dream body does not get hard if someone takes a rod or a sword and cuts us no it will not cut because i am having my dream world so how it is possible it is also a deluding power of your mind mind has the deluding power and it has creativity and creates some fantasy and that fantasy is your dream and you think that how you are dreaming ah how good dream bad dreams is that what dream who is dreaming the dreaming person sees himself and gets crying weeping smiling all in front so this has a connection with this body also here now that means the deluding power because of maya which has innumerable forms the spirit capital shines through this numerous forms there is innumerable form in the dream we find in numerous form here also in numerable form may be pleasing form non-pleasing form the spirit shines through these numerous forms the energy shines through this numerous form they become alive they are smiling howling someone is smiling someone is dancing someone is killing someone is um i'm drinking all types of things are going on because of the shining power of the consciousness behind delighting in the gunas or prakiti he thinks this this self thinks this is mine this is myself this vedanta now see it is bhaktivu it's called the bhagavatam where is bhakthi it is called ghana vedanta this is so the delighting in the gunas we enjoy being in the gunas satyaguna rajaguna of the prakhiti he the individual soul is thinking this is mine this is myself myself this is my table this is me this is my pen this is my phone this is my computer this is my car this is my home this is my friend this is my enemy i'm me and mine madame this is the eternal conflict me and mine this whole universe i and mine are who is i you close your eyes and go to sleep everything vanish you go away your all your trained your enemy your anxieties your suffering is where so long the mind is acting all these are there when mind goes to sleep but everything is gone in the dream mind still functions the same mind creates such thing and in the fantasy see i cry in the dream i smile in the dream i dance in the dream i rejoice in the dream so this is the same connection here when freed from infatuation thought number three then prayed from infatuation with the body how through devotion to knowledge but this book will say through devotion then jivo individual troll delights in his nature as spirit transcending maya and the time so when freed from this and when the maya drops when this delusion goes away when me and my idea goes away then this infatuation with the body that this infatuation with the body this body is mine and anything connected with this body is my my my mind so this the jiva the individual soul delights in his nature as spirit capital and transcending spirit and transcending maya and transcending what is my expression time time space causation is maya so where there is maya you know there is time concept there is a concept of space and causation this cause that this caused that that's the karma theory comes there because of this this because of that karma this so whenever you are talking about that you are in maya so that's why it says the spirit of transcending maya and me scala he is no longer obsessed by the twin cycles of the bondage what is the cycle of bondage no one has tied us into the world we are all tied in the sacral of our me and mind that's why people say i hate him i love him love him he is mine i hate him i don't like him so this duality is functioning because of this circle bondage bondage of me and mine is really this people can meditate and find god in so many ways this is also direct means cut your me and cut your mind there is no me it is god mind is god's not mine what i possess my body i possess when i die you'll take this body what is mine i take this table with me when i die i like the most beautiful watch shall i take it with me i like some money shall i take the money with me or gold and jewelry shall i take it with me what will you take so if it is yours then you could take it is not yours to cut this bond of me and mine is another way of vedanta the everyday thing am i all bondage is coming me and mine you say thee and i no lord it belongs to you and everything is you then you are free the moment one can say that all trouble goes and faku says ramakrishna says ami gucci be janjal janjal means the garbage all the garbage of life will be cleaned washed away if army mole if i dies the small eye should die big eyes should come up all our trouble i i i say now only people we are really what is the circle no one gives me pain i am bound by my eye and mine if i say it matters that's right if you say not me not mine someone someone blames something in out of the 10 people who has done this i didn't do that when you say i don't do that then you were free or or you may be caught but you have done that's why you are saying that i have not done but really if one feels i didn't do anything so he's free so me and mine so i shall the twin cycles of bondage the feeling this is i and this is mine swam karacharya took this two words very appropriately in the samkar vaso fourth verse i shall tell you what the lord imparted to brahma as instruction for attainment of illumination and the release of the jiva from bondage when he manifests in his spiritual form to the former meditating on him in absolute concentration and devotion so he's saying i am narrating you that story but brahma he give that instruction and he attained from the narayana who was meditating on narayana his mind was absorbed and he got this wisdom verse 5 on page 129 when brahma the first of being and the originator and inspirer of all others thought about the ways and means of creation sitting in his lotus seat he could not get any clue as to how he should proceed when he started creation he was also in trouble how to create this universe walking while thus contemplating he heard a sound of two letters uttered twice from amidst the cosmic waters that surrounded him because he was lying down in the uh cuba snake no alan tanaga he was lying down the lord and he found two two sounds from the silence of the ocean these two letters the wealth of those who have no material wealth are tapa tapa brahma the narayana thought i shall create this sin i am alone vedanta says i am alone i want to be many now how shall i do you are seeing thinking in his mind in the cosmic mind no how shall i do and then he heard in the deep silence two words came tapa tapa tapa means do austerity do austerity that means this world has come out of the austerity tapa concentration concentration on your nature of the spirit obtained by combining the 16th and 21st of the consonants thor and paul in the alphabet you know like that in that taw and paw hearing it he looked around now i know he suddenly he thought i will create i'll be many and then his heart is towards ta pa he looked around to see who was speaking to him but he could not see none else than himself his eye only one he is saying it is coming out of his own no extra agency vedanta coming the world has not come out of other thing that brahman it is brahman only in the physical form you see but it is nothing but brahman but in dualistic language narayana he wanted to create and then he thought how to create and then he suddenly heard two sound letters austerity then he could not see anything he looked around and he said i'm the only one there is nobody to whoever uttered this word let me just come in the mind of the cosmic mind so sitting firm in his own seat he reflected that this very relevant instruction must have come from a divine source and decided to engage himself in tapas bhagavan also to create this he has to do austerity fasting [Music] that is true that's the scientific way of thinking yeah so what she says is correct he says that the top top tapa also means heat it generates heat tapa so when heat comes vibration and vibration out of vibration creation comes what is the middle heat then retraction in the beginning there is desire i want to be many and that this austerity means heat heat generated out of that that means mind become little agitated or something and then came the vibration and the whole world that circle this world is the expression of oh no oh that word also another way that is the vibration took manifested in this world and this only manifested it goes back through chartering home into the source he who is the most austere among the austrian possessed of infallible insight understood the meaning of tapas and engaged himself in it for a thousand divine years that divine year means big year 1000 years that itself is big time no we cannot do two days made it to austerity and he's saying one thousand year and one thousand year not human year divine year year means or 365 days is one year no it says one day of us one one year of us 365 is one day for our four fathers four parents all those who have died grandfather grandmother or their and their mother so those subtle bodies for them it is only one day hour 365 hour one year is one day for them and their one year will be one day for gods like that you know multiply by ten thousand years bahaba that means long time to create this vast universe stars and galaxies god has to work hard so it controlling the vital energies narayana so he also started controlling or why to control there is no creation where he is controlling god knows for whom he is controlling i don't know he's the alone person but still controlling the vital energies as also the external and internal organs he practice concentration on subject of creation so intensely as till we mean everything around tapasa created illumination every light everywhere now the vision of brahma what he saw then worshipped in this way by brahma the lord revealed his highest spiritual realm wherein impurities ignorance and their offspring fear have no place that means worshipped in this way by brahma brahma was practicing this austerity the lord then revealed to his highest spiritual realm it's called the balkan taloka these are all different names wherein there is no impurities there is no ignorance and ignorance is offspring offspring's ignorance manifest in the world in so many ways anger frustration lost greed all are absent there and which receives the adoring praise of all the great devotees they are neither rajas nor thomas nor sattha makes tweak them has any place that times ravage is unknown there even maya the lord's delusion power does not operate and there resides the lord's attendance whom both the devas and rasulullah's allies worship so that's a real impact describing that realm not there is no nothing to operate there nothing to control there so that is a pure state and there you find lord's attendance whom both devas and rasulullah worship there are narayans what you call attendance spiritual attendance like think about that life like swami brahmananda and he is encircled by spiritual children all are highly evolved spiritual people all the denizens of that realm are blue in color radiant endowed with eyes like lotus petals dressed in the yellow ropes extremely attractive and handsome having four arms bedecked with the brilliant gem studded necklace and other ornaments endowed with the glow of coral sapphire baidu germany and the tender stalk of lotus minala and wearing brilliant earrings diadem and wealth that means creation this is all they're all divine entities with gold and jewelry and all this see as your mind creates is it not your mind in the night time how impossible things are created there so similarly this is also the same as the sky is rendering glorious by the blue rain clouds illumined by the stakes of lightning so is the divine realm that divine realm what is it is called the vishnu loko narayana loka that plain you mean by this text of lining so is that divine realm beautified by the rules of mansions of its heavenly residents illumine by the explosive beauty of the noble women occupying them so there are all the beautiful girls are there beautiful houses are there all in the heaven that heaven is a place of all beauty all man and goodness all holiness and all uh money extraordinary wealth and prosperity see devi sridevi means mother looks me they are sridevi possessed of unimaginable beauty is adoring the feet of the lord with rare and invaluable ingredients no then what looks me will do lakshmi is rubbing the feet of the lord narayana you know in that plane we think that you go to ramakrishna luke what do you see you will see that ramakrishna he's there and they're singing and dancing and chanting and talking and going to samadhi that type here also you think of narayana so lok's mother looks me is there mother looks me with all ornament jewellery beauty extraordinary beauty serving the lord narayana even when she missed mother looks me sits on the swing for relaxation there is a swing i imagine all these types of divine entities people get relaxation we have a swinging chair people roll like that so there is also a swing and mother looks me being tired or relaxing when she sits on the swing for relaxation with all charming excellence of the spring season surrounding her and the bee is humming delightfully around her fragrant dress dresses she has nothing but the praise of the lord to muse or sing about so all the bees are running around obama they don't bite of course they only sit around mother loves me then brahma saw him who is the protector of all devotees the lord narayana and there he saw narayana we saw him who is the protector of all devotees who is the lord of sri lord of stream and he looks me looks me not seen that's why who is the protector of the all juggernauts of all the worlds who is all pervading and who is attended upon by the chief servants like sunan nanda prabha arhana and others brahma saw him who is extremely gracious to those who practice self-surrender to him he saw narayana who is extremely gracious gracious to whom to those people who are practicing surrendering self-surrender practice who is a delight to the eyes whose face is illumined by a gracious smile and rose tinted eyes and who is marked by his diadem ear ornaments forearms yellow cloth and sea adorning his chest that is the narayana or krishna palm krishna with the yellow cloth i don't in his chest see in the sign of lakshmi brahma saw him seated on a throne of a great majesty and surrounded by the 25 expressions of his creative power shakti these beings the four primary categories of prakriti purusa matata hong karo and other 24 categories of 11 indriyos 5 buddhas i 24 principle cosmic principle he was but transcending sanko also not only the kitty purusa mahatma ankara 24 principles he was also surrounded by his own sixth divine majestics consisting of wish hey we are talking about following six divine majestic conscious majesties consisting of wish lordliness one is lordliness bhija the prows joshua fame three beautiful auspiciousness guyana amin omniscience and birago renunciation these are the sorrow we should six treasures these powers are very partial and impermanent but they dance and the dance but they dance attendance on him always though he is never attached to or attracted by them being ever established in his inner spiritual glory this narayana is called bhagavan bhagava means which church where shah means this majesty that is called the western jew what is god's majesty his majesty is lordliness you can see and understand any ordinary person can understand oh he is the lord of the universe majestic personality bishop he has the power and prowse fame jasha he has his fame is everywhere three is beauty which is auspiciousness the gyano is his his knowledge and omniscience his all-pervadedness and by raqqa renunciation in others these powers are very partial in all other people in all other gods and goddesses these powers are very little but in in narayana it is all full but the dance attendance on him always though he never but he does not try to keep them but those powers as he follow him wherever he goes the six powers he never attempts to he's never attached or attracted by them being ever established in his inner spiritual glory 17 on seeing him the creator brahma was bathed in bliss within he saw this narayana in this form and he was horrible and with love and affection as he was almost bathing taking a dip into the wealth of joy and bliss which overflowed as horrification all over his body and as torrential tears from his eyes he fell down in prostitution at his holy feet which are attainable only to the highest form of devotion based on gyano characterized paramounts the paramounts who have the highest knowledge they can only have this type of devotion so he prostrated before narayana who brahma brahma prostrated before narayana with this power seeing that unabating power in his life then the lord a vegetable embodiment of love took brahma by the hand as an expression of affection so narayana was kind he took brahma in his hand up and addressed him in words searched with graciousness of his face while he brahma the chosen one for the work of creation stood before him with the heart who are playing with devotion so brahma stood overflowing with devotion narayana hold him up out of compassion to bless him so we have 10 minutes more 5 24. you know so we can read little few pages so brahma request brahma's request to the lord now seeing so and seeing in the lord narayana in whom all the powers are there but he does not care for that but they live with him the powers ordinary people work so hard to get the powers but those powers are with the lord narayana who is the cause of creation so it is there so the lord asked yes what did you say the lord said brahma's request now now the brahma is requesting to the lord narayana what no the lord said lord said o brahma o brahma who holds the vedas latent in you i am highly satisfied by your long and concentrated meditation for enlightenment on the work of creation so you have meditated on it for a long time i said ten thousand years divine years the worship and prayers of perverted yogis never satisfy me in this way that people may do meditation with distracted mind for long i am not interested in that it does not please me but o brahma may good fortune befall you ask of me whatever boon you want for i am the general granter of the boon to all but know for certain that there is nothing greater to be achieved than realizing me he passed what he said you want anything ask me but know that to know me the narayana that is the highest question you can put and highest glory you can reach your attainment of my realm your attainment of my realm aim capital r capital that means this loka the divine plane is because i wield it it is not the result of your tapas though it might be an occasion that you are able to perform this purpose that means inward concentration at my command was also the result of my will that means there is nothing you you have it is my will i wished it so you were able to do that here comes ramakrishna said the leap does not move without god's will so this is the thing the narayana is saying in the bhagavata it is my will my power which prompted you to do the tapas austerities for thousand years and and it is my wish that you could hold on to this tapasha this is my power when you stood utterly confused as to what you should do it was i who directed you to perform tapus tapos is the core of my being and the meaning of tapus is myself tapas is me and tapas is the core of any realization anything you want to realize we should do toppers everyone is doing tuples scientist is doing tapas in a lab a builder is working tapas austerity in the heat and cold so much work so everyone is doing some purpose by creating some heat in them to concentrated practice in this beginning i create everything by tapas by tapas i support everything and by tap outside we draw everything too tapos is my supreme browse so here is the end of 23 verse i'll read next time what is the question um [Music] so now we'll have one or two questions question is could you kindly explain what the difference between maya mahamaya yoga maya oh my god maya is a term of vedanta maya means in vedanta what you think is there it is not maya is yama which is not really there it is all brahman all god what you are seeing is table chair floor roof watch light you are saying this is maya and mahamaya the shakti the same it is the power maya is the veiling power and projecting power that's called maya maya has two segments vedanti it's from vedantic language don't mix with devotional language maya is delusion but muhammad is not delusion maha maya is all the time there as long as brahman is there brahma and the shakti both are there so snake is there and snake's power to move wiggling power is there a musician is there musician is there means musicians singing capability is there you cannot separate out the singing capacity here and the man there we cannot do that you are a um expert in anything skill your skill and you cannot be separated so that is the muhammad idea [Music] [Music] which says it appears but it is not true it is brahman you see that other than brahman whatever issue there's maya a delusion but muhammad is this power of brahman or brahma-sakti but the shakti is not false it is the brahmana appearing in the form of maya so this is the difference is it possible to see narayana in saturn or is that just mind and maya also yeah yeah possible to see means what do you understand but seeing if you understand that eyes i see you narayana can be seen yes by when purified mind mind becomes pure they see the god vision different visions of gods and goddesses they see so you can see but that seeing is within the realm of maya so long you see so long you hear so long you act those are all maya but you are not that you are beyond that no one sees in vedanta who to see whom if there is but one so seeing is within the language of duality but seeing of duality is possible why not people are meditating on rama and krishna ganesha on shiva and if you had the vision of shiva ganesha narayana or they have in a purified state of mind they will be able to see that but if you say from vedantic perspective then it is called yes that vision is also not the ultimate so long you see there is two something you are seeing someone is here some knowledge interacting connecting them so you have to say no so long ramakrishna said he who is rama he who is krishna is ramakrishna but not according to vedanta vedanti is only one anything you see you are coming into duality seeing action seeing is an action i see when i am there first then the question of seeing comes three things are necessary for seeing i who i am seeing the object i am seeing and there should be sensory organs or connections light sensory light and eye eyeball and retina and all these things are necessary so this is not absolutely vedantic idea so in that sense there is no vision there is no sheer maya okay is maya as a name a child giving the name maya is it auspicious yes it is a little girl one year and he named her maya yeah it is auspicious but you can think that in vedantic technical term maya means that which appears is not the real so that is called maya but my eyes greek maya means good mother in greece so which language you use sasket language one way my niece's daughter is um it can mean that way also maya means which you get a test but as you said better to take that meaning then good meaning in the greek in the greek they say that but but as can worldly and spiritual liberation go hand in hand or must renounce one to have the other yeah and ultimately two things cannot go hand in hand but this transition should be very slow gradual then it is better worldly worldly fulfillment worldly fulfillment and spiritual liberation can they go together rarely it goes because our mind when it is engaged in the worldly fulfillment i cannot give that mind for god so how this and that can go together it cannot but to this to realize god this worldly fulfillment is lesson but that fulfillment comes in god god is more joyful if one can taste that joy here in god then it will be okay but it takes time takes eternity and it should be gradual right how you deep suppose this says the worldly fulfillment and that side is the spiritual liberation no so you cannot stand here and think that you are reached here if you move towards one step one step one step that means it is automatically falling behind falling behind and you are going towards the truth so one side is god realization another is the worldly fulfillment worldly fulfillment yes people get engrossed into worldly fulfillment and they achieve their goal but to achieve that ultimate goal you will have to first give up and think of the joy of god and be absorbed in the bliss of god gradually gradually and then it will automatically fall back you will not need not have to fight and it is not a painful journey but it is a joyful journey because you are getting more in god what you give up and what you get you get more what you give up and nothing give up ultimately you then come back and see everything is god but that is the last state so we have to first move towards god and when we move towards god we call it renunciation where i am renouncing this it is not renouncing actually it is receiving the total joy of god giving up the little things of life so it cannot go side by side for the seekers of truth we find that they always give up one to receive another we cannot think that a high school a young boy or a girl will be all in fun and joy day and night and club night nightclub and this day dancing ending and he will do a good result in the examination two things cannot be done to do a good result you'll have to give some time for study and other things and that time you'll have to give up this and this and this and that in spiritual life also and to get this big joy then you have to give up little little little and but when you get it you say oh my god i didn't lose anything i got it more peace peace peace we shall be meeting we shall be meeting again at 7 30 our class for shanti gita peace song you
