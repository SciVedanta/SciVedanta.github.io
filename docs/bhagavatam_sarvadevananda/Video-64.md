[Bhagavatam - 3.25.25 ( Book 3, Chapter 25 verse 25 )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNsR0Kz868s)

foreign [Music] the darling and sweetheart of mother devaki and the guru of the entire universe we celebrate that bhagavan Shri Krishna again and again peace peace peace unto us all so today is a pretty auspicious day first of all today is the birthday of bhagavan situation the embodiment of love incarnate how the love of Krishna and Radha the Supreme pure love was manifested in the life of Sikhism himself the unique bhakti movement of Bengal was started because of him in the time period foreign was born Bengal's condition was very difficult different and difficult because of Islamic actually ruling they you cannot chant in the name of God and you have outside and it is receiver punishment was there there is to pay some taxes because being not Muslim but any belonging to Hindus so that was a very terrible period and C bhagavan situation in the bonus nimai he was exceedingly charming and drowning boy young age and was a little naughty also but as a very intelligent and talented and he was so great in argument she learned that your other Scholars were scared of him when they used to see him from a distance because of his extraordinary knowledge and wisdom and intelligence is to conquer the opponent party easily and then a transformation came into him and he totally lost become egoless and day and night crying for the Lord and like ramakrishna did for and it's the uniqueness of situation is that he used to live in the three states it is ramakrishna said one is vaishodasa external state living like as we are but they are also totally merged into God consciousness talking about God listening to God bind withdrawn inwardly and he is totally there but not there and going due to the ultimate state of samadhi that was like ramakrishna going to samadhi you can find and he used to cry and cry and then is to totally get lost a hand is to enthuse people wherever he's you used to be there this this extraordinary love for God was like a contagious things and that is to inspire others to be God intoxicated and whole movement of bhakti movement as I have said which is now iskal is a part of that it has the origin of that is from bhagwan Sri chaitan and this is also another way it's called the Dole purnima the day when Krishna is related to the story of Krishna and Radha throwing colors to each other meaning the scholar of the heart is thrown to you and your heart should be covered in each other and then all in the union of Oneness is actually that's the door and that is very great festivity all over India and they throw color to each other thinking that that how to feel that Oneness one Oneness with each other and God's color and the Heart should be filled with God's color with everyone that was the this so this today is a very auspicious day from that perspective and we are reading bhagavat the story of Krishna which was the favorite thing for Sri caitanya to get absorbed into God intoxication now we come back to our reading in the bhagavat this is we are in the book number three chapter 25 and we read up to 24th verse and here this we are reading that kopila the God God himself incarnated in the form of a saintly person who is called Kapil a boy with devahuti the mother and his father was now when he was born but he is not an ordinary son he was God like an incarnation of God and he established the philosophy which is called kapila Sanka philosophy kapilo sankoca so he so he mother could recognize that the Lord has come down in the form of his son as copilo and kapila now advice this mother is forgetting her relationship Earthly relationship she asked kapila that that you the Lord have come down please teach me how to overcome how to get over the obstacles of being in the world and away from God how he can be United in God as ramakrishna said in the gospel of ramakrishna we find that only the greatest and easiest means of God realization is holy company holy company so here we find that kapila advised mother that you want to cross the ocean of this Sanctuary this world of suffering and babe then you do sadhu holy company now the question comes who is a sadhu we are reading that that we started reading from verse number 20. today we'll start from 25 page 257 of the book so who is it true sadhu let's say copilo his answer is being given by copy love the wise say that intense attachment to the objects of the world is the cause of bondage for the soul we are bound in the worldly Affairs because we are attached to the worldly things because we are attached to the worldly things we get the suffering because we feel it is real because it is real that we feel the consequences of its being given the giving me the suffering or pleasure or pain so all the dualities which bother us so because of that but at the same time the same attachment which I have for the worldly thing is directed towards the holy men oppress the Gate of Liberation not God God if you can you are a higher person but if you've not at least you find the holy person who is pure in heart and who is dedicated to God if you fall in love with that holy man then like Ramana Mercy like so many Saints and stages in Christianity in Islam and in Hinduism of course Buddhism so whenever you can think of some holy holy person is tangible he is matcha absorbed and then then he describe what is a holy man who is a Holy One a holy man is one who is patient in all circumstances who is full of fellow feeling so to see how many qualities they are talking about if those qualities manifest in one person then you know he is a holy person says that his patient in all circumstances we get Disturbed little thing happens whatever happens but the moment and we get Disturbed disturbance will be there also in their mind but they settle down within Split Second that's the greatness of the holy man how quickly a situation will agitate someone it is a physical something physical action and reaction someone throws some play something on your face your eyes will close and if you tenders into your eyes you will be burning yeah it will happen for a holy man and will event everyone but how quickly one will feel it is the body not me that is his holiness so how he will be not reacting so that is the first continent called the quality who is full of fellow feeling who loves her loves other and feels for the other there are people very rare people in the world they talk big things but they don't feel for others no you know who feels for other is a sign of his Holiness God is always giving and feeling and thinking for the good no holy people always think of good about blessings for all even suffering themselves they take out the sin of others they suffer themselves and give Solace to others who is friend of all that means we we have our choice of friendship who matches with my feeling and emotions our friend or my my way of looking at the world no so one politician common subjects would be there to love each other another politician they may find in joy and friendship but who loves all whether he is a good guy bad guy but he looks all like a friend ignoring the negative side not that there is no negative but he does not focus who looks upon none as enemy if something comes they say oh God is there also only is covered with a darker Cloud plus the difference between a holy and an only neither light is the same external covering is darker or brighter no who is overflowing its peace that's the point you go and before him you will find that he's he is established in peace or he's containing more peaceful mood rather than us so he is who has virtue alone as his ornament he is not a gold or jewel in the body but he has the ornament of virtue good virtues honesty truthfulness all these virtues who has a deep rooted love for me God he loves God and God deep rooted love it's not superficial whatever situation comes he goes back to God for every solution characterist raised by a sense of inseparable intimacy God is me my own and my God is in my heart he is my heart and soul and everything and I belong to him he belongs to me this intimacy intimacy extreme intimacy is a holiness one who realized God because there is no intimacy love unites no devotee loving God their mind becomes tuned to God Consciousness and close close when that small distinction go there I and thou become one that Rumi foreign the Beloved came and they said who are you knocking at the door who are you I the door didn't open then he said who are you it is me and there is no opening like that and when he said thou I am thou there is love the distinction between the lover and the Beloved reduces reduces reduces reduces and become a one that is called the vedanta unity that Oneness de Brahman that happens in bhakti language but the doctor the devotee and the Lord the distinction erases zero he works solely for my sake this hadu will be working not for others pleasure not for thinking that I am pleasing this guy he is my boss external world that maybe someone will tell me to do something but I am doing only God God is telling me to do this work I am doing to satisfy to please God not work that work has become worship so that will be the another sign of a holy man so not one one like one side developed one person maybe you can find one expression but it should be so many things benefit but a unique character of Love dedication sacrifice feeling of Oneness with God and so he works solely for my sake and abundant all dependence and relative and trans men preferring to depend solely on me we depend on what whenever any trouble comes we go to our friend no oh could you please help me anyone in any problem we go to the lawyer can you help me we go to the bank to give me loan I Take Surrender here and there and there and there but real sadhu will depend on the god though they may have some external way of acting but they internally know whatever Hell Comes it comes from God and they rely on God more than their own friend their own mom dad brother sister and everything they rely on God he always hears and speaks of my sanctifying deeds and excellences that what will be the tendency of a shadow will talk about God and think about God and go to a place wherever anyone is talking about God that that is the tendency if you don't find the urge and bhagavan also what you call the bhakti Sutra of Naruto says no and listening to Lord's message or where there is a sankirt and kitten and glorification of the God's name going on that sadhu will go there ramakrishna is going to running he is he is going to Calcutta and taking help of others who what he's asking will you take me I hear that that man is holy man and he doesn't take the bhagavan God's name how they call upon God can you take me so he is asking others to take him to a place where there are people are calling upon God or talking about God no he went to Brahma samadhi fine that is that they have their service like in the form of his church when they are present there and he went and saw that how they are talking about God and and there going he is adding he likes it he no one invites Uninvited he enters and gets insulted but he goes there this is the sadhu sadhu's heart okay who is talking oh this man is talking they don't think who is talking but what is talking he's talking about God that's enough it matters little who is speaking so that type of idea will become manifest in the sadhu his mind being fully given over me no affliction in her efforts or troubles him any trouble comes as I said you were enjoyed someone saying that these are opportunities in the Sunday class after question answer session someone is telling the suffering which I got is bad but that's that's great great lesson and we I am God's grace holy mother said that India any difficulties come for others difficulty we would rather Curse God why God is so weird what is this Justice in God's word and they see it in different way they see that with God's grace because he sees the unreality of the world earlier than a frustration with the friendship with all this world what can give they say it is all meaningless no one is there when I am in real difficulty no and they take it as an opportunity rather than an obstacle to spirituality beautiful so that is the sadulai character not that it should be a monk you should not have to be this is the characteristic of a sadhu so many wonderful mothers the heart is leaning towards God and God an opportunity when the trouble comes he thinks that it's an opportunity to call upon God look at our life when difficulty comes that is the time we call upon God many times the days are very sweet and very happy and dancing and singing people are coming friendship is going on I have money and people are around me going on and when my troubled time period comes all live even your greatest friends will live they never will look at you and I'll never ask you so that they know that this is the thing so where shall I go now who will be my Refugee who can look at me when Rama Vivekananda was lost his father and such a rich family person in the richest of Calcutta one of the richest person in Calcutta was his father his palatial house and when father passed away in such a terrible condition all the relatives went on taking opportunity of the home to possess the home and going to quote his father I you owed me so much money so you cannot give your property give the house and he was outside from home his own ancestor room and went to his mother's got his mother's place no and mother was and how much suffering who was there sorry we can understand days were there when and I used to move and all will flock around me oh not in he smiles so good oh no rain you are so good oh so great and you are beautiful you are this and that and when he is not having one day maybe he has not eaten anything whole day he didn't get his Square even Square meal no one inquired about it he's taking money or in hunger to fulfill the hunger he is feeling with faucet water on the roadside faucet water defended one day out of hunger and the way so this is the who was there then ramakrishna came with his God and that is the point the holy people takes these are opportunities to go to God then yeah so such person who are without attachment to anything except me they are the real sadness it is desirable to seek their company oh because they are the veritable destroyers of all worldly attachments is they say sadhu ramakrina said sadhu is like some people get intoxicated in India every country they have people get intoxicated they drink and get an intoxicated so some people say that how to remove the intoxication they had some Countryside simple method they will put the rice water and mix the rice and in the water and then then water mixed with rice that that water they put it into the mouth of the person who is drunk and it removes the intoxication and it comes back to normal then I don't know whether it is still true or whatever but that is the conventional idea that sadhu childhood sadhu holy man is like a water to remove the intoxication of world and worldliness because they are prisons they think of God when you go in their presence but the moment we forget God forget everything but God that means our mind affects us and when you see holy man smiling cheerful full in his own satisfaction that gives a connection that is the sadhu how is he like that because he loves God so what we have to do we have to go to Holy company ramakrishna repeated advice holy company holy company gospel turn pages after perish you will find many suggestions but it's the others are difficult do pranayama do yoga and vedanta Analysis may be difficult but if you tell say that but we don't really feel anything but you get the instant benefit other benefits are maybe in future you will analyze now world is unreal Brahman alone but you see the one world is one when you do but hunger comes with hunger in the body it is true theoretically it is all remain mental level you are doing but practice you go to your sadhu you instantly mind is uplifted instantly you see the wonderful qualities that has been manifested in his life and that will in Impact a mind and that is the benefit so he says oh mother please go to a holy company in the 25th verse we start today in the intimacy intimate company of such holy men you will hear accounts of my glories and glorious Deeds which form a vegetable drought of ambricia to the ear and the heart that means bursting heart and the sadhus presents an intimate company will be you hear that he will they will be talking about God the pure the stainless who is God is nothing but joy and Bliss so you'll hear about him and your ears will be satisfied your heart will be soothed by drinking there is this Ambrosia you will soon develop one after another what will come in your life Faith in the path of devotion Delight in God and deep love for him three things Roti and bhakti the technical term three things will you go to holy man gradually unconsciously you will develop these three qualities shraddha so that means faith in God if you see a holy man he has nothing he does not depend on anything but God your faith comes how the man lives like that there is God so the faith in God and you also feel I can also think try as the holy man has done in his life so that means love for God love for yourself respect for God faith in God and faith in yourself time so three things will develop you go to Holy company that's faith God is there ours are not stable but seeing a holy man because of their intoxication God intoxication faith will come how is cheerful they are not external position they're not getting good food they're not having exterior Comforts maybe they are in a bare body smearing gases in the cold area they're so happy so cheerful face beaming with joy there are even once in Himalayas and saw some sadhus like that so just in our order there are many but we had the opportunity to be there in uttar Kashi sometime in Himalayas and then we went to see Santos in severe cold it is wearing nothing smearing the body but how professional joyful cheerful face beaming so it develops in us God is there he this man is the testimony and what makes him happy what makes him cheerful and peaceful so calm and sitting in the old external conditions and he's not begging money he's not going for anything no enjoyment no fun I did this how they saw Joy is beaming through their paces and there's one point the delight in God you ask them any spiritual question they see their face will be sparkling with joy more they're talking about God they feel excited as as someone talks about his beloved no with you ask about a mother you ask about the child Mother's face will be beaming with joy you praise the baby Mao will be very happy no so if someone speaks about God it's a delight he'll find that he is delighted in God only and third point is that he will deep love for him which is called bhakti by the power of devotion consisting in the constant remembrance of my Excellence is manifested through my creative and identic activities man gains Detachment from the world all worldly objects becomes enthusiastic in spiritual practice so seeing that type of devotion manifested in someone a holy man what happens the powers of devotion which is inherent in us that is and it manifests through my creative denimation of activities then we try to hear about the glories as we read ramakrishna we want to hear about his life and as you go to the life we get astounded oh my God what God intoxication day and night crying for ma mama you are here give me your thoughts on give me your thoughts on rubbing his face on the Sandy bed of the ganga the sun another day sun is just sitting on the western Horizon ma this whole day today is gone and I have not realized you this intoxication for God and when you hear this we feel something oh what are you doing here no their act their life their incidence of Life inspires us that's why Excellence is Manifest to my creative and Redemptive action Redemptive action is touching people taking care of their sin and they are getting ecstasy go to Girish goes the greatest example forget about how many came to ramakrishna in this room day and night there a Mart of joy is going on his room is small room and in that room how many people from Calcutta coming morning till night and yes he said no privacy we say privacy bedroom this is the meeting room this is the bathroom this is this nothing only one room and the bed is there in hey people are sitting he's lying down and sleeping when a few minutes five ten minutes he says and no privacy and talking about God God God God day and night and singing and dancing and giving and people are Charmed with that they're getting elevated so Redemptive power so through my Redemptive activities man gains Detachment listening and seeing those people people pause a moment and think ah every time don't get attached love God love God God realize in the goal of life so that type of Detachment from the worldly objects and become enthusiastic then the then they'll get inspired to speak if you some good sadhu then seeing him he will feel oh let me go and sit sometime do little meditation do little prayer no that inspiration comes from them and strives to adhere to the bhakti disciplines which are natural and therefore easy to practice bhakti in his devotion is in everyone's heart we love we want to love we we want we love we want to be loved we want to love this is our human nature so this this loving God becomes spontaneous and easy when you see a holy man manifest it is not words it is only theoretical talks and one can give a big token bhakti yoga but maybe driving in inside so bhakti is such a thing your heart will be saturated with that you will feel the what to say in language it cannot be expressed so but it can be generated by the contact of holy men by avoidance of sense enjoyments by knowledge augmented by renunciation and by communion with me the Lord through loving devotion man can attain to me the indwelling spirit of all even in this life on Earth one can really get the all few characteristics will develop what avoidance of the sensations attachment to the world and sensitive experiences I have seen enough I have done enough these are this does not please move no more foreign people and and followers Entourage I don't want any one worldly pleasure I only want your loving presence to feeling on me I want you only a situation of prayer is six hours to come there are eight verses there who chant every they chant the name of the Lord is the translation of that but Sanskrit is much more profound there it says um hmm so so I want that that will mind holy man's uh there is a story holy my story if we go so detailed then we cannot progress anyway the Holy One story is that there was a great Sage sent he was doing uh who is the name I forgot that he was doing his spiritual practice that but the landlord was very jealous of him because many people love and respect him and goes to death holy man and soul with love reverence and he is a landlord and he does not get that reputation so become jealous so he wanted to just see that okay it's a fake holy man so she sent some prostitute to dive out the mind of this holy man and the whole the third lady came some of the caitanya disciples I forgotten the lady came and as soon as she came and see she was doing in the Rosary in Japan then he said she wanted to say something or to show something of her body and things but he said let me finish doing Japan one hour gone two hours ago and that's it so he didn't he could not stop his rosary and went on hold and then the night was over and then the that lady fell frustrated and went back and that then he reported to the landlordary he's a holy man he has no attraction for anything he is not interested at all see he started doing Japan the whole night I I could not do anything he said first let me finish my job and his job was never finished he continued continued so one day and the second day also again I hit the landlord threatened him that you cannot just they couldn't care of this one guy who's ripping what Japan go next day she came and she was doing like that and ultimately third day also he only says I am doing japa I'm not yet finished the touch of the Holiness third day she transferred to her totally and said I am leaving this Cottage not necessary Give Me Shelter at your feet I like to lead a life I lead the ugly life and where is the joy and you are so happy with you in lord's name Teach me and then he taught God lord's name and left and she will become a saint that lady so these are the example of transformation the holy man can transform us and its impact is to mean that if the genuine Holiness is there yeah oh lord of the Universe I don't desire for Janam people and sundaram kavitam you're lovely spouse to come which will not ask for anything else oh no no no cause why I love you there's no cause I love because I love you I don't want to gain anything there is another verse in this success that whether you keep me under your loving care or you put me and thrash me under your feet you are my beloved Lord and I am nobody else so this is the intense love and that develops in them [Music] the same subjects enjoyment at one point by knowledge augmented by renunciation this this attachment is due to renunciation of the sensitive experiences because these are all Limited and mind will be totally see the same thing is happening for the Monk we say Monk Is the monk monk is no great anyone can be a monk internally Detachment attachment to God Detachment to the object that is the sign and bhakti also says he will feel this in least interested in the world eating and will be interested in the joy of God the indwelling spirit in all and even in this so in this very light he will one can attain that spirit again said the mother again mother talking to kapila Kapil was giving advice this much but that mother you do holy company that was the advice the mother is again putting the question what is the nature of true devotion you are talking about devotion what is the nature of real devotion because we see what is the devotion we know in Temple we go with a in Hindu temple you go people carry some fruits and candies and these and that is an offering in sensors and offering that is a devotion people go and pray that is a devotion people go some take it deep in the Holy ganga and and do all these ritualistic and that's also a devotion normally people don't like that you go to the church you go ahead anywhere there are some certain rituals is that is is that the devotion that's why she is asking mother what is the true devotion what type of devotional practice suited to me okay there are so many ways you may say but what shows to me like a student asking the teacher tell me what I should do there's your general instruction but what is for me you have anything to say which will enable to attain to your state of Nirvana and Nirvana is a language that Buddhism they are using in the bhakti I will attain that state of Nirvana let's say people fight they are not actually spiritual people the only intellectually they are intellectually they are fighting to put their Supremacy over other but practicing this they are using the same state of Nirvana or Buddhism is talking and it is not point is that how I shall be freed from all these other things and get established into the Eternal Bliss that is vedanta eternal Bliss it is God language are only different which you did preach with yourself as a subject of What description is it and what constitutes its auxiliaries what are the main teaching you have already told about bhakti what is the main principle and is auxiliary yeah every constituents by your grace do expound to me this difficult yoga in a way that even I can easily grasp the meaning of it then the narrator was in between maitriosis she said he said thus learning his mother's desire and prompted by love for her who gave birth to his body copilot revealed the principles of the philosophy of Shankar and also bhakti and the Sciences science of concentration that forms their backbone so see here is the harmony of all the yogas so what he taught is he hearing that Mom Mother is desirous of learning ah what is bhakti prompted by the love for his heart who has given birth to the body so ramakrishna also has to go to serve his own mother so this mother asking me about spiritual question so seeing that copilotin revealed what he revealed the principles of the philosophy of Shankar that's called Sanko philosophy is the Scorpio is the originator of the philosophy of Sanko the greatest psychologist of the world who has given this philosophy and it is still now from time on that and that is constituted vedanta philosophy so it is the foundation of vedanta and philosophy of shanku and also bhakti and the science of concentration how to concentrate the mind then which is talking about bhakti Ghana and meditation bhakti ganodhana then again so this he is an embodiment of copilo the teacher child give this to the mother then said Copilot when all the powers of man's senses which are ordinarily frittered away through external contacts are purified through devotional practices and dedication act dedicated action and they get a natural leap focused on ishara exclusively without an extraneous and self-centered motivation and with the firmness with no obstruction can overpower that state of mind is called bhakti we take back this ways you know but to see the definition when all the powers of man's senses power substances our senses power of Senses pipe senses look at that whole morning till now that energy of seeing is fitted away seeing this seeing that seeing that seeing that all the external thing which are model which are subject to Decay eyes are hearing so many sound meaningless talks no how much we hear about really genuine spiritual talks which enriches us so normally it is treated away our energies are treated away all the five senses his corresponding objects are there they're all treated away in this way are purified they are little purified it is God's glory to the tree look at the tree it is The Shining Nation is the god signing through that then your energy which is printed you're directing towards God seeing something God hearing something God taking Prasad that tongue it's not the food fragrance it is the Lord's the perfume offered to the Lord to connect it connect your all sense subjects with God God God God God God God purified it will be purified and through the devotional practice it did not happen unless you have a prayer to all your heart loves God and tries to spine God everywhere then and dedicated action whole day what you do it is not work it is not job but it is dedicated service to God I am blessed I could serve God this much so dedicated action as a result they get naturally focused on ishara if the all the senses are connected with the same subjects which are really treated every for every one of us day and night will generate that it is it is wherever you behold anything you were Awakening of the name of Lord Lord narayana or Krishna will be awakened in you we see the matter only we will see the Divine only how will you see unless you love God who is divine who is everywhere to see God like that that is fundamental bhakti so you should be purified by bhakti people talk about vedantic truth they are ultimately true but they should be background should be prepared then from this level that bhakti practice trying to trying to see the Divine in everywhere I may fail I don't see but this may be an imagination for me but that is the starting point we'll have to start there then he said without any extraneous and self-centered motivation I try to see God I try to love God not for any mixed strenuous purpose to get money to cure the disease body these are also good but you can do that but higher thing I don't want anything but I want you so that exclusive and it's a firmness which has no obstruction can overpower that state of mind is called your mind will be steady on that that is the devotion is called that that is that that's a devotional definition is very deep on that the frittering energy which are five senses every day is lost lost into vain it is not bringing any peace and joy in the heart that will be stopped and instead the eyes will see God here will hear and or every five senses will bring the sensation a beautiful song uh with that song oh Lord means my mind will be wherever it may be in whatever time it let it be so aware that we can respond to your call here is God here is God you are everywhere my heart should be so pure to respond to your call you are standing before me I don't recognize you you are in every Beauty you remain in every smile you are in every thing which is manifested in the universe so when when my mind will be tuned that is the thing called bhakti and that bhakti form of devotion of the Lord such devotion is superior to mukti mukti means Liberation Liberation means not to be bored again does not want Total Liberation I imagine the god finish I touch I love God and then again come out and again intense love it's called anxiety separation anxiety in the worldly language that is more enjoying the Bliss no if you go and Marge into the samadhi boom we're gone but again coming back to the body and craving for that Joy it becomes intense radhavani is to do like the ramakrishnas to do like that coming down again going up and intoxicated in that mood after a long time enjoying that again coming down no that is the mukti is permanent Liberation means Union with the Divine and bhakta does not drama said I want to be sugar not to be sugar but to test the sugar so that is the bhakta bhakta wants to test the joy of God every moment every moment his whole body will be thrilled with joy every poor of the body will be standing erect a revelation all over the world out of joy and Bliss it burns up the covering of ignorance in a person just as a fire burns up objects put into it the generates in one all the negativities from the life will be just burnt out like burn Fire Burns all impurities of the object no you put a say blah say aluminum what is called uh bauxite aluminum oxide which is underground and you were to make it a pure aluminum you want to separate out what you do you put in a blast furnace the high temperature and what happens it takes out the draws what remains it is the pure aluminum so pure aluminum that's a burning bottle has to go through burning the Peace of and what is the alloy mixed aluminum alloy to remove you have to burn it so the bhakta goes through so much of crying and opening and suffering and this and that apparently to purify purify let's say bhaktu takes it it's an opportunity when it comes in life so it's Fire Burns of the objects put into it so it will be made bhakti will be that the covering the ignorance which we have covered it will burn up foreign or even Oneness with my being that means I am one with I am Brahman they don't like it as ramakrishna said for their Delight consisting in serving me and in working out my will and not in becoming one with me they therefore congregate together and honor me my adoration and participation in my work so therefore these bhaktas they don't want to be United but they want to be rejoicing in my name sing in my name dance in my name these such holy persons perceive and engage themselves in loving conversation with my enthralling Spirit spiritual even emanation which possesses beaming countenance and Lotus like eyes and having the power to Grant all the devotion with that so they will be talking about me they'll be rejoicing in my name they'll be finding enormous sharing those ideas as ramukino said as a him smoker finds great friendship with another him smoker so similarly bhakta finding another Factor will be so happy that I can talk about God no suppose you are in your plane and you find suddenly on a co-passenger and he suddenly come to know that he loves your philosophy not with others and even if any how we feel close in that strange environment so that they become like that when they get intoxicated they only talk about God only like friendship I finish this because this it will take long enough question afterwards 36 verses through their mind though their minds are dust captivated by Me by and absorbing me in my enchanting formless aspect which is charming and Sublime pictures movements smile looks and speech their devotion leads them in the end deliberation though they themselves do not care for it they will ultimately bhakta will merge into Oneness me they release the same conclusion said he will be sucked into that love then you will the drop of water will merge into the ocean what the drop will do he is the one with the ocean he has no way it will be one but this tremendous attachment tremendous love thinking of his glory thinking of his holiness he'll talking to the devotees day and night that is the means of bhakti and they will gain all these higher qualities of an absolute non-dwellery experiences but bhaktu does not want that see how ramakrishna says bhagavat is saying the same thing they become the inheritors of the Divine powers and Bliss that reside in me they become like equally that in them my glory manifests no they go into the after death remain in another plane higher plane the Lord Ami resides in me that power which is in me in spite of there having no longing for any of this they don't care for these powers and things but it will go on conditionally in them because they think of me they get my glory as we think so we become the Eightfold powers are all the glories of the higher World Austin siddhi eight Eightfold local Powers they can get easily they can do miracles in the world no but they don't care for those things but it will come to them you don't care but it comes to you that says you said what you renounce that thing runs after you those devotees who consider me Capital their nearest and dearest their soul their son companion teacher friend chosen deity remains deathless in their neighborhood of peace for on winking time my weapon of universal Destruction has no swayed over them you know everyone dies but they will not be dead they'll be immoral eternal the glorification of the bhakti devotees who give up 39 given devotees give up desires for this world and the next World for the subtle body that links one's life in those two spheres as well as for the physical body which is associated with wealth relative home Etc in this life and love and service me the all-pervading being with arms swearing devotion are surely released by me from the involvement in the cycle of birth if they are born again they'll be born as a bhakta as a devotee from the very childhood the glory what is his name was very born with that type we have seen many sadhus in their Childhood Days on what they are always thinking of God talking about God running for the sadhus even with small boys running after this in India we hear about many of our life is because they're in previous life they have done so much baby bhakti they are born into that environment 41 except for me Capital here meme is always God the Lord the absolute the Lord of nation and of individual Souls then are for winning spirit in all and the Supreme person endowed with very Every Blessed attribute no one can get relief from the great fear of death that beset all involved in the cycle of birth and death everyone will be under the cycle of birth and death but these devotees will be eternally free even if they born they will be born free pour out of fear of me Capital all nature moves I am the lord of the Christian in my fear the sun moon stars goes in order no how everyone is rotating in the world how the cosmic order is going on whose control and we know even to do some little organized work we cannot do how much energy is so the Lord God who has discreeted this Cosmic universe everything is in order see sun is rising sun is rotating art is going on the galaxies are moving and these and that they coming night coming rain coming out coming sir who is doing all this thing so I was with the doctor eye doctor today and just saying see I to ask Me baba you are finding so much in that one who the only one eye department and he's talking about this to the lenses and doing this and testing this and finding that and listen and power eye pressure and high pressure who is maintaining the eye pressure are you doing anything for your high pressure so who is doing who is the planner so it is very difficult to understand that cosmic power no that's why I say the the clutches of that the whole world is rotating but who is what is freed from all entanglements all nature is moving the wind blows The Sun Shines the hindro Reigns The Fire Burns death consumes all by devotion supported by knowledge and enunciation this is the point devotion not simple dancing not simply just going to the temple and church and saying and or talking about daily in worldly talk and becoming spiritual no such humbug so it is by devotion which will be supported by knowledge bhakti should be misra bhakti bhakti should be infused with Ghana the knowledge and renunciation that renunciation ganous should be Detachment you know what is the use of gamma all God is the reality everything is unreal and I am stripped into the unreality so now knowledge and renunciation spiritual experience attained to my glory which are heaven where fear is unknown man attains to the highest he can in life when he gains one point in an answering Devotion to me when his mind becomes unperturbed by anything because of his total self surrender to me so only if you surrender to me and think of me that devotion can help one to cross all the sufferings of life and the greatest of that is the fear so devotion devotions Glory how to attend deviation we have heard next day we will start the chapter 26 when the gopila this sun child is giving the advice how the 24 principles what are the principles of the world those things we shall read on starting from 260 page um okay few minutes per question in srimad-bhagavatam we read that we should want only pure devotional service to the Lord so then do we simply trust that our needs will be taken care of by God so we need not worry yes God if really one totally surrenders himself God takes care of everything just look at the I give the normal example sadhu sadhu holy man we are talking about holy man in India maybe million holy holy men or not at all and not maybe into the highest category of realization see who is feeding them every day every day are you sending some money or do you have any trust account or they have any just what is the source of their getting a piece of cloth what is the everyday meal who takes care of their when they are sick who who is that who organizes that so yes but that is a very high state we need not have to think that God will take care of me in bhagavad-gita he says if anyone takes surrender to me I shall meet his Earthly need whatever he needs and whatever he has I protect that and whatever he needs I Supply that so behind State but now what we should do we should make a compromise God has given me certain intelligence I will exercise those intelligence to earn my bread and things and rest of the time I will serve him as a service or the work I am doing I am serving God with this attitude let us be backed up and bhakti will saturate and mature mature in a place where we did not have to worry anything God will take care of everything they will send people from unknown sources there are many stories I cannot say because already time is up but there are stories in the Himalayas many of our sadhus tested tested and not that big guy is tested but uh like our friends and they were in the deep forest and they thinking okay thakur is there let me see verson I am not written the whole day is gone no food let me see if taku bring some food here then he'll understand he is there oh my God at all hours and somebody comes out of nowhere in the middle in the in a forest and bring some delicious food and he said he was dreaming he was sleeping but his Lord Rama and third time when they got he got there whatever food he has collected and took it and he saw that sadhu is there no so who organized his food with our effort so no but there is a great higher state but in our state we should have our exist our energy first with the proper attitude that I am not working for any I am not a slave I am a slave of God and God only and I am serving him and I am blessed I served and the result comes whatever and then gradually gradually mind will be purified then you will see everything needed in life God sends in time it is an experienced experienced experience of the any holy man a little mom called a devotee now according another question according to the Lord so Eternal disciples the new fight devotees first practices Boise over time with persistent sincere effort spontaneous does the devotees teacher assign particular disciplines hungers based on the need of the individual is a good question you have given the response by the we start with the regulatory disciplines huh you have to get up in the morning regulatory you have to take a shower before you come you feel fresh with the wash clothes then you incense offer incense and put a lamp these are all Preparatory it's not necessary there's nothing to do with God but it is all leading you to feel that I am pure I am pure I am going to think of God so I am becoming pure purified and purified so these are regulatory bhakti you have to do the Puja we do the regulatory bhakti you have to do first item this second item that third item this sprinkle water this way huh so you can do all these things but it will turn into voice and over time with a sincere effort it turns into Little Love Grows for God and if you don't do that in the morning suppose you are not get any chance you got engaged in something else then if you know who I have not gone to the temple even you don't meditate but you feel something as if you are lacking something you are feeling something off so this will turn into a devotion means love has generated for God I do not actually have practiced maybe in with that intention or I forgot the intention I was engaged in rubbing the sandal paste do you do you understand thinking God God God God God Maybe not maybe the tongue may say the Mantra but mind was somewhere but this regulatory devotion leading to the devotion which is called the say um that becomes spontaneous spontaneous your love for God goes gradually it is a matured state from that regulated resistance to this day and does the devotee yeah professionalism no we are not professional we want to grow in love for what you call the raganuga as a stage stage one to stage two can be like that yeah that can be yeah I do Priestly job people may do some pristi job devotee can also do the Priestly job for earning money but there may be only priests can do because I get money that I do that yeah that is the professionalism we are talking about but anyhow we are talking about devotees who want to love God so loving God may start with the rituals and forms but it should end in real genuine love of Oneness with God and third person is there any difference between Sangha and sadhu Sangha no sadhu Sangha what is the difference between sat Sangha and sadhu sadhu is when holy sangam is Association holy Association so it may be a person that's great if you get such a holy person if not holy books holy singing Holy chanting holy image meditating on that these are called Sangha sat means shadu so sadhu means who is sat U is whose heart and soul has gone to God some association association if you associate such holy man we talked about then it is as equal to association with God because you are associating with someone who is becoming like God one like God characteristic all the good characteristics of him so yeah there are the two words are the same meaning the same truth okay thank you all huh okay stay separated testing sugar only while they keep their physical body I'm not sure I understand if ever after the past do they go to an eternal Heaven serving the lord no does the bhakta stay separated they try to stay separated with much effort they said I want to love you I want to serve you so keeping that type of Desire they keep themselves a little away from merging in the Mars they cannot do anything look at that I told the studio Mary and Martha when Mary is tuned to Christ he cannot do anything dysfunctional observing Christian Christ and the and the master the Mary and Martha bring one he's doing for whom for the Lord for the Lord's Lord's world so work is possible to keep little separation But ultimately the bhakta tries to stay stay separate and to test the sugar only while they keep their physical body yes but after that if they wish they can continue another month another month that's why Bhagavad says even they are given Freedom total they don't like it they want to enjoy that way that's why they go to we call ramakrishna loka mind lives in different structure of development and in a level where he lives with God only just you think that if a person sitting in Hollywood or in Switzerland or in India or in any part of the world creates an atmosphere in his mind that he is living with say ramakrishna or ramakrishna's room ramakrishna's Association day and night singing dancing going on in that mental plane he'll be a crazy guy in our eyes but he lives in that awareness it's called the ramakrishna Luka someone is living Shiva Shiva Shiva and living in the Shiva Consciousness day and night you'll be Shiva after death while it will go he will live in that consciousness heaven too long we are not talking about yeah there is no Eternal Health but because this is also not permanent this Loco will be there for some time but that will do is as they say it will suck ramakrishna said a needle and a big magnet how long the needle will be away so long dust and dart is around the needle and when you scream it will be sucked into it said he'll be sucked into the infinity that reality you have no power there yeah but though they must try so I'm not sure understand so probably this is the point that bhakta stays separate testing sugar only when they keep in their physical body when they lose their physical body they can stay in their subtle body because that is also still another level of existence we dream at the dream time do we not have another existence so in that life pure dream that's why in sometimes pure dream we call oh mother came in my dream and gave me this Mantra many people talk about that so where it happens you are lying down in physical world no in your bed and but mentally you and his mother so that's that is all the Visions are like that so that will be after date also they can stay there if they wish and according to their satisfaction they all may merge into that whenever they like so they may come back again with this feeling or they may be totally merged into samadhi and come back occasionally like we find in the great people foreign this type of pure people if they survive they survive for the good of the world by God's will like Swami Vivekananda he was meditating in the plane of high level by the gods and goddesses cannot enter in that level of non-dual but he's still there went and catch him come back do my good work here so he came back but they're doing good see these are the level they live for the will love God not Mars totally but to remain in a low car in a plane and much higher plane where only Divinity and Purity is there okay another question can you talk about the true way to surrender to him there is true aim is surrender how can I talk about surrender surrender me surrender we do whatever I have done suppose I have done I have talked one hour I said I I have talked but what we say now I offer it at the feet of ramakrishna I say that say that saying oh Lord I offer it to you oh Lord I offer it to you that means you get connected with the Lord and here everything is an offering surrender surrender surrender so it is to be practiced that anything you are doing not by your own power it is God's power this dead body this dead engine cannot do anything the Consciousness is behind we are jumping and hand is jumping mouth is speaking eyes are looking ears are hearing these are all instruments only only the power is God so if I surrender to that surrender to the all the time all the time then you become a embodiment of surrender then who will take care he will take care he is taken care of now also we do not know only I think I am doing I am talking I am reading so this is anyhow thank you all for joining and we are too late to discuss questions that I will see you again at 7 30 with our Gospel reading foreign [Music]
