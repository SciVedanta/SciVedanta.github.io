[Bhagavatam - 3.16.13 ( Book 3, Chapter 16 verse 13)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQS_Y9P0U-8)

no no light hello hello here hello foreign [Music] and the destroyer of the Demons and the world Guru of the world and the lord of the universe and darling up mother our salutations to him again and again from peace peace peace so sorry we are little late today to start uh but we are here we are reading the book number three of the bhagavat chapter 16 verse number 13. these two guard they were guarding the Abode of the Lord in the heaven and they didn't allow the poor holy people they are the firstborn child of Brahma and they are extremely pure and they are born with the knowledge of Brahma Ghana and devotion so they came to see the Lord and the guards will not allow with much request so they are cursed and then getting that curse now when the Lord Krishna and narayana came to know that he came in a very apologetic way and then said those to attending the Lord said those two attendance of Mind Jaya and Vijaya Jaya and Vijaya Jaya bijaya two they have misbehaved towards you in this regard of my command therefore o sages these four sages who says yes what you what you who follow my ideas and intentions have pronounced as punishment for insulting holy men I accept the validity of it fully because you have done that you are holy people and he one should not stop such holy people to come to the Lord so therefore I accept whatever punishment you have given to them so as I look upon holy men as object of worship I myself god of the lord of the Universe I look upon holy men I am little earlier I am reading verse number four just to bring back to our today's reading so they are the the Lord narayana says as they look upon holy men as objects of worship may I please you by asking your pardon for what my attendance did to you by way of insult I deem it as done by myself he has done I have done so please can I be pardoned that the God Lord God is asking and that pardon to the rishis who are the only what what will you say who are the holy people no when a servant does something wrong the world attributes it to the master and distribute that one gets that way erodes one's good name as leprosy roots on skin it is because of you holy men that the holy Waters of my name and excellences have come to possess that extraordinary sanctity by virtue of which even one deep init can purify the lowest of the law because you are so holy you pronounce my name and my glory is everywhere therefore is one should not insult you but as he has insulted you my attention responsibility is mine and that is the thing no glory if anything the ideal ideal uh people in the society they protect their subordinates and take the responsibilities my mistake no so it's a great example how to live in the society ideal people it's your narayana is saying it's my fault as it were I did this offense to you so you please pardon that being the case I will destroy anyone who works against you even if it may be God's protecting the world who are to me like my right hand from the holy men Contracting them have my feet derived their sanctity and I have come to possess immeasurable excellences and the power of destroying the sins in all so he said that they say whatever you say I beg pardon that is the point 12 verse says but they are overbearing conduct towards you those two who are my servants and who have acted against my ideas and intentions have got a fit befitting punishment let them undergo the same immediately and come back to me afterwards may you say just be pleased that this period of separation of my servants from me is made as brief as possible this is a favor and blessed blessing which you can easily Grant so I am not saying that you should withdraw your punishment now you have punished them to to get away from this Abode of heaven with narayana and you go down and live any Earth you'll be born in the Earth and so but only can I say so they are my servants you have given this the separation the period of Separation so can the separation period may be squeezed so that they can come back they are also good servants but for my protection they have done little extra which is not good but can you please punish them but shorten the period of separation from you because bhaktas always want to serve the Lord and they want to be close to God no vedanta will say I am that finish but bhakta want to play with God the serve God these are the different ways of closeness to God I live in the same plane same place Lord is here I am here okay same look sameep I'll be standing as a God in front of him whenever the Lord will ask anything I will be the first to serve no some I look I will be thinking of him in such a way I will be like him people look at my face and we'll see that oh he's he's narayana himself as it were Sami brahmananda when he used to walk in a spiritual mood and direct disciples and others sometimes used to see that ramakrishna is moving that because they're so tuned to the ideas and thoughts of Sri ramakrishna so he is saying that these are different categories of devotees according to the punna they can be very close intimate God take caretaker of the Lord no serve him directly in the living maybe not that much pure but leaving the same blessings same place no occasionally you see him you see the Lord you can you're cooking from a distance this is little the same plane but little away someone very close like that so these are the things so they cannot bear they are my devotees they cannot bear this separation so shorten their period of separation but how can you certain that means they will have to get out of this punishment so how they can shorten it's what it means that's why they they came they prayed that please do something that I don't forget a moment God let me not forget God for a moment even for a split second I should not forget how can you not forget whom you forget who love if you love you know he is there okay let me forget but when you hate someone or you feel that he is going to kill you suppose the idea someone's head is declared okay if anyone can bring the head of this person one million dollar will be given and you are walking in the street you cannot walk alone you think somebody is always who is going to kill me no good morning [Music] myself but Krishna who is the cause how can I get rid of Krishna Krishna is killing me so Krishna will be born to kill me so always someone is killing and round around me watching where I go and what moment I get an inanimated moment and they will cut kill me so that's why they think of God more intensely that is the idea of this punishment now kumaru's apologizing apologizing to the Lord the kumaras means this Rishi kumaras they also very humbly said anyhow out of anger I have said no so good people always come back to this understanding very quickly now the Brahma said verse number 13. chapter 3 book 3 chapter 16 verse 13 page 217 217. hearing this charming auspicious and mantra-like words of the Lord the wishes though agitated by anger released it so much that they still felt unsaciated with it that means hearing this Lord narayana himself is saying yeah if they have done something actually as if I have done please forgive please shorten their punishment that's all they don't live far away from me for a longer period how can you squeeze that separation in one lifetime that's why in one lifetime that's why so intense now then then though the rishis were agitated and angry that's why they cursed released it so much that they still felt I'm associated with it as if they are not yet happy okay and and tries to see and do little uh what you say to play with it for a little more do the hard and thought long over it they were not at first able to understand the true significance of the Lord's words as their brief Noble meaningful and not easily yielding their real input coming gradually to know of the Lord's approval of their conduct they began to speak with voices excited with joy and here standing on end to the Lord whose form marked the summit of his yoga Maya's achievement in the manifestation of divine Glory so coming gradually to know the Lord's approval the Lord has approved that Rishi Kumar is cars they began to speak with voices excited with joy and hair standing on the end and that means with excited excitement much excitement with joyful condition they try to speak to whom to the Lord see Christina rayana who's and who is narayana he's narayana is formed by the summit of the yoga Maya's achievement in the manifestation of the Divine Glory yoga Maya by Maya created this universe so this narayana is the crown of that manifestation the rishis then said verse number 60. says oh Lord we are puzzled to receive a request from thee you are the lord of the universe I am father you are requesting me we are now subscribe oh Lord we are puddled to receive a request from you who are the master of everything for a favor and a blessing to thee from us I will keep you as if you are begging pardon as we have done something wrong to me you are the lord of the universe how come it's possible holy men are as equal the objects of worship to you who are devoted to them those who are brahmins those who are holy people they are devoted to you are devoted to them as they are devoted to you you are devoted to them and do holy men who are honored even by these Gods you are their inmost Spirit the holy man is Holy because you so even the gods worship the holy people so their inmost spirit is you the worship the Eternal religion has come out of you yeah you are who you are sanatana Dharma so your the Eternal religion the sanatana Dharma they that has come out where from you the Lord and you are it's protected to to preserve that sanatana Dharma you are the protector you the Eternal esoteric and changeless being are actually saying you are the beginning you are at the end from you has come this religion Eternal and you are the embodiment of that you protect that It Is by your blessings that spiritual aspirin cross the value veil of depth how then could you seek another blessings you are the lord of the universe it is surprising to me you are asking blessings from us you are the crown of all really a realization you are the sanatana Dharma profounder of sanatana Dharma and you are protected of that sanatana Dharma all these values of sanatana Dharma then you are asking blessings from us Howden could you speak or seek for another's blessing 19. it is by the blessings that spiritual spirit and cross this value of veil of death how then could you as seek another blessings he 20 20 verse he who is ever served with love and attention by sridevi at whose feet all bull Seekers prostate at whose feet see they be is competing for a place with a royal honeybee who sucked the off nectar of the flower rests placed there on my devotees he who out of his absorption in communion with assembly devotees neglects even SRI who is engaged in his loving service oh to speak of him who Bears The Mark of srivatsa as seeking a purification with the dust of the Holy feet of men it is all only for the instruction of the world he says you are so great Who You Are but you the SRI Devi mother loves me is always worship your feet and she he who is ever served with Love by and by sridevi a two-speed all bull Seekers prostate we all who is asking for any Boon or blessings they go and prostate before you it is said servo namaskaram and um We Salute anyone if this salutation is not going to you but it is going to the narayana we knew like streams of different rivers fall only to Marge into the ocean so all salutation all respect we show to each other it only goes to keshavam prathika so you are such glorious person and it is it is all only for the instruction so what why are you doing this that the people will learn how to honor the holy people uh the sages or to respect the society to keep the society they high standard this these holy people should be respected such and God himself is showing that honor to keep the values of this oh you who manifest 22 oh you who manifest yourself in all the Three Ages so you who manifest yourself in all the Three Ages by your wish fulfilling and pure satta manifestation you do word of the influence of Rajasthan Thomas which destroyed the satigo qualities like top tapas austerity Purity sympathy and Truth and then Resort restore their aspects of Lords Dharma for the benefit of the holy men the neighbors and others so your wish fulfilling and pure manifestation when you come up as a born and take a human body then what happens that that manifestation is such a manifestation manifestation and you do word of the influence of Rajasthan Thomas when God comes and what happens Thomas and rajas cannot stay there when such then rajastham has become down when Thomas becomes said Rajasthan Sato bows down their head in the society we find very bad people in the dominant all the good sources good power they become powerless huh other time the newspaper these that talking so much thing and then brutality is going on no one dares to order one word rajas was there to kill that is needed but it is not like Thomas added with rajas but satta added with rajas Thomas rajas satwa now rajasth if you say Activity King King killing the demons Etc if it is rajas but not prompted by Thomas all this what happened in the world of nuisance where Thomas is the propelling force I arrogance what it is that it is not it is satwa but the good of the humanity for establishing sanatana back to its pristine Glory shut the quality is dominant manifesting to rajas so this is the distinction so you do what of the influence of Rajasthan Thomas and which destroy the satirical qualities rajasanthamas always they will destroy the Satya quality their three three decades ramakrishna said rajasanthamos they are three day quiets why decodes that they take away your own essential spirituality Thomas what he does it takes away all the good qualities of you and make you everybody Thomas rajas activity are against these that and satwa but all are decodes but the decors what they do Hide Away rubber Thomas Dodd they quiet first caught that person and take away all his assets money wealth Etc and then said let us kill that is a Thomas no he's not satisfied with only taking away his good qualities money wealth jewelry whatever he is carrying spiritual wealth and not only said kill finish rajas become little good quality these also same in the same team three people are working and he said okay brother we have taken away his wealth his goodness is all good gold jewelry everything has been taken away so why to kill then let him bind me bind him into the tree so that he will be in the forest and he will suffer more see rathers if you bind somebody in the Deep dense forest where no one comes and your hands are tight so if they go you will be tight like that and standing all the time so they thought they bind it rather quality minds are Sim Karma foreign okay come I'll show you and take him to the age of the forest and say now see that is your home go that way then he said why not come with me well I cannot go I am a day quiet bullies will catch me that is the jurisdiction Beyond three Guna tin Guna is the state of what you call ah realization State of Consciousness no there is no gunas can play but it binds you may make friendship with this as a Golden Chain and iron chain this golden chain sometimes though we know it is bondage but we like to have it because it's gold so Saturn that what sapta quality binds Us in sukha happiness in karma Thomas to organize them tomorrow takes us to again ignorance mohawk again and more than a delusion so the Moon is destroyed the whole personality you have no sense what he does what you get have no consciousness Raja is little better active and little intelligence but arrogance if you can fall down at his feet he may be little kind to you know rajaguna don't you know who you did and you can really get little excuse satigo is out of compassion will come to help us so he says that this you do come up with taking the satta quality and word of rajas and Thomas because rajas and Thomas destroyed this qualities what is the subject you call it is it is like Purity sympathy and Truth austerity Tapas and then restore these aspects of the Lord's Dharma for the benefit of the holy men the Devas and others so shakta quality let it come back to Holy people back huh God comes to him Gita starts with that yada means the glory the the grace of Dharma Dharma qualities subside and at that particular moment I appear again that means I appear as such a quality and then satta people get the benefit of that say ramakrishna came and the society was the same Society but the society some are seeking for truth and those who are seeking for truth they all went to ramakrishna get the blessings of satta quality and that's what the quality lead them to God realization so to restore the satrika quality amongst the holy people and the seeking who are searching for honesty Purity and love so to give them God Appears if you do not O Lord protect by your sweet words and favorable actions the lives that preserve the holy tradition then the paths of spiritual fulfilled Men Let Down by thighs yourself and The Vedas would go out of bog and be forgotten if you don't do that occasionally come and boost it and give this boosting to the holy people and others then this Society will totally be lost from these values of Eternal religion you who are the embodiment of the satwa would certainly not like this as though are even trying to check the growth upon through the true Kings and other such agencies which are expressions of your power now you are the embodiment of sort of quality would certainly not like because you are a certain person you won't like that as you are ever trying to check the growth of adharma Society always always down goes downward so don't not following the Dharma path of righteousness so to when you see the growth of our Dharma the who doing other the Kings like the big Kings now it is Presidents of Russia uh president of Afghanistan ah so these are powerful people what they are doing or Dharma when they are doing this to check that you come stop them from that that's why Rama Krishna they came again and again by saluting and showing respect to others in order to set an example to the world did that in this says salutation when he met first giris goes his arrogant or the ramakrishna came and she said little bit and out of that reciprocating with head up and ramakrishna down bent down little more and then Girish been down little and little little to the ground went to the ground he fell down at the probe so that is the pruna master the weapon so you narayana now is saluting with the rishis the holy people that is the Conquering the ego of other people and establishing a ideal condition how holy people should be honored and respected that's why in India if you go so many millions of people billions of people one 1.4 billion Maybe but do you wonder why a pennile is beggar wearing a girua cloth he may be a monk may not be a normal the other people will go and salute his feet touch his feet there may be a robe and sometimes people in in Indian Society it is very very Not Unusual when there is a natural light movement When government was so strong and catching the this beastly nature of the Knoxville is going and chopping the head and beating and killing bitterly because you belong not to the their group when the days to go in in Himalayas and just wearing a Gateway cloth start becoming also gave that story now there is a man who went to steal from somehow and when he has almost done and the people woke up and then he what he did he left all these things and with there were some ashes smearing the asses he became like a jogi and these people started trusting this is India always it is you can cheat in the name of the dress or or outside that air and then the this ramakrina story goes that the people are searching searching instead of a thief they found one Yogi is sitting like that with smeared with ashes under a tree and they say oh yeah they wanted to start adoring that Yogi and bringing fruits and this and that then he thought himself that's a different story goes differently he thought if I am a thief I only pick with the clothing what is that nothing maybe some little iron cloth and bare body throwing out the cloth somewhere else and smearing the body and these people love me respect me so much if I become a real real sadhu then what will happen then he give up everything and become a monk my point is that there are people who can just even they are not true sadhus or true holy men but get respect continues in Indian tradition and in every country probably sends up some position but in West sometimes Saints will be declared a saint after death so lifetime recognition is very rare that's why you all Saints go to India tomorrow well it is not a good place they you have to give three tests and severe test of of the miracle so somebody jokingly said Christ one was born God was born once in the west and they beat beat him and make him crucify in that way so thinking that God got scared never to go there so he comes in India and he's born here and there the safest place he controlled kamsha and all the kings and and also made friendship with Judy srid and all these things and then made that Dharma no not political party but their idealist says no look at the ramakrishna came he touched the intelligent top intelligent people of the of that time of British India and that impacted on the other way and other big guys he influenced in spiritual Satya this time it is more manifested enough quality therefore another time it was in need of rajas and Thomas so to to work on the Kings more focused but the king of the modern society is what top intelligent people and those who control the whole society and see look at that this is not the actually so many wars are going on who will remember them but those who are in in the intellectual level they control the whole society like that so he has impressed them and transformed them into spirituality and that impacted the whole world say not in he has current conquered norian but you're not in conquering not in he has done so much work in the world More Kings have come down at the feet up because he didn't go to the Kings but Noreen went to King king of ketry king of Rajasthan these that and they all fail at the feet of the museum penniless monk so in that way transformation in every age is different that's why it is called ramakrishna is a Satya beneficent God himself as he said in the bhagavatiq but this is the supersattvik supersetic because the other time they need a Raja Sikh body they are to born in a King's family archery these that they riding the horses family now meditation and in the childhood you read the earlier life of ramakrishna the childhood is a baby even a small child in the just going into the nearby Boutique there is a canal it's called bhutir Khan cremation ground he's sitting and meditating there so it is a different type of manifestation for the age we are born okay let me finish this few lines so you are the embodiment of satta quality would certainly not like this as though you are ever trying to check the growth of adharma through Kings and other such agencies who are expressions of your power and the Kings and these bad people that's why it is called the bhagavata yeah it is not just bhakti bhakti the good and bad these Kings bad kings they're also your power see this is the other through the Kings and other such agencies who are expressions of your power and if they are applying in a negative way Thomas away and others can apply in such a way by saluting and souring respect to others in order to set an example to the world you who are the master of the whole universe would suffer the loss of dignity yeah people think that you are a great man you saluted by your dignity is gone sometimes in the uh in the worldly sense we say yes bow down to him don't know who am I he thinks that he's a very great guy that he does not bow down but he the big guy when salute someone it sets an example who respects whom this one story is respected Girish goes his story is is remembered by all people an example for the world that the lord of the universe narayana himself saluting a drunk uh what do you call actor producer and a person of Bohemian character to arouse his spiritual Insight by only by saluting him bowing down glory to the Lord people think I saluted him who is that I don't do you know who am I talking to even even sadhus also sometimes make a mistake you know I am such and such I belong to this organization I have this quality I don't know I can speak like that who are you and and if people will love that type of expression all very loaded men and so humble who who is being is an example so yeah is a great example you look at that yeah I have seen him with the top people from a distance as we know and we do Ordinary People when he is meeting anywhere he's saluting like that and it was a beautiful smile coming out no he says same respect so that's the glory of the holy man and that's why that's the glory of God also she's sowing by him this type of practice that Society should survive Satya Society will be built up oh Master we accept with our whole heart whatever you command whether you punish us or give us a higher place than where we are now occupy or meet out a proper punishment to us for having pronounced a curse on the innocent people they are also holy people they say you see we are holy people but we should not curse anyone but I have cursed so you are the lord of the universe you can give any punishment if you like you can pull us down give us punishment to go down or you can boost us so whatever it is you so the both side when there is a proverb that when two good person moves in a road one goes to the right side and then goes to the left side both walking on the bad Road Middle Road good road is left for thinking that you can use it and he's thinking you can use it and more no normally that is the good people and bad people they will fight who will be in the center and if someone comes they'll push it out so this is the God himself salutes the devotee devotees are saying we are holy men you are offering your pranam but I should not be an annoyed we should not be angry we should not do that but I did it please give me punishment whatever you want that's my last word o mastered O Lord of the universe we accept with our whole heart whatever you command whether you punish us or give us a higher place than what we now occupy our spiritual level or meet are out a proper punishment to us for having pronounced a curse we have cursed and innocent people and they are they are knowing not in the fault he is the god it is his duty to not to allow anybody and everybody and not without appointment not any later and for these boys naked people because there are holy people and they move around this poor Rishi Kumar had access to anywhere they can go to heaven they can go to the Earth they can move anywhere they are free to go anywhere so they suddenly appear and how do we know that you are such a person then you should understand on yourself so they they also felt that that for that gives punishment then comes the point verse number 26 onward what is the settlement final settlement between these two conditions that whether they will be punished or what will happen what is the resolution that that is now is is few passive is there any question not then I can finish this this chapter is them bhagavan said these attendants will soon be born in this species of asuras because you have cursed to keep your honor they will be born in the species of asurasura there is it called devasura sangram Always There is a fight between the Devils gods and asuras demons demons means demonic character their mind is demonic like you can cite so many examples all demons around Modern Age big Powers demons noted for their antagonism to gods there they will develop intense antagonism towards me God is giving in that verdict both party now came to the Lord and Lord is finally saying that these two my guards will be born in the family of the asuras Demons they will be noted for their antagonism to gods and goddesses they'll make the hell life of the gods and goddesses and also hate me they will develop intense antagonism not ordinary type of when a um hatred but deep antagonism towards me and as a consequence their mind will get concentrated on me wow hmm they will then have a communion with me they'll day and then think of me intensely thinking of me they will have communion with me through confrontation not to love but confrontation which will help them to come back to me very quickly although it's like 10 lives one life it can be know that you happen to curse them because I will so you think that you have given curse no I the lord of the universe behind you made this arrangement of cursing these boys because Brahma then said then the sages Overjoyed at the Blissful experience of the Lord and of his transcendental and self-refunding about circumambulated the Lord prostrated before him and went away with their heart saturated with joy glorifying the Maha Vishnu and the spiritual Splendor all the while the war Lord then said to his attendance now he told these three four sages that he they your words will remain so they will be born in the family of the asuras demons and they will be creating great hatred for their gods and goddesses as also will be towards me and by that way they will think of me constantly and then ultimately as a result they will get commune with me and that way they will come back soon to me and then and this is where happy and the circumvented the Lord and prostrated the Lord and then went happily and now these two boys two two gods the Lord then said to the two attendants you may now go but have no fear good will come out of all this though I am capable of wording off the power of the curse of these two Sages I do not do so because their action is only an expression of my will what they did said ramakrishna said they would leave does not move without God's will who do you think they give cars out of his own and I will destroy the game so understand whatever we are doing behind God's power is working if you understand then then you have no responsibility but we know I did it that's why all responsibility comes good bad effect these punishment has been awarded to you even long back by Rama Lakshmi this punishment has been awarded to you even long back by Roma sridevi as you once obstructed her from entering my Abode when I was in yogic slumber so I was in yogic summer and mother Lakshmi wanted to enter you stop them so there you did one mistake already you have been cursed there by communion with me through confrontation exhaust quickly the evil effect of offending the holy men and come back to me within a short time saying this to his attendance the Lord went back to his Abode of striking Splendor and towering structures those two Heavenly residents because of the irremitable effect of the cars of those holy men were hurled down from deprived of their spiritual glory and their High self-esteem they used they think that we are somebody you know so they are deprived from them their child great was the cons consternation among the divinities assembled when they witness this downfall of the two attendants of the Lord from the realm of bull control this is very great teaching you don't be so boasted think that you are fortunate to serve many people do that we have seen also these are realities of life even the this this hate samis the earlier swamis we have heard those who are God they are the most powerful people they can hate somebody saying get out here and this and that because power is the behind and they misuse that power they cannot hold that that and as a result they get this type of cars it is thus the two attendants of srihori that now entered into the womb of diti to the fierce Fierce virility of the Gospel it is by the effulgence of this Asura twins that your luster has been eclipsed this is this is the will of the Lord that means they were in the high heaven they've been just pushed out of that because of their mystery so very very careful should be one to serve God disappointed they say defect in your attitude of service the Supreme Being who is the master of creation preservation and dissolution whose resistible Power of Will cannot be overcome by even very great yogis that bhagavan the Lord of even the three musky will work for our good at the proper time what can be achieved primarily speculating on it huh so that there returns to 16th chapter and we will start the 17th in chapter next day okay thank you um [Music] at 7 30 then we'll read today again Shanti Gita and meet you again
