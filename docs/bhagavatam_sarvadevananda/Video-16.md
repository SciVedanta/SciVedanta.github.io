[Bhagavatam - 1.12.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3KyLggvqf3k)

[Music] our salutations to bhagavan sri krishna the son of vasudeva the destroyer of the demons kangso and chanura the darling of the mother devaki and the guru of the world and the teacher and lord of the universe om peace peace peace be unto us all so we are on this reading of this great book which is called bhagavat relating to the story of the birth and divine play of the lord krishna so here we are on the finishing the chapter 11 on the fab book one where we understood that the war was over between the cousins that righteous war against injustice they got back their kingdom [Applause] and the war finished means it was total destruction of so many lives warriors all became warriors and they fought for each other and then bhagavan krishna was the witness he was observing this and arjuna said you be my chariot. and guide me and our life is a similar thing this is a war through which we go through our body mind emotions our senses all looking outside and the struggle of the righteous and the unrighteous thoughts ideas card desires all lower propensities of tendencies of ours to fight with that and to conquer and conquer them and to establish them in the path of righteousness truthfulness and that state of absolute bliss so krishna is the guide make krishna the lord the guide in your life here is the indication so when the war was over then naturally the krishna who was born to help the humanity he had his other calling that's also a very important point in life we have always a calling we have our responsibilities and duties we should have to perform them observe them but at the same time highest goal is to remain in the life and to detach how to detach that's the greatest lesson in life because we work and we get attached we love and we feel at rest we do any action end result is our we get stuck with that that creates a bondage but how can you work but not get attached how can you love but not get attached unselfish love pure love how can it be developed how can the karma be developed into a state beyond karma that means you do work but you feel the eternal bliss within that you are not acting with selfishness with the motivation of mean unkind things to achieve in life and get hold of things which are temporary so this is a this type of example what in the war of kurukshetra has happened that is a symbolic of that and in that world there comes all types of suffering and pain life everyone has to go through that and krishna is standing there to guide us you live in the life face the challenges overcome them so that is the war was over and shri krishna is always detached after that guiding the whole five brothers pandavas arjuna yudhisthira and others in the path of righteousness and justice and then who are over they become the king and naturally his duty is over he didn't look back unselfish service to the world for the good of the world so our life should be modeled in that way the life is forgiving life is not for taking life is for unselfishness life is not for selfish motivation selfish motivation is motivation in the lower level on selfishness that motivation is the higher level which one binds another religious us from bondage so that is the now the krishna in the real life he is now going back to his own kingdom in the eastern part of india dwarka now that city still belongs there and the excavation shows that there was a great architectural heritage it has been found out the most prosperous country which was went under the ocean so now she krishna is going back and then when he's going back he was arrowed by the great people like the great people like bisma who is the considered one of the most righteous holy person and mother kunti the mother of the five brothers like that and all that they praised him and they are very sad that krishna is living and in the course of discussion then krishna left and this chapter started this chapter is a question from saunaka because we don't know the context so it will be difficult for you so i shall pass quickly read out because this is a big history mahabharata that great book we should read or you should watch on the movie the mahabharata episodes how many episodes maybe more than 150 or 200 i don't know how much be huge and really the entire episode of mohammed you see how is the role of krishna and how he's dispassionately watching the war being in the word guiding and doing that and he himself not participating that participating means the vedanta says participation is drifting from your witness consciousness to the relative world but witness consciousness means witnessing the all the activities and non not getting stuck not getting attached that is called pure vedanta and manifested in the life of krishna now this question started birth of parikshith chapter 12 in skanda 1 it says sauna said protection that how how this story came up you are all unfamiliar so i am too difficult to start back again see this this is this story began this bhagavat started where there is a story that king pariksit a king was there and he was very righteous he was the descendant of this lineage of arjuna and then he was cursed by a sage that story goes on he was a king very wonderful king of india and in his period the india was ruled and all the people were extremely happy rich prosperous loving caring all the noble qualities manifested because of his perfect management of the kingdom and he himself was a ideal king so when he was cursed by one sage as that you will live for seven days only so he took that as a verdict coming from god and thought okay seven days what shall i do now this is india he was a king emperor of india and he gave up everything and give the responsibility of next this whole empire to his son and all these things and he instantly detached hey could you imagine an emperor is just detaching instantly greatness of that is the ideal that what it says that this is the life we will have to do that there is your freedom who knows when call will come see how much kobe death is going on but i think i will live forever no i am seeing that new york what happened how many people died in what condition no but i was thinking i will live forever no but death is knocking at the door and with that notice what should you do you have to find out how to release yourself from eternal bondage how to be established in your eternal peace so he that's why he gave up everything and went in a forest on the bank of the river and naimi sharon is the name of the place and he retired there and wanted i don't want to hear any worldly talk now please talk about god and there he found that one great sage vyasadeva the writer of this bhagavat the vasudev the great scholar who divided the whole vedas into four divisions who have written the brahmasutra the greatest vedanta book the pillar of vedanta no he vasudev related this story to his son sukadeva and that sukadeva he was born brahman and he was born he was born with the knowledge of the supreme truth so he is not attached to anything of the world and he happened to pass by that congregation and then this pariksit he was on the deathbed by his own volition his prediction was that a snake will bite you within seven days and he will die an emperor cannot protect himself from a snake for seven days but he didn't took that path he took it as a learning process here is a hint what is the purpose of life to know thyself so he poured his whole energy into one pointed devotion to god and listening to the holy thoughts and that the beautiful life led by krishna and them so that was the starting shukhadev started speaking and pariksha the king pariksit his last bread he is asking question question and answer guru and disciple and he continued and continued and continued at the end of the seventh day the great says sukadeva he said i am now leaving you have any further question then this king parikshi says no i have finished all my questions all my doubts are gone and now i am free from fear of death that is the fearlessness is vedanta fear of death is the greatest fear in human personality so i have conquered that i have no more fear by your grace i my knowledge i of our knowledge has been opened up now the question came this story of conversation between parikshita the king and the great says sukadeva it's a big his big spiritual truth but it has conversation in those days there's no tip recorder and there is no recording system so we will be lost forever then somebody asked sukadeva the great says will this be lost we are so absorbed in your discussion there are many people or so many sages have gathered at that at that congregation in the forest of naimi sharon on the bank of the river that we are absorbed we nobody noted down anything and this treasure will be lost forever then sukadeva looked in the audience and found that there is one gentleman who have photographic memory they are called the narrators so he found one he that suta his name is suta suta is a narrator they can narrate story exactly as they have heard uh seen so he said he will remember everything what i have said and through that it will be transmitted and people will be able to recall in the early days there is no writing they all all to hearing that's why it's called suti so now that is the way we got this entire bhagavatam it's a conversation of seven days conversation with whatever sukadeva and the pariksit king now here is the question of in the war before what happened how the pariksit was protected because in the war everyone is killed all the children of both sides are gone only one in the lineage of arjuna is dysphoric  but when she was in the womb of the mother your opponent asatmama he send an missile some type of weapon or mantra was there to destroy the child in the mother's womb and seeing that there is no this this entire clan will be totally lost so bhagavan krishna stood to protect that baby in the womb of the mother so now that question has come birth of the king this chapter which is 12th chapter said it was said that the uttara's um was saved by krishna from destruction after the brahma-michael that's called brahma messiah when a invincible missile which nobody can resist so that missile it is but is protected by bhagavan krishna released the weapon was released by assad the great warrior had almost destroyed it we are now desirous of hearing all about the noble and high soul one about the birth deed and death as also about his attainment of the supreme state after demise we also want to know how sukha happened to impart the spiritual knowledge to him we were endowed with faith in the supreme being ranks us to hear all this please tell us about these matters if you think us fit to be hard so this is the question in the congregation and then suta was the narrator said so this question was how the pariksito who was destroyed almost how he survived death and how this parish should become the king emperor of the country and how he ended in this curse from the brahmin boy i want to hear all this so these questions and now the suta sutum is the narrator who remembers all this conversation the photographic memory people in their lineage this is the suta he says it is on we are on the chapter as i said 12th chapter then this book is page 52 and it is verse number 4 where sutra the narrator is describing what he says dharmaraja ruled over the country as father over a family being himself free from all worldly desires because of his practice of devotion to see krishna he said that after the war the king who became the king arjuna's elder brother he became the king so he he ruled the country how that's ideal king as a father or a family as a loving father takes care of the family so this dharmaraj means the judistira ruled over india like a father with so much affection love and taking care of the children every one of the country every citizen of the country so being himself but at the same time he himself ruling not either wrong in hand but with a character that's why the kings in india i mean even if you go to nepal the kings are all honored like that of god in every country earlier days because their honesty their love their affection for the subjects that is the way they used to look at the king because they are unselfish their love and protection anyone in difficulty the king is protecting that interest so that was the idea so it says being himself free from all worldly desires how he was free from all desires because of his practice of devotion to krishna unless you're a spiritual person your character will not change everyone will follow their own selfish determination expectation their gain their achievement all centered around me and mine will develop only those who love god pray to god their ego becomes free so dharmaraja means yudhisthira ruled the country like a father as a loving father does that for your family being himself free from all worldly desires he himself is no more craving for his but he's a duty duty to respond and to maintain the need and necessity of the subjects little now unlimited unlimited wealth the performance of jugna's performances means what in the early days in you cannot live your luxurious life you will have to do offering to god every day you spend hours together for performing home of fire how far you know homophobia you know is a fire ceremony in which you have to put the fire root and design the image of the ideal in diagram make the diagram put the and offer mantra and then with the mantra ablation into the fire and then we offer it to god so it's a ritual it is a long ritual they used to do every day those rituals that's why you say unlimited wealth he get got performed the juggernauts and yoga means this sacrificial fire in early days people can have the faith and believe and they used to get it by austerity by offering oblation to god in the fire you can gain whatever material thing you want to gain you can go to heaven you can be king you can attain anything as by other means in this man means to performing these fires sacrificial fires the higher realms resulting from them brothers kingship over the whole india fame extending up to heaven he has such a beautiful king which is judishira after the war he ruled the country his fame went on all direction and all these blessings failed to give him any joy to whose mind long only for krishna just as a man suffering from a gowning hunger fails to get satisfaction from anything except food so he was a king but was seeking for god loving god his heart was painting for god vision and experience then he continued verse number seven pariksit in his mother's womb scorched by the flames of astamas brahma that missile which was destroying the baby in the in the womb of the mother noticed a divine person that is the that baby in the moon he saw there is a divine personality protecting him and that is krishna bhagavan krishna a divine person close by and of the size of the thumb immaculate deck with a shining diadem of gold on the head these are the description of lord krishna lord narayana you haven't seen the trinity of indian gods what brahma vishnu and shiva vishnu has a circular weapon it's called chakra gada mace and what lotus and other things so that divine image appeared before the baby baby is seeing that there is somebody standing before him and protecting him extremely handsome blue like a rain cloud wearing a yellow cloth of lightning like a glitter yellow cloth lightning like a glitter having four auspicious arms wearing earrings of shining gold having rosy eyes and holding in hand a flaming mess by whittling which he scattered the power of brahma michael as the sun does the mist covering him these are all very poetic description as the sun destroys the mist that means similarly the weapon which is trying to destroy the baby this missile this round disc of weapon is destroying that power of the missile such a person he saw beside him and he wondered who he might be the baby does not know who is that but bhuvi feels that he is scorching because of the attack of that missile but there is someone holding and protecting the life so live in our life also we go to different situations we know or do not know those who know do have the heart they can understand there is a divine power always protecting us unconsciously or consciously you are conscious then you can feel that if you are conscious then you can know that you can find that but when you are not you cannot understand how god protects us every second even from the birth that that this parishion then is fortunate that his before being born the lord in the physical form appeared there in a subtle way of course not physical like as we say in a subtle way as you see in your dream what happens you see in your dream they're real or not they're real for the time when you see them so in a subtle level this boy baby found that there is some protecting force acting against the missiles and and protecting him the all-pervading lord who in his inscrutable ways protects the good and the righteous destroy the power of brahma missile and even as the future pariksit now a ten month old fetus was looking on disappeared from his vision so when this missile was to destroy the baby parikshit in the mother's womb saw that that divine power is with the holding a disc and destroying all the powers of the missile counteracting the missile powers when that was over then this baby felt that divine appearance disappeared then at an auspicious moment when all the planets stood in the favorable positions she was born he is the sustainer of the this line lineage of pandu whose natural majesty made one thing that the great pandu himself was reborn him so when when this boy was born pariksit his majesty his dignity and his power manifested like their grandfather who ruled the country for long time because of their honesty sincerity love protection all the nobility he born with those qualities the overjoyed king judistiro then had the postnatal ceremony of the child performed by brahmanas who chanted the purifactory mantras so so many brahmins that was his style when a baby is born king calls the brahmins who can see and foretell the what is this baby like what will be this baby like no like buddhas was born the brahmins were called and the brahmins made a horoscope and saying what he said he's seeing the baby and reading his planetary situation and all this he said this boy either will be big powerful king or he'll be totally renunciate will uh diverse the mystery of this world so buddha became buddha that's why his father was always keeping him in fun and joy from childhood not to allow him to see anything of the suffering of life otherwise he may his mind soft mind may turn towards becoming real monk giving up everything so but could not do that see ultimately one day he saw the force and force for foreseen no four days he saw one day saw what old man tottenham old days it will happen to me also we are seeing every day we never question it we think i will be living forever he's an old guy okay and then another this is a sick man i see oh my god sickness what is that because he is in the palace and no exposure to outside any a and very pure atmosphere and roses and blooming lotus and flowers and dancing and singing and eating and this huh seek what is sickness it is a new thing for him he learned how to oh i'll be sick oh old age will hit me sick physical sickness will hit me is it so and then he says death what is this will he die who will die i will die well yeah he will also die my son he will die my wife yes yes oh my god see in one piece of experience turning his whole life that's the prediction of the brahmins so and then last one you know you saw a monk who has nothing in position but face is beaming with joy and cheerful he said who is he well he is in search a this mystery he is a monk to know the truth he renounced everything he does not care for anything of the material world only the truth of spiritual world no and that made him gun that make him buddha buddha means awaken buddha means awakened so that awakening came so so this is this is actually exactly it happened as predicted by the what you call the brahmins they are expert people they know particular moment when you are born what is the position of different planets and stars and planets so so that science is still now there sometimes it's called what is called astrology youth is in saskate and in english we call astrology astronomy astrology so astrology is it all false in most of the cases it is false because calculation is wrong right because exact time exact things are necessary no to the accuracy and if it is calculation becomes perfect they can put till what is going to happen no so anyway so here also as the pariksit was born so they called the greatest pandits and brahmins to see what is the fate of this and they saw looking at this that auspicious moment the planet stood in favorable position there was born parikshith who sustained the pandu's lineage overjoyed king now yudhisthira then had the postnatal ceremony and then the brahmins are invited and they chanted purifactory mantras vedic mantras and things and then the distillery knew who knew the value of the gifts of important occasion in life now gave away at this most auspicious occurrence of the birth of the grandson grandson you know in every family when grandson is born grandma grandpa they become very happy so here is judistiro is the grandpa and he is the king so he became so overjoyed so call the ibrahim means and there is a rule when you call the brahmins give the gifts best gifts you can give see here also giving giving giving and so in the family countless gifts to brahmanas what are the containing consisting of gold milk cows in the early days you have 10 mil cows cows with giving milk you are a rich guy 20 you are richer 100 you are must you are one of the richest no so so giving away cow was one of the system of giving donation or giving some support to the brahmins and life was simple those days no people used to have little pure milk vegetarian food whatever and then think of god so it makes their life easy so the the king judistira then started giving away all these gold milk cows lands villages elephants horses and treated them to a splendid fist of course you give some food and some gift still now it is there in indian tradition if there is any ceremony they will call some brahmins and then ask them to pray and other things and then they will give some food sumptuous feast and then some offering highly pleased with the humble and cordial behavior of the king the brahmanas said o leader of the poor of us when this proud of the righteous guru rest was destroyed by the inevitable consequence of the past karmas he was saved by the all-powerful he means here the king pariksit but parikshit was served by saved by the all-powerful lord vishnu why is it lord visnu holding the chakra and bounty he was saved by all powerful visnu as a bounty to you for him therefore he will become par famed in the world as a great devotee and a great king under the name his name will be vishnuratha one saved by lord vishnu he he would be we lost unless god himself protected the baby in the mother's womb now predictions about what the brahmin said the brahmins went through the analysis seeing the stars and position and they said this parishion will be the king but a king of unusual character of beauty of love of grace of compassion of strength valor power purity so that so at this the king said oh great ones will this boy follow in the footsteps of his great and glorious ancestors the famous rajasis of our clan who received the acclaimation of all righteous men what does it mean indian kings were not ordinary kings that's the greatness india is great in all this respect materially it was one time great affluent country and spiritually it was also so rich in between what happened that worldly way i mean in india became poor but spiritually still that they retained that spirituality so what happened these kings were not like any other kings and barons in the west they are kings but these kings are raja and rishi who is rishi rishi means he is a share of truth they are brahma-ganis they are the knowers of truth at the same time for the good of the society in the top of the country they rule the country you know you can imagine who is the top most power if he is a righteous person loving caring compassionate how the country will come rule and a person who is only selfish wants to think hold money engage in their own fun and joy and dance and eating and singing and dancing and loving what type of the country will be the output if it's no character he has no feeling and he's not a spiritual person so he says he's asking to the brahmanas this this boy when he will be in future will he be keeping the tradition of this lineage our lineage is their brahmaganis but their kings at the same time brahma ganesha you read the upanishads when you read the ganesha you see all these great dictums of the vedantic expressions but who are these people they are not sannasis they are not monks major people of them are householders they are married they live in the life but excelled all the limitations of life and known the truth and they and these even the brahmins used to come to these kings to know about brahman to put some spiritual question the how what is god realization how can we realize the truth so these kings and not mere kings with weapons and arms but they were so great and deep in their profound spirituality so he asked the brahmanas please how this boy will be will this boy be keeping the glory of the lineage and will they be worse of truth brahma ghani's and also the ruler ruler at the same time no arab truth will that be or mere a ruler so in response the brahmanas said o son of kunti then he is addressing judistira the elder brother all the five brothers are there in protecting his subjects he'd like the king ikshaku himself you know each word will take one class to explain who is ikshaku anyhow he'll be the greatest king in when the question of protecting the interest of the subjects he will give his life for protecting the interest of the subjects if any anywhere anything is there he is there to protect the interest of the person citizens in reverence for holy men you are king but your king does not mean anything if any holy man come you should prostrate that's the india india the king bows his head before one naked pakir the wandering monk the king of khetri and others they bowed down their head at the feet of their from vivekananda who is a wandering monk have nothing in possession that is the greatness in india dagger renunciation is worshipped and respected then the top the king king will bow down his head so that he will be like that in protecting the subjects he'll be like iksaku in reverence for holy men and in truthfulness he will be equal to rama rama is a king but what type of king he is in reverence he is respectful for the holy people and also truthful in his old character in charity and affording affording protection to refugees who takes refuge in him to protect him and giving charity he will be like an emperor sibi the king of the ushinarsa naras in this story you do not know sibi gave up his own flesh of the body to bite and take pinch by pinch to serve others hungry so you so that this that type of dedication will be in the life of this parikshita he will be match to bharatan the son of dusyanto in the patronage of the performance of the juggernauts and in thus enchanting the glory of the clansmen and he goes on like that he'll be like a great archer he will come to the level as like arjuna and when the fighting comes control of the weapons he will be like his father arjuna most powerful person he will be like brahma creator god impartial to all in giving boons and blessings readily he will be like shiva maheshwara in affording protection to all he'll be like vishnu himself even being the focus of all virtues he will resemble krishna himself so his purity will be so much he will be like lord krishna he will be liberal in gifts like giving up everything whoever gift gift giving he does not retain any that means he is an ideal king with so many grand characters which is very rare to find so all those brahmanas working enlightened about the truth of athman by the sage suka the son of basu he will abandon his body on the bank of the holy ganga and attend to the state beyond all fear because it is all prediction so he will be ruling the country being the ideal ruler lover protector and just a person of self-sacrifice in his highest level and he will rule the country like an enlightened person about the truth of the atman he will know the truth of the atman and by the end he will abandon his body at the bank of the city of holy ganga as i said in my beginning and the forest of naomi shaw under the name of the forest which is running on the bank of ganga in the river their prediction is that he will leave his body there on the bank of ganga all those brahmanas were masters of astrology and horoscope reading advise the king thus and receiving rich presence from the from him from the king judistira he returned to their ibrah means return to their homes he will become famous in the world as pariksit the brahmin said that he this boy he will be named pariksit and very famous in his name in the world because he will be always testing whether the form he saw in the womb was the same as was the manifesting in all men as the indweller that means see that means we'll see the god in everything because in the early childhood when this baby was in the mother's womb he saw that one divine figure appeared and who's with a forearms and this holding the weapons and other things whether that same person is still there till the point of death so and that krishna that lord is residing in the heart of all he will be able to see this that that who protected me and that is the same reality same divine incarnation in the heart of all that means god see he saw the even in the childhood saw the presence of god and that god protecting everyone well fed and cared for and educated in all the 64 colors ah colors arts and sciences he grew fast from day to day like the moon in the bright fortnight to him cola or part is added every day he says that now the baby is born afterwards and this baby grew like every day flourishing manifesting his greatness grandeur learning education and manifesting this wonderful qualities then the raja judicia raja means king the king judisteel was now anxious to do asthma the sacrifice as i said sacrificial fire one sacrifice is a sumida as an exp expiration for the sins according accruing from the slaughter of the friends and relatives in the war you know it is like a sacrificial fire performed for the welfare of those who have departed who have been killed in the war in both sides both sides of the world but he found he had not enough wealth for it as his only income was for the taxes and fines coming to know of this desire of his his brother as directed by sri krishna went on expedition to the north and brought a huge quantity of golden vessels and other valuables abundant by the king named maruta with the wealth so acquired judiciary worship the lord performing trio so medha sacrifice to be free from the fear of sin for causing the death of his own friends relatives and trans men this is also the beauty he is performing some sacrificial fire he called asumeda what for reason for the well-being of those who have lost their life in the war both parties he his side and other side the lord being invited by judistiro attended the festivities of the sacrifice conducted the rights by engaging expert brahmanas rituals and afterwards at the request of his friends spend some months in their midst to please them then permitted by draupadi dharmaputra and others he returned to dwarka accompanied by arjuna and his yadav retinue now here he said that in this great sacrifice where judish tiro the king was performing this for the welfare of the departed who have left their body in the war he invited this arjuna and judiciary invited krishna bhagavan krishna again to come and he came and attended that program and spent some time some months and they were very happy getting back god krishna with them and then after that he took by from them and krishna went back again so there ends the chapter 12. so we can read further 13th chapter unless there is any question after they left yeah because that is the seventh day when the seventh day is approaching so sukadeva is very soft no spiritual people become very soft they cannot bear the suffering of others so he does not want to see the last biting of the snake and this and that there is a beautiful description the the snake will bite but that's why sukadeva asked have you any more question any further question then he said no my all questions are solved and i have conquered death i don't fear death anymore last word frightened for death anymore and thinking of krishna thinking of this divine sport this entire volume we have to deal with 13 volumes no 13 books are there so so all this listening constantly that's the point we can conquer death how not by protecting an army um force around me you can protect you can conquer death by thinking constantly of the unchanging absolute reality whom we call god think of god who never dies who never wants think of that leave the body will go but he will not die because you live in the consciousness of the divine so that is the thing pariksit what he did for seven continuous days could you imagine for getting their own palatial all here the king all these comforts and all this food comfort other he forgot everything he has met for knowing the truth and last day how will you think absolute non-dual is one thing but this is called leela chintan that's a great idea to when the body will be old many people we see in our ramakrishna tradition also they live in this awareness of the divine sport of the of the gods presence no oh our one swami was that primeisha ananda swami he was a par excellent brahmagani he used to leave and the last latter part of because he was very weak and physically needs all the time to help and he's so weak and sick and one of one of his attendants said that you whole day you lie down like that as if you are not responding to anything how do you spend your time that is the point seven days suka they've spent that's ideal for us that seven days constantly he only parish it only heard about krishna the lord krishna his glories his unselfishness his guidance his protection thinking about that yes few people may be there another they can think of atman and stay in that level but majority of the sadhakas in the whole universe they live in the awareness of god and their divine sport krishna some christians will think of the christ all their episodes of christ can think and keep the mind not maybe in hollywood you'll think in he will be living with christ to live with christ live with buddha that is the way your mind remains tuned to that higher level and when you leave the body it goes from material world plane to that spiritual plane and to the absolute plane so this is the great lesson so that when seventh day came then shukre took by and he left and after some time maybe half an hour one hour or something then the snake came and he gave it biting and he said with that bite this soul of parikshit the king parikshit came out of the body the jyoti in the form of light and it marched into the cosmic light like that so those descriptions are there so this is the story of king pariksit do you have any question more okay sorry i didn't tell you that that swami said that what do you do all this time you sleep like that as if you are dozing up he said i live in kamarpukur in jairambati i live in kashifur garden house he's he is lying there in a remote area from calcutta in the district of music and he said that i am i'm not live body is here but i am living with ramakrishna where in the dhakshi nation is sitting in the the couch and he is talking to this person not in vivekananda came then master masai they aim come and he's saluting he's talking this and talking that going to ecstasy singing and dancing constantly he is in that plane so you where his body is our mind does not go there why because we are entangled here our mind is attached to so many things when you meditate what happens your mind does not go to god you try to bring it but it runs away because it has more gravitational pull you have to generate some energy to go above the gravitational pull that's why rocket when you launch the rocket what happens they give a boosting it's a booster so booster sort we have to use booster shots the vedanta study and bhakti study meditation selfless work all these are booster and that it should be such booster that worldly pull up gravitational pull pulling us down into the body aha this is aching this is paining ah what what it will body will suffer but you will not suffer you will be lifted from the earthly ideas so that is the purpose of this book we are reading if one reads very meticulously and ruminates over it don't think that you are to think of krishna we are vedanto it may be ramakrishna it may be buddha it may be christ you can think whatever god manifested in this divine form and you live in that consciousness and god's divine play think of the divine play of god that can help us those who we cannot meditate that's why meditation of three types i mean i may have told many times what are the three types of meditation meditation on the rupa dano you meditate on the form divine form of christ divine form of buddha divine form of rava krishna see satan because in them there is nothing world and worldly though they look like a human being all pure all love all transcendental experience full of compassion and holiness as if concrete sachidananda sanchita and think of that form if you look really in the form of christ or buddha your mind will be pure if you look at the ugly picture your mind will be ugly simple thing formula is very simple it's very scientific if you keep the mind in a very vulgar nasty something your mind will be colored in the nasty it is like the keeping your one glass of water say one liter of water in a jar this way it will take the shape of the jar you take in a bowl it will take the shape of the bowl don't blame your mind where you keep your mind what thought you keep your mind mind will take that shape so think of god then your mind will be that's a name in the form so one is meditation on the form of the divine form his hands like this his eyes are like that focusing on the feet is like that whole feature of the body they thought they are flesh and bone but they are not like us they are made of purity they are made of stainless absolute character of love and compassion and holiness so think of them your mind will be lifted in that so that's called rupadhana second dhana mind is not getting there so lilad as i said think of the stories of the buddha buddha's life or rama's life or krsna's life ramakrishna's life what is your subject regarding that you make roam around in that thought and let the mind run here run there mind wants to run and you are trying to stick no come back to the form mind is not coming so give mind some tool okay go there and see ramakrishna is dancing you want to dance okay dance with him so you are helping the mind to play in the way god played in a realistic life so that's called the leelah dhanu and the third one is the tatwa your mind wants to go anywhere think that let the mind go where let it go to london okay you think there whatever picture coming but thing that is made of saccidananda let it go to new york boston he would want to run anywhere into a friend feel that the friend is nothing but he is made of that sachidananda think of the ocean of consciousness everywhere that is called dhan so these are the three types of dhana meditation people can practice and according to their mood and temperament they can take advantage of either one or two or all of them we in vedanta here try to harmonize everything together anyhow now one cross question is there there are so many narrators like suta sonaka shuka is it because they are quoting others please clarify no the sutras you know suto is a lineage narrators lineage means there are a class of people who could narrate the things in a perfect way exactly maybe many people can remember something but how to exactly remember where without any editing that type of people are a class by themselves in that name there will be no not one suta suppose this incident what we read today it was first happened with the pariksit and then sukhodeb came there and sugar they gave the advice okay i understand now it how do you it retain after thousands of years how it is written so one narrator remember that and then they narrate it to the others in their family or some such special people who could listen and remember and they correct themselves again and again that's why your upanishads are maintained how cooperatives are maintained because of the diacritical mark and chanting in a particular way and you have to do exactly like that so probably that is the way the tradition has been handed what one to the other to the other but they are all called sutas all suta but suta's names are different one is x mr x mr y mr z so that tradition whoever in that category we have that in incredible memory so those people are called suta family so in them these are the different names so different names means different person handed over that experience or that stories to the next generation next generation you go to india you'll find that there are bhagavat readers they'll not look at the book they'll take some bhagavat in mind and go on explaining and and hours are hours and people will be astounded to see their stories how they relate how they narrate that's called the narrator okay thank you so we end here then we'll meet you again thank you for attending we'll meet you again at the 7 30 p.m class is on santi gita that's also related to this and others and his father everyone who was killed that means he is father this this we are talking about whom today have you ever understand yes we searched about that but it is there is a reference in the um bhagavat as also in mahabharata was killed and when he was killed naturally you see if no human is killed his father's situation what will be he is totally devastated everyone is not an ordinary person he was a great warrior and the seven big warriors in those days war was not from a distance it was face-to-face or no so seven big warriors encircled him and attacked him in an unfair way of war so that he was killed and that's why arjuna when he heard that his only precious son he has been killed so he lost all interest for tomorrow's fight and then he actually approached he was taken to krishna and bhagavan krishna then gave the same advice like bhagavad-gita and you can find in this book also in bhagavata also there is reference and mahabharata there is a reference but not exactly what he said it is no in between some story and it has come and it is said in some remote corner not as part of this bhagavata neither the part of mahabharata so it is set up in a separate text how it is maintained i do not know that say no english translation yet so i am trying to do this translation so it will it may come out as a book form sometime so the original sanskrit and the word for what meaning and the running meaning and it is small footnotes here and there so we will try to do that so that people can access that it is only one in bengali there is because bengali pundits were very great improving into the things and there there is one in bengali script original and his translation and his explanation it's a very highly vedantic book but that is not available i we searched in like you google searching and doing here and there google helps us everywhere but could not do masjid om shanti shanti peace you
