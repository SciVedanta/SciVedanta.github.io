[Bhagavatam - Book 1. Chapter 13 - Verse 37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mLyeukMl5Yw)

[Music] um [Music] who is the destroyer of the demons kang the darling of mother jason and the teacher of the universe i salute him again and again om peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to our reading of the bhagavata and the chapter 13 where we read after verse number 36 what we read is this the war is over krishna has gone back and then suddenly vidura he came and appeared before the blind king dasaratha the distraught raster and he told that your all sons are gone and everyone is passed away and you are still here in living in another's mercy you are not the king anymore but even in the palace let us go and go in a pilgrimage so vidur dhitarastro and the mother gandhari all left the palace and went away and now when went away but if our judiciary was not there that time he was engaged in some other thing when he came back to see that little roster is gone so she started questioning sanjaya who was the ardent devotee of dhritarashtra the entire gita we find find that sanjaya is relating the story to home to us no to this raster that blind he cannot see so sanjayo is helping so sanjay was the ardent deputy of greater astro so judy steerer came and said where is my father gone where is the mother gandhari where is that bidura uncle where did they go and sanjay was choked with emotion he could not say something we saw what to say so and after some pause pj 34 hours just to repeat that few lines to connect with today's reading this was related by the narrator then sajin suggested that sanjaya who was intensely faithful and loving towards his master dhritarashtra was thoroughly depressed and gripsticken at his disappearance and remained silent for some time incapable of giving any answer so sanjayo could not quickly respond to the rapid question of yudhisthira who is asking where is my father father like father uncle father gone so he then after some pause he then burst rust aside his tears with his hands and somehow exercised sufficient control over his emotions feelings and then began to speak to dharmaputra means judish teera which is mind always dwelling over his lost master then he said o great leader means o judistira i am in utter ignorance about the intentions of your paternal uncles dieter astro and vidura as also of mother gandhari i do not know i cannot say anything about that they have slipped away without giving me any clue about their whereabouts only i know that they are here they left but where they are going and what they are doing it is totally unknown to me now is today's reading then suddenly we find that the krishna devotee who is called the narada who goes all over the world with a single stringed instrument and glories gifts of singing the glory of lord krishna hurry so he appeared so none of those instruction to judiciary narada appeared there and this is a very intense chapter where he is giving always this this is the beauty of bhagavata mahabharata etc high philosophy is given always a place in understanding this life so naruto instructed judistiro this 37 verse it starts and it ends till the chapter ends this is all the instruction of narada to judistero yudhisthira was lamenting what happened to my uncle my paternal uncle and where did they go where is my mother come their ego and without telling so i was repenting then naruto said just 10 37 verse just then 37 on page 59 just then the sage narada arrived there with a loot in hand flute and a flute judistira and his brothers got up from their seats made prostrations to this age and without much of ceremonial worship on account of the tragic situation began to talk with him as follows so normally when a holy man comes there are some rituals they do some it takes some time but he being totally absorbed grip stricken so when naruto came judistura and his brothers got up out of respect the kings used to do that when holy man used to come they gave up their throne and then prostrate before the holy man so naturally worship and all the five brothers stood up leader is judistira and began to talk with him so do these tears started asking what he said who says of great insight o naruto you are the sage of great inspiration and and without much of i am not able to understand where both my parental uncles have gone as also where is mother gandhari our austere and gripstic and mother has disappeared so where is and his brother bidura bijra was a lover of god so in this limitless ocean of sanchara you are the one captain who can take us to the other show naruto you are so pure you are the only person you are a holy says you can take us on the other shore of this world and worldliness so you are the captain so so please show us the way what is that thus addressed the all-knowing narada the greatest among holy men said as follows they saw that it is repeatable condition judistira is in tears all the brothers are really feeling the separation of blind king judishira in dritarastra and his brother bidura what is her name gandhari the mother of duryodhana so this then then they are grip sticking seeing that grief then they said thus addressed like all to me you are naruto you know everything so you are the greatest among the holy people so tell us what what is going on then the naruto said as follows what he said o king talking dude is tira you are the new king now after the war so do not grieve over anyone that is the eternal message coming out who is your uncle who is your father you are talking to your parent your mother who is what don't grip for anyone this world is under the control of the lord and all that happens is according to his will it's god's will so why are you too grieved things are happening by god's will so why are you suffering why are you grieving he the supreme lord to whom all this world and his protecting powers of our worship always is he who brings people together and separates from them by his will we are all gathered together today here we may plan this is the class i am coming here or meeting new people it is god's will who will come who will come not come we will come we will disperse it is everything is happening by the will of god sriram krishna says nothing happens without the will of god no not even a leap moves that is ramakrishna says so he is giving that advice you are thinking your uncle left you or why did they go why you are weeping sobbing for them don't think like that all is done by the will of god so he who brings people together and separates them at his will 41 mars just as the herd of a cattle cattle the cows and the small nose strings tried to be grown are directed to go along well marked paths so are all men individual concerns tied to the big rope what is the rope rope of duty my duty is my duty to do this your duty to do that that is the nose glitching the the cows and also horses of course we see horses powerful horses are controlled by the nose strings no so god is doing that giving every individual i think i am doing but no string is there he's pulling sometimes this direction and that direction what shall i say you are the guide in our guide you guide us the way you are guiding we are bound to go like that what can we do so and they are thus made to walk the path ordained for them in our life we are ordering to move this way at certain point move this way certainly we are thinking i am doing it my karma my bad that's okay if you bring another philosophy but here is the philosophy is not your karma but it is god's will everything is happening by god's will this part is important in this in this analysis we can use another analysis my karma has bought it but karma is not the point is god's will so you are nothing to do just relax let god will work why are you bothering yourself about why this happened why that happen live the life do your things and be happy at some point of time he practiced that only the discipline that i am the instrument you are the operator ami jantro domi jontri i harimanas said in one phrase in a part of my life one long time i practice this one mood i try to keep that mood i am nothing i am the instrument you every moment to remain remember remember that's the attitude that's why swamiji said also that everyone in spiritual life wants to have some inner mood or inner ideas to carry on so big group of duty by the lord and they are thus made to walk the path ordained for them each one's life has been ordained you have to go this way that way that will happen that's why you call predestination god decided what to happen you are only playing play in your role and smile and happy but don't get upset all the time don't make your life miserable your path is given by god accept that whatever comes so you see that's a great freedom people really can feel free ami jontro if one can feel what is happening that's of course very high state where there is be no ego egoless person can only think that i am nothing god is doing but we may make a when a crooked idea inside i do everything and say oh it is god doing and then we suffer that time we suffer we are saying we will not do we should have to feel that just as the combination and this parcel of the play things are exclusively directed by the player's will so are affairs of men by the lords whether you consider the living self as eternal as the spirit or as the temporal as the body or as both in view of his being combination of spirit and body or as neither from their absolute point of view whatever be your attitude sorrow for beings arise from love and attachment which are caused by ignorance about the real nature of the soul what a big philosophy he has brought it here naruto giving this advice naruto is a bhakti now but bhakti see how ghana is here so he says whether you consider living self this living self jiva is eternal as the spirit i am not the body i am the spirit you can think this way or as temporal as body body is a temporary thing or as both you be view that it is spirit mixed with atman mixed with consciousness mixed with the physical body mind complex whatever way you think or neither from the absolute point of view now there is nothing in the absolute point i have no body so all the philosophies regarding this body and this action one is the absolute idea i have nobody i am neither the mind neither body so i have no connection no spirit is there and body is made of elements no it's separate again no it's these two has combined each other and this jiva is moving like that whatever philosophy you take whatever be your attitude sorrow for beings arise know that sorrows and suffering comes from what arise from love and attachment don't love anyone then you are in trouble that is that is a freedom that goes freedom but ramakrishna without ramakrishna or without god don't love anything you are in danger whatever you love it turns into attachment but because the consciousness is forgotten we forget the love all source of love is god but we we forget all the time therefore love don't love anyone is telling some in some place that whenever we love something we get attached because we don't see god therefore the human personality comes and human emotions come and that creates this all these struggles and struggles which are caused by and and where from this attachment and love love love lower love and love brings attachment where it what comes from uma what to do that that one same thing that will do now it will come again so which are caused by this love don't love anyone if you love then there is attachment and attachment comes up out of fire attachment which are caused by ignorance why attachment comes ignorance i don't love god i don't love the truth and reality so attachment comes and it is caused by ignorance about the real nature of the soul as we do not know our real nature and that is the ignorance and that causes this problem therefore odr1 give up your infatuation born of ignorance you are crying weeping why my relative my uncle my but who are you god is your own these are not your own that's why swami vivekananda the first day sangnotha shangsha be they say in the world a foreign country of this world why are you roaming around like a foreigner moon oh my mind go back to your own abode eternal abode of bliss so this is the therefore it is naruto says same idea oh dear one give up your infatuation which is born of ignorance which makes you feel worried we are thinking what will happen you are thinking how will these helpless people get on without me i am the king now so i should look after them in my kingdom there should be protected and they'll went away what will happen if they die hey are they in suffering all these things you are thinking the only which is no string of duty created by god and your love and love is not real love it is attachment and out of attachment you are worried and you are taking the responsibility that you are thinking how these helpless people get on without me i am the king now to think that one to think that one can save or protect another while one's own body is subject to the power of time karma and gunas is decaying is like a person in the grip of a python thinking of saving another a python has caught somebody and he is thinking i will save the other person you get out of the python before you are killed it will be swallowed python does not eat its swallow etc our whole spirituality is just caught and swallowed inside there so to think that one can save that one we sometimes think i can save someone i can protect someone no but this what are you ignorance to think that one can save or protect another while one's own body is subject to the power of time we are clicking no we are all becoming old every day my own body and mind and my existence is under the time clicking of time and also under the karma and or controlled by the three gunas this this my life present life is going on because of the three gunas action or it is going in a big time span it is just appearance and growth and then full manifestation decay and then death it is happening in time everyone the mightiest person to the poorest person all are caught into this trap where is hitler where is good person why is bad person where the time consumes everything therefore you have this power of time which being under the under the power of time and under the karma effect and the goona's effect that is decaying like a person she thinks that i am in this condition i have not made any way to just get out of it i am trying to help you so this is a like a python in that we are in the mouth of the python and being in the mouth of the python trying to help other person who is suffering that's why it is said that first you be a god and then worship god you be a knower of truth then you show light to the others says most of us are like that being blind ourselves trying to show path enlightenment to others 46 verse creatures without arms or animals or the food that they suppose the creatures or the animals without arms who have no hand and feet no are the food of creatures with arms like men men kill them eat them so those who are without arm human being kill them and use them as their food now the pitless being or vegetation are the food of the four footed creatures the vegetation they have no food they cannot move those who move they eat them four-footed creatures or animals even among the trees the smallest creatures are the food of the bigger ones huh smallest tiny uh insects are being eaten by bigger animals the birds even birds are even eating this that and then thus one kind of living being is the food for another in this wise nature nature keep big capital nature in this wise nature in this wa in this wise nature has made ample arrangements for food for all and you need not be anxious about your relatives you are thinking i am the king i give food why what food they will get who will supply them the necessities of life no look at the whole nature the wise nature the language is nature is capital and why is nature this nature is very intelligent nature that means it is not done by an idiot and god's plan in this big nature you see the what is going on the cosmic plan is a designer cosmic designer there is a great designer so in island ample arrangements for food for all and you need not be anxious about your relatives mostly it happens for us also when we become monks we most of the time we are in this dilemma who will look after my mom my dad as if god has created to you to save everybody your mom dad one swami told me god created your mom dad first or treated you first so you think that you have to take the responsibility of everyone but god has a master plan and and god does not depend on your health rather when your help is gone you see it flourishes better better management happen when your ego goes away that is very true even in small lives of many of our monastics we have found that they were really a dilemma to become a monk how they will be giving up all responsibilities who will look after mom dad and when but they're not that dead but they somebody takes care foster mother faster father or not even but someone so little kindness they get married they have their friends something argument with the cosmic plan i am not saying that is ideal but point is that of course who can do that who have no sense of duty who himself has no me and mine but it is a practice also how the state will come unless one starts practicing yes god is there why do you look after me because earlier days now we are comfortable place we can join in ramakrishna order or some organization who takes care of us previously what i am becoming a monk so get out of your room what is your position nothing just with this dress whatever you are wearing get out how they get dressed whole life wandering monks of india who is supplying i am giving giving some dress comfortable blankets or something like that every day do i give anyone a food but if the whole world is going on in a cosmic design so it's really easy to think about that is not our responsibility to do rather our responsibility think of god major thing our responsibility is to think of god and as it so long we have duty we'll have to do that but we have to understand we are not the doer god is the doer and god's will will ultimately reign not your will or my will when we don't understand that then we find all these conflicts and confusions all this universe is the lord's alone 47 he's the soul of all souls the self-revealing spirit needing no other revealer sayam prakasa he is self-illumined he does not need anybody he is what he is what science is the within and without he is what shines is the within and without that means his triumph procrastina self-effulgent self-revealing all the universe it is only lords nothing belong to you nothing belong to me not to the king not to the um jamindar landlord or baron we think they are the king there it belongs to them it belongs to god and god only he is the soul god is the soul of all souls the self-revealing spirit is god needed no other revealer it does not need another flashlight to reveal him like sun's light reveals everything sun does not need any light to show i am here look at me some plus lighting no this is called sun so that's why god is self-revealing his sachidan on the self-luminous he does not need any other support this is the idea idea is that god is the support of all but god does not need anyone's support the ripples and waves are supported by the ocean ocean does not need any support for the from the ripples or waves so creation is dependent on god god does not depend on any created booster understand he is what science has do within and without see how he has become the many by his mysterious power maya look at that this all diversity is all created by his all-pervading maya a mysterious power and that power is called the maya shakti shukti that bhagavan the origin of all is now amidst us as the divine incarnation functioning as all destroying spirit of time eliminating all evildoers now the lord of the universe is krishna the lord as abu taara is residing with us and he has taken the role this time gita says calls me i am the time eternal and and i wanted to destroy the world meaning destroy the evils of the world so naruto says that we are fortunate that in this period when you are here the god the creator of the universe has come down in the form of avatar krishna he is not mentioning krishna but he is indicating and krsna's rule is time he's only see seeing things he didn't stop he tried to stop the war but he being god can he not change the minds of no his plan is to destroy destroy all the evils that's why this war and that's why he says bhagavan the origin of all from which everything have created we are created is now amidst as the divine incarnation functioning as the all destroying spirit of time eliminating all evil doers he has completed this work mostly and is awaiting the completion of the rest he has finished his major work of destroying the evil kings and evil personalities and in the war they have been destroyed but now he is waiting to destroy further lord's completion president to complete awaiting the lord's completion of his mission no the traitor astro with his wife gandhari and brother vidura has gone to a resort narada knows what is happening so he says you are talking about your parents called the uncle where they go they have gone to a resort the great ascetics in the southern region of the himalayas and they go in the southern region of the himalayas they have gone there to live there and what they what they will do they are now in the holy place called sapta so shrutas a place optimist seven shrota means the stream where the mother ganga breaks into seven streams that's a holy place that means from the high himalayas when the ganga is dropping down and in certain area maybe there is a place holy place where that splits into seven direction so that's called sapto srota the spot where ganga divides herself into seven streams to please wise split to please seven races shaptorsi all the seven species are in the heaven naren was one of the races so he says to please them that mother ganga has split in seven directions in a particular spot that is called softer sea that is the southern part of the himalayan range and they have moved there and they have they are staying there for their last moment taking bath in the holy river but foreign is sacrificial rights subsisting only on water money drinking water only abandoning all attachment from wealth family enjoyment here and hereafter theater is now abiding in peace now he is very peaceful why he has given us this kingdom he was holding on this kingdom and that kingdom holding on gave this disaster he supported his son jodhana and others blindfoldedly and as a result this disaster happened now he has detached from this and left the palace his me all the family members enjoyment wealth palacial uh what is called the comforts all giving up tito astro he's now happy because giving up everything he is happy that is the philosophy of life soft short case of power if one can leave everything then you will get everything giving up everything one attains everything it's a big philosophy people think holding something it is a i will get more my money is this one hundred thousand i'll make it two hundred thousand by holding three hundred more and more people even in anywhere in life we go this idea i'll be happy more more and more but spirituality is less less less and when anyone becomes monk or none nothing i have no bank account but in this country we have but india we don't have because so because some checks sometimes people give something and you have to issue a check also but but you legally know you mentally spiritually no it is not mine it is for the good of others so it detached it has detached one side was attached attached attached and now soon the detached data is detached so brutal astro is now is peaceful because he knew this philosophy now knowing he knew that but now he's practicing that and he's leaving his last days drinking holy ganga water that is the way people die want to die they go to the holy ganga give up all food and naturally body gets weaker weaker weaker weaker only drinking water and thinking of god think and nobody in my life there is no friend no relative no my good person bad person in my life i am alone and god is alone no that type of spirit they get involved into it having established 53 hours having established himself in a subtle seat and controlling the pranas and the sixth senses he has reasoned about the gunas of prakiti by the practice of devotion to huri by loving god this person that means the jitter raster the blind king he has established himself where in a settled seat a seat steady seat and that and what he did prana controlling the prana means pranic pranayama and practicing this or that eightfold yoga path [Music] that path so he's talking about asana settled asana he has taken a seat not to move like buddha i am sitting in this posture i'm not going to get out until i realize the truth [Music] let my body be dried out i'm not going to give pig food or anything means the place they split they fall apart [Music] this awakening which is attained through many many this body may fall but i am not going to move from this seat that's called the steady seat and we cannot sit for one hour and then we go like this like this you know but if they sit with that determination through sitting there that because it is that because you know if sasket was the language of that time but the elites and pali when he wanted to preach but colloquial language people speak by bali and sanskrit if you really study very closely you will find that there are much closeness to sanskrit if you know sanskrit atta atma pronunciation different nibbana nirvana nibbana nirvana it's a colloquial people in colloquial language english they speak so that he spoke just to preach the message so that people can take it they if you speak in sanskrit it will not reach them you have to come to the language of the people so for that buddha came down so having established himself in a settled seat that's why it is asana then controlling the pranas pranayama and controlling the breath and six senses all the senses are shut down no i don't see this i won't hear this i have no design what are the six senses five senses eyes ear nose throat tongue at the touch five and mind so controlling mind and all these senses six senses he has reason number of the gunas of prakriti by the practice of devotion to hurry how he has risen by practice of love for god that is ramakrishna's message you can just parallely make makes rama krishna's quote ramakrishna said by devotion you can have all this kumak your pranayama result of pranayama you need not have to do this pranayama like this but kumbhak automatically that kumbhak state will come and breath will arrest and you will be thinking of the divine only absorbed in that it will happen 54 and 55 identifying oneself with the intellectual self with the intellectual self resolving the same in the shaytan the witnessing psyche and resolving that to in brahman the basis of everything like spot pot sky in the universal sky he is now sitting motionless like a pillar with all the natural tendencies of the mind overcome with all the senses under control and with no need for any food my god this is a very great philosophy here qatar punisher says this verse 54 to 55 verse what it says identifying oneself with the intellectual self i am not the body not the mind i am the intellect he has risen that body mind has thrown away in that previous verse did you get it previous verse previous verse what he said having established himself in settle seat yamanyama then asana seat is stable then he said pranayama and there he said control him six senses six senses means all these sense organs plus mind is the boss of the all the senses now he has come with drawing the mind to intellect panchakusha think of the five kosha idea panchakusha bichara so withdrawing from the outside is coming to mind is now control mind control mind will control who will control my intellect intellect is now is it resolving identifying oneself with the intellect i am the intellect now now intellect resolving the intellect in the god i i my intellect i am the master of the intellect no that is the shattered he who knows the chatra this is the chatra body mind emotions and intellect these are all part of shuttle and i know i am the god with witnessing psyche that's witnessing he has translated witnessing psyche mind one part of the mind is witnessing mind that's why mano buddhi are the same mind mind functioning in four stages one is the mind vacillating another is the mind determinative one is the mind remembering another is the mind ego i so i this the finest level of mind is the eye so now with drawing the all these things within the first to the intellect intellect to the ego which is here they are mentioning that's his calling witnessing psyche and resolving that to that i should be dissolving from him and katherine says so the basis of everything which brahman is the basis of everything what is bei it is like it's like a pot sky in the universal sky for sky money you understand here is a pot the sky within this spot and the cosmic spot space what is the difference nothing only pot makes a say house the space within this house an infinite space is there any difference no we say we say it is spot because we have mentally divided that this is called this 30 feet by 60 feet by this that this is the space of the house but there is space you have not divided space is so fine it is continuous one thing so port gata the very important philosophy of your vedanta the cosmic space and gotha casual this small space in the ghatak in the pot break that pot what happens space space so there is no different division so you move back to the space is now witnessing motionless now now the terrastra is sitting controlling this way withdrawing the mind withdrawing the mind to the intellect intellect to the ego that shatra goshetra go to brahman and he's sitting motionless and natural emotion less like a pillar like a stump of a stone with all the natural tendencies of the mind overcome no tendency is fun distracting him with all the senses under control and with no need for any food 56 do not go there and cause any disturbance to him don't go there he is meditating he is absorbed in god and don't go to show your love ahaha you are suffering come to the palace i will give you food he does not need all these things so do not go there and cause any disturbance to him who is who has abandoned all duties and actions within five days from now he will be abandoning his physical body which will be burnt automatically in the fire of yoga power in the high himalayas where he will get firewood but they have done such yoga yoga power will destroy the body his wife gandhari seeing the yogic fire consuming her husband's body along with the leaf heart and there is a there is to live in a heart and that heart made of leaf naturally there are trees and ah there is where is the palace there so that house is burned so seeing that follow she will also follow him by entering into the fire so gandhari will also give up her body entering into the fire of austerity and as for vidura now his brother vidura seeing all this and overcome both by sorrow and joy he's happy and unhappy happy in one sense he's getting brahma ghana and released and made sorrow because brother after all and as for vidura seeing all these and overcome both by sorrow and joy sorrow for death for his brother and joy for his attaining to the spiritual goal he would go out into the broad world as a pilgrimage bus he saw this that her elder brother and brother's wife both consumed themselves in the highest spirit of oneness with god so he then started to becoming went on into the society come to as a pilgrimage saying this much naruto left with his tanbura in hand and judish chiro taking his words well to heart recovered from his sorrow so now that's the end of the chapter 13th chapter where the end came that naruto said that the you are asking about yudhisthira you asked about your grand what you call the [Music] grand grandma uncle and your gandhari you asked about hitarastro so they are living is life of seclusion detachment total absorption withdraw their mind from the external world and to the senses senses to the mind and mind to the intellect intellect to the chatrago and then shatraga that is the i i to the brahmana and they are now absorbed and in the spirit they left their body so you need not have to go back and ask them to come back and help you with your love huh okay so there is the end of the chapter number 13. we will start the chapter 14 next day uh next next time next occasion om shanti [Music] [Music] there are some questions we'll try to have some time and then leave what is an avatar avatar means when god incarnates we call avatara we are human incarnation god is also human incarnation but god not only him and in early forget about the earlier stories recently we know rama krishna christ buddhas they are called because they are the highest expression of purity love joy grace what we find white want to find in god so that's why they are called avatar and their purity their love their compassion their redeeming power exceed excels everything so as god can redeem people so avatars can also redeem us second question a baby is born with life threatening illness the parents ask their shanghai to pray that god saves the baby does god change the baby's fate because people pray i do not know it's a very serious question you have asked the question what god wants to do god is free will person no he is not limited by by our speculations but i think that god can do everything he can change if he feels lazarus come out why lazarus will come out lazarus is dead but christ failed the compassion and then asked him to come out so god if he wants the baby will be clean tomorrow we hear many stories in the ramakrishna's disciples life and and disciples devotees life they are suffering severe um problem of the health and they have a dream divine dream in the night and god came our mother came and tossed the forehead and next morning the person is totally free so we we hear so many stories you read the lives of the we call miracles but it is not miracle it is the will of god god can do everything and anything and everything so yes parent can ask surely parents will ask for the child and got to save the body baby but what god will do it is we cannot i cannot say anything but this much i can say praying to god leaves us i am praying i am getting the benefit if i pray that moment my mind goes high up to god and also i am praying for whom he his heart is tuned to me and we are praying not for our selfish end therefore it is a better thing not to ask for one's own need but for the need of this another one who is not me so it is god's play so to pray to god i think has at least this spiritual benefit if the baby does not survive it may be karma is ending as we read just now time is a big healer god has time is waiting and everything in time is getting destroyed born and grown okay another another question kumbhaka and samadhi the same no no no means when breath stops actually if your mind is really very much deep in soma deep in contemplation and goes deeper and deeper and deeper as we find in ramakrishna that doctors could not find the pulse because it is a dead body almost so if the body is dead that means no breath means holding breath is whole tight like that but ramakrishna again comes back from that state you see again slowly breath starts that means that kumbhak state is coming out so kumbhak state may samadhi in samadhi people go to the kumbhak state but every kumbhak state is not samadhi those who are practicing pranayama they can go in to live in the kumbhak state does not mean that they are no words of truth in an himalayas i i saw one time i was in some place and i saw one yogi he is practicing kumbhaka that means he can live without breath breathing for several hours so he put his somebody dug him into the ground he said grab me dig me into the ground and then they gave some cushion and then put all the mud together it is all almost covered under the like a tomb and then said that okay after after half an hour one hour just release bring out and after one hour or something they brought out he's still alive and still but he was when he sat everyone observed there is no breath kumbhaka started so by yogic practice they can do but kummaka probably is that where no breathing this flow of breath stops because of mind getting totally absorbed in god and total lack of body consciousness that is samadhi state but every samadhi probably there is kumbhak but every kumah may not be samadhi yeah no no i know god is one but i am attracted to his krishna form do i repeat shiva mantra should i change my mantra i want to have vision of krishna is that possible with shiva mantra you know if i say i i say christ so christ form will come into my mind mantra means the expression of the divine spirit the attitude so it is better to have a shiva mantra to have shiva but chanting shiva mantra you can see krishna oh i think i cannot say that that will be much quick better to you have krishnamantu then you can cap krishna but shiva is not different from krishna that you have to understand but god is only one god only take different forms so if you can think that you are repeating your mantra but you are thinking of krishna your shiva is nothing but krishna that you'll do but if you don't want then you have to think of krishna mantra and krishna form but if you can think this way that i am taking this mantra my guru has given and that shiva is no other than krishna so same mantra if you can meditate on that way that may help you but it is much easier to repeat the name whom you are meditating if i say rama rama rama my naturally rama figure will come in before my mind and if i want to think rama is the shiva yes that is true that can also be done but if you can do that then yes same mantra will do it depends on your own intense love and understanding okay thank you so we have we finish here now and we'll have our class at 7 30 on shanti gita so we'll try to meet you again om shanti shanti shantihi peace peace peace you
