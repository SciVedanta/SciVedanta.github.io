[Bhagavatam - 3.3.1 - ( Book 3, Chapter 3, verse 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSbxcxoW2pY)

we salute bhagavan sri krishna the son of vasudeva the destroyer of the demons kangsho and chanura the dear darling of mother devaki and the guru of the entire universe [Laughter] [Music] i salute him again and again on peace peace peace so we are back to reading of the bhagavatam and we are in the third chapter of the book 3 we start that reading of the chapter 3 and you can go in the back so that i can see your face and then put it put your mask if you have the mask put the mask as much as this part prevention protection so we are reading uddhava was an ardent deputy of bhagavan yes then uddhava was describing about the holy life of bhagavan krishna and there we ended last time that he is always protecting the cowherd boys of brindavan and also protecting the father nanda and his friend to protect our people of brindavan and mathura so that that a indra and grazed began to pouring incessant rain then bhagavan krishna raised in a finger tip the mountain and protected the whole settlement of govardhana mountain in rome indra was enraged that he is not being worshipped and so they used to offer oblation to indra in say gods and not also that's why it is better to be human than to be gods also gods of their fine and jealousy they also are eager to be worshipped as it happens many prestigious people want more praise from people then so not that okay you are doing like that should they become revengeful so that's why indra was the lord of rain he poured rain heavily so that this cowherd boys and the entire government behind the ray he raised the entire mountain in tip of the finger and protected the whole community and then going out and going out of the mountain the outskirt it could not affect the entire community because they took law protection in sri krishna and also he read the last time second chapter 34 bus last bus that in the moonlit night of the autumn session he filled the place with the sweet strain of his fruit as he sported in the midst of the women enchanting their joys and praiseworthiness so he played a fruit and then attracted all the devotees who ran from their home so that that much only one line we heard the description now uddhava narration is continues in this new chapter third chapter third book third chapter so verse number one uddhava said afterwards for the liberation of his father then he along with balarama he and his brother went to the city of mathura and then killing his enemy kancha by throwing him down from a lofty throne it dragged his body over the ground so that's why the kangsha was destroyed when he went back and by that way he liberated his parents who are under in the jail we call in mathura that is the same place now there is a temple of krishna very bad place where he was born and his kong show kept them under the prison so that there any child born he can access and kill them he mastered the vedas with auxiliaries by once hearing it from rishi sandipani and krishna the baby krishna in his earlier childhood he did not have to go for 17 20 years for study no like vivekanandu here in the current period that his teachers will read and he will listen that's all he has not to read the book be awakened on this life story if we read then we find that vivekananda is lying down and the teacher comes and he reads the book and when he reads best that's done he and the baby they may not even have the understanding of everything or memorizing that so that was the glory of naren in the recent historical age krishna was also like that that he does not need to master the vedas and what are the auxiliaries phonetics and grammar etymology all these sciences just by hearing from the sage whom was his teacher and his name was sandipani sandipani so he did not have to learn like that we're going for 20 years of our life for getting a ph.d and how much study day and night but they don't need only hard it and best that's all and and as farewell gift abduction for him he restored his sons to him by tearing off the stomach of and then he then the son of this his teacher sundeepani rishi he was revived from the demon humanist panchagna who had devoured him his son was devoted historia guy i did not know now remember now so this this is our mind and that is the mind of the yeah great mind of this krishna's mind so he he gave the education his his teacher was sandipani rishi and in return he removed the grief because his son was swallowed by some demon and he killed that demon so a guru dakshina people give guru dakshana some money some other things for guru here he gave back his son many were the kings assembled attracted by the beauty of rook meaning the very embodiment of sri means mother lakshmi all anxious to win her as wife but krishna as if he was the only eligible person invited took her away as his rightful position administering a kick on the head of all those shooters and married her by gun herb rights what is ganderbarites that means by forcefully there is a rule that kings they can if they select someone to be the queen that they can go by their might defeat the others and rescue the lady and make her as a wife so that is the tradition of the powerful kings they can do so he did that krishna as if we are the only eligible person and the rook mini who is the attraction of beauty of all all the kings they attend there she's mother looks me like sri and all anxious to win her as wife but krishna kicked out all other suitors who were shooting and married harass gander that means these are the stories in the relative in the life of bhagavan krishna that will come later that the radha was in i do not know this scripture suggests radha was a that in earlier age when he was in that brindavan he was a boy of six seven eight years some however when he was playing the flu she uh all the women were married and had children and husbands where do we so like that darling light beautiful child baby child all the mothers feel attracted some are married some may not be married some are younger but it is charm of the beauty of god incarnated as a child you know every person likes the six seven eight years small children with all beauty all enchanting no that's a different attraction but people make he make him a young man to make it interesting those days iron ghosts are married true but boy age was how long the inaudible holy mother was married in witches see so she's married she will not play and she will not be doing something like that so it is a divine play though that's why they are so early as and maybe but this bhagavat says we read the other day um it was within that small young age very young is young kishore kishori that means they are not adult even before adulthood is called kishore in sanskrit teenage teenagers starts from nowadays what teen means 13 13 14 15 19 these are the teenagers that even if you say teenage you can say little because 13 that 12 13 years boy and the girl is five six years girl so anyhow at least that is the other way it makes no sense why to talk of a young boy and girl making some fun and joke of this play of life what is that spiritual it does not make any sense and we are not going to read bhagavat being a son nasi to read a life of mundane play of love no it is spiritual it is divine and that really it happened in the dhaksinisha if you can if you can think of ramakrishna's life look at that when he was a young boy in dhakshi nashville he in the kamaku good days all the ladies all the young girls they are all looking after when godai comes wherever he goes they all run there to see even gaday is not coming so some of the sisters fine sisters they're all so many young girls and they didn't find gadar ramakrishna for a long time and then they will go they will talk to each other one girl talks to the other sister you know what has happened why did not come so you go and bring some those decisions everything ladies were put in the inner courtyard so how to go outside so they said one lady said okay bring some water from the haldarkur the pond from which you face the water so they will even they take that water in the vein of bringing water they go to gauta his house we can make a fantastic story hey he is going like that as our ugly mind things only wonderful sexual thoughts and then he said oh and they actually he met she met and went to my auntie how are you auntie is not the point point is why is gaday and then saw god i then said yay so we are all waiting and that's it then then boy god is very happy then he took the wash she took the water and went back home and god i also followed little afterwards and they entered into the room and danced and sang and enchanted them with spiritual joy no so we can make a fun of it because it is history historical period that's why you cannot do otherwise you will made ramakrishna a young man and all these ladies are young girls and they're doing something with fun and joy of sex there so this is they should not be they're there unless you maintain that you have no right to talk about the art of the name of radha such pure and ramachana says you don't like anything like to take the attraction but radha is to feel for krishna that kind that tremendous love feel for god a little bit of that anyhow uh so winning in the context of controlling a team of powerful bulls without a nose ring he won as wife satya the daughter of nagnajit so nagnajit his daughter's name was satya and winning how he got her by winning in the context of controlling a team of powerful bulls will be left with powerful bulls around and without any news control the all the bulls becoming a powerful person how you can fight alone with so many bulls showing that power bhagavan krishna then got the wife her name is satya with the daughter of nagnajit then without sustaining even a single wound on his body he in the confrontation with those heavily armed by stupid kings destroyed them who in spite of failure and disappointment still desired to get the girl then he killed who are opponent people trying to get that girl she got it these are all protection of these ladies and they are also taught in previous birth i god will be my beloved so that is the madhura bhava so in the question of literature there is this spirit they prayed and meditated and that's why god played in this way he the lord of all like a commonwealthy man appeared to be prompted by his wife satyabhama to get for her a branch of the kalpataru from heaven the lord of all he like a common worldly man appeared to be prompted by his wife satyabhama that surat obama is another wife the guided by heart obama to get her bench a branch of the kalpataru in the heaven he she asked a branch satyabhama wanted a branch of the tree which is in kalpataru tree in the heaven called kalpataruti so that kalpataru tree in the heaven hindu then rushed in great anger to recover it because he is taking out that tree [Music] kalpatri you know it is a wish fulfilling tree if you sit under the culprit and think anything you will get it whatever you think you will be able to get that so that is the power of the culprit territory but satyabhama wanted that branch of kalpataru but he went to heaven then and heaven is under jurisdiction of whom indra indra is the god of gods he is the ruler there then what happened hindu then rushed in great anger to recover it and krishna is trying to get it and he has to bring back low indoors but a play animal of his woman folk low indra is indro is what but a play animal of his women book that means women all their housewives and others they thought oh indra is playful means a worthless he could not protect and krishna took it away krishna's valor and strength is so big probably he cannot protect so they laughed at you this is you are in rock this is your power ridiculed as it were naraka shura and washuda means the demon who covered the sky with his arrows in battle was killed by his discus sudarsana this narakasura another demon shri krishna with this circular disk is this powerful what is that if he throws to anybody krishna will have to do nothing he will be sitting here and that disc will go and catch him and cut his get head and come back to his hand that is that that type of weapon is called sudarsana chakra so krishna re killed by him by the discus of sudarsana chakra who the naro kaashura nashura demon whose name is naraka who is like a like a hell that person is like a hell hellish activity he does so who covered the sky which is arrows in battle when they go into battle he'll cover himself no one can kill him with the arrow of arrows all around so no one can kill but shri krishna's this discus penetrated everything and killed him and came back to his hand requested by naraka's mother in the earth goddess the earth goddess he returned his kingdom and properties to his son again narakasura's mother as it happens mother was so distorted she prayed to bhagavan please give me my back my son so what he did requested by naruka's mother the earth goddess naraka's mother is you earth the mother earth so he returned his kingdom and properties to his son and then entered into the inner apartments these inner apartments were full of young shattrio girls who narakasura had taken by force from their homes narakasura why naraka asura is a demon he used to go and fight with the warrior kings and collected all their wives and then bring them and put into the jail in their own in his own kingdom taken by force and it is these inner apartments were full of young shatter yoga whom naruka had taken away by force from their homes on seeing krishna they all stood up and received him with looks in which joy blastfulness and love were mingled though they were all living in different apartments he held the hands of all of them in wedlock simultaneously taking form suited to each by the power of his maya so it's like a magic story magic story he went into the different apartments found so many shots girls who have been kidnapped by narakasura and arrested and kept there in each apartment and narayana bhagavan krishna entered and he saw them and they are very much affected by his divine presence and then krishna become many in many apartments and everyone as they like to see krishna as if krishna transformed himself in so many to satisfy this  to you girls who are thinking of god krishna to rescue them in each of these women he begot 10 offspring equal to himself in order to demonstrate his mysterious power so krishna have 10 girls 10 children offspring like krishna all the girls have each one have 10 offsprings and that demonstrate his mysterious power by his mysterious power krishna created them and salva who besieged his city of mathura with their armies were killed by him through the instrumentality of others so he's talking about other college governors jovana's name is here also javano means his name is kaala jarasandha and salva they are all violent people in the society it is not that today world is so bad putin is doing like that the china is going to say conquer ceylon and this area that area not like that the world is always like these demons and good people and good people suffer demons will be doing their fun so that's why the krishna came to destroy so every age it is said that god comes so kala jabana jarasandha and salva these are three people three demons who beseeched his city of mathura with their armies attacking the aram the kingdom of mathura they are all killed by bhagavan krishna through the instrumentality of others he kills shambara divida bono these are the names of different bulwa and the like and caused many others to be killed afterwards he managed to destroy all those armies that had gathered in the field of corruption causing ramblings of the earth on the sides of the suns of your two brothers he was not satisfied even after the total destruction of the kaurava armies along with jordan whose good fortune and lifespan were all fortified because of his succumbing to the evil advice of carno distraught and sokuni and who died on the field with his thighs broken in battle these are all the destruction of the demonic powers demonic personalities by krishna only a small part of the burden of the earth has been relieved by the destruction of the eighteen auctioneers of troops by drono vismo juno and others there still remain large armies of the jurors having invincible prows being led by pradhana and others born of me there is no way to their destruction except that they be made to drink the total forgetfulness to quarrel and fight among themselves and thus to bring about mutual destruction my resolution in this regard will automatically take effect so in the war of the bhagavad-gita which where we read huge army 18 akshohini warriors warrior is how many one of any warriors number how many soldiers and then 18 times that they were in the fight they were killed but still they remain much army forces those who are evil minded so how to kill them after mahabharata war is over these demons they fought with each other is described in the mahabharata as battle formation consisting of two eight twenty one thousand eight seventy chariots sixty five thousand six ten horses hundred nine thousand three hundred and fifty infantry so you add all this hundred nine thousand sixty five thousand so so the two hundred and fourteen thousand two hundred and fourteen thousand and twenty one thousand [Music] true yeah army with the elephant an army with the only sword but i'm saying the number of people i am talking about so it is a huge number of armies they fought with each other akshaini concept 218 700 warriors 218 700 warriors were in the fight and the ratio ratio of one chariot is to one elephant is to three dot five that means in each of these large number groups these digits add up to 18 that means 18 times of that one akshohini soldiers means two hundred eighteen thousand seven hundred understand two hundred says say two hundred twenty thousand times eighteen then many people fought in the mahabharata war and they were killed but all dead but still they remained [Music] did it so much 218 000 times 18 how much 218 2018 mahaprabhu so that much number of people fought with each other still there are many people who have the evil-minded people so how they will kill so they fought with each other being drunk and being addicted they start when they get drunk or get into addiction they lose their sense so therefore they fought with each other and that's why after krsna's lifetime itself they there are people warriors they started fighting with each other even his own family members be a part of that there is no way to their destruction except that they may made to drink to total forgetfulness to quarrel and fight among themselves and thus bring about mutual destruction so it was first fight between two opposing opponents when they are all destroyed but still the warriors worry and mentality to fight to tease and each one poking to each other as it happens in a family brother against brother they become the worst enemy sister against sister so like that these remaining people they became they become so jealous or powerful to fight with each other and destroy each other dissolving thus the lord had judish today installed on his ancestral throne after doing all this thing then judistrido has met the king but the king how how many people are left in the world empty empty empty kingdom most of the people are killed and lived in its capital city exemplifying the way of piety and bringing joy to the minds of the friends and relatives so judistiro the lord had judiciary installed on his ancestral judiciary was made the king and bhagavan krishna then lived in his capital but where is that capital where is the capital of krishna no duarka his own kingdom is dwarka and he why he did that exemplifying the way of a king with pity and bringing joy in the minds of the friends and relatives the line of puru was saved by object be getting an issue in uttara but that issue was destroyed in the womb itself by the way from napa it was revived by all powerful lord he helped judistira apart from the three or sacrifices and do this to reign with the help of the brothers always depending on krishna so he made it is all guided by krishna so three ashamed of sacrifice assuming the sacrifices giving horses you lead the horse the king will let the horse go any country with a sign that judicio is the king of this country he helped judistiro performed three ostromeda sacrifices and judistira did three gosvami rajas means three corners probably send a mars go this way followed by a big army behind if anyone stops that horse that king he will fight this judicious army will fight and then they will conquer that kingdom and then move forward that means they are all accepting yudhisthira is our king's king we accept the allegiance to him that is called the australia and then after that that also they will offer in a jagna and that's called swami reject though that part will be that is the way same way they goes to the other's territory other kings are there but that king will not allow as ukraine is being tried by the russian army that they are fighting no you cannot do that but if they fail then that begins my land similarly same way that also also the horse goes and the army following him and their horse is stopped then war starts and then they will destroy or they will be destroyed if you destroy the other party then you conquer that land china did that in last you mean in upper part of the himalayas then crossed 21 000 miles or something like that in the himalayas towards india stopped very long so judicial reigned with the help of his brothers always depending on krishna but judy steer then become the emperor and he ruled by the power of his brothers on krishna guidance and krishna though he was the lord of the world yet following the way of the world and of the vedas lived in dwarka amidst all sense enjoyments but ever detached from them and established in spiritual awareness so finishing these activities the krishna though he was the lord of the world he is the master of the whole world but being king he came down and following the way of the world he become the king of that jurisdiction and then in the leave the dwarka which is still now there no somnath is there dwarka is there and how lived he lived like a detached person we live with attachment and we we cry and weep for that he lived as a king it matters little whether he's a king or not he's always detached from the worldly attachment he delighted he delighted in all in this world especially the judus by his charming and smiling face by his most attractive words by his righteous and beneficent actions and by his most auspicious presence in their midst at night she gave some time to his wedded wives for love support love sports in his company after many years spent in this way krishna lost interest in the householder's life and observing this example of the lord no one that approaches the lord of yoga through any path of spiritual communion would put faith in the world's worldly enjoyment which are with us today and gone tomorrow so what happens it is that krishna lived like a king and he lived observing the examples of his that he live in the world he got then detached from this and he lost the interest of even ruling the country anymore so he spiritual observing this example of the lord no one that approaches the lord of yoga that means we who are worshiping god krishna through any path of spiritual communion to the path of ghana to the part of bhakti or to the path of yoga or karma who would put faith in the world in germans would put faith in world engagements which are we tasked today and gun tomorrow so they will not be attracted to this because all sense enjoyments in the world only momentary it comes and it goes away and they don't stay rather it brings much suffering when after experience of something good and that goes away soon and brings suffering then who will be interested in holding on to that type of enjoyments so bhagavan krishna then denounced and that way he's saying that following his path all the world will learn that whatever duty you do detach and don't get attracted to any things in the world because it is today is here and tomorrow it is gone one day the young men of the judos and bhojas who are at play insulted some sages who being dash provoked and angry pronounced a curse which was in the accordance with the wish of the lord but there is a big story that one day a young man of the judo clan and bhujas their group went on a plane and then insulted the sage that is i'm not going to that i know little bit but not fully i forgot so then the sage cursed and his scars actually which was the inaccording which according to the wish of the lord because they want to destroy these evil-minded people who are fighting with each other they're immoral drug-addicted drinking so god's will they created this and pronounced the curse some months after as destiny would have it the clansmen of the bhishnis bhujas andakas went in a joyous mood to prabhasa in their schedules after bathing in the holy water there they performed worship of gods and rishis and victories and made gifts of excellent cows and brahmanas presenting various gifts to brahmanas gold silver bedding clothes deer skins rappers babies elephants and all and land and treating them to fists with many varieties of food in a spirit of offering to the lord these heroes of the britishness clan made low frustration on the ground so after bathing in the holy this after a few months afterwards all these family members of the clan of brishni and bhujas and andakas there are three clans and their children they all went and took a bath in the waters and performed on worship and then presenting gifts and others to their poor and the brahmins they then the business clan made prostitution saluted the earth so question is there but here ends to today's reading we end the reading and we'll start the next test reading god next day again uddhava will describe the last days of krishna how his major part of the life is duty is done and then he is going to destruction of the judo clan and then he also gets out and guy telling uttawa what to do he ends his life okay om shanti shanti shanti harihim sriram krishna panamastu so there are questions already nishant question is krishna taught to dava aduta had to teach it to the gopis to counsel them why did krishna not just teach directly to the gopis oh no the question is that krishna [Music] sent uddhava no uttabla went with the chariot now so krishna when he left vrindavan so he came to mathura to kill kik kancha the demon but the gopis used to love bhagavan the lord krishna as i said those girls of six seven eight nine ten years old they're so dedicated to bhagavan krishna and that krishna has left so they are in our believement so narayana you go to these girls they have no higher education they didn't go to school they didn't read the philosophy of vedanto and uttab is a person who knows all the philosophies of life he is a knower of truth and also scholar and if you go and see they are crying and weeping so you are an intelligent person you have the philosophy known to you so you go and console them so hearing this uddhava went there with the chariot and then as soon as they said is coming from krishna all the ladies all the girls they assembled around that chariot and uddhava came down and he talked with the ladies then he said why are you weeping why are you crying for krishna krishna is a man krishna is god and krishna is not in any particular place he's in the heart of all in your heart in our heart he is everywhere so why don't you and vedanta says no god is everywhere started giving this advice that don't be silly cayenne weep for krishna krishna is not a man it is not a human love it is a divine love therefore krishna is in your heart think of krishna he's here he's not a man that he should have to have a physical company but he's here in your heart all the time that's the vedanto sarva-bhutastamatmanam sarva-bhutani chatmani she who sees me in every heart and in me the whole world i don't disappear from them so you are all doctors be a little ganny then you will not cry knowing that god is everywhere why i should cry he's here he's there he's there he was here in the physical form he is not there but he is there in a subtle way so i need not have to weep and cry then the gopis responded oh your arguments are very good but how we think to think you need a mind we have no mind anymore the lord god krishna has stolen our minds we have no mind and how can i think how can he think that he is in the heart and this and that that means he has taken our mind heart everything he has stolen that's why he's krishna krishna is the stealing everything cursed and krishna steals the heart of the devotees so he said that what how can you tell us to meditate on him you are saying think of him close down your eyes see the presence of krishna you will feel that in your heart how can i do that krishna is no more here he when he went to mathura in a divine play she has taken stolen that means we are not we are not ourselves as human our mind is being there so this is only an external what you call the structure external structure without any heart heart has been stolen there so therefore so that is the advice that is the conversion between conversation between ut davao and the gopis so the auditing knowledge it is not updating knowledge but it is what he is trying to give that it is much higher than our data knowledge here is the question of testing the love of god ramakrishna said i don't want to be sugar but i want to be testing the sugar so he is testing the sugar coming down from that level so i i think that is the way to understand that god is testing [Music] little proud that he is a ghani and rudolph thought these are women they are illiterate people they are having no spiritual wisdom but it is this spiritual wisdom can come it's called para bhakti para bhakti means supreme devotion it is not ordinary love it is supreme love the supreme love transcends your ghana knowledge knowledge is the god is everywhere there's only one word but i am feeling the pangs of separation he is in the came down that's what down under came down how can you imagine what will be that attraction when sat chidan only incarnates in a human body what will be the tremendous attraction so to prove to dava that knowledge is not higher than bhakti this para bhakti is higher than so-called knowledge so that is the first question second question in the lilac said that hindi says mother and gopalo are awake what does that mean the other aspects are not active meaning if you say mother and gopala are having mean meaning gopal is the child and mother is mother that means in this age for the redemption of the world sri ramakrishna came to create this attitude of mother and the child child and the mother so this is awake that means awakening in the spirit whole to save the whole world from lust and greed what should be the attitude mother and the child attitude no among all the relationship what is the purest relationship when a baby and mother baby does not know anything but mother and mother whatever may be doing when she is holding the small six months eight months nine months baby whole heart and soul is the baby so baby and mother that is the spirit and ramakrishna came in this age practicing all these different modes he said amar maktribam mind is the attitude of mother i am the child innocent child and she is god is my mother so this relationship is very pure and stainless otherwise tantric practices are there which is very risky there is a fall because people with body identity their mind will be going to the sensuality but in the pure state of a baby just a new one baby and then mother what else is there what sexuality is there that is the purest of love that's why now this is awakened that's her that little [Music] that if you say that no no [Music] [Music] before body identity they are spiritually together and they didn't compare their body identity and nothing so what is the glory of that if you have that thing no no transcend it and you attain that spirituality no no no no no no no that is something they are already pure soul such a pure soul you know you don't make everyone every child same there's some child born in knowledge these devotees whom we are seeing gopis they are the rishis of the past they are all brahman ghanis for excellent and they wanted to experience this attraction the love spirituality that is developed though they may be child ramakrishna was child but he's going walking and seeing the crane he is in ecstasy people will think that he has painted what what ecstasy he understands true but they have so much practice behind anything beauty seeing the eternal beauty of lord how it sparks in their heart so that is the level to be understood that they are so pure in their heart that they felt that attraction pure attraction pure love but there is nothing for us to learn from them yeah you understand on the he tithe no you love god with your heart and soul that is the point you love god like the gopis love the krishna but they didn't have that i forget that they ran from their house listening to the flute the god is playing the fruit do you feel attracted run for god god is always playing the fruit come come come who who responds to that call may the millions of people are there who is here to listen to this bhagavat why not why some one or two people come or even five people come attraction does not come unless the mind is pure so whatever it may be say all children are sick some children are even five six seven years child they are playing with gone someone with the toys some some everyone child has different tendency and swami is meditating why why swami vivekananda will you put him into the same category four five six years boy what he's doing he's meditating with the friends snake came and all ran away but he's still there he's an adult 25 years old noran or a child not it how he got this intoxication he has not understood anything but his is that he loves to be tuned in consciousness with closing eyes he used to see the light here do every one of us see light when you go to sleep every night so we have to think that way i keep the light on i see it that's the external light you have no control over that but if you could just close and see the light inside that's the spirituality so that is that we don't consider that ordinary people because they have not developed that is not the point not developed or developed that inner tendency will force them to drive and drive in that direction an orange situation is ramakrishna's example i am giving he was dressed with a like lord lord like lord shiva and just shiva and everyone he was so many merged into civil idea he went into samadhi he became in that unconscious state for the whole night and next day so what will you say he has not developed he does not know any samadhi he does not know any technical term or anything but see the absorption of the mind so though their child they were playing but their ramakrina said they are great sages in the past life and they had tremendous austerity they did for god cried and knew it and that made them pure and with that pure heart they filled their attraction for god actression for god does not come unless heart is pure when i am not when i am in the world and i am having fun and joy what is my need for god what do i need if i can get fun and joy here i am satisfied but god is needed go to all the you youthful people what their energy is being spent unless you have purified with that and finished with all these things understand that these are no more important because it is transient because it's a momentary not that it is bad all joy is joy god's joy but this remains two simple fraction of a second and then you forget that you would plunge into the again suffering so therefore the point is that pure heart is necessary to have felt the love of god in the transient world but it's not the same depth and satisfying as one joy right yeah that's the point we have joy we know what good food can give us it can give us joy but good food how long tip of the tongue food goes here we are all haha good food fastest food how beautiful how nice how spicy how this everything goes away it's a memory you see something beautiful as long as you see sun setting wow what a beautiful sun sets that becomes a memory full moon night full moon night and the full moon night goes away then it becomes a memory it does not stay with us and we feel the separation from that joy that's why the worldly joy which we are there i it is this temporary momentary and we don't want momentary thing we want to joy perpetual nature the whole life everyone is struggling for joy and joy only people are having having drug to have joy people are having fun for joy people are going to the dancing club for joy people are going to politics for joy people are writing poems articles for joy there is the joys attraction of everyone in every point of life but this joy whatever you find you see it comes in a time and goes in a time yeah so how can you be satisfied with that which comes and goes is there any joy which can be continuous will stay with me will no one have any access and take away snatch away any joy you have it is dependent you need a good food to satisfy your tongue it needs a good music satisfied you satisfy your ear you need everything anything you need in sensitive world and opposite and dependent depending on many things depending on the object depending on your mood suppose you have a plenty food of you have eaten something and then someone brings the best thing you like ice cream and then it is here but i i cannot take it today why not take you like it because i'm full so even the sunset experience has its end it is not very fulfilling and temporary and momentary it comes and goes and it ultimately brings suffering when enjoying only few minutes before that you lever hard to get that joy after that joy ended you go into depression oh no i'm not getting it why people go to drug again and again one day they have to experience drug why not it's sufficient oh i got it that time my mind was very high and now now naught is coming okay let me go and high and high high high high and then whatever you become slave of that dog and then that becomes a problem of life and suffering it does not give joy people say addiction how to get out of addiction i know it is not good but i cannot give up that means you are caught in the neck by that which is addiction so shall you go for that he very full go again and again you suffer and if you're a wise person you'll say no i don't care love god come contact in contradictory you who those who love god and meditate on god they're full see their face beaming with joy they don't depend on anyone you shut your door yourself think of god and you find joy so that's why that joy is perpetual that joy is inspirational you have a good meditation yesterday if you sit today your mind will think oh that was good it feels high not text like the drug or drinking so these are the things to be thought about yeah krishna had about sixteen thousand ways it is said is there a symbolic meaning behind the marriages i don't know only it is i have heard that he was the all these queens or these ladies were kept in different evil-minded kings who were prison imprisoned in their in their kingdom and when their krishna conquered and killed that demon or that bad guy bad king then naturally these ladies took shelter at the feet for protection and they are all kept under the supervision of krishna probably that's why it is called he has meaning so many why he married so many people it is for protection i do not know about more than that uddhava story you are telling is lovely but is not krishna conveying a different message by having ten offsprings with each lady i don't know there may be some reason i don't know a devotee is always trying to check his ego by thinking of himself as subservient to god but for aspirants in the path of knowledge where one says i am that how humility could be cultivated that is the humility when you are saying i am that what do you mean this tiny puny man is that you are making a mistake when vedanta says i am that what does it mean this five foot four inches height 155 pound weight with two eyes ears and hand that is brahman that is that you are making a grand mistake [Music] you are not the body not the mind then you are that so you are keeping your mind in your thought i am the body and i am that that's a wrong interpretation so you have to understand real i am that you will be feeling when your ego this this this mundane ego this ego which is talking this ego which eats this ego with judge judgmental that ego will die when you are tuned to the cosmic eye the small eye merging into the cosmic eye then you become the cosmic eye you are saying i am that the drop merging into this ocean drop zero drop becomes zero but he becomes ocean that's why i am ocean i am not the drop i am a stoke not the small quantity i am that infinite so that is to be understood vedanta analysis there is a process otherwise making people will mistake that talking about i am that make you egotistic it makes you most humble you cannot think that you are this or you are some powerful person and that that means satchida absolute one without a second okay think yeah see even if there's no ego and even if i don't think that in my body or my mind maybe it's still appropriate to say that we have our own will that can either turn to god or brought him in or away and even if again no ego nobody but i still in the jiva that's independent yeah so long you are jiva you are independent but you are in the duality i am my ego you have your ego but even though ego is still how can you be no ego and then you when you go to deep sleep you have no ego but you're still separate no i am not separate suppose when you are sleeping i am sleeping one million people one billion people sleeping at that time do you remember that who you are and i am remember who i am a monk you remember i am what is your name so i am german join me jeremy okay so you are jeremy i am sarva devanando these adrijadis do you remember when you are sleeping deep sleep no your ego is mulch but ego is still there it is hiding that ego is hiding ego and then when you just somebody pokes you up you come back to this ego it is not that like that you totally overcome your lower identity but even if somebody overcomes it and i'm saying this i think ramakrishna also said that instead of becoming sugar you want to think that's what i'm saying exactly in some sense where you can love god right now that is after loving god deeply deeply you march in god and you go to either the absolute state called samadhi then your total ego emerges into the cosmic ego and when you come by from that end then you see you are pure and everything is pure you then also eat then also sleep they also talk enjoy but that's a different enjoyment but one person can be somebody here and i could be here and not in somebody so doesn't it mean we're still different now in the material level we are different so long i am talking you are talking we are different but you go to the inner core dive deep into yourself if you say that you don't think of your body you go beyond you don't have to mind thinking this thought that thought that thought get in internally go back back back and see there is somebody saying i saw i was seeing that mind was restless so i somebody who is observing the pawn of the mind so go beyond beyond beyond beyond when you go to the last part then everything is same but when you come down from experience then you see the whole world transformed now we are seeing the world as individuals you are different i am different that time they will also see the world is different and non-different at a time how it is different in name and form everyone's name will be different form will you remain it is like the gold gold aldermans one will be hearing and there will be bracelet another it will be chained they are different but all are gold you will see gold everywhere at the same time it is chain it is it is it is called the ring it is called the whatever bracelet etcetera but the gold is really in the form that it is right so maybe we can say right right that is the truth that will come back then you see gold everywhere whether in form this form or that one matters can you understand this intellectually or do you have actually intellectually just imagine where to intellectually i i cannot understand intellectually intellectual graph you grab that idea and think does it make rational is it does it make sense is it possible you know you go to the gold gold gold shop and do you think everything is made of gold those designs are all different so similarly we see designs are all different but so all made of gold you go to the wax museum wax museum all the actors their portraits are all different you can match it but everything is made of wax so those two will be coming out in the mind of the person thank you all om shanti shanti shanti and will have class at 7 30 shanti gita at 7 30 today you
