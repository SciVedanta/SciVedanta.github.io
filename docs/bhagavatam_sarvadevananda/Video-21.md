[Bhagavatam - Book 1. Chapter 15 - Verse 36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PnF30Agm7g)

[Music] the destroyer of the demons kangshwa and chanura the most darling child of devaki mother devaki the guru of the world and it and the lord of all we salute him again and again so this is the bhagavat so bhagavat we are reading on the chapter 1 chapter of the book 1 chapter 15 and we are on verse number 36 we will read today but just the context is that what you know when to dwarka the capital where krishna was ruling and krsna's all the divine activities are all over establishment of dharma and destroying the demons and all the evil and now he thought that his purpose is done so he wanted to give up the body and so krishna gave up the body arjuna went there and found that that is the way the lord of the universe was his friend and guide in every aspect of the movement of arjuna that he's lost so they were absolutely broken so with that broken heart he came back to judistira and judiciary got this news so they are very much totally destroyed and very much lost their all interest in being ruling the country or remaining as a king or emperor of india so they were very in the mood of departing or abandoning everything and leaving the body so that was the situation going on the great abandonment of the pandavas that is the praise we are reading we have read that the mind of arjuna merged in krishna under the powerful sentiment of deep friendship became pure and got settled in calmness so arjuna also thinking of krishna where there is a deep relationship you feel much affected by that no so many people are dying today it matters little it's a news to us no in the newspaper you see that some people have died 10 people have died oh it's a justin news but if anyone related to me or related to you yourself know your friend and the intensity will be different according to the closeness of that relationship now so arjuna's relationship with krishna was so close deep and profound that when he thought saw that the lord krishna left the body by thinking of krishna day and night his mind becomes purer and purer this day believement normally brings attachment and be remain more depression and suffering but spiritual people if you love for them you cry then you become purified you can pure you your your spiritual growth i become faster so arjuna became like that and by the power of devotion now intensified by continuous thoughts of the lord arjuna's understanding was free from all impurities so arjuna was now mind become very clear thinking of god no other attachment no other interest in the world the lord god who came down to solve the problem of the world now he is gone so what is the meaning of staying anyone all lose their interest when some near and dear one dies no and when he sees he says that krishna who is krishna he is the power behind arjuna's every effort all the success behind that was krishna who is a friend of god become your friend so how powerful you become them in the material world so he was spending that time so he lost all interest for anything in the world in this mundane world of name and form and arjuna's mind becomes so clear in understanding was so pure that once again he recovered his remembrance of that saving knowledge which the lord had imparted to him in the battlefield that means twice in the battlefield one the bhagavad-gita what do you read at the start of the war and the other one where you read santi gita whatever you would be next reading in this evening so the booth twice he heard this great message saving message which was given in the battlefield being obstructed by abstracted from the manifestation of the force of time karma and worldly enjoyment so karma is finished no worldly attraction so he became pure by the experience of the supreme being he was now free from all these sorrows and doubts arising from the sense of duality so this duality creates this trouble by thinking of krishna intensely his heart becomes so saturated with the knowledge and wisdom that he became free from all attachment like that and then it happened to this happened to arjuna what happened to others hearing about krsna's departure from the earthly life and the destruction of the clan of jodhu jadhavas judistero made the firm decision of taking the vow of abandonment he will just give up everything all is kingdom and emperor emperorship no and the mother pritha prita the mother of the pandavas on hearing arjuna's report of the destruction of the jews and the lord's ascension gave up our earthly body by uniting her spirit with the supreme being through the one pointed devotion to him what powerful ladies are they he said oh krishna is gone thinking of that so intensely we drove our mind from the world that he detached himself herself from this body and left the body that means they have the power to give give up the body at will we have no power even if we want to give up and sometimes people i want to die i don't want to suffer so much i want to get out of the body it is not in our hand but arjuna's mother five brothers mother she was so pure and so dedicated to krishna so that purity had given the power to withdraw the mind from the body and just deepen his consciousness into the divine krishna and left the body so mother passed away judistiro planned that he should give up the kingdom and abundant see all is giving up giving up a torn is taken the example and of the body with the aid of another thorn and after the work is done both the thorns are thrown away so also the lord has assumed the body for lightening the burden of the earth and having done it he threw away his body also for the lord his body and bodies of others are alive he embodied himself as fish another incarnation he's talking about krishna krishna has abandoned the body in this body now how krishna has it is called the god 10 incarnations before god appeared in different bodies for the good of the universe even taking some bodies which are not human bodies fish body tortoise body that's why hindus have several gods and goddesses worshipped in so many ways that's why western people they criticize what is this religion they worship tortoise they worship fish but anyhow so so as the fish body the tortoise body the avatar lord came down for the good of the world and when the mission was successful they gave up the body similarly krishna also the lord or god of the universe appeared and now the purpose being served so he is not he has left the body he embodied himself as fish and other incarnation abandoned those bodies having fulfilled his mission in the same way he abandoned this body with which he lighted the burden of the earth but in the midst of those changes he remains all the time same no he takes this body that body but he the eyes sachidan on the absolute brahman remaining the same all the time just like an actor who plays several parts without changing his identity no one actor he plays in different roles different times so similarly god the saccidananda the absolute the timeless spaceless absolute reality which is called brahman atman small body like us he is brahmana himself incarnated that's the god god incarnate christ buddha's like that now we start reading 36 but today is reading this is the preamble the very day when the lord of abounding grace left this earth that same day curly the spirit of evil which augments the degenerate tendencies of indiscriminating minds strengthened his sway on earth then again he said now the lord god came and he resolved the problems removed the negativities from the world that do but as he left again all the lower characters mean selfishness unkindness fraudulent nature all gradually raise their hood again it is suppressed as it were by the presence of god's presence and now again there is started raising their hood that's why swami vivekananda said no they're doing good to the world he inspired everyone to be unselfish and do good to the world huh you don't think of yourself think of others and unselfish thinking no but at the end he said this doing good to others for who's whose necessity world does not need you or me but we do good for whom for our own spiritual development the world remains the same he said no it is like dog's curly tail the god star dogs curly tail you try to stretch it like that hold on so long you are pushing and pressing it is there lift your hand it turns back again so the world is made of the three gunas sattva rajas and tamas so satyam revealed when lord god came down by his spiritual force in the three gunas the lower character thomas and rajas were subdued the kings were killed means what rajas thomas king swear thomas who are very mean unkind kings would be generous kings should be like father taking care of the child every citizen no rama was called the king real king he he used to look after the needs of the subjects not for his own personal anything no all become secondary so ideal king but mean king you go every country and there are not even every thousands of inspiration inspirational bad kings you can find now today's bad king survivor what is sputnik doing what is going on in ukraine huh so what force is this i didn't leave people unto themselves to attack to go and 100 000 people um in the army being assembled there took out all this and this is the thomas and the raja's quality so when it hood is raised that's why another time has come to god to come again is to subdue them so he says that krishna was like that so the kohli so the wise judiciary soon made preparation he was a king so he said my purpose is done also so to abandonment seeing what he saw the advancing of the influence of kali yuga kalikali kohli is called the kali yuga is called iron age no that kali has iron and dark dark characteristics is coming up creeping into the mind of the people because lord god is gone therefore the influence of the bad influences are raising their hood now no always it happens you know when police force become weak the gang people become much more powerful when less police petrol goes in the freeway people drive recklessly is it not so even good people that i drive miraculously so all these disciplines go away so they were seeing this that influence of kali is entering on this city kingdom palace and himself in increase of greed untruth duplicity and cruelty he found that that is the tendency in the mind of the people coming up the emperor judistira now perform the coronation of his grandson that means he is putting his grandson as a king to rule and who is the grandson pariksit from whom by whom this bhagavad-gita started no parikshit was in the last leaving the body because in the fear that he will be beaten by the snake and he will die within seven days so that king judistiro judistero's grandson parikshith installed him as the king that he called a ceremony and he was establishing him and the emperor yudhisthira now performed the coronation of his grandson but she who is parikshit who is noted for his modesty has also possessed of excellence equal to his own that means he's a good king he has the brain he has the power to rule for the good of the of his whole citizens of his country made him the ruler of the whole land cuddled by the sea with hastinapura's capital their capital being hastinapur and west indiapoor is what what is the name modern name of hastinapur delhi yeah yeah you can go and find the near delhi there is a place called hastinapura check it and google will tell you immediately ah and that hostinaport is the capital yes and girdled by the ocean see all india you go down all through it's on the ocean the all covered by the water and on north side is the himalaya no so it is protected from that side from at but now it is this ocean is nothing and also himalaya is nothing they can attack from any direction now at motura he enthroned badra [Music] still now the same place exist so here was the capital that time then he performed vedic fire sacrifice in the name of prajapati and afterwards who who this is judishira he was the king so he's trying to exit abandoning everything and just lead the last journey to god all duties have been performed so he then judistero performed the vedic fire sacrifice in the name of prajapati and afterwards he withdrew into his self the three fires these three fires and dakshina symbolic of his having therefore abandoned the external performances of fire sacrifice so long you are a king in earlier days that was the rule king or householder you have to perform jagnas every day so three types of juggernauts so he performed the last time one time last apart from all this sacrificial fire because he'll be in a wandering monk like that he will run move towards the himalayas so he is no more king so he didn't like ordinary man as one become a monk so so last rite is done here there itself he abandoned his silk dress because king's dress is royal dress so he was wearing the silk dress and the golden ornaments in his body kingly um uh ornaments abandoning also his ego sense and the bondage of the world he sacrificed speech in the mind mind in the prana prana in the upon upon in the death and death in the material body that means in other words he control all the senses and realize that death etc are only applicable to the body and was established in the conviction that he is the atman not subject to the six-fold changes no so they are all yogis no though they are kings that was the incense wisdom people were so much philosophically established that these kings were the great teachers of vedanta they know all the philosophy they know how to withdraw the outside to them these objects taking into the mind mind into deeper and deeper and deeper to understand to stay in atman and everything is all detached dressed in bark cloth without food speechless with hair disabled resembling one senseless or inability or cowardice without casting even a look back depth to all sounds with mind completely absorbed in the thought of brahman he started from home in the northern direction along the path of no return which all the great men in the past have treated in earlier days that was the tradition when you reach a certain age then you move towards the northern region that means himalayas you give up everything your your wealth money prosperity whatever it is not only the monks that is that's why india survived with his spirituality so much last part of life your friend your family your everything is gone all leave behind and just like wearing a as a bark in those days that means simple dress royal dress has been given up all the ornaments has been gone silk dress this is that and you become like an ordinary wandering monk you give up everything and move towards the himalay to the region of himalaya for your deep contemplation keeping the mind in the divine and divine only what is society even king setting the ideal no that's why earlier days the brahmin son son of a brahmana he was sent known sometimes to the kings to learn about vedanta to learn about brahman atman and call in the upanishads we find king prabhahan jaiwali jaiwali all these names we find that they are going and asking please teach me what is brahman like because they had the knowledge at the same time they are not ordinary people just eating sleeping and dancing and see singing that type of king and it is not they are all men of wisdom and particularly they are talking about this judicial so judas children then gave up all his royal things put brick into the throne and then he left everything wearing the dress of mandican dress all refundable brothers two seeing the evil influence of kali spreading among their subjects that means people are again getting polluted by the selfishness unkindness jealousy stealing all these negative characters as we find in the society creeping up so rapidly the all the other father other four brothers there are five brothers no judistira and then arjuna nakula sawadeva and bhima these are the five brothers all the other brothers they also followed the same path followed the footsteps of their elder brother judistira with firm determination they who had lived their lives in the light of truth and righteousness all these five brothers lived the life of truthfulness and righteousness all through the life that's why they suffered so much truthfulness you do this to hold on to the truthfulness otherwise you don't was cheating how many times like our previous president in a day how many things he has to say so and he says no i didn't say that the record is there well no no no that's wrong somebody's languages they have mimicked it no anyhow so they who had lived their lives in the light of truth and righteousness realized that the feet of the lord were their only ultimate support and withdrew their mind away from all worldly objects that they could have stayed in their kingdom why elder brother is going what is there other brothers are making they can and the next brother could have been the king no they didn't the judiciary did not make the other brothers king or anything and they didn't like also so they followed the footsteps of renunciation detachment and love for god that's why something bibi can understand the national ideal of india in this is renunciation and what service service and renunciation twin ideal of india from dance and time renunciation and service when you are in duty serve do your duties as a king certain subjects the best possible way and if you are and after that service renounce renounce renounce that is the key note of indian spiritual tradition with their understanding purified by devotion generated by meditating on him the lord krishna they became absorbed in the supreme consciousness of narayana and endowed its spiritual bodies of sudden sattva should means pure extremely pure buddhi their indirect understanding becomes extremely pure without any rajas and tamas sattva rajas and tamas so he became totally all or become so pure giving up their tamas and raja's aspects attained to the state of absolute purity which is far away from those engrossed in the ephemeral enjoyments of the senses it is just opposite of the ordinary people who lived in the world so arjuna and other four brothers together they also followed the path of judishira abandoning abandoning the all kingly pleasures and renouncing everything and moved on to the path of the northern region means himalay viduro vidura was the uncle bidura was the uncle of arjuna and five brothers he is of steady and understanding cast of his body at prabhas with his mind absorbed in krishna and infilled by him so video his uncle he gave up give up his body by deep contemplation and thinking of the lord krsna naraya another krishna as bidura was the descent of dharmaraj the presiding deity of the departed spirits he resumed his original state to perform the duties that the lord had placed on him dhruvpodi finding that her husbands had taken to the life of renunciation centered her mind entirely on vaasudeva and attained to him so draupadi also she put her mind in the lord krishna and then she also attained to him means he become united with the lord so this is the situation happened to the five brothers their mother and their wife draupadi that means everyone followed the path of spirituality no and they give up all the kingdom for which they fight this is a wonderful incident the all the far five brothers fought for righteousness and conquered the evil with the help of krishna bhagavan krishna and now they are only giving up all the kingdom what what type of this see the values of life they do for dharma for righteousness not for their own fun and pleasure not for their own enjoyment it is about citing giving a example to the society how to be a king for justice for truth for our ultimate goal of human life so here in the chapter 15 last verse is 51 we are reading that that whoever hears with a devoted heart this esoteric and inspiring account of the great abandonment of the son of pandu who were extremely dear to the lord krishna will be blessed with devotion to the lord and attained to liberation so yeah there is the blessings of the writer bayasso basso vasudev he is saying that those will be blessed though will read these verses with devotion and understand its meaning their mind being focused concentrated to god and then they will be attaining ultimately liberation that means that the praise of the study of this book now page 71 we will be starting the new chapter we have ended here 15th chapter now we will go for the 16th how many people are sleeping and don't sleep baba oh now listening time listen meditating time meditating sometimes we do that in the morning chanting time people meditate no no no that is not the meditation time that is the chanting time evening time we do the earth you know think that everyone will join because there is a prayer that the pray but that time all the people will be sitting like that so better to do chanting time chanting meditation time meditation then you will enjoy enjoy the thing more of course goal is to meditate that's true yeah now so here 16 chapter book number one sixteenth chapter first verse sutra watch now the narrator is talking suta then what happened um o learned one even as the experts in the reading the future had predicted at his birth this pariksit the great devotee of the lord and a man of many excellencies ruled the kingdom following the advice of his competent ministers he married irapati the daughter of his uncle uttara and had by her four children the eldest of whom was janame jaya so now we are entering into another area he's saying that he this pariksit king was the great devotee of lord krishna and he was of many excellencies he ruled the kingdom because he was then set into the throne by yudhisthira just we read because he has put into that and he he ruled the kingdom following how he's very wise person so he followed the advice of the ministers good people take opinions of many people no good good administrators that's why the king has their ministers ministers has to guide the king giving proper right this suggestion and then he can take the decision but there are good people to support him so pariksit is following the advice of the competent competent ministers ministers if they're bad they can drain you to another direction our ministers are good they can do good to the country in a in a in a country in a parliament when it happens they are all ministers no if they are good people they can take good decision and good thing may happen if their evil tendency to how to make money how to pay fill their pocket then it is something else so he then parishioned tried to follow that principle of taking the suggestion from the competent ministers and he ruled the country and he married ishwar irabati he's the daughter of his uncle uttaras uttara's son and daughter and he and had four children eldest the elder's son is called jana meijaya with kripa with kripa as the leading priest he performed three assamed of sacrifices on the bank of ganga at which wealth without limit was given in holy charity and the presence of the devas invoked was visible even to the naked eye when they call they do this this type of what is called the homo fire it's called the astra meda astra they send one horse aswa assuming's horse and they send it and their hangs this horse belongs to the king and this king of this power and prowse you know so it goes through anywhere and another domain of another king so you accept this horse means the representative of the king that is honest king you you make friendship and rule your country if you don't then there will be a fight and defeat and then they'll conquer that country and conquer that country like that that's the rule so he did three asamera such big sacrifice on the bank of ganga and there is a whenever you do some performance hindu rituals are there you will have to give gifts you will have to give gifts to the people brahmin and poor people food and gifts so at which wealth without limit was given in holy charity it's a holy charity so that performance part of the performance was done and not only that if you do it perfectly then gods the subtle entities which you call gods hindu gods or many gods they descend they come by their presence and he said there are so much purity was generated in that astra me the sacrifice special area that the cause descended and they were even visible by the gross eyes other people saw the gods and goddesses whom we meditate they are visibly present that means the very auspicious and pious sacrificial fire has been done believe in what it happened when this belmont was established swami vivekananda passed away in 1902 july 4th no and this temple inauguration was done in 1938 how many years 36 years this temple was also established in 1938 the same time this is as old as that bellarmore temple so now when the temple was inaugurated that began maharashtra was uh somebody began on the who designed this plan according to swamiji's idea swamiji said that i may not be able to see this temple but i shall see from the uh from that plane huh and it is said the day of inauguration was going on so maybe we can run the song that's something sorry swami began on the song that swami vivekananda is standing there blessing their presence sami vivekananda brahmana those who have passed away those direct disciples they all came to purify and sanctify this place so that means it's a living presence in the old story a new story you know this is story of thousands of years ago we say these are all meet but that meat was not myth for being began on the moral he is not an ordinary guy he will tell lie no he said i saw directly that swamiji came and maharaja came they all bless this peasants so it is this they are gods so the gods descend to purify sanctify the place when some auspicious thing goes on in this book you will find deva narcanti the gods are dancing in joy like you say and the christian literature you'll find the angels are dancing in joy so similarly the subtle pure souls those who are god's support live and some they are protecting or they are supporting these noble things so you have any question you get ready now i otherwise i will continue to read a few more verses now once the heroic parikshith in the course of his tours of victory came across the evil on one calling koli sporting with insignia of a man of a royal cast but tormenting a cow and a bull by kicking at them mercilessly seeing that parikshith influence inflicted severe punishment on kohli that means there was one bad kohli means the idea i said koli is what this iron age called kali yuga that means dark dark natured so one day once this parikshit was in the course of his tour he found when he was coming back after conquering different countries she saw that one kohli one call him is one bad guy one one bad king uh sporting the insignifica insignia of a man of a royal cast as if he's a royal king but torturing the innocent this cow and bull by kicking them means they are innocent animals even they are troubling them seeing that pariksit inflicted severe punishments on kohli now show naka said why did parikshit in place of killing kali inflict only some punishment on him he was really a man of sudden characteristics they say this is the india they are not saying he is a sudra he has a shudra characteristic character characteristic we are all brahman but we sometimes take the characteristic of a brahmin nature sometimes shatter your nature sometimes means business mentality sometimes the cast of menial workers cast forecast indian societies brahman the priestly cap those who learn scriptures and vedanta and all this brahmin kshatriya the warrior class who protects the country from evil that like arjuna they are reading about and basha the society is people who are very skilled in doing proper perfect business not that all business skill a business skill is with everyone so this is the action and then sudra is the class who does most of the menial things to keep the keep the society living alive if there is no carpenter or if there is no builder then where will you leave they are also integral part of the society but the characteristic is there inside the man's nature so they are talking about the nature not the person the same person being born in a in a brahmin family he may be of the characteristic of sudra that means his his brahminic character is not developed so he's talking about that he was a really man of sudra characteristics though he was dressed as one of the royal cast that means he was supposing he is a royal king that means next class brahmin is the highest class shot is the second class third class is should brown bash business and sudra sutra is the lower rank rung of the societies as regards the societies you can say the development of the intellect brahma means they develop their intellect that's why they are poor always because they are not money they don't go for earning much they engage themselves in the study of the vedanta scriptures and all these no so they live more for god and god consciousness that's why they are the highest next to keep these good people you need a king who can really protect the interest of the good people that's why next best is the royal kings third the king will be there but if there is no business transaction inside the country will be without money no so that's why the next is the business class brahmin and sudra is the class who beats the construction and everything road building and everything what is needed for our livelihood they contribute to that so then that they fall in the same category should throw an outcome awesome so but this king kali he was dressed like a king that means in the second rank but behaving like a lowest rank sudra so he was really a man of sudra characteristics though he was dressed as one of the royal cast otherwise why would he kick and torture a cow speak to us about it if it brings from the story of krishna or has reference to any great devotee whose delight is his service oh dear one what is the use of other vein talks they are only means for killing time for man's life is short and he must utilize the short time to work for the attainment of mukti so the god of death has been invoked by mantras at the sacrificial rights and so long as he is held up here during the sacrifice no one is likely to die the great sacrificial priests have indeed invoked the presence of god of death here so that he too may listen to this great exposition of the lord's excellencies therefore let more discourses on this subject be given be which the nectar of divine excellencies will flood the world alas the diluted and short-sighted man spends the brief span of his life in vain happy in sleep at night and the rest in vain action that have no reference to the lord once in this life we spend how mandassa and understanding is dal they only mundo ayusha and their life is also dull because they spend the life in nitria riyadh naktam whole night they sleep hours and hours 10 hours 12 hours sleeping and rest of the 10 to 12 hours in the daytime eating sleeping and doing mundane tall mundane talk mundane things monday new wastage this light day every day goes away like that it's uselessly worthlessly they spend that time therefore it is better to hear what happened to this girly and why he was what he was doing what is the bad character so that we learn out of that verse number 10 suta the narrator then started responding when the great warrior parikshith heard the unpleasant news that the evil spirit of kali had entered the land of guru and jungle that was under the protection of his government he took up arms to confront him seated on his well-embellished chariot drawn by swarthi horses and mutbery flag with the motive of a lion he started from the capital on his victory march to the surrounding countries with his army having the four divisions of chariot cavalry elephant division and infantry he's saying that all is soldiers divided into four categories then those who walk on the foot the fight with the horses over some fight in the what you call the elephant sitting on the elephant in early days fight was like that now you don't need anything you send one drone and he will find you here and there and go and bomb so really that was a man-to-man war you fight with me there was strength to strength but that was old style and that is the way this the pariksit went when he heard that there is a bad king like that so he wanted to fight with him he established his way over countries like badraswa these names are we do not know anything these are all changed he went to different countries and the name have been given one two three four five and others five six countries name has been given as he he went and conquered them now and received tribute from the rulers of this country so they become friendly okay so i am your friend so so you also come into my car my country yeah and attend to the ceremony as he proceeded he heard persons singing fenugreeks on his great ancestors conveying the glory of krishna so they are praising krsna's glory because they know that is krsna's lineage also on how by krsna's grace his own life was saved from the destruction after astamas brahma michael this is a past story when he was born in the mother's womb so that one missile was sent by um and that was protected the krishna saved the baby by with exerting some weapon how there was great friendship between pandavas and bushness and how they all were deeply devoted to krishna these songs delighted pariksit and highly pleased with their singers he gave them liberal presence consisting of money clothes necklaces etc but it was overcome with devotion to krishna when he heard of the lord's loving solid solicitude for the devotees the pandavas of how he worked for them as chadwicker secretary servants friend messenger protector glorifier and subordinate as also of how the whole world honored him so parikh sith was very happy visiting different countries and their respect the heart that they are so grateful to bhagavan krishna because his presence give them the freedom from all types of this negative impact of bad people so and parish it was very happy and he was very grateful okay okay so we end here after verse number 16 of chapter 1 chapter 16 of the book number one book 1 16 chapter and you know i do not know i am not exploring all these beautiful stories each story is beautiful uh what happened why is the one word we read only the parikshet was overcome with devotion to krishna why when he heard the lord's loving solicitude for devotees the pandavas and how he worked for them as a charioteer etc and how he was protected by krishna one word protected by krishna there's a big story behind hurry [Music] okay modern machines okay we'll we'll read the next week this verse number 17 okay now there is some question for few minutes um [Music] sri did parikshit practice renunciation like his saw juno the part of us did he think of spirituality only after he was beaten by snake i think he was born with this infinite character gold wonderful spiritual and and he was born in that infinite spiritual atmosphere so he had it but it became triggered when that ultimate otherwise how suppose if someone says to a king that you will die within seven days by a snake bite will the president of the united states be fearful that one snake will bite me after seven days so let me give up everything and become a monk will any country any king will do that that is not that's why he has his spiritual nature that's why he's for justice he's for truth just to be read now and they went to the different countries when he's listening to the glory of krishna he's getting overwhelmed and he's becoming respectful that was his heart was full of that so i think that he had his innate nature but it kindled up when renunciation see how much inner potential was there only a king like the king of india no he is fearful about he cannot protect himself in a room from snake no he did not [Music] killed understand but i am saying that in the kingdom he is in a he has accepted that and he was in the middle of the congregation and he was lying there and that time that incident happened that he came and in the form of another person anyhow so but the point what i am to emphasize that the politician had his great spiritual insight otherwise when he heard that this uh he will be beaten by the yeah by within seven days he gave up all his kingdom and all responsibilities and then just detached from everything and just wanted to hear about krishna and his life's glory you know and spending day and night in krishna consciousness you know and that is the way he left and sukadeva came there the great renunciate and he deliberated this bhagavat there so it seems that he has his naturally he had that often in spiritual scriptures the word dharma is used but not in a vague sense of righteousness does dharma mean loading life such a way that will help one to realize the divine angry dharma means that dharma is a word man to dream is which holds which holds a person the dharma means that which holds a person of character righteousness truthfulness honesty these are but there is highest dharma ramakrishna said dharma is highest dharma is god realization lower dharma is also there that you become honest you become truthful you become a good citizen in the country you be helping to other these are the this is also dharma that's why dharma is a word it can be used in different level of understanding so it may be a charitable person it may be a good person but dharma does not mean only that dharma means highest dharma is who is dedicated to god realization or knowing the self who am i that is the real dharma okay so we end here then and we'll see you then again in the next class at 7 30 with shanti gita the gita peace song song of peace peace you
