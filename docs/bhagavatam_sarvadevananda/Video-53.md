[Bhagavatam - 3.10.10 - 3.12.20 ( Book 3, Chapter 10 verse 10)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gFFAD_cWCyU)

foreign [Music] [Music] the darling of her mother devaki the guru of the world and the lord of the universe We Salute him again and again on peace peace peace be and trustful so we are on page 186 of the bhagavatam and that is the book Number 3 chapter 10 and we are reading verse number 10 will start today this portion we are reading is bijura the earnest Seeker was asking the material the says Rishi the sage betrayal about the question how this world created what is Brahman and how for the first creation came in time what is time in time it happened what is the definition of time and various questions so this with the sage material is responding to these questions one by one sometimes it is very um detailed we may not be able to interested in them so today the the question asking about what is called time T capital so bituro said you spoke of time this is an aspect of the Lord hurry who's multifarious forms and supportive activities are so unique God's montefarious acts and these supportive activities are in Munich and you spoke about the time which is an aspect of the Lord so now describe O Holy person O Holy One please describe all about it to us tell me about all what I have to know about time the capital time small time there is a time Capital time is eternal mahakala Lord Shiva another aspect no change unchanging time and another is the time in which we are living the time is changing clicking every second now so the whole universe is run by the time so tell me about what is the secrets of time they see Metro disease responding to the question of bidura the time in itself is without any modification real time has no change in this time is a change it is 4 30 already 4 35. 35 4 next few seconds it is always changing now so but real time time is itself without any modification and in substantial it has no beginning and end we do not know this entire you know everything is happening in time no Cosmic time uh see the sun was in his orbit big sun came and near our sun no and because of the pool gravitational pull some chunks have come out by that time the big son is gone somewhere so it is happening in time one million year before 10 million years before that that is we we count time in that range but but real time is an irritisation and real time is without any modification there is no change in it and without any beginning of that time that time has no beginning and that time is equal to Brahman almost but it gets a form or expression when it causes the stunning of the gunas in time the trigunas prakiti shaktaraja San Thomas in time they get Charmed and in time that gets little Disturbed as it was stirred and then beginning of a creative cycle starts it forms the basis for the Supreme Being for a sport of creative manifestation so this time gives a scope where this thing will happen and that thing will happen and that thing will happen so the Divine Lords play will happen that's why it gives a scope so that in time the creation will go on like that and then they need The Rescuer to come so Lord God will come down as a human being as a human Force like Krishna Rama like that and then they will give the Boost into the mind of those people and they will get elevated so it forms the basis of the Supreme Being for a sport capital and creative manifestation when at the end of The Cosmic cycle Lord's power Vishnu Maya has absorbed the whole universe into himself it is the Indian concept of creation is evolution and involution so now it is evolved and again at the time of Destruction it involves it does not go anywhere but it is absorbed in a subtler way final way so he absorbed the whole universe in himself it is with time the unobservable and the insubstantial that the Lord of all ishara bring all entities into existence as a separate manifestation once again so when the end of the cosmic cycle the Lord's power the power God has power with that power he creates with that power he absorbs within and that power he plays in that room so that power the Lord's power Vishnu Maya it is called Vishnu Maya vishnu's Maya Vishnu Maya is the power has absorbed the whole universe into himself so as a Vishnu Maya vishnu's Man play business power is manifesting in everywhere also means which everywhere which pervades everywhere that's the Sanskrit words meaning so the Lord of all so and that is it is within time it happens and that time is unobservable time in substance time goes in a unmanifest way now now he's got talking about verse number 13 to 17 9 bishargas I we are not much interested in it malign this organ is division of 24 Cosmic principle they divide it in different way and they say these are the nine division of the 24 Cosmic principle so we just can go over it and there also boy boy kriti creation the creation of Brahma so this is also I have read but it is very how the Lord created this universe and the description is there the distribute to raja's quality of the Lord this creation has been done and there this is the seventh aspect of creation is beginning into existence of the six types of unmoving we have created all moving beings then he created moving beings like that so I am skipping those areas there's not much interesting but last just the species of the Gods and superhuman agencies they are also created out of God's Will and there are there are different they are different levels the gods are there poor fathers area is there ashurras are there gandhar was said dancing singing playing of existence is there different flights of existence that it all created by God and God is the material and instrumental cause of of everything of the none other than himself that's actually the God has become this whatever we see whatever we feel in this level in higher level than final level wherever you go it is the same God manifesting now oh it is like that next third book 11th chapter the 10th chapter ended like that discussing about that 11th chapter is also will be not much attractive for us because it is I don't want to enter after reading vedanta all this creation and its Division and its name and what has happened ultimately vedanta says all are your mental creations yeah you are with your eyes open that's why you see this universe you close this eyes this connection with the world goes you come in your mental world no and mental World also goes when you go to sleep no so these are all in time it happens due to Maya and when you raise your mind from one Consciousness to the another Consciousness another realm of world appears and when you go beyond Maya we do not know it's called Brahman but we know every day when you go not Beyond Maya that mind is become dysfunctional sleep the most enjoyable time for all of us if we can go to good sleep a perfect peace no and where is this universe so all this talking about time this is that everything vanishes is not in dream there is time also here now time is there of course already 10 minutes past 10 15 minutes past no here is time your time is there when you are in a dream world but when you go to sleep at least to you there is no real time because mind is not functional so we vedanta always listening this and now thinking why this creation and how this creation has happened and how time has come into it how did he many animals become developed into humans or these plans to animal life so this details is no more very interesting for at least me yeah that's why we will skip such areas that's the way so now this chapter 11 chapter 11 chapter book 3 11 chapter and just starting with verse 1. so it is talking about the division now now the time Big Time now the division of time what is the division of time and how many divisions are there yeah we will be interested in Italy I lead one there it is said that 15 logos make one nadika 24 minutes and two such nadika and nadikas means six or sevens as nadikas make the prahara right these are different divisions of time in ancient time we have only minute what is the our division is what our division is seconds is it not so you can go this way but on holidays they give name of each division so so therefore one pole is equal to four third of a Tula and all these seers okay so let us go then they are talking about four yogas that we may be little interested let me see what it says page 190 the four sugars verse number 16 bidura said you have spoken to me about the lifespan of a person man you have spoken me the life of a petri between those living the father's plane after death people go to call the poor father's plane they are there is a belief that if you after death you can go and meet them all if you want you're very much fascinated with your family members and someone dies early someone does late but there is a plan prayer thinking of them you after that your mind moves into that plane oh many many lives you can see your grandpa grandfather Grand Grandpa all are in the subtle body living there but this life is coming if you see this life's father his father his father yeah it is plain then they say billions of people like that all are related we came from one family you know this this modern idea is that we all came from Africa we both from same gene no we had that's the concept is coming we are from the root is one and we have by diverse treatment so also there will be all this fathers poor fathers suppose you are a musician you will go to the gandhar baloka the plane where all the musicians oh all the musicians are together they're playing Fruit and drama and these and that music so that is another word no so he's talking about different planes and different heights are there so he says four yogas for fours are what you have spoken me about the lifespan of men that lifespan of Ministries yeah human life is normally 100 years roughly a little more little less now and pictures they live they also live 100 years but their hundred years means long time there one day is our one year relative they live in a final one that's the concept you need not to believe these are all Hindu Concepts the stages described about that after death you go to your forefathers plane if you have to live 100 years means how many days that hundred one day is one year hour one year 365 days ago they only will feel it is only one day for them now our one year will be 365 days there will be only there 365 days is will be how big is a quantity one day equal to one year see that period of time you will live there in the subtle body as you go to final plane you will be living longer there in that plane and after finishing that you have to come back to again human plane that's why realize God here and now otherwise if most problem is there if you go to any higher plane you get stuck there for a longer period no so they are all included in the universe tell me about the highly evolved Souls who are beyond the universe of the three words so three words Beyond three words those who leave tell me about how what is their time concept and anything and all knowing person like you oh my prayer you know everything about time great men have that yogic Vision before which everything is clear so you are a yogi you are a Rishi you you know everything before your vision what is time and now what is the time of the final level or this existence in the material plane in our plane and then say heaven and this interspace and go tell me about what is beyond them that is said that that is called are the four ages Hindu division we call Golden Age as the Dharma and all these Noble virtues full in everyone is honest everyone is truthful no one harms anyone they are morals are very high they are they they're very high standard Purity in their life so that is everything is perfect but as the time passes here their quality is declined decline one fourth is lost in the next age they call treta and then another 25 percent of morality values decline decline then it becomes and now Kohli Kohli will be there the three all the good qualities 90 75 percent of the qualities are gone only 25 percent of good qualities Noble qualities remain in the heart of people that means among hundreds and thousands only few people will be virtuous and yeah truthful honest and will be surrounded by only people who are cheat and they are all liars not the character not pure character yeah so all types of violence this is called the division of age so we are now going to college yeah so we are in a bad time but but he says that poor sugars foreign thousand Divine years one Divine day being the 365 days of men anyhow so our 360 is a 365 days of men is equal to 12 000 Divine years one Divine year those together together means the whole range of satyajuga Plus foreign all this it is only those these together with their saundis and angsha cover 12 000 Divine years these are called twelve thousand Divine years what is one Divine Divine year one Divine year one Divine day being 365 days of men the duration of the food Rivers beginning with Satya I said to be 4800 3600 2400 and 1200 Divine years respectively it take total of how many four point four three eight zero zero zero zero so many years can you imagine that much period will be of human year our we live only 100 years here uh what is six zeros means how much million the 4 million 38 380 380 000 4 million 380 000 years that much here one that's one Divine year and for us we are only our lifetime is only one themselves so many human years will create that Divine ears to know much the theoreticians of time have given the name the juga to the middle period between the Sunday and the ansha yesterday so do you understand time it's very difficult time is a relative thing we understand so but he's saying that those we think that going to heaven is good even is not good because we go to heaven then you will have to live so many years of Human by human years our one lifetime is so difficult no 100 years right and there will be four million three hundred eighty uh A Thousand Years lifetime how to Lifetime that yoga plus all these yugas added together will be this much expense Baba Brahma creates and he rules there also will be huge calculation are you interested then put it let us go to vedanta easily then he said pararta half lifetime of Brahma Brahma rules one one period of creation no so is another time division of time what is that that time is called the real life of the present Brahma is now over and the second was known half the lifetime of Brahma is called paragu the whole lifetime of Brahma he divided half then half is called Paratha this first of the life of the present Brahma is now over and the second is on so now Brahma has crossed his 50 years life he has stepped into 50 first birthday so so what to understand of all these calculation of time that means this much is to understood time is infinite ah calculation of Time Event makes you wonder about this creation and to understand this creation is difficult when it is created how it is created you are talking about yeah also scientifically how much they say the creation of the universe and this and that all in many hyperbolic numbers we cannot just see how much tend to devour 1900 200 500 goddowns how much it is endless the time in his creation destruction is going on and on in the cosmic level we look at the stars and galaxies you read astronomy that is astronomical that's why that calculation is astronomical so they are also talking about the same absolute time is astronomical and in that there are division which is also impossible for us to gaze and understand and he who creates this how long he lives he lives more than the creation no say someone builds a house if the house takes to build up say some time the person who will live in the house it will take longer so simulate the world is created and the Creator is lives much longer that means infinite cannot be made any limitation so that idea so we move to the next chapter foreign let me see why what there it goes it is called third book chapter 12. and we are reading the first one let me see what the question whether we are interested page 193. brahma's dissatisfaction with the creation of evil and now he created everything but in this creation there will be unto rajas and Thomas will come so evil will come good will come and bad will come no anything you create absolute good you cannot create no there will be some anything you do that is good for the good of everyone you can do but there will be some little evil involved into it no you want to give Feast to so many hungry people good fist so you can now punctuous food so you bring some chicken you bring some fish and you give some it's not he's not doing bad we're feeding the people but you are killing so many chicken and so many fish how what will you do about that we think I am vegetarian I am taking good I don't take I don't hurt anyone no Baba you are hurting ten thousand twenty thousand uh grains in your lunch or 100 not maybe one thousand whatever so you are eating those could have been sprouted and they could have lived their life they have a plant life and they would have you kill them and boil them and kill them so you cannot stop absolute good you cannot do anywhere wherever you do something there is something new in that sense so here Brahma created so also brahma's dissatisfaction happened because he found that something is wrong in its creation is again the teacher he is talking to udhava but he says I am now described to you the Lord's power but is called time so long I have described now here how Brahma proceeds with the work of creation he created at first five modifications of ignorance ignorance has five modification according to this bhakti book we are reading where is bhakti in ignorance that's true because we are ignorant that's why you want to get out of ignorance we pray and we pray do Japan all these things but anyhow let us see what he says now here how Brahma to see proceeds with the work of creation how he started this creation he created at first five modification of ignorance these are called Thomas not having knowledge of One's Own nature that's the one ingredient first everyone is full of Consciousness and knowledge no so first put that in the movie Hall as I give the example you want to see the movie you enter into the movie Hall and you are talking to each other and very joyful cheerful matching some popcorn on this and that and enjoying the discussion and suddenly whatevers the switch is off light goes down no so first part is ignorance that's why he said Thomas he created the first modification of the ignorance these are called the Thomas Miss Darkness ignorance not having knowledge of one another's nature one's own nature immediately immediately forget about Focus you that you have come here in the hall is just for a fun and now the darkness or ignorance comes and builds it one point second moha the association of the sense of I with the body attachment no more means more means delusion forgetting life second point delusion what is delusion money clingingness I am attached attached to this limited body or attached to the what is projection coming I am getting a test that projection comes and falls on the screen and we focus on the creation and myself so it is the second point is means you explain what is Maha Association of the sense of I with the body I am the body third great attachment great delusion what is that Keen desire for enjoyment you have this then I think I will have to have it I will have to eat I'll have to see I have to feel I don't experience all types of Desire now craving no you can compare it to a movie very easily you have no attachment to anything you sat alone but first you forget yourself then your focus goes on something on the screen and then you get identified with that you are getting identified with that out of So many actors and actresses playing you will be connected with one emotionally and what is happening with that guy it is becoming your pain or your smile or your joy you are your suffering it happens in the movie no we work in that way so this is the movie God's movie so he says first Thomas second is the moha delusion third is the Muhammad then desire to enjoy our experience then Thomas said the fourth anger at the obstruction of enjoyment I want something and someone comes in between yeah we get angry that's why even in the movie if you see that you are someone is being tortured or being you your anger also it's not just giving blow to that person also no it is happening in the movie but your Maha great identification with the people who don't like Therefore your anger is coming under Thomas feeling of total loss of oneself in the loss of objects of endearment then you say you are totally lost people get to depression frustration when they wanted to get something being angry these that but nothing happened it's a good thus no life people go to commentary side even though what does it mean the meaninglessness comes there so these are the five divisions of and create five modification of ignorance it's good to think about that you can understand that how we get Brahma got deleted so we'll say he created at first this modifications the ignorance is one important factor Thomas and with the Thomas knowledge they forget when Thomas comes I forget I am Divine I am pure so I'm totally forgetful about my nature second comes moha it association with your senses of our eye with the body connects I connect here now forget my real nature and connect with the body second third Muhammad for the body form did then to see something to hear something to eat something to test something to touch something you know so the desire comes and then desires I want to have that fourth I want to do but someone is standing in the way we become angry that is the Thomas anger at the obstruction of what I want to enjoy and then all the time is through feeling of total loss oneself and then the loss of object of the individ Define as trying to get it and tried my best and I failed to do that people always go into deep depression so these are the five Brahma felt dissatisfied with himself for having brought into existence this sinful creation he is said I my God I wanted to create a beautiful world and I have created this problematic world today everyone is now forgetting their own self no look at how many 80 billion now 8 billion people forget about own reality who knows I am Brahman I am pure everyone forgot and what you are thinking I am this body then body means I want to enjoy this eat this sea do whatever five senses can give me with the mind and then after that someone is not giving me that becoming a barrier and then I become angry and to get out of that and lastly not getting anything they get frustrated seeing this creation what Brahma already did he got frustrated oh my God what did I do so therefore Brahma felt dissatisfied with himself with himself for having brought into existence these sinful creatures that means the whole creation is creation means you are incomplete no you want to get satisfaction from outside so Brahma creating this he understood what a mistake I did now what to do now fourth verse creation of they need to do I need to find something how these people can get out you create the trouble and then formulate how how to get out we have asked you to create and now we are trying to get out but you know creation is like that when you when you enter into creation people are very happy when they enter into creation and get stuck there and now to get out that's why he created some Sages that so he brought into being the four Sages and their names are sanaka one one to Tardis sanatana and 40 sanat Kumar who were contemplative established in the Atman consciousness and these unbroken continuous unbroken continences they are pure Souls they didn't fall into the Trap Brahma created this trap but these people didn't so they are more contemplative and they remain in their own identification in the nature of the divine nature the getting absorbed there Untouched by anything of the world or this creative forces he then said to these offsprings o children because he had generated them but he has given the Thomas but they didn't come into the fold of Thomas because they were so much contemplative inside so they don't get affected by that then this Brahma said oh oh my children generate more and more offsprings so that this this counteracting the other obstacles which people will suffer and go to depression and death frustration and name so o children generate more and more offsprings but being devoted to spiritual disciplines and established in total surrender to vasudeva they are efforts to do that they are getting Joy of samadhi why they will go for this problems of enjoying to seeing something little hearing something good five senses gives us joy but how much joy a little little but they are engaged to this Rishi kumars engaged in that samadhi why they will be interested in it so they are not feeling connected with that so but being devoted to spiritual disciplines and established in total surrendered Lord bishvasudeva they were average to do so Brahma felt insulted I am ordering you you are my child I created you you don't listen to me so he got angry this is purana so this is these things will happen this mix is more enjoyable he felt his or he tried to control the unwearable anger he felt on account of this though he tried to control it but it by his discriminative faculty it came bursting out from the middle of brahma's brows as a boy with a mixed complexion of blue and red these are got it he got frustrated that these four Rishi kumars they don't yield they say okay you go and make more of your children so that these people who are in total darkness they will get way to come back but they are not interested and being ignored then Brahma got mad and now he wanted to control his anger but still anger created something fire something came out from here and that created the boy which is up what is called brahma's browse as a boy with a mixed complexion of blue and red let us see what is that blue and red eight verse on page 193 these ones bhagavan rudra the first term the deities to be born so he wanted the rishikes to solve the problem of the creation but they they didn't yield to it so anger came and he just don't want to show that anger or Express the tongue but still it came up and that when the eyebrows came a boy with her complexion like blue and half red and that is he who wrote draw the Shiva so he cried out oh Father of the world give me names and places of residence according to his ascending to his request Brahma said do not cry out all you ask will be given who first among the deities as you cried like a frightened boy people will call you rudra so your name will be rudra rudra means you know rudram is one who makes you cry because after creation you cried out and said give me protection he said O Father of the world give me names and places of residence voice give me a name I am a created being what is my name where shall I stay and he cried out like that Ascend into his request Brahma said do not cry out all you ask will be given you first you are the first among the gods that is Shiva is the God first God rudra does we find the name rudra rudra means he makes us cry means the experience of life let us not overwhelm it we want to get out of it that's why to feel disgusted and it becomes unbearable so that's the cry what is used here as you cried like a frightened boy people will call you rudra I have assigned you to you even before asking the following 11 places as your seat so you want it where will you stay you are born in my in from my forehead and you are saying your name I give your name rudra and where you lose why you sit where it will stay you will stay 11 places I am giving you 11 places your choice you can sometimes stay here they are they are there or you can stay at your time always what are the 11 places heart the senses The Prana this Prana the five elements earth water air fire Sun the moon and in austerity so you know while rudra lives rudra lives in the heart that's why everyone feels pain where in the heart it is and and the senses whenever sense organs are active and there you feel the absence of not achieving or achieving whatever that is the power of rudra The Prana in The Prana is the rudra and five elements rudra so heart senses Prana five elements the Sun the moon and Tapas so hello 11. heart senses and pranut tree and five elements eight then Sun Moon and Tapas eleven so eleven dresses you will have as names you will have names also you did I give you one name but you will have many names what are the names how many names big names he says your name will be Manu mahinasa Mahana Shiva Rita oh gloritas and as wives I give you the British um all these the god in different names and their wives accept these names these seeds and these wives and go on multiplying issuing and be progenitor without parallel commented thus by the father Brahma rudra began to generate offsprings equal to him in strength form and nature so he created his children offsprings and the power of rudra his own power and almost of their same strength same form and same nature the creation of rudra soon became so numerous and their aggressiveness became so threatening that Brahma became very much concerned at the situation so wherever he would create something see the trouble come he created the ordinary people and then he said oh they they are all Thomas and ignorance and all these things what he says [Music] that is bad so he wanted to create something in this don't agree and then he wanted to feed the rudra and rudra he gave the first day what is my name he has given so many names and so many places to stay and then and their wives also created so now you create yourself so he said all Shiva nature will be created everywhere but they become so many and so arrogant then again Brahma said my God what did I do see the problem of creation is this to go back to home that is the safest place vedant is the safest place okay so soon become so numerous and their aggressiveness becomes so threatening that Brahma became very much concerned at this situation so he said to rudra O best of the deities enough of these creations of yours they are ferocious look threatens to burn everything in all directions including myself I am also getting frightened to see my creation therefore you do now austerity tacos it will be for your own good and for the welfare of the World by Tapas you will obtain the power to create the world anew you will get the power by your topic time idea is that you can achieve everything by austerity and spiritual practice so you now start doing tapasa the by taposi will obtain all the power to create a new world a new world no It Is by Tapas that only one quickly attends to the Supreme Being the light of Lights who dwells in the hearts of all but is beyond the cane of the senses so maitra said being thus ordered by Brahma rudra says say yes and circumembling him the Lord of Saraswati and uh uh a map being thus ordered by Brahma root draw says yes and circum emulated Brahma the Lord of as the Lord of Saraswati and went away to the wood of pathaks so then he went to tapas austerity so it is interesting certain places but if you have time then you can read I have skipped about maybe 40 50 verses because these are we will not be able to enjoy them because we are not familiar with those terminology this division of Time how they in the pants and time they did but this much is at least understandable this last part so creation he did and creating creation he felt Disturbed then he asked truth about may have done enough now now do and do meditation and pray no so by that that you will get the energy in a new a new new power of creation because when you get back to tapasa that we have purified without without austerity what you get you can recklessly use it is it not someone gave some money who gets good entire big property and big uh funding Etc from the father assets and things this these children don't try to learn anything and nothing but who have to do with austerity they learn and they their value they can value others and can value also his own wisdom so that is the last word Brahma said you did enough now you go for austerity and by that you will be able to have your own strength grown and you will have the capacity to recreate and that creation will be not disastrous so this is the verse number where he ended for your reference it is book number three chapter number 12 3 12 20. we ended at 3 12 20. we'll start from 21 next time yeah to the nation is here so we don't get it okay here's the question how do one know if he she has gone beyond Maya or is it not possible to know yes if you go beyond my eye you will know first because then this world will not appear the moment disappearing now you will see as upanishad says you will see foreign Consciousness which permits everywhere he will see as fire becoming one but it takes different color with your different objects which it burns you can see they put some salt into the fire it color is wanted you put some oil into the fire you put some firewood it is one one type of firewood another type of fire would know so it takes different color but fire is the same similarly when one knows the Lord what you'll see one everywhere though different divisions may be there they will see the diversity at the same time Oneness that is an experience so when when going Beyond Maya means Beyond ignorance this Multiplicity will no one be very obstructive to his knowledge his knowledge will be there of the Oneness he sees that Oneness ramakrishna say I see God he will feel the presence himself everywhere that's why they remain in absolute Joy all the time he always swims in absolute bliss all the time because he sees it all that that has sweetness that's all sachidan on the self only in different costumes and different shapes and sizes so that is the beauty that that time when one goes beyond Maya they will feel like that gradually gradually Vision will change apparent body will be same as we see only the body we are seeing you all different in different bodies you everyone's eyes are little different nose is different and I am seeing that only I don't see any how what is behind but they will see the Consciousness behind you Atman the full notion of like the wave the city how we see only the wave but the knowledge to knowledge of the water all water everywhere water only this way this way waves had different names and forms are different but con see they see with the destruction of the ignorance that experience will remain okay so all right when m is heavily when you dream of me m says yes and it's okay no God Alone is there and then after that he says you're a follower attractive and after that conversation about the dream but I don't understand why suddenly he says that it seems kind of out of the blue and then later he's coming back from the Pine Grove and M is meditating there and he says oh you are here and they talk about it m says Master reminded him of his idea he said remember what we talked about the other day I told you your ideal and the master told him the ideal again is he referring to that conversation the ideal being Shakti because I am like the formulas right and then so in those early level why is the difference so team is manifestation what is manifested they don't see as matter their matter the the division between the matter and the spirit is dissolved for us it is matter is matter we are thinking spirit is something else how much we talk about but when that type of experience will happen around my Master's Grace it happens it is really short anything in the waveform it is a Shakti otherwise it is ocean why it will be formed so you are Shakti means when you see in the dream meaning mind is very much lifted in the higher level and that even you are lifted in the higher level that living mind is there that mind is manifestation of the otherwise there will be no name and form to see and seeing ramakrishna is a really and a very auspicious thing because mind must be extremely pure otherwise it does not come that's why they may dream when he saw that means that is a higher level of his presence and monsters saying see it is God only Shakti is only the same reality in the manifestation level right sure no more question anything okay so we'll see you then again 7 30 for our Santi Gita class it is coming to an end soon then we are thinking that we will read something else so I can get some suggestions later on that I have something in my mind I will tell that after a year the your suggestions thoughtful suggestion I have never studied that much you know more spiritual okay let me finish this [Music] your point is that when you want to really um practice it should be 1.8 and so how of course mature person can bring and
