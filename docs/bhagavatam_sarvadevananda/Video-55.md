[Bhagavatam - 3.14.1 - 3.15.31 ( Book 3, Chapter 14 verse 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVkxo34pQBA)

foreign daughter and son of devaki the guru of the world and the teacher of the whole universe boom peace peace peace so we read the other day that and uh our first Incarnation our Incarnation came as boor which is the causal bore and he uplifted the whole Earth by his task and save the world so hearing that the sukhdeva said to bidura who was holy David who was wholly devoted to spiritual disciplines was not satisfied by hearing mystery's account of srihari's incarnation as the causal bore ham and therefore questioned him again with respectful salutation this is chapter 14 of book number 3 chapter 13 14 and verse 1. so then sukhdev said oh great says who is this age Metro oh great says my true we have understood from your account that hiran naksha the first of all Titans the actors was destroyed by srihudi sihori who is the embodiment of all jagga it's called foreign foreign the embodiment of all the homophiers the people do that result end result of that jugna is not narayana so if narayana came down in the form of boor that is the barahu Avatar incarnation when to help preserve the good so with the tasks this they uplifted the whole Earth and what was the reason for such conflict between the Titan and chivalry and many question coming do we have understood from your account obedura that hiran naksha the first of all Titans writers was destroyed by huri with the embodiment of all jugnas but what caused this fight foreign did this thing so he said that was destroyed by the embodiment of what was the reason for such a conflict between the Titan the date and the Lord who lifted the Earth with his task as if in sport so the Metro then the sage was very pleased and he congratulated this question and wanted to explain it said I congratulate you obedura and putting this very good question which relates to Lord hear his incarnation by hearing account of which man is enabled to overcome the bondage of death inflicting sanction so by listening this the people in the world were under the ignorance and they'll be their mind will be purified by hearing that glory of the Lord Lord kill that here on the show the debit Lord I can they have translated not the village Titan titans and greatness it was by hearing SRI narada's this Hymn of srihari's attributes that the son of uttan of other dhruva was able as it were to kick away death and that end to the state of Lord huri so hearing the glory which see Narada praised about Lord narayana hearing that druva was able to get out of the cycle of birth and death and yet in the state of in the plane of srihari his mind Rose into the height so now this is his response from my tree the sage now verse number 6 to 28 this 22 verses which are continually describing how the DT and Oddity that the two daughters no Brahma so Brahma created them fast so how dated and approached the casa Passage to have some proceeding because God gave him the created to fill the world with his children so how he approached that description is now coming it is simply it's elaborated too much money with detail what happened so about the subject on hand there is a tradition which I have heard from Brahma when he narrated it to the Gods it seems diti the daughter of the daksa prajapati desires of progeny and approached her husband and at that time cast of raised the sage kasaba was the husband of diti and did you as the daughter of daksha prajapati so he wanted some child so he approached her husband but then after that there is a total description and the child was then they uh have their child but it was odd time it was not a good time that was a prayer time of the customer all these odd time odd situation that's why do it was created major foreign so so he said that he um in this way DT got the child out of prajapati out of Kasha anyhow so that in that way so the child was born after that I skipped so many verses this is dual descriptions is too big and because it was this approach of diti foreign is he not in proper time and could not restrain herself so there came some curse so there are certain um just as an impure goal is purified by melting it in fire men will following the example purify their minds and Hearts by abandoning enmity and other passions he whose manifestation this world is he by pleasing whom this whole world is pleased he the Supreme Lord the self-witness will be immensely pleased with him because of his unswerving and one pointed devotion so if one listening to this story gets devotion in the mind so that will be devotional increased more and more for the Supreme Lord God great in his love of God household large-hearted greater than of all great men that person will be will establish the Divine in his heart and purify by practice of a wholehearted and one pointed devotion then he will be able he will be above body Consciousness so that way thinking of God thinking of the Leela of the power of God then your heart will be purified and one pointed and holy devoted to God and by that way he will lose his body consciousness he will have no interest in the worldly enjoyments he will be a seat of good habits and virtues his Joy will consist of seeing other happy and joyous he will share in the sufferings of all he will have no enemies just as the moon gives relief from The Heat Of Summer so will he be a source of relief for all the sufferers from the miseries of life so this this will be that characteristic of the person who is thinking like that said this Con grandson of yours will behold within and without the Lotus eye Lord who is stainless who assumes forms in consonants with the wise wishes of devotees whose face is alone with shining earrings and who is the auspicious marked on the forehead of mother Lakshmi the goddess of auspiciousness our joy to hear that she would have a great tribute as her grandson and being a high-minded lady she took comfort in the knowledge that her two sons would meet their death at the hands of the Lord so God will appear and then this this two children will be born they will be do have the touch of God they will die that means if it is the idea that the hiran naksha and hiran kashibu so they will be killed by God because and why all this episode that is for purification of the heart of the devotees people will listen and hear about the glory of God and God's glory manifesting to them we move to move to 14th chapter all these other descriptions we skip now we come to chapter 15 chapter and 15th chapter talks about hiran naksha and hirana koshibu the cars of the kumaras so what is the schumerous cars yeah let us see what it says so that is this chapter 15 we are starting now third book chapter 15 verse number one I skipped many other verses it is a repetition how they got the child and this and that all this little this there's not much interest for us Metro said afraid of the potential harm to the gods Devas for a hundred years in herself that fetus of fears potency derived from prajapati and possessing a power of aggressive darkness that could efface any brilliance that power of Darkness put at not the Brilliance of the Sun and the Moon illumining the quarters as also of the Guardians of deities who complained about it Brahma the Devas then complained oh all perfecting being you know already of the darkness which has put us to pray I pride nothing is hidden from you who know whose knowledge is not limited by time oh god of God who supported of the world who thou the great creator of the master of all power holders you know the thought of those who live in the past as also in those who are yet to come so salutation to you whose power is knowledge you have assumed this form of power by your Maya salutation to you who taking on the quality of raja's quality has become the cause of the manifold world no defeat overtakes perfect joke is blessed by you and having single-minded Devotion to you who inter penetrates the universe who are both the cause and effect of the world as well as the transcendental reality and to promote the welfare of the God jivas We Salute You We Salute You The Superior of all beings to whom all Fisher offer the attributes of offering being pulled like a cattle by the no stream of The Vedic injunctions so we salute you it is glorification of the Lord I salute you so o great one going to Perpetual Darkness caused by the fetus in deity's womb all Vedic rituals which are Guided by the position of the sun have ceased to perform so everything the world has become full of darkness and things so do something oh Lord to save the world we who seek shelter in you deserve your merciful consideration so the gods were praying to Lord Lara you know for them escape from this deep Darkness now the fetus begotten by Kosovo in diti is developing with ferocity of fire and fuel spreading the Gloom of apprehension all around now maitra said verse number 11 page 210. oh mighty and one Brahma who was the who was addressed by the gods they was replied with a smile to the Devas in Charming Wars Brahma said with this prayer of the gods that Brahma responding Brahma said I have heard your prayers your elder brother my mind born son who is called sanaka and the others who had abundant interest in worldly life from the start could travel all over the universe through the sky once they want to welcome to Maha Vishnu so these four brothers are talking about Kumar sanatana so they didn't cooperate in propagating the creation so they became Monk and renounce it and went around in the whole world so they once they went to boykunta by country where the Lord narayana resides his residential home by Kunta the return to Maha Vishnu and the realm of mahavishna great Lord which is an object of adoration for all all the residents of that rhythm resembling Maha vishnu's himself that there everyone is so pure they look like the Lord himself because the higher plane of existence no the higher plane of exist who can go whose mind becomes pure and tuned to that level of consciousness so therefore whoever is residing there they look like almost pure like Lord Krishna narayana mahavishna himself in appearance had attained to it as a result of the observance of the bhagavata Dharma that means code of devotional disciplines the long time they prayed they did Mantra japa they have chanted they have done worship all these ritualistic worship they become popular and they have raised themselves and stay with thee and that is the concept that we will also say Krishna ramakrishna Krishna Christ loka meaning these are planes of higher finer levels of level where pure Souls by their purity of thinking and day and night of someone is thinking in the form of God as in the form of say Durga so their mind becomes tuned into Durga Consciousness and then they after death of this body they get up and they remain in the Durga Luka Krishna loka Rama loka these are all different planes Durga is there removing all obstacles but you think of Durga so you get the quality of Durga Mata Durga that's not only that when mother one they will go and help you you'll send his a dualistic religion he are not talking about absolute non-dualism it requires question of dualism in the dualism the higher and higher higher higher higher and God's different higher positions and in this do you have to do Duality this tell me this creation will come and all this fight will come so and those who are in the world of Duality we are suffering so what they do then there is divine entities come and bless us and protect us like them so anyhow the the all the residents in the realm on that realm they look resembling like mahabhishna himself had attained to eat this state as a result of the observance of the bhagavata Dharma no one can go to that plane unless they are practicing in their personal life their spirituality they are meditating they are praying like that then that's why it is said that as you think so you become you think of something holy your heart becomes solely and then your ex everything changes your character changes your behavior changes so that is the bhagavatarma without any self-centered motivation they want to love God and then to be tuned to God Consciousness so they think of Vishnu Nara you know and they become like narayana the Supreme being possessed of all powers and auspicious attributes the embodiment of Dharma and the subject of Revelation for The Vedas abides there in the body a pure satta quality without any Touch of rajas for the blessings of his devotees so it is believed that the Lord resides in that higher plane and we call him as Maha Vishnu and he remains there being possessed of all powers and auspicious activities thinking of Lord Vishnu narayana cultivating that quality so we become pure auspicious attribute comes in his life they become the embodiment of Dharma righteousness and the subject of Revelation from The Vedas All The Vedas come spontaneously from them abides in their body and they live in the body shut the quality rajas and Thomas they are for the lower planes but that is a very pure suck the plane there they went where spring where spreads the Woodland of mysterious liberation pull up with shielding trees and then the description of the baikunthaloka what is the beauty of that plane there will be that some Forest and the forest made of trees what type of trees these type of trees in our material plane mango tree give some sweet mango or some fruits trees and some give shade zombies firewood some Sandalwood but in heaven this concept of the heaven they are giving some concept of Heaven there the full of Wee shielding tree there are trees you just say whatever wish anything and it will be happening ramakrishna was visual new tree in the January one is coming because that whoever came to ramakrishna and asked whatever they got their own desired illumination so in the heaven the full love we should link to it you just go and say anything and you get it and over in Blossom as if they were at the state of maksha taken safe as if it is a Liberation Liberation means what I want something and I am there is some obstacle but for them there is no obstacle because of their practice they went to the higher plane Vishnu loka and they are they are satisfied with everything because whatever they want they get it ah but here you want something you have to work hard and even if you work you make it or may not get but the glory of the vehicle is that that whatever you wish it comes true their move about their move about devotees in aerial Vehicles they work in plane aerial vehicle means fish floats in the air they have their vehicle our our vehicle works of course now we can also moving the airspace by your airplanes so but in the body control over there they don't have to make much effort they can go from one to the corner of the other corner by air vehicles within with their family members panned by the winds which bear this stimulating fragrance of flowers blooming on the surface of the legs beautiful Lake flower fruit blooming description of the what is called the heaven heaven description not ordinary heaven heaven of Lord Vishnu in which Lord Vishnu stays in that plane though the environment is sufficient to stimulate the passions in the heart these devotees are oblivious of all that in their absorption in the singing devotional hymns about the Lord though they can satisfy all the physical needs or these sensual desires can be fulfilled but their mind is so pure being in that plane they really enjoy very much they are to listen to The Glory glory of the Lord their singing of the glories of Lord this stotras chanting prayer Vedic mantras they prepared those type of practice that's when the hovering Bee makes its loud and Sonora sound a beautiful idea oh there are hoaring bees making some humming now noise you know as if it were singing the glory of God and now the bees are not only humming but through their humming they are singing the glory of the Lord narayana Lord's Glory even the humming bees are also chanting the name of God huh think about that the chirping of the numerous Birds the pigeons the kakus the crane the chakra these are different varieties of birds the swan the parrot the peacock and the batteries stop for a while as if they were all attending to the bees devotional hymns so everyone is listening to glory of God that means is a description is the description that they are only all auspiciousness is there all praise for God is going on and the devotees who like to live in that consciousness after death they go into that plane it becomes congenial you go to a place where everyone is singing the glories of God he will also feel like doing like that no my pillow is in the mind of course it is in the mind mostly all these experiences are fair ramakrishna is seeing all these things what is happening in his mind he is saying if it's like in the gross I would have seen all the all the priests who are challenging ramakrishna in the dakshinesha they could they won't do if they have seen mother Kali like ramakrishna but ramakrishna is saying not we even now there may be some people who are saying God but I don't see I see the material thing it is only in the mind which mind that pure mind at that how the Purity came you think of God listen to the glories do Japan prayer worship so he's saying the bees are humming all the birds and others they stop Dairy and listening to the whole Glory up and the Lord as it were to the humming sound of the bees it's very poetic Sanskrit we go that will be much more poetic and this poetry great poetry and pretty and other things are what one simple one point you can make it a book how good is your eyes how good your ear how nose is beautiful how your eyebrows are like that how your hair is like that how your hand is like that all description just to keep the mind around the holy Divine Lord numerous varieties of sweet scented garden flowers subordinate themselves to the Holiness of the tulasi leaves ah in the bushnava literature they consider tourism is the holiest of the Holy why to Lucy leave his life by the Lord Nara you know so in the heaven the numerous varieties of sweet scented garden flowers are there any Garden you get authentic flowers here we have beautiful Los Angeles is good for flowers at this or what you call the rows we have many roses but when you get the Roses no fragrance but in heaven it's all full of fragrant roses some varieties of roses and but tulo silip is the its fragrance is divine fragrance so it's subordinates the other figures do the latter be of undefined fragrance seeing that they found people with the Lord who has given Wrath made of wreath made of most important places of his decoration there is the place was covered with a vast number of golden Pavilions studded with precious gems of various kinds residents which could be had to nothing but Devotion to the fill of his srihori the devotee is residence there with their mind immersed in the Krishna was insensitive to the Exquisite charm of the large number of beauties presented there so there are so much Beauty beautiful thing around in the heaven but the devotees who are there to those job after death have gone there in a subtle body they live there huh actually after death they go to heaven no physically no one goes to heaven so because whole life they have thought of God their mind becomes so pure so when they die at the point of death according to that they live in that mental plane and that they're describing that mental plane that is the heaven said the devotees resident there with their mind immersed in Krishna why these they would no one can go there unless they are pure unless they are Satya quality people and rajas quality Thomas quality will live in another area you know a person of activity tremendous activity can you put him to sit down for meditation it is not that plane will not suit his nature so he will be another plane but if the devotees are there they are contemplative they are prayerful they enjoy the glories of the Lord they see the they can see the humming sound of God's name in the bees is more powerful than your fragrant flowers all these types of description to glorify that they become satika that Satya pure Satya people they only can live in that higher plane therefore reflected on its and and their all James started things because it is Lord himself in his Palace you go to a king's Palace what do you see King's sit no it should be gorgeous it will be all costly dwell and Pearl and these and that so therefore reflected on the crystal walls lined with gold it could be seen the unique figure of Sri Devi as if she were sweeping the floor with the plane play Lotus with the play Lotus held in their extended arms while she moves about producing the murmuring sound of the anklets of her feet and this is the sea for whose Grace All Gods and Men live and they there in the heaven mother loves me see the Lakshmi she alone resides there and she is cleaning the sweeping the floor with golden or gem stated brooms this example of all and what people Aspire here and there it is spontaneously everywhere on the banks of the coral bedded Lakes with sparkling and cool water see Devi the mother Lakshmi which worshiping the Lord's image with two sleep and his mother is worshiping with two Salim at the feet of the Lord and this is so gorgeous but it is nothing to Loosely with must um important and costly there which is the symbol of devotion times in these Waters the reflection of our own face with high nose and curly locks and realizes that it is the kiss of the Lord that has imparted all his this beauty to our face that the Lord has kissed mother Lakshmi and her beauty is so big and she can see in the relaxed water all these descriptions are glorifying the greatness of the plane which is called the narayana plane this excreted place uh go the devotees of the Supreme Being to this excreted place go the devotees of the Supreme Being the pure and Immortal ones who have overcome the sway of Jama when we die Jomo takes us to the ground right come to the prison come to the hell but because they have taken shelter in God after death Jama went but let them okay let them go to heaven because they have taken the Holy Name Of God they have become purified so much they have become so much so the JAMA the god of death does not touch them so they're the people who have escaped death Jama so to this Exquisite Place go only okay this devotees who have the Supreme Being devotees of the Supreme Being they are pure and Immortal ones to have overcome this way of Yama the god of death and attained to a state they have attained by that way they have attained to a higher state and then my mind means here here who is talking about my trail is talking but they have reached a state even iMessage they have reached higher state than me their eyes stream with tears and their bodies are covered with horrifications going to the overpowering emotions that we love in them as they Converse among themselves about the deeds and excellences of the Lord they say that when the these um residents of the Vishnu loka by Kunta the Krishna krsna's plane what happens their eyes this devotees they don't want anything else but love for God so therefore their eyes streams with tears and their body gets covered with horrification all joy joy joy out of what because owing to the overpowering emotions by taking the name of Lord listening to his glory they get so much excited due to high spiritual emotions they well up them as they Converse among themselves when when they talk about God within each other think about that what situation is created when ramakrishna is to see a converse with say Vivekananda ramakrishna is talking to the highly evolved sadhus who come and visit so that environment like that in the heaven these people who have done so much good karma and escaped the jaws of death they go into the higher plane and live in that plane with their lord narayana and there when they talk about God their tears roll down in the cheeks their whole body becomes Joy full of joy here stand direct out of Joy whole body thrilled with joy when they are talking about God so much excitement so much peace comes in their mind now what happened now the story is coming the obstruction of the kumaras by The Gatekeepers you know that story a simple story is this but it will talk our pages and pages that description simple story is that these two guys who joy and be Joy they are the Gods in the Palace of the Lord narayana you want to go to meet the president of this country can you go straight to president's room yeah I make appointment and then they get the permission and the gatekeeper then will someone will come take you and then you go inside huh but these four Rishi kumars four Sages Brahma created this poor very highly Noble soul and they did not Brahma said okay go and create the world prajini because it's the world is to be filled with people then he said no sir I cannot do and they renounced and left and these people but they wanted to go to see their narayana and then when you went to narayana these two bodyguards the guards were in the gate and saw that four small boys have come and their suddenly say we want to see the Lord narayana no no you cannot go you have no permission and then once she requested why not we are coming from such that you tell our names then we will allow me but he did two strong Gods sometimes it happens no you go to see somebody their bodyguards will make you a difficult time for entering into the room itself no it happens everywhere it happens so and then the with much request try once twice twice they are not allowing no it is not Lord's Lord is not passing anybody to get in now you come some other time go when they got angry and they cursed what you are obstructing me to go to narayana I curse you and cursive but when the curse came from this poor Sages eternally free Soul they are ever free they are Never Bound into the ignorance Maya autita then he got frightened Jaya they went to their lord narayana and said two poor boys have come their name is this this had their naked boys small boys nothing in their position but they say they will meet you and we said no and then he got mad and he cursed me that you will have to go to be born in the desert again and God and God will come later on so he have cursed me that I will be detroned from the heaven I'll have to go to them maybe Earth and narayana hearing the names he immediately ran like what did you do they are the greatest devotees you have stopped them coming and then went and greeted them and brought him and this joy and Vijay they are stunned what is the matter going on that's the Lord is so gracious and he himself ran to receive them and brought them back and then they then then this Jaya and Vijay are the bodyguards to those gods they requested the Lord oh Lord please please forgive me they are stop discussion I don't want to leave you I want to be always serving you in the heaven no and I have been cursed to go to the Earthly plane please do something and Lord narayana says I cannot do anything you have Disturbed my devotee you go and beg pardon from them if they excuse you then you will be freed then they fail at the feet of these these two big body burned god of the palace they fell at the feet of these four boys and beg their apology but he said no yeah I I what I have said it cannot be undone because established on the truth those who are established in the truth whatever they say that becomes true so it cannot be changed so this is the condition okay then ask for some boom then they say okay there is no other way then then I I can go you'll go but the Lord will have to come make it such that I don't forget God at any point of time even I go anywhere I go to the hell you go to the Earth he will leave some ordinary life give this boom that I don't forget God for a moment so they are then became the hiran action in one Incarnation three in conditions three times so these are the three times Punishment No for one mind or mistake so it is better don't go to heaven they if you do little mistake then punishment is much more more than here be very careful so don't don't be there yes true then then poor guy they only said are the Lord is resting this is not the time come later on and then they cursed him and the thieves to come three times born in the world as a demon because in a demon body he's always thinking God will kill me kill me kill me kill me so you are remembering whom you remember most whom you love who you love you may remember may not remember but you if you get to notice that I will kill you with a gun and someone is always searching for me then you will think of the person more who is who is your name not the person who loves you he may forget now and then and then but he is enemy you cannot forget your enemy no but if somebody said that your head is declared suppose that think of the person who whose head is declared that I want that body head life or Alive or Dead no for one million dollar then what will happen who is who is coming around me all the time you'll say oh my God he's going to kill me he's going to kill me he is going to kill me so it is here it is God so you think of God God God God God God that means not a moment you forget so that is the major theme is coming here there they make the one nine story every 10 20 pages with versus 100 verses and all descriptions our time is our another five ten minutes then let me read as a question with this my God I want to finish the book so today we have I have also read 10 10 pieces today because we skipped the all this description detailed description and we are not in the same age you know we live in the 21st century so the situation the illustrations the incidents are different to relate to that that background it takes little time to consume so observation of the kumaras by The Gatekeepers so the United States Gatekeepers what they did I'll quickly read the lines by their spiritual power the kumarans kumaras means poor kumaras Brahma created them out of their mind mind born as we say brahmananda is the mind-born child of ramakrishna no it is not has nothing to do with the physical but he mentally created them this pure Souls what are the four Brahma created this also four names start with sir he created this four ever pure ever stainless spiritual entity in the human form and there's more room around anywhere in the world for the good of the world and they didn't enter into the life of life into the world to creating the progeny and others so they are free soul so these four three Souls by their spiritual power of kumaras with the Mind brimming with joy once they arrived in the mahabis Imagine they have all they can move anywhere so once they thought let us go to see the Lord Maha Vishnu they have passed as American passport you can go to many countries you don't need any Visa no so this this from four sages have the world pass so wherever they go no one stops them so that they are invincible their movement and everything so they Alam they want went to Maha vishnu's which being above all materials fears that's the concept of is beyond the material plane material plane you can get Earthly enjoyment finer enjoyments and longevity of life I may live hundreds of years without witful youth all these con different planes but it is beyond that a pluralism outshining all these fears which is filled with Mansions of numerous Divine beings and which is a unique Wonder compelling the Adoration of all so the narayana loka is like that and these four Rishi Kumar's mineborn child of Brahma they all plan to go there the kumaras quickly crossed the first six Gates of baikunta there are six Gates of time maybe some philosophical meaning is there maybe six Gates of my country is what sixth plane of consciousness they easily went through that when there is the seventh seventh is here there you meet the Lord they found their two handsome Divine beings of the same age two gods looking at the same age and form armed with Maize and bedoked with valuable ornaments like arm bands and Fish Market earrings Etc in training their bodies and resting on their chest between their four bluish arms was a massive breath of tulasi leaves whose fragrance invited numbers of honeybees to hover about here is beautiful description that they thought honey is a very good thing so honey bees are there and they are hovering around the tourism you have seen tulasi plant and they are hovering around the tallest seeds and to suck some honey from there their face board is somewhat angry look as indicated by their arching bow brows quick breath this distended nostrils and then you see eyes just as they passed to the six Gates made of gold and diamond these sages the four Sages who were established in even sightedness and accused to travel accustomed to travel everywhere unobstructed enter the seventh gate also without taking any permission while the two Divine personages were looking on so their access their access is everywhere no one can stop them because they are pure and therefore the good of the world so they all went to the sixth place and then seventh and these two Stout strong good-looking guards they saw this poor voice these four Commandos or no dress dancing they looked like boys of five years they looked like a child of five years so ramakrishna also sometimes no he has no concern of the cloth but he used to look like a child of five no you know same child so these four Rishi kumars are like that they're so pure then they are Beyond body consciousness they were personages established in the knowledge of Atman seeing them entering the gates these Gatekeepers when the seventh here this Gatekeepers obstructed them with their words and battles and mocked at their prows although these sages were persons worthy of respect and although such conduct towards them was contrary to the attitude of the Lord towards the devotees so these two gods may become more powerful okay see what you are going where are you going stop here naturally it is his duty also of course but there they could be very humble because they live in that higher plane means your mind should be shocked mine should be kind I said you know how to behave with people no and there are ordinary people cannot go they are highly elevated spiritual personalities and they behaved strongly and rough uses of their time maybe when The Gatekeepers of the Lord thus blocked their way in front of the Devas there the ascetics who are worthy of highest respect frustrated and angry and the obstacle put in their way of seeing their dear Lord I spoke with an agitated look so then the cars came from the poor Sages that will be the next day's reading that will be from 32 so we'll be reading next day third this third book book number three three dot 15 DOT 32 verse so we have read about 100 Parts maybe today do you understand I have read today about 100 verses skip so many things [Music] so this is the point that now we'll hear what kumara's the sages how they respond to the angry guards and how the cars came and then what Vishnu the Lord came and protect tried he was in between that their great devotees they are cursing they should be their words cannot go wrong Ah that's true that kid is the two epics they are to be killed that's all one one time it happened no this whole episode of bringing Rama Sita in the world and Kong show s and now one was the other one so just like if you have like a Krishna hmm now what is the question so we end here the reading uh as I said we ended on page number 210 and 12. and verse number 3.15.31 [Music] okay you will do what question okay okay what happens if someone worships for example but ramakrishna and madurga which looks [Laughter] also do these different lookas talk to each other Lucas talk to each other Lucas uh actually I do not know this response where they will go but I think that as we may have two Targets we are going two holy places to visit no and then when you were driving you think that look I'll go to jail first there was two places where the holy place of birthplace of holy mother and the birthplace of ramakrishna so when you are starting for your journey I like also I also like holy mother okay go fast you are then your your strong desire will tell you where you stop first both are holy places in the plane of Duality realm of Duality according to bring vedanta here whatever you call Mother Durga Kali Shiva Christ Buddha Rama Krishna these are different planes but what is that plane it's a pure mental plan it reside they are only pure satic quality people can keep their mind in that plane so where will you go they're all the expression of one Brahman so you start with Duality you end in Oneness so and here so long you are in Duality level there is separate there is separate but if you really go to the foundation who is ramakrishna who is the mother Shakti holy mother they are only one absolute sachidhananda and it's their power no so the expression or non-expression it is the one so if you want in The Duality level you will go okay I will go first to come out okay come on then your desire is I'll go to janamati now go in the plane of Duality but in your thinking here ramakrishna is also an embodiment of that Consciousness manifested but she is actually Brahman so you go the same absolute is the one whether you go through this way or that way it does not make any difference okay thank you this is done bye um [Music] so we'll be meeting you again 7 30 for our Shanti Gita class we are almost coming to an end of
