[Bhagavatam - 2.5.21 ( Book 2, Chapter 5 verse 21)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdHt4ErkuQM)

okay um [Music] and the destroyer of the demons kangshow and chanura the dear darling of mother devaki and the world teacher i salute him again and again on peace peace peace sorry for a few minutes delay we were reading the bhagavat chapter book number two and we are on the chapter six to start today now what we read before that the question was there what is this creation and what is this creation the world we see and who has created is god god has created so narayana has created this but what we see around what is this it is the same everything is his body as you come consider he is a cosmic person huge person no bishop like the chapter in the bhagavad-gita cosmic form of the divine so at arjuna song in the body of the cosmic form of narayana was krishna he saw the sun the moon the stars all the warriors etcetera etcetera and the teeth and like that is a huge revelation so that actually is described here in this chapter 6 also it is giving every detail that everything of the world is nothing but a manifestation or everything is embedded in the lord the whole world is nothing but god whatever you see some marian she will hear that his face and the lord's face is what so it is like what is that great lord like everything is in him everything is in him and in in everything he is there in in him is everything and he is in everything that means there is nothing but god and god alone so this is for meditation to think about when we walk around look at the ground at the trees and the sun and the moon and the stars wherever our eyes fall no this can be experienced and this can be thought out it is his body part it is he himself nothing else nothing else nothing else okay so this is the divine and this manifestation is the name of this chapter six which we are going to read today the other day also we read the same it ended with the identification of the different planes in hindus have seven planes up seven planes down all these planes regions of universe can also be done in another way his feet is as if his feet is the bull loka bhuvalaka that means it is his body only different parts of the body in different level and these are the different locus today also the divine and his manifestation chapter further details about the universal form we look at the universal form it is nothing but it is a part or it is in the body cosmic body of narayana brahma said chapter 6 second skanda chapter 6 verse number 1 page number 113 his face is the source of the organs of speech and his presiding deity is agni the seven dhatu is based on basic bodily substances of his body are the seven vedic meters beginning with gayatri his tongue is the origin of the offering of devas and petries called the hobby and kapio of the sixth form of test his nostrils are the source of pranas his eyes are the source of all forms of brilliance his body is the seat of the essence of all objects of beauty his hair may be regarded as the origin of all trees and plants his arms are the seat of devas gods who protect you all the quarters his feet of hari the feet of puri held the fulfillment of all one's ones in the universal cosmic form the blood vessels are the rivers the bones are the mountains they're thinking a big grind purusha naan his different body parts as it were in that the whole cosmos was there as it were actually if we think like that now today's modern science also will say no in our body if this is possible why not in cosmic body of god in our what do they say at the base of one eyebrow no how much small space is that billions of so microbes are there billions of microbes are here in your eyebrow one eyebrow at the bottom of the eyebrow billions huh they leave they serve they die they eat they smile they joy so in we in the cosmic body will be like that season that's a thing that the thing in the past dimension so i'm not going to details of all this it's it is difficult to think also in the old pattern of thought the cheetah of the supreme person is representing dharma eternal sages like sanaka rudra and all these ayan the dishes devas asuras men elephant birds jaksa rakshasa bhuta we do not know all this even trees creatures living in water earth sky all the various plants and galaxies and comets lightning thunder clouds in salt all things are that existed or will exist form the purusha himself that means it becomes it is the purusa purusha means that cosmic nara you know the lord krishna but just all the objects that have been made out of gold are only gold so all these have come out of narayana so it is everything is narayana that is a vedantic vision ends no as swami vivekananda says that vedanto starts with great pessimism not this not this not this but it ends in total optimism everything is divine sarvam kaluidang brahma everything is permeated with brahman consciousness there's nothing but brahman so that is the conclusion of the upanishads and the vedas seeing everything is pulsating with one consciousness whatever you see whatever you think what you cannot think can think cannot think that is the way of vedanta says here is a bhakti saying he has keep out of him everything has come out but it is not that he is here and thing is there after creation he has entered into it that means it is he manifested in diverse ways it is he who is multiplying everywhere and it is he is seen in thousands and millions of ways verse number 16 i jumped onto all those details because say how many names you want to hear how much subdivision they have thought about right he started here the in the the sages narada sanaka root draw special knowledge rishis devas asuras men elephants birds animals serpents gandharvas apsaras dancing girls of sarah in the heaven jaksas rakshasas buddhas reptiles cattle pit trees the forefathers siddhas those who have become successful in their attainment of gold with withdrawal those who sing songs charanas the singers bowl singers and others trees creatures living in water creatures living in water earth and sky all various planets and galaxies all are in the purusha himself he being the material cause of all this it pervades it all and also transcend it there's a important point material cause and efficient cause for any creation two things are necessary one is the matter this table is necessary what is the matter wood then what are the material glue screw doesn't matter but how it became a table somebody skillfully worked on the wood assemble them put him together in this shape no so one is the material cause another called efficient cause that efficient cause put this into a reality so two causes we find here two causes are different one is the wood another is a person conscious one is conscious another is unconscious but looking at the whole universe all this creation the material material is earth water air fire no intellect ego all these things they matter matter is also he and consciousness is also he let's say it is called material cause is god because there is nothing but god all the ornaments his different designs matter is go gold and whatever efficient cause created these diverse things ultimately come out it is only the gold in all some design so everything is god and god and god alone so he being the material cause of all this he means god perverts it all and also transcends it but he is not limited by it another point he is not ended here just as the sun giving the example beautiful example you look at the sun sun ilu means it remains itself no you don't need any any flashlight to look at oh there is sun or not sun itself not only he illumines he spreads into everything and other things are illuminated he himself self-believement and whatever thing you see he is the illuminator of everything god is like that he is self lilumin and anything you see it is illumined by the light of the lord so that is itself that's why he met he being the material cause of all pervades it all as a matter it is god himself has become the matter so whatever you see as matter it is no matter it is all consciousness and giving the example just as the sun illumines itself and spreads everywhere outside too by its heat and light so also the universal spirit is in the universe and also transcends it so the universal spirit which is called god is in the universe penetrated into the universe this is see as matter but it is god what the idea and bhakti book or ghana book end result is the same end result is seeing the divine everywhere seeing the consciousness everywhere so he is saying that universal spirit is in the universe and it transcends that giving the example that sun illumines itself no other person is needed but at the same time he remains everything what is in the world of creation so similarly this also god has created himself he is the self-illumined reality and it is he as illuminator and the illumined this is the important point illuminator and the illumined in the world of duality these are two different one is the matter another flashlight it illumines nothing it is different it is different but it's one like the sun it is self-illumined it is illumine and the creation whatever is there it is lighted by the light of the sun thus he he means this our book is continuing that exists as this cosmic form revealing himself and everything inside and outside without the help of any other illuminator no other flashlight necessary to see a see what are other things for he the lord is immortal and fearless spirit it is free from perishable nature of material substances so material substance whatever we find it is here it will be destroyed someday it is present now it will be old someday it will decay some way but no here it is free from perishable nature because it is god only ultimate truth it cannot die where shall i sell it die where shall it go where shall i end it is the only reality there's no place to go no place to come you know all beings dwell in a part of him every object we see they're all dwelling in the part of him is there only one segment of it as we saw his eyes are like this hand is like that his thighs like that this this whole plane of circle heaven is is this waste like that we did just now all beings dwell in a part of him who has manifested as the universe that in spite of such manifestation he is not in the least affected but continues to be the saccidana existence knowledge and bliss absolute so it seems so many parts as it were this is separate that is about that but it is being separate it is not separate it is one continuous thing how can like space look at this space room space space in the pathway space in the other house these are divisions but the space is the same space you cannot cut you cannot divide you can say this is my room my space it is your room your space but actually space you are saying so but you cannot cut the space here okay this this segment is mine that segment is your you cannot do that even you put a wall your space penetrates to the wall there is only one so god the conscious entity the reality is only one both the ways of life have their sanctions in divine will he from whom this cosmic shell is manifesting as the universal form comprising of all categories like elements organs mind etc originated he the supreme being stands above transcending all and illuminating all his manifestation as the sun illumines and transcends everything in the world so nearest example is the sun example as sun illuminates everything but stands above everything similarly the narayana the lord himself is separate from this at the same time stands above it and permeate again permeates it without his presence nothing can move nothing can be a reality now he's continues brahma these are all brahma saying to narada so when i emerged out of the navel of him you know brahma comes out where from the navel of narayana did you see that picture narayana is lying down on a big snake no and snake is holding anantanyaga anandam is limitless the snag of the snake holding the umbrella and lara is sleeping now and there is a picture in the navel there is a lotus comes out and in the lotus brahma comes and says no his brahma himself is saying padmanam so when i this brahma when emerged out of the naval padmanabha of him who is the inner soul of the universal form virata is the inner soul of everything god is the inner soul of everything i found nothing but the parts of that being for use as the various requisite for jagna etc i find nothing when i came out of the lotus of the navel of narayana i found nothing all the jagna when you do the home of fire you have seen we need so many items so where are all these all the items are narayana nothing else but not i am because there is nothing else but narayana so all these requisites like animal post crucial grass ground seasons seasons sacrificial utensils barley these are all the items needed for doing a home of fire and other cereals ghee edibles representing sixties metal like gold earth water etc these sacrificial rights sacrificial names mantras swaha sacrificial presence austere practices god's rituals all these etcetera all these different factors of sacrifice had to be identified with the part of that being so these are different part but it's a part of god that means it is nothing but god god part means finger is a part hand is a part no so it's a part of the whole body so narayana's body you can imagine these are only parts of his in the body a qualified non-dualism they are giving the idea of absolute non-realism qualified non-dualism these different ideas are given they are meaning there is god is the only reality and nothing else so then i offered all these sacrifices to the supreme being himself so with this ingredients i did the homophone all these different factors of the sacrifice had to be identified with the part of the whole being equipped with all such ingredients from the parts of the purusho i offered all these as sacrifice to the supreme being himself that means it is said you do all the worship eating that you are purchasing puja is going on now you go to the shopping place you purchase ghee purchase sweets you purchase fruits people flowers yes you are thinking something you are purchasing for god but the things are themselves in god it is called his thing you are offering to him you know in in our ganga deep when people take after taking this ganga deep and standing like this they take the ganga water in their palm and offer like this so gangnam water you take from ganga and offering to ganga his thing you are giving to him what thing you will give that's very important point we do puja we do spend money i am spending so much money for doing durga puja and whose thing you are giving to whom and murthy was without god their clay it is created by god so the the in in intelligence of the vertical pattern that's also god so what you are giving to god you are giving god's things to god people think i spend so much money for puja money is yours it's god's you your intelligence that belongs to god so everything we do if we understand we are worshipping we are nothing even we are not are not the master of ourselves it is god's will no this body is not mine if you have murder then you have put full control so why not stop from aging why not stop from disease so no everything belongs to god and god's thing we are giving back to god that this god permeates everything we only in ignorance thing i you yeah my devotion there is no my at that point everything is you know you said that then [Music] [Music] end result starting point action in between the thing we do worship that whatever hand we use for doing everything belongs to him we only think i i i i so this brahma is teaching this to naruto this lesson then so 38 verse on page 115 3-0 verse number it says the supreme being he his transcendent nature this is the immanent nature so long they are talking anything you do [Music] to perform the puja those things are in them god is there it is god's things so but what about what is not the material object that is also permeated by god in the infinite space so now they will talk about it all this manifested world verse number 30 on page 115 all this manifested world is established in narayana we call brahman she only don't get confused in the language it is we call we call malna you know ramakrishnan devotee is called ramakrishna christ devotees will be christ allah if you believe that way this all is established in that in in creation he is manifest he manifests himself as this universe of a million forms by assuming the gunas to himself not subjected ignorant he himself creates this whole universe out of nothing out of the three gunas what are the trigonometry you know satyarajas and thomas with these three gunas he created out of nothing by his play magician you have seen the magicians how they play they come with a stick in hand and there is an empty drum and say it is all empty see you can see the hole and put on the desk and cover with a napkin and say what do you want i want mango okay he puts his hand take mango right it is created by him if you say create it it is created by him and who is audience he is also created by him in this case and the audience is happy oh my god what a miracle he is doing but the magician it is the trick of magic magician is above that this trickery may change to another trickery magicians always play tricks which we cannot catch trickery of the hand triggering of diverting the attention of people so it can do that's the skill so but he is separate from that so stasistic christi the creation shasta the creator he stands above he is not finished with creation so that idea being directed being directed by him that means the lord narayana we can say ramakrishna if you wish to say so rama devotes means by rama's will krishna devotees relay by krishna krsna's will so being directed by him i create the worlds i create the words here brahma it's all statement of brahma the creator god you are thinking i am so big i am nothing in relation to narayana brahma says i being directed by him it is his will i only am a machine i do i create the world which is subject to its control and hara destroys it hara means shiva i create by his will he tells me to create so i do by his power and shiva hara destroys the whole universe he can destroy but it is his will point is that he is he is he is brahma is saying he is and he the welder of the three gunas sustains the world as visnu again three of the trinities of hindu god brahma vishnu shiva says brahma by his will i create by his will narada you know the same you can say i how who will you catch now i you call brahman that's why brahman is better to say as by the direction of that brahman inspired by absolute consciousness i creator i create and then na visnu maintains it and shiva hara destroys this who dear one oh dear he's saying oh naruto i think i have now answered your question by showing that there is nothing in the chain of cause and effect which is called the universe having any existence independent of the bhagavan there is no independent existence brahma is in the tool in his hand now for us oh he's a creator god no destroy god now lord shiva there's no existence of shiva brahma vishnu neither this world neither that neither heaven neither celestial beings neither millions of billions of diverse creations nothing is there accepting that bhagavan because i bear the in my heart with intensity of devotion therefore my words never proven brahma is saying because i am truthful why the lord narayana lives in my heart because i am that my words cannot be false what i am saying these are all true my mind never takes a wrong turn because the lord is with me guiding me and my senses are never attracted to evil ways though i am created by i am created by god but my mind does not go to the lower things not the senses because lord is so powerfully present in me i have not been able to know anything about mahabishnu the supreme being and my source though i am the very embodiment of vedic learning and austerity brahma created everything so vedas also came out of him and all the four vedas and the wisdom and knowledge do i am the venerated master of all the prajapatis prajapati means gods suppose one department no one department wealth mother looks me education mother saraswati these are not prajapatis but these are the ruling gods so i am the boss brahma i am the burma i am the boss of all but and though i followed the path of yoga and attend to great concentration of mind but i have not been able to know i cannot know though i am so much powerful but i am powerless to him i work only by his bidding salutation to his sacred feet which saved the refugees from the travails of sangsaru who is best to peace and which are in themselves the most auspicious of objects so vast and varied is the power of god's maya i am on page 116. at the bottom first paragraph so fast and varied is the power of his maya that even he does not know its extent just as the sky is unaware of its own limit god also does not know his own glory how big is he like the space does not know how big is this place neither i nor you not sibo understand him the lord in his real nature so no one can know used to sing this song brahma vishnu [Music] [Music] who can know you brahma visnu my son cannot what the question of jiva individual soul like us what we know we cannot know that's why god cannot be known if you know vedanto says then it becomes an object you become the subject you become bigger the object you know it's limited you are the knower is bigger so if you could know god that's why they we cannot know god you can be god you read sami vivekananda's yoga they'll say you cannot know god you can be god you can dissolve yourself into the cosmic reality and your identity being lost it will be brahman only you can be brahmana you can be infinite you can be worthless deathless but you cannot know the birthless deathless no are known or the duality scripts up so that is very important point see how in puranas this is bhagavata purana how in purana in the language people can easily understand they are making some examples of brahma creator this that and explaining the same principle as highest vedanta teaches us so what to speak of other gods neither i means brahma not you not other nor even lord shiva understand him in his real nature knowing is impossible a drop of water he thinks how big is the sun i know uh ocean i know i know the ocean how do you know the ocean you cannot you come come come come and touch the ocean then who will know you cannot know you become the ocean ramakrishna's example the frog the frog in the well and he was thinking he does not know what is ocean the ocean frog came and he said where do you come from he said i come from ocean the ocean what is that it's water water water water ah it is bigger than my well this water i ocean said mushroom truck says no it is much bigger is it what is much bigger than that okay this big he gave a jump that's bigger this part to that point then he said this monster is your ocean [Music] he's trying to small frog wanted to know what is the big frog saying about ocean and he is trying to measure it trying to measure it with his mind with a physical ability intellectual ability okay and the two jumps he gave and the third jump when he said no no this is nothing motion is much bigger then he gave such a jump and he died he fell down he burst and died then by dying the frog understood potion cannot be measured brahman cannot be measured god cannot be measured he may be intellectual giant that intellectual giant is only this yardstick god is so infinite no mind can assist that's why the mind i am not the intellect not i am not chitto my emotions my memory my text is not me it's not it is not that machida when you go to cheat on saccidananda brahman then you know that's why it's called chidananda rupa shivoham so this is a very beautiful idea though we people give descriptions of his activities in his incarnations none of us know him in truth and in reality he is the pure spirit the original and unborn being and the creator of all that exists at the beginning of every cosmic cycle it is there it starts the whole creation our hindu idea of creation is not one time it's cyclical cyclic it happens it ends and again it starts again it comes no jata purum as it was once created it gets dissolved again it comes from there like a seed rama krishna gave the example of the seeds they grandma in early days granny is to collect all types of seeds when the season is over and the garden fruits and vegetables they used to keep the seeds tie in the in a cloth and keep it in hot spots back and when time comes she used to bring out the same thing which are stored in the as a seed form in the hospice bag god's hospital bag is there and when the time comes again those seeds are planted and again trees come truths come and diverse universe comes so he is the creator the material of creation the created world and the one in whom the creation subsists he is everything so musk the word verse number 38 he is pure spirit the original and unborn being like brahman he is the original he never is born eternally he is there was there he's there will be there anything is limited in the time it's called creation it was not i was not there before my birth i came with my birth and continuing now if i die tomorrow it ends so before i was not there in middle i am here at the end i go but god is not like that he was there he is there he will be there in a tree period of time and transcending time he will remain he is the pure spirit the original and unborn being and the creator of all that exists at the beginning of every cosmic cycle he is the creator the material of creation the created world and the one in whom the creation subsists he is spirit pure and untranscendent he is the innermost essence firm and unified he is truth complete and beginningless he is a non-dual eternal and above the goonas the rishis entreat him when serenity reigns over their body racist can get a glimpse of this truth that he is beyond time beyond space it is all the time is the essence of everything the whole creation is nothing but he who can understand the rishis the shears of truth they can understand by their intuitive eye that means that pure heart pure mind can get a glimpse of that that's also gleams not they cannot understand everything unless they die no one will understand that that small ego should die small ego becomes big big big big like the frog extend extend this big this big this big and one point comes it it bursts and there is no ego anymore ego dissolves the rishis in tweet him when the serenity of the serenity reigns over their body their body mind becomes serene and calm and they can intrigue that that means in samadhi in samadhi they can entreat the power of god presence of god but he evades the mind agitated by my main argument now his manifestation 41 verse the primary descent or manifestation of that transcendent being is the virata purusa this cosmic this is called birato what we see through the eyes the grow size this is the vidart this birato comes from manifest when he is trying to manifest in the world that absolute transcendental reality in time space this is called the virata purusa and everything distinguishable from him are his devotees here we can distinguish everything this is the table this is called the pews this is called the roof this is called the floor everything is distinguishable well these are the bivouative power the god's power it's a division this universe is called virata purusha and the distinction which is done is the power bibuti of god divine powers and attributes these are time nature cause and effect condition of cosmic intelligence the great elements ego quality senses and all entities moving and unmoving so these are all these items time cause and effect cosmic intelligence we are part of cosmic intelligence our intelligence is a part of the cosmic intelligence our mind is a part of the cosmic mind that's why you feel suffering for others someone is suffering you feel some pain how when you connect with mind mind to mind mother connects the mind with the child child suffering mother feels more how if the mind is separate one mind we don't understand that but one mind if you strike in one point that vibration goes to the other place who is connected with that myself means the brahma rudra vishnu destructive god prajapati the creator the rishis this is like you naruto you like rishis including you the lord of the lords the heaven art the patalo the lower plain the leaders of the gander was biddadharas charanas the leader of the jaksas rakshasas snakes and serpents the chief of the petries asuras siddhas and dhanavas the leaders of ghosts demons elements aquatic creatures animals and birds in fact all that have striking endowment an attribute like majesty personality strength luster energy brilliant colors beauty etc are all special expressions of each that means here bhagavati is trying to help us to look at the world as the devotee of god god's bibuti satan srimatur whenever you see some glory in anywhere you see oh his man is very intelligent don't glorify him it is my glory my devotee my power manifesting through him wherever judy with him wherever there is any extraordinary power satam the subtle quality and the pure quality satan shri means oyster wealth prosperity see urjita overflowing in the degree of overflowing degree now it is my power manifesting there so see so sage i shall now narrate to you according to their important the account of maha visnu in a sportive divine incarnation lila bhattaras accounts which will erase the impurities that the years have acquired through hearing about worldly matters and which are in themselves extremely attractive and sanctifying to hear so now he says any beauty in fact all that striking endowment the attributes like majesty personality strain luster modesty intelligence patience energy brilliant colors beauty are all special expression of peace therefore o says narada i shall now narrate you the lila avatar now we have talked about his his avatar manifestation to anything material world but i will say as a human personality a krishna born krishna played that manifestation i will talk that's the leela abu dharr i will talk about that and why because this type of accounts which that will erase it is what it will take away from our heart all the impurities all that is ignorance that years have acquired through hearing about worldly matters and which are the themselves extremely attractive and sanctifying to hear it is always pure it makes us heart pure mind pure that will help you to purify your heart and soul so that you will be free from all bondage so here ends the chapter 7 which is started reading from the beginning so quickly we have read about 45 verses just to understand the glory of god manifesting so what is the sum and substance is this that everything belongs to god everything is god it is he anything excellent that is god's power and anything you see all the brahma vishnu creator etc they are nothing they are only manifestation of that one absolute divide in vedanta is called say that brahman okay we end here om shanti today nobody has come in this if it is not i know god has become this world and permeates it completely why does vedanta consider it an illusion and unreal yes why this world is considered unreal if it is everything is manifested but for me it is unreal because i don't see that i only hear now but when really the narayana god has become this world it becomes reality then there is no illusion illusion is for ignorant people what appears illusion becomes god himself when after knowledge one one goes to samadhi when he goes to samadhi these are non-real these are angel these are not real and when reaching the top then you come down again what will happen that everything you see that it is all gold gold ornament all ornaments are nothing but gold but when you start your journey i like this tournament i don't like this argument you are caught into the name and form that's why narayana if it is narayana then god has become this world and it permeates it completely the vedanta consider an illusion this consideration is for the young student who have not reached that maturity of realization when one realizes and his mind becomes purified for purification we do this i say i am not this not the body not the mind because i am always connected with the body and my joy my fun my eating my sleeping my money my house my days me me my my my my and we fight with each other and making the world a hell and there is no peace one two two one we want to get peace then we follow the process this is not the ultimate reality it is today only important tomorrow something will come and knowing this way we move on and say no not this not this not this but ultimately god is the reality when you reach god then you see that god is permeate everything so after experience world becomes all god before that it is not for me it is not gone you tell a sweet smiling face you show to me i'll be happy if you look in a ugly manner towards me or frowning face i'll be mad you say some sweet words i'll be happy you are unpleasant word i can give a fist so for me this duality is there but if one can really purify the heart and saying not this forget this these are my trifles i should love god think of god and and by loving god they enter into the brahman consciousness after that your whole vision changes when you come down then you see that it is all made of one element ramakrishna gave the example himself it is like they wax garden ramakrishna gave the example it is like wax garden everything is made of wax table plain dream human being all wax but looks different there is a garden there is a fruit hanging there is a monkey there is a person grabbing something so but it is made of wax so all made of wax sachidan no no no even after after vedanta when they come back they ship sarvankal lidang brahma after experience when they come back they see god only nothing else or brahman can duality god i am using because they come back into the duality level so the absolute knowledge will remain in their background but they see the name and forms [Music] that is that is for the right you are correct when we are starting our journey we can take two path either gany path or octopath gannypath says this is not real not real not real not real and rejecting everything you reach that goal and bhakti says no no no god is inside this god is everywhere god is there god isn't the son god is in the daughter god is in the husband god is in the wife what is in the tree so try to see god god god guard god so that your eye becomes really purified in a bhaktivedanta you reach the same goal ultimately can the effect be different from the cause if god is real and manifest everywhere and in everything how can it be considered an illusion and ideal yes initial and unreal to the person who does not only intellectually talk about that if you pinch me i'll be thinking i am the body no and i say i am brahmana i am atman so it is contradictory it cannot be you have to go beyond the body idea so when you go beyond the body i need idea till then this practice should be maintained let me see this equation is muhammad same as brahmana vedanta yeah i see i i don't get baha visnu has a form and it be in the um puranas puranas but as we talked about that it is all maha visnu in that it is a more they are talking about vedantic perspective two perspective bhakti perspective ghani perspective and the realization is the same when you end your journey in bhaktipat you reach the same goal you follow the organic path you reach the same goal but when you come down then you say oh god is in it everywhere is rama huh he is lying in the heart of all that ram is all pervaded so you know bhakta is getting the same view but you have to go to purify yourself to that level that's why the same question you can you cannot equate with bhakti language with vedanta language but your experience you say when you transcend everything same when bhakta goes and merges and in absorbed in god then he has no other identity but god and again he also when he goes he loses his all ego identity only truth will remain another question so it becomes god same as union of jivatman and paramatman the goal of bedford yes so knowing god is lower knowledge than yes knowing god is always lower because you can know only some object some subject i as an ass subject can know something so subject object subject object idea but ultimately object subject merges into one subject and object merge into one okay what is your question my question is something excellent like we just talked about you know we can remind ourselves that this is all god's excellence is not mine and that makes me feel more devotional yeah but now on the other side something very bad happens how can i think about that how should i think yeah it is a goal my i have done something good or bad because so long i am in the body bound all our actions should be either good or bad and absolute good we cannot do you are sweeping the floor you are killing so many germs you are eating your food you are killing if you are a non-veg you kill fish we kill animals and whatever if you are vegetarian even you are killing the rice and doll they they are boiling them they are seeds those seeds could have produced much result game they they feel really full with paddy no paddy field but you could have these sheets could have been used for re re revealing the plants but what we do we dry them dry them and make them and make a rice in the machine and we are eating we are killing them so consciously unconsciously we do good bad things and some people are very consciously do harm to others they will be happy if they can torture someone there are people in the mind no so in one life they did that next life when they born and they say oh why i am suffering you did something you forgot so karma has a theory of that good and bad no and i if you don't take the responsibility that you are the doer of good then you can also reject the responsibility that you are doing bad karma does not touch you but as we are human being we take one side and try to leave the other side that does not happen in the world good and bad go side by side light and darkness side by side coin one side then the opposite side goes together we can see only one side of the coin i won't take the other side it will not happen that's called the duality the the conflict of the duality and in absolute one all there is no good you cannot say it is good you can't say it is bad there's only one who will then experience a bad or good thing in life okay so am i clear your question i think it's clear now what is the problem again tell me oh yeah and you will have to say that everything is also if it comes why do you bother it will pass it is not permanent it may taste stay for short time as good came and passed back came and it will go i am not involved into it you had me or in a train ride and some good guy came and sat with you and have a good friendly relationship chit chat and this and that a bad guy came and pushed you out of your bed and took him himself it happens in a train journey we have our experience like that you have your legitimate ticket and you are you are in your reserve bath in the lower lower back maybe and someone comes and pushes into and the college students when they go for one space to the another standard train they will come in 20 20 numbers and then they are powerful they will certainly push you out and get out you sit in one corner and they will take out there so this happens it's good but they will drop some other place but again another person may come according to my fate and someone may be sleeping well no one is going to disturb him so these are things happen in life's journey if you take vedantic path then it will be it is coming and going it is not permanent i i should not be so much affected accept this and bhakta makta will say god's will it is happening what can i do oh lord let thy will be done om shanti shanti shanti harihum 7 30 we'll have our another class which we'll call santi gita the song of peace and i hear no he knows here is there there is i don't know what he did two places also will be oh
