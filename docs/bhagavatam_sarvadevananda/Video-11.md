[Bhagavatam - 1.8.1 - 1.8.35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=abAxrMdvN70)

[Music] um [Music] we salute bhagavan sri krishna the son of vasudeva the destroyer of the demons kangsho and chanura the darling of mother joshua and the teacher of the whole universe we salute him again and again from peace peace peace be unto us all so we are back to bhagavat and we are reading the book one and in that book one chapter 1.8 we will start a chapter new chapter krishna is now getting prepared preparing himself at the end of the war to go back to dwarka this war has been finished and last part we read that there was ashatwama the son of the teacher drona arjuna's teacher druna unethically killed the five children of drupadi arjuna and five brothers five sons and they are sleeping in the night and the astra went and killed them everyone so that there will be nobody in the lineage of arjuna so that was the critical condition and when this came to the note of dhruvadi she was so upset and then arjuna took a vote that he will kill asatmama and that we read the other day astama then the fight but you know took the how with an air anger now arjuna the lord said to arjuna that killed him is to to kill such a person is necessary for the those who are evil and innocent people they will kill so and then this astama seeing arjuna in the race he to protect himself put that missile which is called the most destructive missile that is called brahma astra brahmastra that means it is invincible and if you cast that yeah the entire world will be destroyed it's like atomic bottom bomb or something like that but he knew how to throw that and we don't know how to retract that there are mantras formulas how they can apply and can if they like they can withdraw arjuna then seeing this condition then shri krishna asked him to counteract and so arjuna then put he also know how to have their control over the brahmastra he knows both how to put it and how to withdraw and then he put it and there's two missiles interjected and the description we read it is like a huge fire in expressible it cannot be seen by ordinary eyes so in this way and then that strong fire this is invisible thousand suns as it were in the sky so when that was sin and then originally retracted that and then astra may become powerless arjuna then went and tied him and put him pull him to his camp and brought it before drupadi was first happy and then krishna said that now he killed but again compassion came in the heart of dhruvadi after all we should not kill a brahmin i mean boy guru's son how is a how you should kill your guru's son guru's son is like guru so soft sentiment came this happens with the good people always no most notorious people get escaped by that way good people always compassionate and they have that some rationality more of soft-heartedness so this was the situation then krishna ultimately did that i would suggest you should kill him but at the same time don't kill i give this two bodies you kill and don't kill how come it's possible to kill and not kill but he understood arjuna understood the secret if a brahman boy his topped head is cut that's an insult that's killing the brahmin so he did that and that is the killing and then not killing you didn't kill that person then he was untied and let go from the out of the camp i mean released with a humiliation and taking out in his crown there is a bright something that's also dishonest and dishonor if you take out a king his crown is taken out it is a dishonor now it is more than his disgrace so that was also arjuna took out that and cut the top here gave him back so this was the situation now we read the last verses of 55 to 58 of the last chapter 7th chapter on page 32 we read arjuna understood what the lord has in mind and accordingly he shared off with his sword in the head tucked a vasatama together with a crushed jewel that was natural feature on his head be raped of his spiritual aura by the sin of child slaughter and deprived of his physical brilliance by the loss of his crest jewel asthma was sent away from the camp of the pandavas released okay that's when he goes back to his camp most humiliated people say what happened so that means you are almost your honor is gone you are discredited person and now execution for a degraded brahmana consists in sharing of the hatred confiscation of property and expulsion so the inflection of physical death is prohibited this way along with krishna the pandavas who were bemoaning the death of their children next attended to their cremation and other rights because five son has not died so after the death of the children or anyone in the family the whole family goes to do some rights and rituals in hindu is one in every religion there is such rights no in every every culture there is something so now here is the krsna's preparation to depart so they all all went that is the last verse we read that they all went together to do the rights whatever the brahmin priest will be there and they will have to offer something those mantras chanting etc now sutra said now the narrator says what he says page 33 verse number one the sons of pandu that means arjuna bhima judishtira all them accompanied by krishna and with the ladies because mothers were also dead who lost their children at the head of the party went to the ganga even now people do the rights on the bank of the ganga if possible to perform the water rights connected with the obsequies of their dead relatives after having performed the rights consisting in the gift of jingling and water to the spirit of the departed and after bewailing long their loss they took their bath again in the waters of the ganga which have sprung from [Music] the feet of huri the lord are sanctified by the dust of his feet it is believed that ganga has come out where it has come out from himalayas we think but hindu belief that it has come out from the feet of the lord hari narayana then krishna along with the assemblies of the rishis discoursing on the inevitability of the ravage of time time kills everything in time we are born in time everything is dead so he was this krishna giving these discourses tried to console all the assembly soruladen devotees krishna gave this message yes we lose our friends we lose our children we lose our relative this is a part of life time in time people come in time people die that's the eternal message so krishna gave that message to those who are all weeping and sobbing because of the loss of their children and their own people in the war these are still sitting in his palace now the king theater rasta is sitting in his palace and then judith tira the leader of the kurus along with his brother gandhari the grip stick and mother of the khorabas they have also lost all their children kunti the mother of the pandavas and panchali their wife no so they were all seated krishna along with the assembled races discoursing on the inability in evetability inevitability of the ravage of time time kills everyone that type of message tried to console all the terrestrial the old because he has lost his sons in the war sitting in his palace because thirteen day it started no by that time many are killed in both sides so judy street he lost his own children leader and gandhari the mother of the durham etc and kauravas mother and kunti the mother of the five pandava brothers all were weeping and wailing someone lost their own he also both party have lost their own people in the world so they all were consoled by bhagavan krishna this way now verse number five and six the kingdom accept by deuteronomy had now been restored to judas tiram so now the kingdom and in between stories are there that story is not being told here so now war is over almost so the kingdom is back to judah is given to members of yudhisthira royal clan were responsible for dragging dhruvadi by her locks and thereafter cursed by her to paris had now been destroyed the noble fame of judish tyra had spread everywhere like that of indra the god of gods himself after the performance of three asamiras means there is a sacrificial right where they give the austro also means the horse the tie in the horse neck that this it is the king judistira is the king of this country no and the horse will go anywhere no one can catch it if you catch then again judistiro will come to fight that means everyone accepts judiciary as the king of their country so three times he did not people do one time here it is said the thrice so that means yudhisthira is now the king of the country of india it is established now and everyone respects that decision and his glory of yudhisthira means all the pandava brothers yudhisthira is the elder brother so he is the king that means all the five brothers have conquered in this war and destroyed their enemies so their glory their truthfulness their honesty have crowned with come being crowned with success now it was so many times defeated and this coming dude joshua again and again did all this nonsense but now it has come back to judistria having helped his devotees to achieve all this shri krishna prepared himself to return to his city of dwarka his own own kingdom krishna when he's planning okay my duty is done now the war is over and this has been established in his kingship no and then he finished and he said okay let me go by no he took formal leave from the sons of pandu means five brothers worshiped sages like basma and others those who are present best bias and other sages she krishna honored them offered them their respects and was and in return the sages they worship krishna gasol mason and others and was worshipped in return by them he means the krishna was now ready to get into the chariot and dramatic yeah krishna is going getting back to his own plane they have their own private plane the ministers military general what is number one plan no for our country u.s past so that plane is special plane so krishna also had a special plane as the king of a big kingdom he was now ready to get into the chariot he's not just entering into the chariot accompanied by his followers like uddhava and saptak etc when o brahmanas he found uttara who is uttara uttara who is uttara ah obi-wan was killed for which this actually shanti gita came so because is in the um he has not borne yet it is a past story so he says when obramanas he found shri krishna is going to enter into his plane and that time he found that obi-wan knows mother who is still in the womb of mother okay see i am getting confused obi-wan is mother no these are you have to remember all these stories wife is already killed obi manu's wife so she if there is only one baby in the lineage all five children or other are killed so who will inherit afterwards there will be nobody to inherit so therefore when he found uttara uttara the wife of muhimanu rushing to him in utter fight to whom to krishna helplessly coming to krishna and running uttara said o lord of the worlds and of all gods o supreme yogin i find no refuge except in thee when all are engaged in mutual destruction everyone is killing each other and see my condition they are putting some arrow to kill my baby so lord here comes very fast towards me a fierce missile like a molten mass of iron let it burn me up i mind it not but let it not destroy the fetus within me i can die let my child be protected oh krishna please help me somebody who is that who who did that hi who is that we do not know so from durjeet on the side someone is trying to destroy obi-wan's son pariksit huh see the damaging even if he's released from all this danger but he does not understand that that's why people cannot change his nature even bad people you get sometimes just to give them less and you you be kind enough no but they don't change that they take it in revenge okay i'll come back and check it second time how we can do so that is the situation or good so asa tama then again uh send some missile asura send the missile to kill the baby and which was who is the parikshi is the baby for which we are getting the whole bhagavata we started our entire book started with pariksit the king pariksit anyhow the sutra said hearing the wars of duty the lord understood that what was confronting har was a brahmana michael again released by the sun of drono in order to face the line of pandavas from the surface of the earth see krishna thought now the word is over let me go back home and everything all this conclusion and suddenly uttara running towards krishna help help help help oh lord o krishna this is my condition let me die but not my child in my own at the same time the five pandava brothers finding red hot missiles coming against each of them not only this brahmastra is trying to kill the baby in the womb but also the five brothers yudhisthira or juno and bhima nuclear saudi et cetera so it is such a powerful missile that in one stroke you can kill so many and arjuna and others also saw this it's coming towards us also seeing the perilous condition of the pandavas now everyone is helpless almost so seeing this perilous condition of pandavas who are devout devoted to him the krishna with all their heart and soul the lord shielded them with his mighty weapon sudarsana chakra krishna has the what you call round disc a weapon always in his finger like that there is circular weapon that is called the sudarsana that says chakra that is the name of the weapon and it is invincible krishna never applied that for any wrong reason but he thought that this will kill the five pandavas as also its next generation which was the parikh  was the next he is also being killed will be killed so he applied his sudarshana chakra to stop the missiles which is trying to kill all of them it's like counter acting with the missiles protected though brahmastra is invincible but brahma has been created by narayana therefore his power stopped all this missiles action so seeing the perilous condition of the pandavas were devoted to him with all their heart and soul the lord krishna shielded them with the mighty weapon the sudarsana the lord who is the master of the yoga and the indweller in everything revived and protected with his divine power the fetus within uttara which was the only trade of giving of the continuity of the pandava lineage even though brahma missile is as rule as a rule is resistable and indestructible by any counter missiles it is such a powerful weapon nothing no other weapon can counteract that but it was extinguished by the might of visnu's sprouse means krishna krsna's that circular weapon there is nothing to wonder at the performance of him whom him means of krishna the unborn and unchanging being who is in himself the wonder of all wonders and who creates preserves and dissolves everything by his power of maya this is krishna who is avatara who has created it is within his will creation sustenance destruction all his power so he for the good protection of the good he stopped this death or stopped this brahmastra's action and nullified that by his power now seeing this now the mother kunti that means the whole jatana uh could not kill them so seeing this kunti the mother of the five brothers started praising krishna with very beautiful praise mantras these are very vedantic it is really surprising that the lady those who say that women had not this [Music] not permitted to do this and do that but how they know all this vedantic concept unless they have no education so time was there when they were no less spiritual than the men and also in knowledge also so kunti watch now kunti says foreign [Music] up all is of them because when they were children this twin brother they were born details we don't need now that's true we should know that but no this is that's why to read this book is difficult unless you know all this background and remember them who is what and whose relation is what you know yeah it is enjoyable if you know that then all these things will be so clear now we are in the kunti mother kunti is now praising krishna as we read in the morning time all brahma is praising ma mother mother you are sachan you destroyed you protect us you are these you are that nothing praise the whole chandi we read every morning if not every morning three to three days a week about all the praises only when the praise was chanted after the war when this war is over and when a victory came to the good and the worst thing was defeated so here also the himacu said in the company of her sons and their wife drupadi kunti devi the mother of the pandavas who had been just saved from the brahma missile thus addressed krishna who was about to start for dwarka you can go to dwarka dwarka was the king was what you call the capital of krsna's kingdom and that this is this will go under the waters much later when he want to depart and it inundated under the ocean now they have excavated after so many years people used to think that these are all concocted stories now with the military and uh navy people they have archaeological people archaeological research was done and they have brought out from there and they found beautiful city in the city under the ocean and afterwards many structures have been built on over over over and the surface you cannot see that but under the water you can go and there is perfect drainage system big palatial foundation foundation of the palaces and most modern you equipped a city so that was the krsna's kingdom so kuntiden to being saved by this then the kunti said what kunti said namaste is praising krishna not as a krishna the man or the warrior or the protector in a physical level he says namaste purusam adam i salute the uncreated original being isharam the supreme controller the lord prakitang puram transcendent of one transcendent prakriti you are beyond prakriti that nature of diplomacy 24 principle you are beyond that o krishna you are beyond the prakriti you are beyond the tree you are supreme person and you are the uncreate being no one has created you you are the creator of the universe none has created you how can one lady say like that huh see what what a wisdom what a knowledge [Music] abiding within and without all beings none can see thee you reside in the heart of all though you are residing in all abiding meet within and without oh lord o krishna you are deciding inside and he's hiding outside of everything but ordinary people don't know this how can an ignorant person like me i am a lady and i am an ordinary person can know you the trans is your beyond all sense experiences you are the changeless spirit when you have hidden yourself behind the screen of maya with your own maya you have covered and you become a ordinary person like me in front of me you are standing how can i understand you i know that you are but i cannot understand i cannot experience it yourself being screened of my you have hidden yourself in the screen of maya your mysterious power that my eye is not something else it is your power maya binds us but maya cannot bind god god's power is maya no so he said it's your power you by your power you have mesmerized this and you have come down to us like a human being how can i ordinarily understand you as an ignorant spectator cannot recognize an actor in his theatrical costume costume so are thou hidden from the ignorant man hey an ignorant spectator the movie they can say who is playing in which role you know the player's name familiar with that how they know who is playing in what role so how they know that god you are the lord of the universe you are playing in all this role how can you know so ordinary people cannot know it by your maya the same maya covers the knowledge of ordinary people the same maya your power by accessing that power you appear like an ordinary man okay this is like the sankara's commentary sacha bhagavan that bhagavan who is ajah who has no birth which is infinite unchanging a biopicion universe it takes a birth like a human being by his own inscrutable powered maya similarly the same example um [Music] devotion to those people who are parang that muni the sages who are omulanam atma whose mind and soul is pure purified to give them devotion and love you how an ordinary lady i can know your glory so as a spectator cannot recognize an actor in the technical costume so are thou hidden from the vision of the ignorant man that being so how can we women understand you in this incarnation to teach through your supportive action the real import of communion through divine love bhakti even to the all lying knowing paramahamsas who have attained to transcendent purity only it is known by the takura also said by only god to recognize god is very difficult only few pure-hearted person can understand that so the sages the rishis those who are pure-hearted they paramhansas they only get for their enjoyment in devotion they can understand what we ordinary people understand you krishna beautiful namaste peru and these are all wonderful verses this is kunti's prayer is um people can meditate vedanta be done to prayer every day so now salutation to krishna krishna that krishna who is krishna is born of vasudeva salutations again and again to brahman of the upanishad who has appeared in his sporty manifestation as the son of nanda and on the you know nanda is the king of the cowherd clan so he was the enemy of the congs all the time but he was the lover of god and so they at the so he says that salutation to krishna is born of the vasudeva and devaki mother and father salutation again and again to the brahmana of brahmana of the upanishad actually brahman has become krishna has become krishna that's why i have my salutation to that brahman spoken in the upanishads who has appeared in his supportive divine manifestation as the son of nanda then next month [Music] in india whenever someone describes something very beautiful they say lotus eyes are like lotus so pete is also like a lotus so lotus means is most beautiful so that what is used salutation to the one having the world lotus emerging from his navel never did you see one krishna lying down in the over the snake and from his navel one lotus is blooming like that so he say oh a salutation to that narayana with the naval lotus coming out of his navel salutations to one having the world lotus emerging from his navel salutation to the one who is lotus eyed whose eyes are lotus and saluted lotus garlanded has been given a garland made of lotus salutation to the one with feet marked with emblem of lotus as if his feet is marked with lotus symbol namo pankajana beautiful prayer some people memorize these verses it is krishna we pray in many this can also be it prays [Music] salutation to the one with the pit mark with emblem then he says [Music] master of the senses just as you did release your your soro-stricken mother devaki from the prison cell of the wicked kansa so i have with my sons being freed by you o master from this several perilous situation you know the story when krishna was born he was born in a jail and when he has been born how he was released his father was released afterwards but so so he says as you have released your father and parents from the jail so you have released me also kunti mother kunti from the tyranny of the all the durham and others 24 verse many were the dangerous situations from which you did protect us from the murderers attempt to poison bhimasena from the incident incendiarism of the kauravas from the menace of horrible demons and rakshasas from humiliation of the gambling meeting from the perilous very various perils of our forest life from the trait of the weapons of great warriors in battle after battle and now from the threat posted by the missiles released by the son of druno yeah that is the point son of donald or sutham so he's saying oh lord you have protected you are always protecting us from our early days when we are being attacked when i we have been put into the lack house a made of lack and then to burn them but krishna protected them by giving guidance how to escape so you are always protecting whenever in our suffering you holding our hand protected us guided us all through the life when missiles anti-missiles all these big things are going in every moment you are so kind you have protected us all through so therefore you teacher of all the worlds that is there comes the beautiful statement this 25th verse very much quoted they'll give me more suffering but don't leave me that prayer is coming now guru is the one of the beautiful verse which is quoted in different places of this bhagavata and by kunti his praise kunti says verse number 25 this is the verse number 25 of chapter 8 1.8.5 25th verse on page oh teacher of all the worlds mr world guru is the teacher o teacher of the universe all the worlds let perils face us ever and unknown for it is in dangerous situations that we feel the presence of you to know whose visions best freedom from rebirth you appear whenever i am trouble i call upon you and you appear when you appear that is the purpose of life no to see god and god's vision so let perils face us even and unknown that means let it come again and again for it is in dangerous situations in bad risky situations that we feel the presence of yours whose vision bestows freedom from rebirth and what is the effect of seeing god your vision you appear when he called you are there and you appear when you appear your vision actually redeems us from the world and worldliness no more to be born if you see god no more to be born so that benefit we get it 26 thou whose vision is got only by ascetics who have no wealth except you cannot even be addressed by your holy name by men who are infatuated by the pride of birth power fame wealth learning and the like janmo is they cannot understand you those who are proud in the world with their money wealth prestige their strength military power all these they cannot understand your glory so you whose vision is god only who can get your vision by the ascetics by the sadhus by the holy people by the austere sadhakas who don't think my money is my support no my house is my support my friends are my support my army is my support no no no no you are the support only support for the sadhus for the holy people god is only support they don't care for anything in the name of god they go and like wandering life they lead what food they will eat where they will sit where they will die they don't know anything they all give it to god so you are the support for holy people like that not for those who have pride for infatuated by the pride of birth i am born in such a high family i am the king's family i am this educated family or pride for anything and power power fame wealth learning etcetera twenty-seventh verse [Music] this is verse number 27 27 salutation to you go krishna who are the wealth of those who have no other wealth you are the wealth of all who have no other wealth you are the wealth of them salutation to the one whom the workings of the three gunas do not affect salutation again to him who is absorbed in his own bliss who is all peace and who is the best toward of liberation to the jivas so you are the only redeemer you can free everyone from bondage oh so salutation to you who are the wealth to wealth for god is the wealth for whom well for those who have no other wealth that means all other wealth are meaningless for them they have given up for them you are the wealth god is developed salutation to the one whom the workings of the three gunas do not affect i am saluting i am offering you my pranam because you are beyond the three gunas gunas cannot we are all mound under the gunas but he is the beyond guna is the master of the gunas salutation again to him who is absorbed in his own bliss we need we we need to find some joy find some peace but god is joy itself so you are the bliss oh krishna you are the bliss who is all you are the peace and you are the best tower of liberation to all the created beings jivas i deem you to be the time spirit ishanam you are the controller the kaalo kalam is the time click click click click click going on no well anybody has control over that most powerful king or a poor person in the street have any control over time time is going on someone is being born someone is dying someone is sick someone is in danger someone is happy someone is unhappy time click click click click click click no one has control over time but you that you are the time big time t t capital in the the sanskrit is kalam ishanam you are the ishan the controller the master you control time under your binding time stops beginningless and endless no adi no beginning no one can destroy you you are bibu beginningless endless irresistible whose team roller movement makes no distinction between anyone as time moves on it does not make any special thing for anyone everyone comes in time everyone is born in times everyone is going through the experience everyone dies in time so you are the planner of that it is your power all good and bad small and great it is times process that brings about feuds among men leading to the destruction of all this big war is happening that feud also comes in time no and then how many wars happened in the world world war one two and so many wars massacres so it came in time and it ended in time killed people who joined this this side and who others joined that side and terrible thing happening and good things happening people are getting liberated from all bondage people are we beyond the three gunas becoming three gunas people are becoming charitable in time people are being becoming mean in time so it is everything is going on in time and you are the controller of the time great that's a different aspect but here is kalo he's the krishna is the kali kalo according to bhakti it is all praise you can think whatever you think yet male female gender is not the important point 29 verse says no one can understand the real intentions of your supportive actions when you do stimulus stimulate the ways of means in your incarnation none is specie especially friendly or inimical to you because you come only to redeem all the jivas and even your destruction of your so-called enemies is only to bless them and give them salvation we say oh mother why the asura in the morning which i know when when they look at the frightful face why didn't they perish because no by your weapon touch of weapon they'll be released from mondays so here also it says that your so-called enemies to bless them and give them salvation that's why you this world this fight goes on without understanding this main attribute partiality to you they say oh god is not looking at god is favoring this person and not to me but you are not you're not the person to favor somebody and disfavor somebody you are equal and all everyone gets their karma and karma follow the result of karma so is there any question or we'll end here better again you know janma karma chubby swag money adjacent [Music] the apparent birth and activities of yours who is unborn and unchanging spirit the soul of the universe in your incarnation among rishis men and some human and aquatic creature is indeed a grand mystery so you being all pure this grand creation of all duality is a mystery how this from out of one everything has come so it is your your miracle janma karma you are not the doer of anything awkward too you are worthless and you pervade everything in the world how to understand that this creation has come out of it it is very difficult to understand and then he goes on when as a child you did the mischievous acts of breaking the ardhan card pot he's talking about the mother kunti talking about when you are a baby you playfully you went to eat the mathematical milk pot or yogurt pot and used to break the arden pot and eat like sportingly when as a child you did the mischievous act of breaking the ardhan card pot your mother took a rope to tie you [Music] to a mortar as punishment when i think of your face at that time with eyes tremula's in fear and sending copious tears that washed down the corilium from them i am wonder struck and mystified remembering that you are the one of whom even the death is appeared he's saying you did some naughty thing and your mom was chastising you how oh you you are disturbing this and you are breaking the milk pot and they're eating their curd yogurt and all the sweets huh no ma i didn't eat no you yet and then mother tied him with a rope and he's saying kunti saying i can imagine that scene that your eye is currently almost there and tears are coming down and you being the lord of the universe you are playing like a child who is being caught by a trap no so mystified i am i wonder struck and mystified remembering that you are the one whom even the death is accurate and death gets afraid thinking of you and you are like you're tied with a rope and you are crying like a baby you know as your ways are inscrutable men speak of the purpose of your incarnation variously some say you the unborn were born in line of the virtuous judos in order to enhance the reputation of the royal house even as the sandalwood on the mallards mountain makes its fame widespread some say why you are born you are the god of the universe why do you burn some say this way praise you that some say that to born in the line of the virtuous judo jodo jodo clan you are born in the judo clan why to enhance the reputation of the royal house judges are great to prove that you have born there some people say like that others are of the view that you did take birth as the son of vasudeva and devaki because of the austerities and prayers they had practiced many you were born with vasudeva and devaki they did tremendous austerity and prayed oh lord we want you as a child to be born in as a son so because of the tremendous spiritual austerity and practice some say you krishna the lord of the world you have taken a birth in a previous birth as suitable as prishni for the privilege of being your parents and they by that by taking such birth you could work for the welfare of the world by eliminating the wicked from it so some say that your mom and dad in previous birth in the name they are born in previous birth sutapa and prisoning so they in the previous birth did so much austerity and pray to god please be i want to have you as my child and you put to fulfill that they are born as and to purify the whole world there are some others who say that you did take birth at the request of the brahma to relieve the earth of its burden the wicked and unrighteous men and save it thereby as a boat that is about to capsize is saved by throwing away its superfluous contents still there are others they maintain that the purpose of your incarnation is to provide men struggling to samsara the chain of cause and effect consisting of ignorance and desire of desire prompted actions followed by repeated births and deaths with material suited for devotional discipline of sramana manana hearing and remembering in the shape of the counts of your spotif so some say you are being born so that to redeem the world to remove all the negativities from the world and people will follow you in future and will listen to your glory remember your glory and purify their heart so after 35 let me end here up to 35 so these are different views why god incarnated so that was the okay so we end in verse number 35 8th chapter 35 we 1.8.35 with the different views why the lord has incarnated those ideas have been given but there will be a conclusion what is the ultimate purpose another 35 9 43 eight another eight verses okay om shanti shanti shanti harihum yes what are your views on religion and characters like jesus what is connection with this let me see so we'll go for question answer for few minutes what are your views on religion and characters like jesus same i think they are the same christ character the character of jesus they are also the same they are born in a similar way you can find that krishna was born in a jail so so christ's birth was also in hidden and then he was always under the eyes of the herald to kill him always trying to find searching him and also establish the truth uh he didn't take a weapon like arjuna like he didn't guide a warrior party like krishna did or through arjuna destroyed the durham but he did his way god comes every time the same same spirit same spirit and comes again and again and there they establish certain principles certain path in the life and therefore people can follow them in future so see after the passing of christ two thousand years how many forget about religion which is preached in the church that may be good that misfoot somebody may not suit but christ has impacted the life of how many limitless number of people all over the globe it brought peace that is the purpose as krishna has brought in india you go millions of people are krishna krishna krishna krishna they chant the krishna name and they get overwhelmed with that so that is the same god comes down and they are so pure thinking of them chanting of their name see that's why again and again christ also same person and and christ religion as
