[Bhagavatam - 3.17.1 ( Book 3, Chapter 17 verse 1)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbTxF-Shp48)

reading from the bhagavat chapter 16 of book number three and we did there the last that the bhagavan said the two attendants who didn't allow the devotees to come to visit the Lord not Ayana kumara and should have to go to be born in the species of asuras and who are very much famous for their antagonistic tendencies we are antagonistic to the Gods they don't tolerate the good people so and being there but they have because of the so much service they did for the Lord they have developed intense love for the Lord and then they will be very much antagonistic to the people holy people as also antagonistic to God himself don't like devotas demons don't like gods not only gods God Of The God Who is the Lord himself Nara you know he does not like that so this species of passwords they are noted for their antagonistic Tendencies so there they will develop when they will be born as a human being in a form of assurance need not have to be really imagined they have several Heads This that that but mainly they have their mind is diabolical negative and does not like holy people does not like God does not like does not like them Lord of Lord the creation so he said that they will have to be born in the in the family of the asuras and by by their very tendency they will be antagonistic to Holy people and I love the holy people because I love and protect the holy people they will be antagonistic to me also and there they will develop as a result intense antagonism to me me Mr Lord narayana and as a consequence their mind will get concentrated on me they are not thinking of the enemy who can take away your all peace who can destroy your own life so thinking of him you always be thinking of your enemy day and night day and night so it is called the foreign spiritual practice with this mood of enmity your God is my enemy as God is my beloved Lord God is my father God is my mother son or God is my friend God I God is my master similarly there is another Power God is my enemy so when you think of God as enemy then you will be always you cannot forget a moment no so if someone is foolish is searching for a person no suppose he police has declared but then she has done such crime or something police has declared that anyone if you can get him life or dead will get this much money are this much uh what do you call the prize and the man who is actually trying to hide he will be always suspicious looking in your nose he may have someone maybe is a good friend he cannot trust him or he is my enemy he may he may come to kill me so he's worried every moment all around see only his enemy so here who is the enemy the Lord God is the enemy so Krishna narayana is the enemy so we'll be always seeing the enemy all around that means Krishna all around every moment every birth nighttime he cannot sleep whether the guard is itself my enemy yeah so any meaning if seeing God everywhere then any person coming oh he may kill me or he may be his gods messenger so that is the end is sadhana in the in the spirit of enmity with the divine so they will then have communion with me through confrontation naturally they will not like me and so they will come to fight with me and we should help them to come back to me very quickly because constant constant thinking of God they will be purified by that and then they will finish their Earthly living and come and reunite with me so know that you happen to be curse them because I will and he said to the Brahma and others to the umat Kumar and Rishi kumaras that you cursed don't you think that you have done by your own wish you have done by the force of my power so that was the thing now after this last words now then hidden and hirana kashibu these two Gods will be born as hirana now today we are reading this chapter 17 chapter 3 book 3 say chapter 17 verse 1. now see you said what he said understanding from the words of Brahma the reason for their difficulty the day was returned to their Heavenly Abode with a clear and easy mind meanwhile the faithful wife deity was much concerned to learn from the husband's worth that her offspring would be would be enemies of gods Devas after 100 Years of gestations she gave birth to Twin Sons at the time of their birth many potents of frightening nature were seen in heaven the middle of the world and on the earth so everywhere some evil person is born so everyone felt some bad Omens there were earthquakes in the mountain mountainous regions that these are the bad signs everywhere because these two evil people are getting born asuras are born to destroy the Peace of others before their birth even they are very coming create that havoc they're there were earthquakes in mountain region Strange Fire appeared in different quarters fire here fire there shower of materials fell to the Earth like heavy rainfall and commits portending evil appeared with different comets falling of the Comets in that destroying this piece that which many all natural disasters started because the evil are going to be born soon powerful winds with whirlwinds as their army and clouds of dust as their Flags Swift to one all rolling enough rooting uprooting in huge trees a storm started uprooting the trees when everywhere Havoc started we can find sometimes now no all the time fire fire thousands and thousands of records and fire that's one incident but that time it happened everywhere here and there all over heavy rain heavy swelling of the ocean and all bad environment all around in the nation heavy rain clouds appeared in the sky hiding the Sun and the moon and covering the quarters with uttered Darkness sun is covered Moon daytime is covered with Darkness night time is covered with Darkness so all the quarters are dark dark no sun no moon appeared in the sky like ones chicken with grip the ocean stood to its depth seemed dwell throwing up its wave your arms while dried up legs with turbid Waters and sunken lotuses present to the sin of an utmost distress so everywhere nature no this as if the ocean is swelling up from there and they we call tsunami you know is all this that's a sign of bad bad bad we call Badoo means everywhere which way rain fire Landslide cloud swelling of the ocean water the eclipses become frequent eclipses occasionally when the astronomical World it happens and on solars actually it's Luda like leaves no but this is happening now and then seem to be surrounded by circular phenomena there were Thunder claps without any cloud in the sky while Caverns seemed to give out terrific defibrations like the rambling of Chariots to the hearts of Heart of villages Vixen Ram vomiting fire while their cry is mixed with those of the foxes and now seem to potent evil The Village lions stray dogs I mean stray dogs standing here and there with uplifted head how old in a way that seems sometimes to be crying sometimes singing the street dogs they started crying sometimes howling sometimes honey how mad as it were mad things maddening things are going all around as if they were mad and intoxicated praying loudly and kicking the Earth violently for no reason the horse is normally should graze but they started jumping and running and digging the Earth as it were with their hoop legs the wild brains of the asses started birds from their nests wild brain of the acids startled the birds from their nest the birds are sitting and the horses are howling in such a way that's not and they they got frightened and and the birds are running away herds of cattle began to purge and urinate unusually both in the pastures and in their pains that means animals are also getting frightened and as if as if death is occurring because of the two sons born the couple Iran naksha he run into ship the cows began to tremble in fear and healed blood in the place of milk uh the clouds began to rain excreta instead of rain excreted the images of deities began to shed tears all the gods and goddesses their temples as if they're crying the gods and goddesses and the tears but uprooted even without any wind suddenly the tree is standing still fell down the inauspicious planets began to outshine and then to drive out the auspicious ones and by their contrary movements they seemed to fight with the latter the in the in the planetary World also it began to the inauspicious stars are there and auspicious starts are there so in auspicious stars become mild and prominent auspicious ah planets seeing all these are minus potents all ignorant people except sanaka and the other kumars were agitated with fear and even thought that the time of delus had come yes those four Rishi kumars they know what is going on now is born so we will up raise their Hood when he will Reigns other evil people who are normally cannot show their power they start raising their head no in a disciplined School The Naughty Boys they keep silent when they find that the Administration is weak they must the teacher is very weak then what happened they become dominant they disturb the class they disturb the Peace of other bully bullying the other children so like that it similarly in the planet everywhere that type of disturbance is found now these two archetypical demons revealing their inner and might grew soon into mountainous proportions with bodies as hard as rock hey these boys soon getting stronger and stronger and growing they are born to their strength and their body as the Invincible no one can kill them no one can cross them with their crowns almost touching the skies very arrogant people touching their Skies or spreading luster in all directions wearing brilliant armbands West brain bands that pooped the Brilliance of the sun to shame the very costly shining bracelet and these and that wearing as if the shining like sun they walked about with the Earth trembling at their every step arrogant people what did you see when very very in the in the movie we see no when ravana walking how you are so like at the hand they become up so that's why they're there as if and every step as if the Earth is trembling in fear every step no so this is the and holy people the meek they walk even no one can hear the footsteps no that's why you say that those who walk with making noise they are calling us pieces because that is the sign of arrogance and disturbance and raja's manifestation of rajas satika is soft sober and Thomas is like that so these are the description how hiran action here in The Crucible too are born to destroy the Peace of all everyone and they walked about with the Earth trembling at their every step according to the order of their birth from himself and their mother soon the prajapati gave the name hirana kashipu to the first to issue from himself and hiran naksha to the first to be born from the mother what does it mean according to the order of their birth from himself and their mother soon the prajapati gave the name of hirana kashipur to the first issue from himself and hirana means gold Akshay means the eyes whose eyes are like gold or what is what is the meaning of Deku of these hidden with the support of their inherent strength of his arms and held by brahma's boon making him free from the fear of death easily brought all quarters together with their Guardian deities under his control so out of that hirana kashipu he brought all the gods and goddesses uh God of other gods of other goddesses means what they are the departmental heads so with the support of the inherent strength in his world with arms money with the power of the arm and helped by Brahma has given some boon that making him free from fear of death so no one can kill you no accepting God let's say to God has to come down narayana has to be born so they become Fearless and they brought all the power of the arm brought all the gods and goddess in making preference easily brought all the quarters all the equation east to west north south these quarters every in this direction in that direction in that direction in whoever was there all the gods under the control brought us together with their Guardian deities the quarters and who are the controlling gods of that quarter no it is very our system is very good modern social equivalent democratic system they take advantage of this time now department division of own labor so God has created the quarters and somebody to overlook that quarters no so similarly all the quarters four quarters and who is to look after their quarter those gods how they brought under control so that is the hirana kashipu what is means what golden okay so he is wearing okay brought the four quarters and all the gods who control those four quarters under his control under his control now he's the younger brother who is the hidden naksha whose eyes are golden his younger brother here on naksu who is very dear to his elder brother elder brother is younger brother foreign dear to him and cooperating with him always because they will be in the animal in the same line friend their brothers as also same tendency therefore went to the Heavenly region Kiran naksha went to the Heavenly region with mace in hand eager to give battle Miss Gada in the hand went to the heaven to give eager to give battle okay come fight with me quick in moment armed with Mighty mess around with love and Loud sounding anklets and Priceless necklace understand and fearless and proud because of his consciousness of the inherent strength of his body and mind which was fortified with the power of the booms obtained structural into the hearts of the Gods Devas who play their way like servants before the Garuda now hiron naksha he don't know because she could eat this four quarters and their God's control these younger brothers he said okay I can also go so let me go to the heaven so he went to the heaven therefore and going there with a base in the hand and because he has got the power already the same way from from Brahma that they will be Invincible no one can kill them unless God himself no so and he went and declared war and seeing that might all the gods they became like the serpents before the Garuda this example goduda it's the sermon no so in front of a tiger amen just imagine and before the tiger and a mess a what you call the a cow or a sheep similarly all the gods become so cheapest so powerless given the example in front of the guru as all the snakes and get frightened and lost so it happened finding that the intro and the Devils had disappeared from their place they left the place ran away for their protection and the guru comes naturally they pray all they pray suppose the tiger is chasing you see now you see the uh multiple Discovery Channel no so when they are saying and what happens to the all the praise they write try to run away run away run away just Escape their life no so finding this condition in the god of Gods and other gods had disappeared from their place on account of fear of his might that the Lord of Asura rode several times intoxicated deprived and self-esteem no so they all just to save their life they were driven away from heaven then returning from the expedition from the heaven the mighty Ashura desires of having some water sport entered in the extensive and deep Waters of the ocean like a huge elephant in rat so now Heaven is done now returning from that ex Expedition this Mighty Ashura desires of having some water sport just for fun entered into the extensive depth of waters of the ocean like a elephant in a rat means what a condition happens if the elephant tries to enter into a rat that means it's all split and broken and thrown away it is just a pond giving the examples are very unique the elephant is so powerful and it can be destroyed this little rat and this can be destroyed in a twice so that happening when he entered into the ocean who was the ocean baruna Varun is the lord of the ocean equator no hindro was the Lord in the heaven he has been detroned now going to the borona the god of water when he entered into ocean burunas barunas following not only buruna he is Following also consisting of all the ocean dwelling creatures the ocean and ocean gives place for so many Oceanic creatures no how many varieties of fish in different layers we see in the a channel what is that Channel Discovery Channel and you need to see they all got frightened all get lost got frightened by his might and energy although he did not kill or disturb them in other ways and played in all directions to power of places so they all try to ran away ran away ran away for a thousand years that Mighty Ashura ranged through the ocean raising huge waves by its breath and smashing them into minute minute particles which is iron mess finally he returned into baruna's famous city bibhavuri buruno the lord of the Water World so he has a palace big Palace so after playing in the waters I just put fun and then he went into the baronas famous city which is called no now a challenge comes to baruna 27 verse then meeting baruna the master of all aquatic creatures and Lord of the patala yasura which is the derisive love made a sec sarcastic and mock prostration at his feet and just it is just any type of insult you can say he is just in a mock in a mockery did some salutation to whom baruna god of the Netherlands as if his salute and said sir come for about with me are you not the lord of the Lords come I I don't fight with you 28 you are the master of all Guardians Divine divinities of the various fears a famous person is indeed no you are a great person you are more powerful you are the you are you are the master of all Guardian divinities guardian divinities means Divine entities to control the guardian of all small units of living entities under the Earth you are the master and guardians of relief in his various fears you are a famous person you are also said to quell the pride and power of perverse men whose ego knows it is unknown that you can destroy the ego and the power of people you can quell them you can calm them and you can control them you can smash them that proclaiming that you have conquered all datas that you have already known that you have already killed many Divine debtors means asuras now before and dhana was you are a very powerful person oh Lord refuted to have performed a Raju sacrifice also in days of old in previous early days you conducted on rajasu jagna what is that means he is accepted by other all the kings that you are the greatest Among Us no so you have conquered that name and fame and power you are controlled much earlier all these your achievements so you had great power so I want you to come for a bout a fight with me let us have some fight though that's ridiculed and provoked by Ashura in his own winning Pride the Lord of devotion somehow controlled his anger that is the point good people powerful people really spiritual people they can conquer their anger he is poking him and making him ridicule oh you are so powerful you did this you did that and everybody get power you have and you fear all other evil that those are run away and you conquered them no no so come to me and I want to have a fight with you knowing all this that is ridiculing him that he controlled his anger and his anger by his discriminary power and said to him he told hiranya naksha their younger brother oh dear one I am now on the path of peace I don't want to fight I want peace I have totally given up War I don't know nowadays I am falling path of peacefulness I don't want to go to path of War I do not find anyone in the whole universe who can be what the contestant to satisfy and all around what they are like you I don't find that there is anybody in the world who will be contesting with you except the Supreme Lord mahabhisma himself only Maha Vishnu narayana he can be your contestant because you're so powerful who will contest with you who will go to have the courage to fight with you so he should all lead the Lord Nara you know he can be your contestant Maha Vishnu there comes the point that how anger is generated against Maha Vishnu oh lord of us asuras many a hero like you it is said when to fight with him at first but remain to pray afterwards as they went to fight with narayana and later on they prayed for Lord please protect me no in order to Humble in order to Humble persons mad with over winning pride and haughtiness like you and protect the good and the holy ones he has taken several forms as incarnation you know this Maha Vishnu has taken many many times she was born many many times to destroy the haughtiness and pride or people like you so he doesn't know he has been Avatar many times you go to him verified and soon will you be lying on the battlefield then you will fight with narayana and he will dead you go to fight with him we are not competing to fight with you I am not in the mood of fighting anymore I am I want peace so you go to the Lord narayana then with your pride humble and a pack of dogs surrounding your body no that means you will soon the fight die and that dead body is eaten by heart jackals and dogs they will be eating so he said that they are hence the chapter 17. so this is a beautiful story two brothers were born and gradually they grew up and one went to the four quarters and control the gods and goddesses of the four quarters and brought under control and the other brother went to the heaven and all the gods and goddesses seeing his powerful presence with mace in the a mess in his hand they all ran away like the serpents run away seeing the guruda Eagle Eagle tree Eagle Eagle bird no Garuda a special narayana who is guruda he's a narayana's carrier foreign so see like that all the gods played away then he was very powerful and then he came down and entered into the ocean water and disturb the Aquatic all animals and everything and then went to buruna baruna's quarter and asked I know in a fake language of Praise oh he was such a great power at this and that come I am I am I want to have about to fight with you and then baruna knowing what is going on inside she said I am in peace nowadays I don't fight whether you go to fight with Lord narayana and he will be your befitting candidate to fight with and the Lord narayana with that he will lay flat and you will be down and the dogs and jackals will be around your body means you will be defeated there go to fight with narayana so that is the 17th chapter ends here 18 chapter starts hey again the maitrea again started saying the fight of the farmer with Vishnu advised by I don't want peace I want peace so I don't want fight so you go to Lord narayana Vishnu now this hidden naksha he went Pride to narayana see that part ashura's challenge to the Incarnate more in different incarnations so this Incarnation bore incarnation said rejecting the suggestions of baruna the heroic Ashura in the pride of his might transported himself rapidly to rasatala to search for another Planet another plane he went down to the another plane where hori as directed by SRI Narada so Narada guided him for all he said you want to see the narayana to fight go to rasat Allah there he saw the Lord in the form of the cosmic bore you saw there on board shukara dharam prep premium foreign there he saw the Lord God Vishnu in the form of cosmic bore huge board gigantic like mountain with the Earth uplifting in his task you know so powerful like that you can live the whole Earth and having red eyes whose clear seemed to absorb the Life Energy of asuras seeing him they are to relax who is naksha whose eyes are gold let out in ridicule saying hey it is indeed wonderful is hurry after all a wild animal and God is now an animal he further said oh stupid fellow come for a fight release the earth the earth belongs to us the inhabitants of Russia the inhabitants of rasatala into whose region it has come by itself in the deluge sent to us as it were by the Creator whose scoundrel of a Deva hiding in the form of a boar you shall not escape with life carrying this Earth so long as I am present here so you cannot you cannot do anything um so long I am here I can destroy you life you have indeed been made into a patterned board by our enemies the Devils the gods have made you a little heavy by feeding the gods the Devas to destroy us you know you have been created to destroy us but the result now will be the opposite it will be a step to your own destruction now narayana you will now die in my hand by foul means you have been killing asuras you are narayana but you took the form of a boar and in boar form you are killing the asuras no having failed in face-to-face battle you are weak you can face to face do battle you took a form of a big boar and you're holding the Earth come inside direct fight you are weak you run away to come direct fight after killing you you have but little strength and courage but plenty of Deceit and cunning is all this good words are coming out to the mouth of whom naksha that we have but little strength and courage is talking to God in this vein plenty of Deceit and cunning you are doing and then fighting with the asuras and trying to destroy us I shall assray is the grip of my King's Men and wipe their tears when you head when your head has been smashed to smithersen means mirrorness by The Stroke of my mess the rishis and others will gather there to perform your funeral of Secrets will perish themselves like rootless trees as you their root would be the dead of bed by then so if the root you are the root I smashed with my mess in such a way he'll die that's now and as you die all the gods and goddesses who Praise You So High this sages to go therefore I'll do that so I can end here so this is very exciting area and okay there is a question of how to kill krsna in the tenth control is there a symbolism that you could explain uh if if it is true some say these are all symbolic but some say it is history but anyhow yes these are all symbols symbol of our when we become arrogant we become full of pride that's Thomas equality takes position of us we don't honor The Honorable people we don't pay respect to the holy and holiness and that in that pride and arrogance we do behave which is uh and like Assurance and that causes the destruction of our spiritual life total depth of our spiritual life that is the a symbolic Ashura is inside therefore we are always in our day-to-day life also we are always conflicted with the good quality and bad quality in our life now how to fight with them how to um not to go like this asuras with that time we don't honor our respectful people if there is some respectful person who insult them as we find the hirana aksha Iran naksha went to the bore form of the Incarnation and talking so arrogantly you are this you are dead you are cunning you are destroying the asuras from the heaven so so the Arab anger Pride and all these Petty things come in life and they destroy our peace so so with the Ashura inside that is the symbolic idea and then all The Godly things we discard compassion Holiness Purity love humility their life's beauty is where arrogance or humility Pride or the type of Purity so these are the things so actually that is the symbol and we then ignore God and God's personalities holy people are being misused so the question comes pasturas don't like God how come in the puranas love Shiva are some Buddha ganas ashuri and others less so I think so there should be is a one category of people Surah means the Devas the Divine qualities of Surah means opposite qualities and bhuta means is the embodiment of some element Elemental forces maybe they love to Shiva that means they are already pure let's say they work for the good of the that's a Shiva demons destroy the acidic things destruction so they are not falling in the category of Asura Ashura is those those forgotten their Divine characteristic and their full of Thomas but they are also fighters they see both good and bad dramas Army was also gunman and others they are great Fighters and ravanazar means also fighters Surah so she was there Shooters their they were devotas they are only for the good to as she was Shiva Gaya they work under the instruction and Direction and purpose of Shiva and asuras go from the beginning against that which is auspiciousness Devas and go against all us preciousness all pure things so they are categorically probably separate I heard during summer program under this time some devotees had purchased a mutty of mahakali and then afterwards came to swamiji to help them take the mutty away why did that happen master of precautions to give Fierce images some incense every day I am puddled how the mother in any of her forms be dangerous for anyone in what way dangerous it is not that she is dangerous but the child feels dangerous he said not if the mother comes with fearful eyes and just for fun before the child sometimes they play playfully what happens to the child will cry out huh it is the same mother but child will cry out that time Oma don't don't show this form I don't like it I don't like you know these are like that waving the incense and other things to prophecy it that fearful aspect which I cannot bear you know God has two aspects mother Kali has two aspects no one destruction side another protection side so when the destruction site comes we want to hold on to our old patterns and we think that it is dangerous for us but it is for our spiritual benefit mother works like that so mother is all auspiciousness but in the fearful images of mother is a destructive image for destroying our evils so when someone destroys the evil it is very difficult to take it that's why as we say when you make a credit card use of credit card and go on extending your loan you can go very easily but when you become careful and you want to pay off the loan of the credit card then it is really crying situation so it is like mother when they come to destroy our evil that time we cannot take that form of man as a Wayne mother because our Earthly mother think of that when Earthly mother becomes little frightful to us as babies you are doing something wrong and Ma occasionally comes hey you did that and with the great eyes the child is it not by by that scolding what mother is doing improving our character no so that we don't do it therefore when you keep that form say my will not do anymore so when you say I will not do any more click that you offer your ma every day ma I you don't want to be bad and make me good make me your child so that I so for to grow in devotion all the spiritual practices they are keeping and it is said that if you can if you have two form of your mother why shall you keep the peaceful form of mother why not your sweet mother and it's just in our day-to-day life what we lose you have maintained photos of your mom when once she was very angry and doing something to chastise the child for their betterment that form you take a click and when his mother is lovingly taking the baby in the lab no and smiling and which will you take so they said in your home keep that picture but if you cannot bear that that picture though that is true mother sometimes does that mother is not always smiling it otherwise she's not a genuine mother sometimes for our good they appreciate our goodness and want to wear better so when something bad to chastise that that fearful aspect of the mother we cannot take it therefore for worship we take the easier aspect Advanced people they worship the fearful aspect describing about mother Kali you see the whole starts her brought it out think of that sun is individual and double that sun is being scattered scattering proud of light and burnings so this is the mother's form of destructive aspect for destruction of the evil negativity no so that aspect you are not fit for that Ordinary People they are not fit to have that type of courage to worship that God no therefore yeah the Sami Vivekananda the stars are blotted out the clouds are covering clouds it is Darkness vibrant sonnent in the Roaring whirling wind at The Souls of million lunatics just lose from the prison house wrenching trees by it by the roots sweeping all forms of path the sea has joined The Fray and swells up mountains waves to reach the peachy Sky Baba you see I just really read that before the birth of hero naksha the sea swells up as if it is touching the heaven not tsunami thousand times of tsunami so this type of the force is working in the nature so who can worship that aspect of God unless there is a thousand thousand shades of death breaming and black to reach the peachy Sky Plus reveals one every side a thousand thousand sets of death be grieved and black so if you go that that who loves who can love this mother so your question is this why mother becomes angry they take away our mother is mother but only to take away our negativity or our attachment it brings this type of move money effect in our life and Ordinary People are not fit for that that's why we start with the benign aspect of the mother it is worshiped so much because it's benign faces so Serene so loving though destroying we know that she is destroying the demon knowing fully well she is destroying the demon and face is so Serene with blessings and Boon and other things I feel this mother is for my Safety and Security but that mother who is destruction but is destroying my evil and you are to when you to destroy the evil you have to pay a price of it are we ready to have the power to wash the terrible aspect of Destruction really not that's why but that's why some improvement as you said probably ask somebody don't worship keep your this type of mother's palm give it to us but why how he took it tell me how he took it he knows mother Works in both aspects he's matured to understand that but even we are intellectually talking seeing such mother's form will be terrified therefore if you have any Mother's form just to please mother I don't want to see anything please help me please guide me Please Release Me From bondage no therefore do you offer a worship and this and that is done this is my thought it may be different to the explanation also okay so huh so so we end here today thank you for joining and we are late little bit uh it may happen now onward because sometimes it will be led to connect all these gadgets together so we end here and now our next class will be 7 30 as we do the Santi Gita we will be meeting again you okay [Music] um [Music]
