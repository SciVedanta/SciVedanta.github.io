[Bhagavatam - 2.9.24 ( Book 2, Chapter 9, verse 24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IUNtg-UFe5I)

[Music] i salute bhagavan sri krishna sudeva the destroyer of the demons kangso and chanura and the darling of the mother devaki and the world teacher of the whole world we salute him again and giving on peace peace peace be unto us all so we are reading bhagavat and we are in the book 2 chapter 9. and here brahma was the first creator in hindu trinity creator god there are three here narayana is the ultimate then narayana gave boon to brahma and brahma created this universe now brahma requesting narayana that how did you you are only one without a second brahman etc but how you have created this universe how creation comes so brahma's request to the lord was we read the other time brahma requested the lord narayana krishna that o brahman who hold the vedas latent in you i am highly satisfied by your long and concentrated meditation for enlightenment on the work of creation the worship and prayers of perverted yogis never satisfy me in this way is talking that o brahma you are holding from brahma came all the four vedas and also the vedangas all the scriptures and all creation has come in the physical level or subtle or anything so i am highly satisfied because you did austerity creation is done through austerity in hinduism everything comes out of tapas tapas tapasha tapasha so and your sincere tapas austerity concentrated meditation focused withdrawn from the whole world focused in me as a result this worship and prayer excels the prayers and focus of of ordinary yogis who try to concentrate and whose mind is disturbed in every direction so uh may good fortune befall on you ask of me whatever boon you want now i am very happy to give you the moon for i am the grantor of boons to everyone but know for certain that there is nothing greater to be achieved than realizing me the greatest bone if you ask if you can realize me that is the greatest boon material moon name fame prosperity glory that will be coming but that will end but that is the highest means it pops up brahman pops up in the material world by tapas so this is saying that realizing him is it because his bhakti book this book is called krishna and narayana if it is shiva book then you'll see shiva all i am the granter of everything no so this is puranas are like that to increase the devotion of that particular way of thinking my guru jagadguru it is like that my adorable god is the god of all superior to all so this is the referential attitude of a devotee your attainment of migraine is because i willed it you did some tapasha you attain me now i'm seeing you see me i'm talking to you it was because not for only your tapas austerity but it's my grace i gracefully guaranteed that that you are able to perform even to do tapasa you did austerity don't think that you have done by your own power it is my power i am gracious i am giving you the power that's why it said we try meditation it does not happen and ultimately said god's grace is necessary no so simply thing that you could do austerity because of my grace you have see you're now seeing me it is by my my grace prophesy you did you thought to purify yourself to concentrate what tapasha means concentration not at paying attention to the external world not even to your hunger thirst bodily needs all concentrating authority or state means what austerity australia means what fasting not thinking of the world not going for anything concentrating concentrating concentrating that means your total mind is not on me only so this has happened because of my grace you always say god's grace me too that you are able to perform tapas inward concentration and my command was also the result of my will i will that way that's why your mind prayed to me i will do tapas and i granted that tapas that means it is all god's play going on that's the major thing when you stood utterly confused as to what you whether you should do it it was i who directed you to apart from tapas that was the core of my being and the meaning of tapus is myself what is austerity means reaching me that's the trust in the beginning i create everything by tapas by tapas i support everything and my tapas i withdraw everything to me by austerity or by concentration i created this universe and i maintain it by tapas and it consumed into me by tapas a glory of the austerity glory of one point in focus on god that is the subject here the goal of all human beings [Music] now today's reading verse number 24 brahma in response now said these are all krishna narayana said my austerity i gave you the power my power you did austerity by my wish you saw me to merge in me it is by my guest that is it is you are nothing it is i have created everything by my cosmic intelligence now brahma said today's reading verse number 24 on page 131 oh lord you are the overlord as all the indwellers of all beings you have by virtue your honoring awareness and insight into the hearts of all and knowledge of what they yearn for you are the lord of the lord that's why you are overlord and as you are indwelling in the heart of all because of that virtue you are aware what is going on in everyone's heart you are the noir of every thought and insight into the hearts of all and knowledge of what they are in front and what they are asking for see you punish it that brahman being one he is fulfilling the desires of everyone your desire my desire i am asking for this this i am i craving this all it is he is the he knows what i want he knows what you want in all the universe because he's the indweller and the conscious entity behind oh lord still dean to grant me what i asked for so i am asking now what may you be pleased to make me understand how i can know you who are really formless in forms gross and subtle you are formless in your nation but i want to know give me grant so that i understand how you are the formless really formless but in form you see the gross form you i see you and the subtle form also you are there oh lord oh sir grant unto me that knowledge by which you of irresistible will are able to bring out this multi-powered universe in sheer play by your own wish how you brought this universe this earth scots stars and galaxies everything just hereby you wish that's why he said just we are hearing from the condition and whole universe came out my mere wish how you do that please tell me you are the one articulate truth i understand but how you by mere wish you are the formless entity but how you became in so many forms how you manifested yourself in so many ways and multiple powered universe by sheer play and you are sustaining it after creation is it's here for yes we see our forefathers saw grandfather grand grandfather grand grand grand all those lineages thousands and thousands of years everyone sees this universe it is sustained it is maintained and withdrawn into thyself as a manifestation of your unique even inner inherent power so atma mayam and you sometimes consume the whole universe no creation no it's called the prolia permanent dissolution so you you create it you sustain it and you dissolve it what is that power just like an example just as a spider spider it brings its own saliva and then it makes a net you know and when it can take out take back this this juicy thing when it is just creating if you just strike it then he goes back and goes back and withdraws the entire thing and goes up once they make the net it cannot dissolve for the spider but for god he creates its sustenance and it can consume into him everything comes from him manifests and then consumed so it is your like the spider brings out from within and it draws into itself it's wave with such ease so you as to god you did that universe is created out of you it manifested like this and you are consuming again within yourself if you wish ordered by you i shall perform the work of creation without any negligence i you have selected me as brahma the creator you are bestowing me the power by your power i will do that equipped with the knowledge by your grace may i not suffer bondage by engaging myself in creation but only i pray if i start creating then ego will pop up i am doing i did this see every one of us whatever we do say i did it and i want to take the credit of it glory of it but i don't want that type creation brahma is saying i don't get entangled i should not get entangled by you have ordered me i'll have to do your work but bless me so that i don't get entangled into creation see the whole philosophy of hinduism runs in this point on the whole bhagavad-gita says you do everything do detached whatever you do do this way and and don't perform all actions in the rama from swamiji's do everything but don't get tied up with anything like padma patricio the water in the lotus lip the water stays there as it were but there's no stickiness and our all problems are their stickiness we stick and we cannot depart could not detach so brahma is that's why he brahma is brahma muramba has also said that mind born a mind born creation of the lord lord created out of his mind thinking they say this is brahma and brahma and you create he's a big boss narayana has no time to create himself and you start your work brahma all the power being bestowed to him but he may narayana is free he can consume everything but he created ask you you start creation and brahma is saying please give me the boon that i will do as you ask me but only i be detached engaging myself in creation that i may not suffer bondage by engaging in the creation o lord you have received me with cordiality taking me by the hand as a friend dude but i am after all your servant so long as i am tirelessly discharging this duty of creation of beings high and low as your servant may i not develop the pride that i am brahma the unborn and independent being so so everyone that it is the beautiful prayer of brahmaden that i yes i will do the creation as you have said i will do whatever you have ordered me this creation and all sustain but but let my ego let my pride don't get entangled and let me think servant i am your servant swami vivekananda said dasta bhujanam servant i am your servant not in this life light of life after life nasta bhujanam janami dayani you are full of compassion you tell me what you want to do it is your will i am nothing so swami vivekananda song also said one is now instruction on the supreme knowledge now the lord now this is the prayer in between brahma said that i will obey you i'll do what you say but let me make me detached let me feel that i am not connected with this and no have pride that i did it because you you it is you are doing i am an instrument exactly that idea i am an instrument you are the machine i am the machine you are the machinist operator i am the house you are the indweller in the house house is house if there is no indoor there is no house if there is nobody we call abundant house it's a dead body but wherever you find any house i am the house but you are the indweller who lives as conscious entity in everyone so let me do your work as you are ordering me to do but let my pride let my ego does not come in between let my attachment don't get along the world will be all joy if one can learn a little bit of that our life is so much problem why you know we are attached if you detach even your body what is that this body was not with me forever that's so abuse so if if if someone is 50 years old before 50 years this body was not there and you got the body and it grew grew every day growing in every day old what is no more and anybody is coming but my body i the body understand and is suffering understand i am atman oh my mind stay in joy and bliss attachment and pride these are the whole let's say ramakrishna summarize the whole bhagavad gita it is gita gita tagi it is the renunciation detachment that is the essence you need not to read the bhagavad-gita only know this diagonal live in the world detach but it's a very big struggle and this is the maya though we know but we don't understand intellectually sometimes but to play into practical life is totally impossible unless you are abram again unless you're very advanceful this point comes the surrender this idea of surrender dedication comes god is the doer i am nothing why would that be impossible impossible means hard not impossible possible but with many tremendous dedication is necessary tremendous austerities are necessary to detach every day to think all our suffering comes because of that who can give me any suffering if you detest see the that pew does not get attached to anything you see it it gives you shelter you get up it is there it breaks backs it stays stays its police police is unpolished on police it matters little so if one can be feeling like that this is the body's body jawada it is like the piece of food piece of plank what is that to do consciousness is something else and that as a embodied being i surrendered me when i am in the body consciousness unmanned jesus to say no this when i'm in the body consciousness i think i am the servant you are the master you are the lord i am your sermon jiva buddha when i think i am the individual soul then you are the cosmic soul i am the individual soul but and when i think i am not there in this body-mind then i am tao no i am that but it says that yeah if you say on then there is no question of attachment there is no detachment everything is you then to whom you let us suppose in your home if it is not my thing i get people get tempted to take away something if it is not but a nice nicer thing people are supposed there is a people enter into some place and see some costly thing people tempt to take it because it thinks that is not mine i will be rich by having this but if you know this is yours this is yours to why what will you do will you whose thing will you still then you are you are there that's a brahmagana state the the whole world is yours because there is nothing but you that is a that's a state of knowledge but i am not talking of that we are talking about our condition where we don't think that way we cannot feel that way and thinking will not do we are also to work on that meditate on that prey on that and live that way feel that identity now the supreme instruction now given by the lord to brahma brahma said help me to be detached help me to be free from pride now the lord said verse number 30. he says ganum this knowledge which is the paramam gujjam which is the most secret knowledge of material science there are physically you can understand this knowledge is the knowledge of the subtlest knowledge paramount may just begin or someone is telling you not to give you intellectual knowledge i'll make you understand that that means sadhu-guru brahma-guguru or god himself giving the teaching to his own pure son like ramakrishna giving to vivekananda so that they can understand that's why i said sarah awesome i will talk about the subtlest of those responses because you are my very dear you are my part as it were i am food you are a part grihano guri i am describing it listen listen to that [Music] as who am i i will tell you jatha bhabo what are what form i can i can carry and what is my guna the qualities and what are my karmas and knowing that you get the knowledge of the truth tattoo that means truth by my grace so it says by my blessings you shall have that knowledge of my truth what i am what my manifestation what are my forms what are my attributes my activities so i shall let you know because you are so sincere and so pure before creation 32 hours i alone was that that is the again i was alone alone means means not the thing we think about alone means people feel i am alone so get frightened it is not like that alone means loneliness god didn't feel loneliness but he was only alone here miss only i was only and i thought okay i will be many and then creation came so he says before creation i alone was there being no other existence of the nature in the cause and effect different from me i am the cause i am the effect and i am there is nothing but being nothing but brahman nothing but that ocean of consciousness nothing i am saying consciousness who will say consciousness whether it is consciousness or dullness who will say that only one alone that reality so i he's saying i now not i am not talking to you i was alone only one now before krishna alone was and there being no other existence of the nature of cause and effect you now see everything is happening cause and effect and they're different from me this cause was i am the cause and i am the effect ocean is the cause an ocean is the wave effect the same water i was alone a pacific ocean says i was alone that means ocean was the only thing and all the waves and ripples and so much of variation and all the forms have came from where the from the ocean the i am new waves i am the ocean i am the cause i am the effect there is no third cause and effect normally we always say why it happened because somebody has done something so hard agent is necessary but at the beginning of this creation there is nobody but only me i and i became like this it's very bhaktivu it is brahma is saying creation and all this but see how vedante is the foundation of all understanding it is nothing huh the creative cycle ends when the creation of this creation will be end i alone exist all the waves go what will happen ocean will remain now ocean is turbulent with waves so ocean is wave wave is ocean and when there will be no wave ocean will remain is it not ordinary vedanta non dual medant absolute for this universe which seems to have a separate existence now this table is there the roof is there sky is there earth water element are there trees plants human sub-human animals plants everything is there but we seem separate from god no but he says he's also myself deriving his sustainability from me alone and when everything dissolves in its cause in mahaprabhu dissolution what remains is only my self aim capital i only remain so i in my absolute form i in my manifested form and there is no other person brahma vishnu had said all created by me they are actually talking about brahman the absolute but because it is a book of vaisnava book so we say it is krishna that i cosmica is the krishna avatar krishna that's the point but cannot but he manifests and unmanifests there is as you say there is no maya even who will do i am the only reality why are you talking about maya there is no maya there is no power i am only i am this way i am that way that's why ramakrishna said the snake and its wriggling motion it is inherent and it comes out they suck to philosophy what is presented on the atman without any substantial reality apart from it that means atman and what fails to leave anything as residue apart from the atman when it ceases to be presented no that to be due to my divine power maya that's my maya shakti that means what is presented on the atman without any substantial reality you are imagining something as if there is no god one is no atman only the world is there many people they don't believe in god where is atman what is brahman i see this universe this is the only reality so what is presented on the atman without any substantial reality apart from it capital and what fails to leave anything as residue apart from atman when it ceases to be presented know that to be due to my divine power maya so it is happening because of my maya maya shakti maya means the power of creation sustenance and destruction tree power is within maya such presentation is like a reflected image that power is what as you see reflected in me this world is reflected real sun is further away but you see the reflection only so what you are seeing in the mind it is reflected in the mind the mind without the mind only one son and i'm going to give the example of the pots there are many jars 10 20 jars if you keep 10 jars 10 sun reflected only one original sun and 10 reflected sun are there the stain this earth planet stars galaxies are there so many is reflected where it is deflected in the mind mind and you destroy the cosmic mind you know mind is removed break those jars then what will happen only one sun that was there that is there that will be there whether you see reflection that time also the original sun is there and you destroy all these reflected jars that also the original sun is there so that reality is brahmana the great basic elements of nature combine and constitute all the objects high and low pure and impure though entering into these combinations formed by them these elements do not lose their elemental nature and take on the qualities found in the combination they can thus be said to be in these combinations and also outside them at the same time similarly i constitute these beings i as atman brahman constitute i have come every wave constituted by me is it not the ocean water everywhere where the small big bubble form is only the eye ocean portion of the language he could say that i am the pacific ocean i have created all these names and forms no big small nothing but me you see though separate as it were i have entered into them and in this sense i have entered into them i have created them and i have entered into them means ocean is there also water is mine not minus ocean waves and ripples are not minus ocean it is happening on the ocean ocean is seen in another form reflected in this way and when it smudges it becomes one again ocean yet i have not entered into them in the sense that my pristine nature is not affected by the nature and experience of the combinations that make up the bodies of beings what the seekers of the truth has to grasp is that that substance which persists always through all its transformations into its various effects or forms but suffers no diminution in the process as also when all these effects of forms are eliminated in the causal condition suppose when the ocean was come we've started we have started ripples started and waves start so when this wave started as the ocean has entered into the wave but ocean does not lose its sanctity ocean does not lead his pristine purity when it is formed that's also the ocean oceanic energy is there a syntact when it dissolves then also the remains devotion that means brahman remaining the same this creation sustenance and destruction may happen but it does not affect the ocean it does not affect the brahman it does not affect that with the reality practicing the highest samadhi or concentrated abs absorption in me perform my commandments then will never be infatuated through all the cycles of creative activity in which you are asked to engage yourself so what is ultimate teaching try to understand this philosophy that it is all mean nothing other than me if you understand this and do your duty and with meditation experience practicing the highest samadhi you you now contemplate and think that there is only one the one manifested this way as the world and diverse universe and he has entered into it in the sense because we as if we are seeing as a wave separate from the ocean that's why she say ocean has entered oh it is ocean only was entering question does not come and when it dissolves it remains the ocean so no it is all oceanic play it is all the world display of god and then you do your creation activity with the combination of this and that now you can start knowing that this combination is not changing the characteristic basic characteristics search it out on the characteristic saccidananda characteristic remaining the same this play is going on and now you perform my commandments then will never be infatuated through all the cycles of this creative activity in which you are asked to engage yourself people has fascination i created i i write one line perfume lines i am attached to that because my writing ah you have composed a poem you are you like that oh it's my poem and you will be happy if someone praises that that means i have my association with that but if you think it is the oceanic energy it is the sachidiana on the energy that has manifested you have nothing to take glory on that part it has come out of you you are only an instrument then in that perfect knowledge and perfect somali you will then not be affected so [Music] [Music] those who cannot care they're they have so that's why mediocre people we are all especially those who are can do we are not concerned about them but he is teaching that how to be you brahma you create but you can be detached if you know it is not not my doing it is his wish ramakrishna said everything is is his will here is mother here is brahman here is narayan forget about this name that's revenant is very simple they can understand don't get deluded by the name narayana or bhagavan or commander kali or father mother forget about that the one principle they are saying in so many language the shokuli tu manicha it is my cosmic will means your cosmic will that is the cause you are all willing yeah your your wish is this manifested universe when people foolishly say i am doing no one can do anything it is you doing now how origin of this book came out bhagavatam commending brahma 37 verse the commanding brahma the master of all creatures in this wise srihori the eternal being disappeared from the vision of the former even as he looked on a brahma was seeing narayana appeared and he gave this advice and suddenly after finishing this advice brahma saw the lord disappeared brahma who had the germinal condition of everything in himself in him he's a creator so all the creativity thought was inside the brahma he the lord created brahma giving the potential power to manifest all this universe no so disappeared na brahma who had the germinal condition of everything in himself then saluted srihari joined hands and began to create now brahma started creating by saluting the lord that is project all beings in the previous creative cycle ah it is like the jatha purwam and the hindu psychology is that nothing new it cycle after cycle the same cycle cyclical you know all this creation comes in cycle as was before the top urban tata but but it takes billions and trillions of years of the existence is it brahman in the same in every cycle is the same brahma or does the soul individual oh that may be different maybe with different souls i don't know because god and that's a big soul it's a big power maybe this is one brahmas day and night is big the whole creation is comes and creation goes so brahma lives 100 years calculation is so big you cannot imagine calculation one brahma cycle is some millions and billions of trillions of years suppose think that how the sun from the sunday planets came out it's only small example this creation he goes on millions and they are all calculation is trillions of years and human years so the same they say no there may be another but after 100 years of one lifetime they are all calculations very complicated complicated thing to understand even in one one period they are called golden age the four jugas says that yeah right yeah but that is the question is that the lord huri with joined hands and began to create brahma started creating what creating mean creating means what what projecting what was in his mind ramakrishna gave the example the granny the grandma normally when they used to have agricultural system one season goes one types of plants are germinated and that is season is over then they collect the seeds and keep seeds in some pouch that's called hot spouts many varieties of seeds are kept one and when the regular season comes again after a whole year maybe next year then they put them again the same types of plants germinate for food for flowers etc etc so the creation goes on like that that is project all beings as in the previous creation that's why creation is infinite like that if we go to the beach you saw a whole day sit there whole day and you have the capacity to see how many waves and ripples and forms have been done today now you go tomorrow you will see the waves and ripples and forms are coming the same way we may say little difference today or tomorrow but in the total cosmic creation it came the same way one after another one after another once brahma who was fully wholeheartedly devoted to the lord engaged himself in austerity consisting in jama and yama desiring the good of all created beings then the most beloved of brahma's offspring who was noted for his devotion to service his introspective nature and his love for god he approached brahma to know the working of the cosmic power maya of the lord maha vishnu the master of maya after having pleased him ms brahma by his service humility and discipline then they were sinarada seeing brahma his own father and the grandfather of the worlds in a pleasant mood put to him the same question that you have now put to me then sukadeva said that that narada appeared and naruto also put the same question as brahma has put the question to narayana naruto in turn imparted it to the sage vessel of the great spiritual prowse so naruto then gave that knowledge to bashdev and who sitted on the bank of saraswati was absorbed in contemplation of the supreme being so naruto in turn imparted that knowledge to basudev and vasudev as such a such a great spiritual personality who have what you call that who have divided the vedas and brahma-sutras and all these things he was sitting on the bank of mother saraswati river river saraswati seated on the bank of the saraswati was absorbed in contemplation of the supreme being he was thinking of god who bears one vyasa sitting on the bank of the river holy river saraswati that's contemplating on god and that time naruto appeared and 4 45 for here your question beginning with how this world came out of cosmic form of the lord i shall give answers to the narration of this great text the bhagavata so he said now i am going to give you the story how it is created in this naruto then bhagavata is created so now this is the end of the chapter 9 so we'll end here for few minutes to go for some questions and chapters 10 will start next day book 2 2.2.10 next day we end here om shanti shanti shantihi harihuma krishna stew yes question is without cheat be water then unchanging god is same as changing world i cheated means it's a technical term very cheat the changes you see but without changing the original you are seeing the rope but you are saying its snake that snake is the bibarto snake has not come rope is rope all the time without changing that it is creating a illusion so chidbribato then unchanging god is same as changing world yes if one can see like the example given that nothing has happened to the ocean ocean remaining the same only it has created some ripples but ripples are nothing but ocean so nothing but you see the waves you see the cow motion everything is only ocean ocean ocean so is bhagavatam then proposing that theory what is the theory the chit will ask it is the play of the chaitanya yes where the world is seen as real actually bhagavat is talking about that god has created he had creation theory it is god who has become everything simple thing we see wrongly because of our ignorance by his power of maya the lord god has made this world appear like this whereas without changing the conscious substantive conscious nature of it yes another question sri ramakrishna stresses association with holy and pious men and women who converse about god where does go to search for such people by living in this world that's true sriracha stresses always association of the holy he says holy company yes holy company is always best ramakrishna says huh to get out of this melody of the samsara so holy company is the only source which can free us from all defects so where will you get the holy company that's the question where does where does go to search where we do go to search for such people while living in this world that's true while you find holy people you are too big question so you have to search for that and you have to search for that and you have to sincerely seek for that and holy company means holy men that's also true holy company means holy books also holy scriptures anything which brings holiness in the mind anything brings that holy ideas in the mind that's holy company you can sing a holy song you can listen to holy talks that's holiness and holy person yeah always there is some holy person everywhere so but you have to the holy places go to the holy places you have to try whether it is available or not who will tell that this is the holy man to holy man to understand is also difficult so how many people are there like that that vaisnava scripture says that who is called holy holy is that looking at whom or coming in contact with whom and daughters few people you call it it is open but some people do not know their some people have see some people have rod that's the point so holy people are bhushna literature says looking at whom or in whose presence your mind you are reminded of god or your heart goes to think about god know that there is the holy man holy man that person to be a holy man vaishnava pradhan devotee of vishnu jahari hairy lay by observing whom or by coming in contact with him your heart feels shride in the heart fury manifest krishnanam that means you will be reminded of bhagavan lord god's name will be coming in your heart or you'll feel like thinking of god so this is the but you have to find out who will be the holy person we cannot give any sim outside nature i may talk big things but my eye may be a worse person many people can do dual drilling no can speak good words and give good lessons but their life and character is centered around god or not we cannot judge from outside but this much we can see if we are sincere then we can feel that we feel good being around them being in their presence so many people used to feel that when i i say many times that swamishananda when he was here many people used to go and even sit with him and talk to him no and then they will find that they are they go back with little joy little peace that means that peace and joy you can feel being in presence of a holy man when you go back or you talk to him then you get spiritual inspiration of course both side is there the students should be capable of understanding that so ramakrishnamushi many people of calcutta came to visit him but when they came to visit him the islam got the greatest benefit of it they got the they coming there they saw the ecstasy they are absorbed in god consciousness and but others they came and they are very restless even that company to be staying with ramakrishna itself become a problem they wanted to go to see the what you call the garden house and other when ramakrishna was speaking about spiritual ideal yeah they have no attention to that side no so it needs the characteristic of him some someone should have the recipient mind if i am not hungry you give some food what does it matter even the best food you bring i am not hungry so it is no ruchi in ameruci but who has really hunger and find such a person they will understand many we are reading brahmana swami's life and his reminiscences so people are going and seeing and coming back they feel a pull for him attraction for him and being in him they feel uplifted so these are the signs of a great souls um it is difficult to locate by seeing outside even some some some some sadhu came to see brahmananda the president of our spiritual order and then they saw that he is sitting with a fishing rod catching fishing not actually not catching he catches and then releases but still is a firm like a child but a person who is coming to see that seeing a holy man sitting at the fishing rod what type of sadhu is he and actually many people misunderstood but they are pulled in another way to see his greatness how his mind is so high pulling the mind down to our level so holy company holy people are to to understand you need some holiness in yourself but at the same time holy people will be for in huge association we can feel some touch of holiness touch of joy touch of peace anything more okay okay so we end here then om shanti shanti shantihi peace peace peace oh we'll have our next class at 7 30 and that topic is santi gita the peace song you
