[Bhagavatam - 2.8 ( Book 2, 8 Chapter)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jcCA_gh_IyY)

[Music] i salute the lord krishna the son of vasudeva and the destroyer of the demons kangso and chanura the dear darling of mother devaki and the teacher of the world i salute sri krishna the bhagavan again and again on peace peace peace be unto us all so we were reading the bhagavatam and we are in the book number two and lord's glories we read that he can be found everywhere he is present in everything his vedantic idea in a devotional way it only speaks differently that that brahman is everywhere as vedanta says we see brahman but we don't recognize but i am seeing all brahman only with the name and form that's why ibraham says don't seek god see god i am seeing god but don't understand it so that was the way and the glory of seeing that and then that seeing god everywhere that was the chapter we ended now this we are starting to the eighth chapter the 20 questions of parikshit the dying king not dying king who is almost ordained to die that king pariksit is waiting for dying and the teacher is sukadeva the great says so he's talking about and he's asking his last question so how to spend all the moment in god consciousness so that was the discussion so here the rajo watch raja means the raja parikshi the king pariksit who is in the mission that great forest holy land and all the sages have gathered around and you want to know about the ultimate goal of life and last few moments thinking of god and god and devotion so then he he is putting his question the the greatness of bhakti and the devotion how glorious is bhakti because bhakti is spontaneous bhakti is a natural thing in our life devotion we all carry devotion means love love there is nobody in the world who does not have love in the heart but someone loves one object someone loves the other object only the subject of their love is different so now here that but bhakti is love when it is only goes to god in the dualistic language then it is called bhakti otherwise it is a mundane love worldly love and that love is the same sanctified pure love but because it is not transmitted directly the pure it gets little polluted because of the mind and emotions and ego which true through which it percolates so raja parikshit then said this question to whom and in what manner did narada the sage with super sensuous inside impart the knowledge of bhagavatam in obedience to brahma's command describing and elaborating the countless attributes of him who is beyond the gunners of prakriti meaning what it says the narada is a ordained by brahma he is always charged with extreme devotion so he goes all around the world and sings the glories of god so that to evoke the devotion which is hidden in the heart of all that is the naruto's work if we as we get some job assignment this work or that work and that one brahma gave him that job they will go around the world and chant the name of the lord and create devotion in there which is hidden so so the now the king parikh is putting that question to whom and in what manner did this naruto this says which super sense was inside he imparted the knowledge of this bhagavata what we are reading the wisdom of the bhagavatam how he gave it narrated in obedience to brahma's comment they only after realizing the highest they could have just kept within themselves and in entered into samadhi but they didn't allow brahma didn't allow that how to transmit that wisdom for the good of the humanity to the masses so he was ordained you go with this job your job is to preach the message of the bhagavata to the masses so it says in the obedience of brahma's comment and what to what the obedience what command is describing and elaborating the countless attributes of him god is beyond all duality but he has so many attributes also his infinite compassion his infinite beauty his infinite glory manifesting through the nature through individual and to the cosmic his his presence in the stars and galaxies all these glorious manifestation of the lord so who is really beyond all description see how bhagavat is beautiful it it just gives a touch of the non-dual and the dual we are living in the dual universe that duality is the how that transcends into that absolute he has the full knowledge the king parishes is such a student he knows all these things but he wants to absorb more and dive deep into that that that god who is beyond all glory no glory can limit him beyond all description success beyond all glories all forms of expressions so it had beed to meet charming so i want to know this oh you the greatest among the new arts of truth that means he's talking to with humility the king is humbled before uh the um the sukareva and saying that oh you the greatest among the knowers of truth i am an aspirant of knowledge of truth o great one tell me about the doings of hurry a wonderful prows gory god who has descended in the form of krishna he is he he has infinite power and prows and strength about his words sanctifying says saga so that i may have my mind absorbed in krishna the soul of all beings so that you tell me something to inspire me so that totally my mind gets absorbed into khuri the narayan or the lord himself whose words if you hear it sanctifies your heart that is the beauty of bhakti school bhakthi school thing that's whenever you [Music] their style is you take the name of the lord you sing and dance in the name of lord and by think about the glorious acts of his life when he was alive how he acted how he lived how he played with his childhood to till death all the leela it's called the divine sport think of that it's very easy you need not have to go to the very deep philosophical rationations and discrimination and all these citizens those who can do but ordinary masses thousands and millions and millions of people they don't go for higher philosophy but they are devotion so how they can listening to these words if you say people get purified in their heart so so that i may have my mind gradually withdrawn from other things more and get absorbed in krishna the soul of all beings he has to see vedanti is always at the background krishna they could have said this much krishna the soul of all beings that is the beauty of bhakti and ghana absolutely detached from all other objects and concentrated on him and him alone may i pass away in that state of mind so this is my last days few days i am in the world so that thinking of him listening to his glories i will be able to give up this body and my mind will be not thinking of anything of the external world of name and form but it is only in the divine form of oh lord hari krishna fourth person soon does the lord enter into the heart of one who hears and studies about his dreams and excellences with a heart full of faith and devotion as if that's the quickest way of spiritualizing yourself you feel attracted your fondness grows if you can do that that thinking of him your mind gets absorbed and full of love and you get absorbed and absorbed automatically you are not to renounce vedanta says not this not this not this it's very difficult how to give up but fall in love with god you automatically will be giving up that's the beauty of bhakti it's a positive approach to negative approach and one approach is not this it is non-eternal it is non-existential it is not ultimate truth so i give up and analyze god is not this not this not this but the second point in the vedanta also says i am that consciousness and bliss but but this is not this is not this is not but here bhakti says i want to see god and i don't want to get attracted to this name and form and the external beauties of it i want to see the lord who is in my heart and who supported in a human birth and was like a human being he was born and cried and we and played and smiled and all these human emotions when thinking of him continuously continuously the heart will be purified and sanctified and totally absorbed in god world will drop off automatically and with that absorption when one opens the eyes he sees god everywhere nothing but the end result is the same but this bhakti path bhagavad bhakti it is called vedantic bhakti two types of bhakti one bhakti is only not knowing the glory of god just be becoming focal and fanatic but universal love with the utmost focus on god is the real vedanta so soon does the lord if you think of god this way day and night the lord god soon enters in the heart of one who hears and then studies about the doings of god and excellence with a heart full of faith and devotion i love god and i have faith in him and getting absorbed and then they get up get out of the world's problems fifth person through the portal of the years he enters into the heart lotus heart of his devotees who hears about his excellencies and when he so enters he the lord purifies all these impurities of the heart as the autumn season clarifies the turbid water of the rivers as if like a blow it comes like a stone and takes away all the dirt and dust so similarly when someone hears the lord's word enters through the ear and then goes into the heart that is the point goes into the heart then all the dust and dirt all our negativities all our worldly thoughts being washed away and then it will be giving the example like the dust and dirt is cleared from the turbine turbine of the rivers [Music] a man who has thus been cleansed of all his sinful tendencies and found rest at the feet of the lord krishna is like a traveler return home after a perilous and trying journey he will never more lead that home the feet of krishna as he this person is like a tired pilgrim who went into the journey of the world you know as we are all we have come down from our divine self and we have been in the life's journey and hindus believe not only this human birth birth or birth going through different accepting different bodies and as a really tired soul taking ultimately refuse in the lord gets perfect peace here never to go back into this dirty world again so that when the that a man who thus has cleansed of all the sinful tendencies that means the mental tendencies all the negativities the thoughts negatives and found rest at the feet of krishna he is he is like a traveler who is returned home after a perilous and trying journey he will never more leave the home which is the feet of the lord lord krishna beautiful that's why it is a beautiful water and the sanskrit is wonderful but it gives a depth of it that we have no time to read and enter beautiful pravish [Music] [Music] the waters you know in a river pond and pool you can find some scum you cannot see the water but when the blast of wind blows the scum is driven away similarly the lord's words and his glories when i hear from narada that will purify the heart of all and also of me that is the king pariksit as this now put it sixth question 20 questions parikshit has put how many questions come in the mind of a pure soul but exceed questions for illustration seventh part says the atman is spirit non-material how does it then come to have a body that is material is there any cause for this or is it purely accidental first question god is transcendental no absolute it is full of bliss and joy so atman that is the spirit ajaha is unborn srijyoti bhutani he creates this universe so non-material substance and how does it then come to have a body who is bodyless how you can be entering into a body that's very good question we call maya these then let us see what they say but the questions are very intelligent questions is there any cause for this or is it purely accidental the birth of god when he comes down as christ as buddhas as here we are concerned concentrated we are talking about whom we are talking about krishna so if he is the lord of the universe beyond all the dualities and eternal and absolute how he will be coming down here first of all that's impossible infinite becoming finite this one is it possible how can it be possible and if it is so is there any cause to take a ordinary human body and act like an ordinary person man eight months man it is sin has so many distinct organs and limbs now the supreme person from whose navel the world lotus is said to have emerged is also described as having the same kind and the same number of organs and limbs what then the differentiates god from man many people say that's why it is many people say i am also i am also an incarnation and christ is also incarnation ramakrishna is also incarcerated what is the difference if you take the body of ramakrishna or say christ before the medical doctor will they find not find the heart the lungs the kidney the hands the feet the eyes so it is the same the head the brain neurons what is the difference between this incarnation krishna and me an ordinary guy see very wonderful question this is astro it is this book is bhakti but bhakti has his greater understanding here how it is that that it is is it what is the difference then what differentiates between krishna and me what differentiates between sri ramakrishna and me he was a human being he has his high temperature sometime no he was old he had cancer cancer was in his body also as in our body also so what is the difference between these two that question brahma the controller nine bars brahma the controller of all is said to have come out of the naval lotus of the supreme even the brahman the creator has come out of the fundamental creator god in in according to this philosophy now no no that's why you find that there is a narayana and lying on a snake big snake and he's lying down and there is snake is who discovering the head of narayana and from the naval region comes brahma and brahma creates this whole universe so he says brahma with the controller of all this created universe is said to have been have come out of the naval lotus of the supreme being and is sitting there to have created all objects within his blessings so brahma by his own directed by narayana he has created the whole universe surely there must then be a difference between the supreme being and the jivas because if narayana his he creates brahma and brahma creates this whole universe and we are created by brahma so there should be some difference between me ordinary ego and the narayana himself the lord 10th verse he the supreme being who is the lord of maya and indweller within all beings as also the source from which creation sustenance and dissolution takes place in what form does he remain when he dissociates himself from his inherent creative power mama this question is a serious question he you are talking about krishna or ramakrishna the same christ so he with the supreme being who is the lord of maya he is the master of maya we are under maya we are created by mahayana and he is the maya master of maya he controls maya and we are subject to maya so the in and this this he who is he he is the lord he resides in the heart of all not only human all these living and non-living that consciousness is here under the table the consciousness is here also somewhere manifest some are less manifest brighter manifestation lighter manifestation but everywhere the consciousness permeates no so here krishna he is everywhere in a dualistic language they say god resides in the heart of all right gita says in the in in every being that atman which is there he sees that that atman his vision is the correct vision so he the supreme being who is lord of the maya and the indweller within the beings all everyone's heart he resides and the source is the source what is the source from which creation sustenance dissolution all these take place in what form does he remain now in what form does he remain when he dissociates himself from his atma maya so when he detaches from this world then why does he decide then if the creation is not there where does he go there 11 we have heard it stated in the two contradictory ways that the world's and their protectors are formed of his limbs and also that the world and their protectors constitute his limbs how are these contradictions to be reconciled now see there are two answers to this question so he said we have heard who is saying we have heard it is pariksit is putting the question for if she says the king says the questioner says we have listened we have heard before from other sages and saints that two contradictory ways that the worlds and their protectors the world and his protectors means his masters that gods and goddesses are formed of his limbs they come as if a part of the blimp of krishna the limb of the avatar and also we have heard that the world and their protectors constitute his leaves all this added together is the lord how can we reconcile these two contradictory ideas what are the lengths of time involved in a culpa or a full cycle of time and in a big alpha intermediary cycle of time time what is time length of time it's very the hinduism there are kulpo bikalpo and all types of thoughts are there that means what is the length of time which is involved in a culprit means in a full cycle of time full cycle of time how how big is that time and in a big alpha means intermediaries cycle that means our say our our life say someone living hundred years so the length of time involved in a couple means it's a whole length of time no hundred years but what is be called for intermediary cycle of time meaning say yesterday was one day that is gone today it started at certain time this day is going on i will go to sleep this day also go so it is an intermediate cycle of time how are you to understand time which is divisions in the past present and future how i can think that the lord was one and absolute but in that absolute infinite how the time has been divided the past present and future the three divisions of time how we could have them what is the span of life of different types of beings what is the span of life human as for the like men women with trees means far forefathers or suppose we are here those parents have passed away what is there our time one day is how much 24 hours okay this human calculation so suppose what is the one day for our forefathers they say one year hour one year hour 365 days is equal to one day of the four fathers who have passed away they live in a subtle level no one dies until god realization but so long you are here you are here in this house or here in that house but that is relative here you live 365 days that's called one year but there you live there's also one year but that will be long time in human calculation that's why in human in our hindu rights and rituals every parents are there some oblation is given to the forefathers every year one day it is like giving food to them offer your respect and love as we do in our childhood is to go the day starts we start our day with touching the feet of the father in indian tradition mom starts that is that so so yesterday and today we have 24 hours but for forefathers hour 365 sub days will be one day for there they live in longer span that's why what is the span of life in different types of beings like the men women like the pit trees like gods and goddesses et cetera et cetera so that's 20 questions no he is putting all these questions do you remember all the questions now baba you have to remember the question and the teacher will have to respond one by one you must tell me about the actions action of time in its micro and macro aspect time has two aspect micro aspect macro aspect also tell me what realms man can attain through his actions by doing good job which really you can go after death hierarchy yes that's why hindus have so many heaven and help others have only one heaven one health no christianity islam they have died at one heaven one hell you do good thing and divide it go this way go that way but hindus have option a hell which type of hell first intensity of suffering one grade two great three great four gate seventh grade you can be you know according this is very rational you do some mistakes so you should be punished so you should get till this lighter punishment so you go to one plane and someone did such very heinous some bad things to others so he should be punished so he should go to lord you need good charity and love somebody and if you get say maybe one heaven another did much greater dedication and and did something good job good reward so you go to the fourth and five-star hotel and go to any other heaven means all places of enjoyment so so many where then his question is that also tell me the realms of man realms man can attain through his action so this is very important how do we serve and live in the world and do add to our karma and that karma will give us the freedom to live in which plane which level we are for the jivas that are desirous of getting various embodiments as devas and others all of them which are formed of the gunners of prakriti tell me what combinations of karma lead to that kind of birth suppose someone is what type of karma one should perform to be born like a god they was different and gods also have different levels of purity so what type of karma will lead one to that type of higher life tell me also about the origin of the world and how this a world this created this entire world is created like who the earth this this plane this earth you see this the planet on which you walk walk we eat we sleep we are born we are dead so where did it come from tell me also about the origin of worlds like bhu earth patalo netherworld that means the dark area bright area medium area and the quarters into all the four quarters and these these east west north south the sky planets the stars the mountains rivers oceans islands etc and of their inhabitants who live there who is capable of living in the earth planet who is living capable of going into the heaven planet who is going to netherland neither neither zone and who or the sky there are some live in the sky some in other planets some in the stars we think that we are the only living entity but they are thinking this question there may be some some type of different type of beings are there not like us but in that context there are some jivas who what is their karma can lead them to there and what type of people live there ocean in the ocean we know ocean is ocean but it gives sustenance to how many uh aqua life how many aquatic lifestyle and on different levels who is living in the bottom of the ocean that type of fish and a aquatic animal they're different from that of the another level but who who took birth there who become that aquatic animals so planets stars mountains rivers oceans islands etc you ought also to tell me about the internal dimensions of brahman or the whole universe conceived as a cell this whole world what is the he was said about the internal dimension of brahmandu this brahmana means this is on the under means the egg they they created egg the the earth is excel like form that's called brahman of what is beyond it when what is the center of the created earth or this world and what is beyond the egg form of the lives of the great men and of the stipulations about burnas from ideal of society so you tell me about how in the whole universe is concept in a cell what is beyond it and the lives of the great people under the stipulations about the astra borders the student life married life then retired life and life of renunciation and four societies borno brahman shatriya basha sudra in those who live in the intellectual level and learn about scriptures and other things brahman they live only about god and god consciousness scriptures and studies them that is their life and warrior class from the protection of the country but this protection of the good people and destruction of the evil so shut your class that is the second born basha in a good society there should be business class people who will be always helpful for economy of development economical development of this society and there should be some group of people sudra working handymen you may have all intellectuals or warriors and their roof is leaking there is nobody to prepare or clean and stop the rain so you cannot survive so this is holistic life was satisfied in the earlier time and the division and then make experts a handyman his father i saw we have one handyman my friend of ours here his son this this small tiny boy his father is doing something technical and he is taking a screw and driver and this and that see how he learns seeing the father he is getting added when he will be little adult he will know so much about the fixing things no and suppose someone's father is a professor teacher mom is a teacher so this child is seeing the mom dad is reading mom is intellectual level no he quickly adapts those qualities so that's why that is the benefit of the four classes of people in the society brahmin class they are intellectual they will read the you see you go to south india you'll find the even the small boy you are girl they are chanting business also namade is there no we learn it after 20 years 30 years when you are almost becoming old that time he started chanting those things and but they they learn even when they are on the cradle hearing those mantras so that's the greatness of the system of brahmin caste they are expert in that they are expert in worship how to do worship for you for him and to please lord and how to purify the heart but all hindu system said all these will lead you to the same goal no is higher and lower it is a means of releasing god serving god anyhow so the question was that that barnastroma ideal what is the ideal society and what is the border ideal and this uh astrum ideal i have told borno is forever brahmin means intellectual class of people shout to the warrior group military protective force of the country then business without business society cannot survive no and then working hand and these are the four and in individual life individual life if you take then it is the brain is the brahmin head it thinks always thought right wrong d is that no then until hand is the work it's [Music] so you can you can put it into your life and can yes that is the way probably the scripture suggests so describe the wonderful actions of the lord in a sporty manifestation as divine descents incarnation as also the yuga's many times and the duties pertaining to a particular yoga is each time there is a duty and that becomes predominant duty of this particular age so tell me what are the duties of particular age what are the time period of that what are the common duties of men and what is special duties what should be common duty for all humanity and what should be the individual special duty for individual person what duties are to be followed by a person practicing different traits by rajas and by persons facing emergencies that means what type of practice what type of duty are to be followed by a person who is practicing different traits many business and also by rajas that means those who are king at the same time they are noah truth rishi their duty should be something no because they are king kingly duty is also there though they haven't realized the soul na what is the name what is the name janaka janaka was the king at the realized soul rishi rishi and raja raja means the king and rishi is this age so what are the what will be the duty of that category of person what will be the duty of a trade business who is doing trade and by persons facing emergencies tell me about the number of categories like prakriti matata that's all sanka philosophy what is prakiti what is what and their nature what effects they produce about the way of worship of the supreme being about the practice of yoga with eight steps so tell me about shankha tell me about patanjali all these questions inform me about the way the yogis progress in hereafter those who are practicing spiritual discipline in yoga path and what happens here after after they die what they do after death how the yogis destroy the linga sarira the subtle body with which the jiva transmigrates they in the subtle body they do much yoga practice some will have to come back again and some may be purified themselves too high they live in the subtle body how they can transcend that social body to causal body and transcend the cordage causal body to merge into the brahman the samadhi so and the nature of scriptures like the vedas subsidiary vedas dharma sastras ethiopia traditional history and the puranas speak to me about the creation protection dissolution of all beings of the ritualistic duties led down by the vedas and the smithies of desire prompted rights and rituals and of the three ends of human life dharma ortho kama so tell me what are the duties and responsibilities what is the dharma what is arthur what is kama and what is moksha all these details i want to know it is so we end here today 21 verse and then we'll read again next time from 22. so i have no question now i will have no question lot of already questioned and we should not have another question if one escapes life and death through moksha where does the soul transcend to there is no question of transcending the soul when one escapes the life and death through moksha that means he's already liberated liberated means his soul has attained perfection that means he attained the identity with the divine so there is no question of going anymore another question in developing don't take any more questions we will not take any questions today we'll do it tomorrow i can do that in developing love for god and doing spiritual practice how do we make sure that our efforts are not spilling out through holes in the field like ramakrishna's farming irrigation metaphor that's true whether we are really practicing spirituality or it is going into the black hole and not black hole true true we have to be careful really are we progressing in spiritual life or in the name of spirituality we are declining yes purity will come in the heart love for others will come genuine attraction for purity truth and god will develop spiritual life am i progressing in spiritual life is one sign am i inclined for god and godly things or i am getting interested in world and worldly things more and more so this this will be the short distinction and how much i used to hate people how much i should criticize people how my size to see the fault of everyone how less i am seeing fault in others how less i am doing any thought of harm to anyone even in the insect and the holy people will not ask for any harming even the insect so okay we end here today we will have our interesting class of swami sarvopriya nanduji at 7 30 please come at 7 30 in person and online okay see you then om shanti shanti [Music] foreign
