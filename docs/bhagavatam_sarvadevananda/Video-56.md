[Bhagavatam - 3.15.32 ( Book 3, Chapter 15 verse 32)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUa64ar2KA8)

foreign [Music] the guru of the world and the lord of the universe I salute him again and again from peace peace peace so we are back to our reading of the bhagavat Jeff third book chapter 15 and we are on verse 32. on page of this book 212 bottom no we are reading that you know the four Rishi kumaras all right they went to see the Lord bhagavan the Lord narayana in the high heavenka and there are two guards who are in the gate and he was he he was me saw that this poor boys they did not they're like as simple as like a child they are oblivious of the outside outward things of life and not careful about and they are almost naked boys like ramakrishna like a have no care of the body and anything so they appeared and they wanted to see narayana but the God said what will you do you boys get out what is your business with the Lord no no no no please we are coming we are there for Rishi kumaras they are born out of the four faces of bhagwan uh Brahma so and they pleaded but did not guards around many times become very rude no if you come with sophisticated dress well dressed person and with previous appointment then you may be allowed and they will an apartment should be notified no the gods would know that such and such is coming so then he will open the door he is doing probably their Duty very well but little two hearts and the holy people how you will know that they are all from organic for excellence and the son of the Lord Brahma and didn't allow and how how much depleted not allowed and then they got a little annoyed and then the cursed curse there the two get Gatekeepers and that section we are reading so the obstruction of the kumaras they reached and they then this are the four Rishi kumaras they then cursed the cursed by the kumarus what is not that part we are reading starts with verse number 32. huh so he says the sage said what he says said in this fear where one person who has for long practiced the devotional disciplines and served the Lord intensely can find a place how is that perverse one like these have come in the Lord is the embodiment of peace and that these boys two guards how they enter into the heaven I was so arrogant they don't understand no sensitivity if you are done enough good work then you will only go to heaven is it not and not ordinary heaven but the Abode of the Lord narayana is the highest heaven and there the Lord how much purity of your heart should be there so you should understand some holy man what what are the holy people how they are spiritually elevated at least that little sense should be there and you should behave with them properly as he said how these people in this fear where only persons were for long practiced the devotional disciplines and serve the Lord intensely can find a place how is that the perverse ones like these two people have come here the Lord is the embodiment of peace and divide of all enmity and antagonism means a place where there will be no enemity and there will be no antagonism a place the mind will be such these are the type of people they can go and stay over there that's why it's called foreign but these people have pulled up ego and full of antagonism how can you suspect that anyone with evil intentions against such a one will come over here you are the gods you should know here an ordinary people cannot come into this sphere of reality they might have done good spiritual practice that's why they come over here they cannot enter get any entry into this plane so this qualities within you and that means you have these qualities you yourself possess these qualities within you in abundance making you feel the same with regard to others because your mind is polluted you are God you have the power and you think that your mind is polluted so with that right you are looking at us also Rishi kumaras are thinking this way the Lord who holds the whole universe in himself wise men see no difference as one part of the sky is not found to be different from the another part such being the case how has fear which is the result of seeing difference a reason in you making you feel the need of protecting the Lord as if you are the protector of the Lord whose Lord is protecting the whole universe and because of that he is the Lord but you think that you are going to protect him and you don't allow anybody you are unless Lord will be impure or Lord will get hurt no how arrogant are you how can it be therefore 34th verse we have decided to reform you so I would like to correct you reform you who are not no doubt the Servants of the lord we are also Servants of Lord we want to correct you who are no doubt the Servants of the Lord but are possessed of a poor and impure intelligence you are producing intelligence which is poor intelligence so we need to correct you so that you you fit candidate to stay here in the heaven you are excommunicated rather is the order your ex communicated from this realm because of your separatist Outlook you are separating you should be some other C those who come into the higher plane they should have the Equanimity in vision but you are coming over here seeing that incompetent people or because we are not well dressed because we are not gorgeous in our attire you think as ordinary but you don't want the holiness so you are excommunicated from this realm because of your separatist Outlook and are condemned to occupy inferior reasons religions which are the under the domain of the evil evil passions like sexuality anger and greed so we will be thrown into a plane where worldliness will be much more you are not fit to stay in the heaven I haven't where there is the possibility of pure people can stay stay heart should be Purity full of purity so you are excommunicated to that plane where you feed him anger frustration and all these negative things worldliness the attendance of srihori now recognizing in this ominous words that irresistible and it is immutable cause of a brahmana now fell at their feet in the great fright and repentance now this attendance understanding the scars they fell down at the feet of the Rishi Kumar sir please please hurry up done something because they understood that how these people can curse in this strong word that you are unfit here you have come over here so we curse you go down to that plane where you are fitting no leave it like that worldly thoughts and your anger just be fit in that plane not in this plane of by Kunta they play enough the Holiness blown up the narayana now the attendance then said to this curse but they said 36 verse 31 36 says what you have done is only to inflict a deserving punishment on sinners we have nothing to say against the infliction of it as it will destroy our sin of disobeying the Lord's command but though we are doomed to a three see Peter's Paul from our present State grant that we may not by virtue of your sympathy and Good Will towards us be deprived of our minds capacity to remember him always okay so now only we beg we know we have done something wrong but we want that will be corrected but for my good you have done that but I beg that give me that wherever I go I don't forget God even for a Split Second for a Split Second that is their reason so you may put me wherever in Hell or whatever punishment punishing areas but this much I need your grace to bless me with the curse you have given that that is is revocable because it is believed that whatever comes out of the Holy people that becomes true so whatever your rishis or Sages so if you have said this it will happen but give the bone so that I forgive forgiveness and give the blessings that I can not forget God this Nara you know a split second into my life as a now question comes that's why they became born as all these demons ravana's time in one way and any other incarnations taking the very bad plea role and what they they because of their past Good Karma they have their Royal King and other things and power also very strong and that all is fearful about Krishna or the Lord who he is going to be born like the krsna's time and kangsha come today and night thinking you my my he will kill me is being born somewhere he's the eighth child of devaki maybe who knows my first child so thinking of it krsna Krishna Krishna is born Krishna is born he's seeing Krishna everywhere if you love someone you don't think of him if you hate someone then you think of him more someone loves you may forget ah and ignore but if there is a dangerous person who is going to kill you your head has been declared that anyone brings ahead I will give one billion dollar big guys are there in the world so he always keeps so many gods around and this and and always think someone is going to kill me kill me kill me kill me their life is really but they're here they're thinking of Lord Krishna he is coming to kill me so thinking of him day and night they become relieved from their curse that will be the later incident later no no not now description of Maha vishnu's form in 2013 page verse number 37. also it is very important what we get the training that foreign times it happens that to be in a very high level up with high level of spiritual people very difficult they get arrogant in many places you'll find that it's a they say because those who are they think that their power it is not their power people come to the Lord who is there to see him to get his darshan huh and guards have greater responsibility how to how to persuade them how to tell them if you don't want to go okay they are questioning you go and tell the Lord this person has come what shall I do no he's again and again telling like that no why you take the rudest rude and unkind decision people forget that so this is a lesson how to be in the world also this is this is another another world who are very close to the high power High very powerful people those are the they they are more powerful is their gods powerful man you can meet him and you see that he's so easy yeah but the gods are very powerful they will check you and then you hear you and so that is the world it happens but in spiritual World it should not be like that that's the point so 37 verse says the Lord who is dear to all good souls coming to know about the hand high-handedness of his attendance against the holy men hurried to the spot to which is concept SRI their mother Lakshmi Lakshmi and narayana narayana came to know this has happened how the message went to the and he sent hurriedly came back to the whole rishis Rishi kumaras and with Mother Laxmi came both of them came moving on his holy moving on his holy feet which are the quest of the great sages like the foreign it is just dwell in the heart of the Holy people well if you meditate on the feet of the Lord and that that lord of the universe he walked down his description is very poetic this man this bhagavat is a poetic expression as per Excellence from Sanskrit side from description side poetry side no poetic means what in one there is one beautiful flower poet will make it a whole poem and describing so all small things that is the poetic that's the poetic imagination and they'll describe the feet is like that of a flower or like a rose and their eyes are like that or see they'll go on describing now then so it is very uh flowery we call flower and holidays that was even when we are just our childhood period there are the language was different flowery language the people if you can say something in the flowery language that is accepted but that generation different generation that is the style of different but poetry is always and this is the greatest poetry in the whole world so the sage is now saw standing Before Their Eyes him whom they were in the habit of meditating upon in their heart and this Rishi kumaras they were meditating on God and that that with the walking that Peter and the Lord stood before them has been just overwhelmed to see whom they are meditating imagining that it will be like that and seeing in front of them whom they are in the habit of meditating upon in the heart his attendance had brought all his paraphernalia they held to Swan like chauris chauris on his side you know what is that chaudi and over him a moon like ceremonial and umbrella with dangling pearls filaments on the fringes they're doing still even they what you call the umbrella is also so gorgeous have you seen the South Indian temple called uh that have you seen in the temple there are umbrellas it's made of gold gold will be hanging here then this and and this the simple umbrella to cover your head so the sun does not hit you but that is itself very costly and worth seeing thing you know so like the dangling Pearl film filament on the fringes which released cool drops of water under the influence of the gentle bee to make the cool so nectar is dropping there like that so beautiful description that means umbrella one holding the umbrella main thing is there 38 his vinagnan face pleased all the sages and the attendance no this face of the Lord narayana pleased everyone when he appeared all auspicious qualities and excellences seem to be centered in him means in the Lord sweetness and benevolence he cast by his look touched the hearts of Allah and he just the Lord come and look like that and that through their hearts of the sages and the attendance with three means mother Lakshmi shining on on his broad chest blue is in complexion he rendered luminous his Abode which is the crest Jewel of the universe his Sumptuous waste was covered with a yellow cloth held in the position by a brilliant waistband like that lemon cloth like the description how the Lord looks how would the dress what what dress he wear how his look how his umbrella and they will go to much more description so he and on who's just a plural wrath attracting large numbers humming bees hummingbis is not pleasing for us but hummingbiz is good there because humming bees are then there is flower flower of very high fragrance flower is wearing some Garden so they are like that humming bees and of his two arms direct with precious bracelets one who's placed on neck of Garuda his Eagle vehicle and other held in it a play Lotus which she told about holding a Lotus twirling around his cheeks and his nose were smooth enough to reflect the radiance of the fish marked earrings splendors earrings it is reflecting there like lightning wow his diadem was started with numerous precious gems between his arms on his chest where the necklace of precious pearls and on his neck he's having some close to wound oh God just because God the Abode of all and mother Lakshmi is had that in his attended so naturally all wealth is there in narayana party to us his devotees found in him a riverly a beauty that humiliated the pride of the Indra to be the center of all Beauty seeing this form of the Lord revealed for the worship of all including myself Shiva and all your devotees the sages continued to look at him with unassociated eyes and then prostrated themselves before him in the fullness of joy so seeing these they are warm and their hearts full desire is fulfilled as it was The Prostitute of the feet now the fragrance of the tulasi leaf dollar is very mildly it grows in heaven to also live is does not grow in everyone's home only it grows while devotional family they can grow to the Sea huh so tulas is Lord narayan's most favorite yeah what you call your favorite offering you you every time we do some tulasi to us it is itself is pure uh you did not have to we when you offer anything we purify that thing and then offer but for tulasi tulas is the pure itself you need not have to pull it purify the tulosi again until us he gives us devotion a lot of Devotion to God the fragrance of tutorials he lives offered by the voter is mixed harmoniously with the devotional stimulant of the pollen of his Lotus feet and when it entered the hearts of those sages through their noses even their minds and bodies were overcome with the devotional sentiment in spite of their being poised in akshara this changeless absolute though they are much attracted to the changes absolute but listening this this pure fragrance of the tulo silim entered in their nose and their devotion becomes full of search of devotion came in their heart after viewing 44 to their satisfaction the Lord's blue lotus-like face so their world to see the Lord standing up before them so fully satisfied Blue Lotus like face lit with a smile revealing his Jasmine like teeth and then looked at and contemplated on his feet with the red ruby-like nails his feet with the red ruby like net nails are also Ruby like because it's got everything Ruby Everything Gold Everything Jewel everything the Pearl and this and that so everywhere the whole wealth is there in it it indicates that God in God everything that's why you know if one realizes God he can get everything now money wealth everything everything can be heard it's just because how much was there all of the um people who want to call conquered India in different times they stole away all billions and trillions of such jewelry and this and that and and Kings also would have and they say that's why sometimes God is considered Raj or rajeshwara you're the Raja of the all rajas the king of all Kings the Emperor of all Emperors so naturally he'll be full of all this expression of this beauty and grandeur 45 then the sages recited him after seeing these beautiful form and beautiful dress and beautiful fingernail these eyebrows all these descriptions we got it before also but there is now they wanted what they will do they say oh Lord you are so great hello you are so appeared you are Infinity you are this you are that all the praise will come now so they were 100 with the emotion they started praising the Lord narayana so in the Sages recited him a praise to that Revelation as purushottam he is a purushottama Utama purusa means the Supreme amongst all purushas who is the objective quest for all who treat the path of Judah is the goal of attainment of what is all yoga practice whose form is blissful to the eyes and commands the Adoration of all and who is the naturally endowed various yogic Powers which it is difficult for others to possess other people can practice yoga but they cannot get this power What the Lord narayana Has the yogish he's the ishara the Lord of yogis that means no one can excel in people may get beautiful higher powers and but no one can Excel the power which the Lord narayana has now they started the kumaras the four kumarasanandan sanat Kumar sanatana these are the four so they now him this side recited the hymns of the by the Kumaris 50s 46 verse the kumara said Sanskrit will be of course beautiful these are the Praises that there is chanted [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] the Lord resides in the heart of antar innermost reason of the heart of all you me everyone but not experienced we cannot experienced Why by Evil Hearted person whose heart is evil evil means we have negative thoughts who are imperfect who have not purified their body mind and soul by repeating God's name and prayers and meditation or selfless work foreign but still to feel the God is is not directed that God are not experienced by Evil Hearted persons has verily appeared today before our very eyes what a great Fortune you the Lord who come only before the pure hearted soul and you are here in front of me and you have appeared before me upon us not even young this perhaps is not to be wondered since you had entered into our hearts much earlier through our years when we receive the instructions from our father Brahma Brahma created and Brahma praised narayana so by that time when he came we already had your glory before so it is already you have entered that way some conception in our heart about the Mystic Glory of yours I've heard from my father Brahma we know we do for this they are on the deputy saving we know it is you alone who are the Supreme spirit that has taken this form of pure satta there are different forms and Thomas is the most saty go for generating infinite joy in the hearts of devotees you are realized as much in the hearts of passages who are endowed with renunciation and not supposed Hearts have been cut Ascender by the form and devoted practice of disciplines of bhakti which you yourself have revealed to mankind out of your grace no so you are realized as such in this way that you are the Lord of yogas and Lord of all you are the Supreme Spirit who can realize that of the Sages the sages who are endowed with renunciation not every says every stage is trying to realize God but those sages who have in many successful in endowed with the renunciation and the not support Hearts have been cut ascended I mean they have no bond with the world and worldliness that type of pure Soul pure Soul they have realized it ascended by the form divorce hi how by the farm devoted practice of the disciplines of bhakti bhakti practice they have done following the scripture and they've done long time their heart is beautified they can't only understand you and you and by you who beloved Lord 48 you worshipful one you are the only worshipful one and you are the lord of the universe your devotees who have taken shelter at your feet and who are intelligent and sensitive enough to understand and feel the incomparable sweetness of your excellences has revealed to the creative and Redemptive activities rejective and Moksha people don't want to get Liberation that's why it is said even they are given I give you Liberation the factors don't want deliberation they want to keep a little separating into the Lord is the ultimate but the devotees will say ah no no no I want to keep a little separation so that I can enjoy the place if I get Mars then I'm not dead no the sugar the the dolls salt doll if he gets into the water then it is dissolved so better to see ramakrishna said I don't want to be sugar but I want to taste the sugar there is a big discussion on this point Which is higher to be one absolutely absorbed in brahman's hand or a little giving a little separation is good you are seeing just you can merge an infinite ocean of joy and you are just keeping a little separation you can feel the joy being separated because your trace of mind to end to experience as you say experience experience is done through what to the senses you need it's your mind something still to be there and total annihilation of all this experience and other things you will be that when you merge into it so which is higher bhakta will say this is higher ganis will say hey again to separation separation is bad because separation has always Banks of Separation feeling of pain agonies and that pain of separation is there sometimes again you merge sometimes you become again frustrated oh I have not seen let's see the radha's condition how much rather crying crying crying oh when you look up I am my whole day and night waiting waiting waiting and Radha does not eat anything does not look at anything is it good is it is it many separation is bad and and Radha Krishna Milan at the end of the music in kitten they have to sing Radha Krishna ultimately mate and there so which is good this is good or this is good anyhow and we have reading bhakti book so this is good keep a separation from God and to enjoy keeping little separation but ramakrishna said you cannot do much if you go close to that it is a magnet Mountain there's this little needle how much you want to keep separate you cannot separate it will stop it will just catch it become one but anyhow known we did not have to think in that way it is bhakti so it is let us be uh Moksha they don't want any more so Liberation Liberation means you will merge into God your little drop Will merge into the infinite ocean you become infinite I am that no and who will say I am that that also will go convince that Unity absolute Unity but here I want to I am your servant you are my father I am your child you are my baby I am the mother and Krishna so they they your creative and Redemptive activities reject even Moksha considered as your highest gift in preference to your service I want to serve you oh Lord not to be merged into you and who will serve if you get much you can serve God so I want to solve that service how little will they then care for Boons that best Rejoice a perishable World which come and go at the moment of the book of the of the of your brows to all the joy and suffering in the world it is like a blinking of your eyes no it comes and goes but who will like that I want to serve you and be your that's why you see that's so how they are talking of service means that's so wow thank you used to serve Ram Swami Vivekananda said I am your servant for this life and all the life so Lord I'll be born again and again for the service of Sri ramakrishna let us be born in any state of misery due to our misdeeds we don't care for the sufferings of it our or if our mind should even then Delight only in your feet as honey bees do to the flowers if our ears would always be filled with nothing but the sounds of conveying your excellences and if like the humble tools leaves our words will derive when you watch this what solely due to their connection with your feet this 49 verse uh this is very prayer oh Lord let us be born in such a way in any state you give us misery suffering no any state of Misery we may be due to our Mysteries we have done maybe when you are born means there will be some negative things also no gold 10 percent pure gold is no you cannot make any ornament you want to make your ornament you have to put some alloy then you cannot be come into the name and form to come into the name and from Little Thomas is to be annotated little rajas Instagram to it so rajas and Thomas and satwa the three gunas they constitute the creation it is God's power that's called the Maya in vedanta so let us be born in any state of misery due to our mistreats we do not care for the suffering being born in another life well as you are human being that's the prayer that whom this even the kumaras are saying if I be here it don't be here in another plane lower plane but it matters little if our minds should even then Delight only your holy feet my mind will be thinking of you and you and you only like the bees are always humming and sitting on the flowers full bloom flowers so let our mind also day and night think of your holy feet holy presence if our years later every year whatever we use the audio for what what news say our situation is to say grandma don't listen vulgar words of the world through your ears listen only divine words that we read the gospel lead holy mother lead bhagavat later keep as much as you can in the in this world is not possible but keep your all the sense organs engaged to be focused in God God God that will be the quickest progress that's why the otherwise he said Bhagavad said that your tongue is like a you know your tongue is not sweet so many sweet words in the world no but these are all worthless it is like the it is Sun it is called the the bad bad croaking voice of the all her words are like the croaking experiences of the Frog things that he is doing good job all night all the gang organ whole night and all the people are getting tired so we talk about this all the holy people get tired what day and night how they can talk we are reading Sami vivekananda's they with their disciples Baba he's walking he's standing he's sitting what they are talking all the high philosophies how they can talk in such a living even in the big philosophical book you take and swim concentrated Focus you cannot understand the meaning and spontaneously swamiji is talking about that with chit chatting in the carries the carriage is going when we move from one place to another place in the carries what we talk all this what's the nonsense talks and what swamiji is talking to that SARS chakravarthy wow you have to read some as if you are getting a good class spiritual class in isolated that means this this mouth is speaking on that he ears are utilizing there because these are all to help us to lift the mind in God Consciousness so that is the thing it is said that let us be born in any state of misery don't I don't care for misery or suffering due to our misdeeds but we do not care for the suffering of it I don't care for the suffering which other Lives May give if our minds would or even then Delight only in the fit it has honeybees do in the flowers if our ears are ears would always be filled with nothing but it sounds conveying your excellences God's glory the ear will be listening there foreign is the verse number 49er sasket is beautiful and unless anyhow we have no time and if like the humble Tulsi lives our words will derive any what solely due to their connections with your feet oh Lord oh you the all renowned your form now revealed to us can never be seen by impure Minds The revelation of heat has brought to us the breeze of spiritual fulfillment We Salute You the Supreme Being one who though him imperceptible to men without self-control has been pleased to reveal thyself to us out of your infinite Mercy people do so much austerity prayer and we only came at your door in the heaven and you are so kind and you appeared before me it is even yogis need to practice long practices so here the prayer of the poor Rishi kumaras and then for the appearance of Lord narayana happened right question yeah time is 10 minutes how many questions one shall I need any further okay you can attend to that like five minutes and let us read to this now we are moving to the chapter 16 15 chapter ends now this chapter 16. page number 216 and the Lord on his relationship with holy Men final settlement of their fate so where they will go they have cursed and they are saying please forgive and all these things are gone what ultimately will happen so narayana will settle that so this is the chapter 16 for that so it is then said please read the words of the him sages of the great spiritual attainment the Lord who has manifested himself in baikunto to bless his devotees said as follows now the Lord is responding to this praise Lord you're standing there and listening to the praise now Lord now talking to them for Rishi kumaras and the other attendants these two attendants of mine Jaya and bijaya have misbehaved towards you in this regard of my command who says what you who follow my ideas and intentions have pronounced as punishment for insulting holy men I accept divide validity of it fully he's saying you you are my this my gods have made a mistake against my command they have done I never say that return anybody at them drastically pull them out but he has done this many against my command and what you have said I fully I accept that yeah I'm not blaming you that why did you get banged and why did you do that rather I accept what you have done as they look upon holy men as object of worship I myself the lord of the Universe I look upon the holy people as an object of worship may I please you by asking your pardon saying Lord is begging pardon for the activities of his gods for what my happiness did to you by way of insult idem it as done by myself and this was a great character you can check it and the Lord is saying forgive if they have done means I have done my attention so if they have done some mistake is mine that's the good uh officers take responsibility of everything no if any of his policemen does something police officers says sorry it is my mistake Governor says it's my mistake you know good people say like that and God lord of the world narayana says it is do they have done this they are act they have done because though they have pilot in my orders but it is done by me because they are my gods for what my attendance did to you by way of himself I deem it as done by myself 5. when a servant does something wrong the world attributes it to the master and ah and the disparate that one gets that way he wrote one's good name as leprosy Rose to our skin it is because you holy men that the holy Waters of my name and excellences have come to possess that extraordinary sanctity by virtue of which even one deep into it can purify the lowest of law many that means that you are describing the glory excellences of Me by by this description or ordinary people will be purified by hearing this so that being the case I will destroy anyone who works against you right or rishis oh for rishis I will work against anyone who opposes you or your thoughts your pure Souls even if it be Devas protecting the world who are to me like my right hand from the holy men contacting them have have my feet derived their sanctity and I have come to possess immeasurable excellences and power of destroying the sins of all for the same reason does sridevi cling to me though I am utterly indifferent to her mother looks me is hanging up on me but I am indifferent to that this is that is God but she's standing there mother is standing over there but truth is truth so I am utterly indifferent to her SRI for a favorable glance from whom All Gods and Men perform austerities no so the rich he soaked offering of the Masters of sacrifice in the sacrificial fire are not consumed by me with the same relish as the Marcel of food I consume to the mouth of holy men who perform all their actions in dedication to me and eat their humble prayer with really snow that missing people are doing so much a home of fire with ghee and soaked in ghee and ablation it is not pleasing to me that my sages like you who live in the cosmic consciousness of the Divine you're in a simple some offering that is much more pleasing to me that the water flowing from my feet is supposed to purify the whole world including the moon Christianity's feet no the Lord vishnu's feet and that word business water is held by whom foreign who will hold this heavy power descending the heavy power of Purity descending on the earth that's why Mahadev was requested and he hold in his lock and is locked and then the stream came down from the other areas the water flowing from my fit is supposed to purify the whole world including the moon Christ deity of mysara even then I possessed of an unlimited power and excellences of my yoga Maya carry the foot dust of holy men like you on my crown head I from my feet the ganga which comes out purifies the world but I myself is saluting for putting my head down to you you are the sages you are the pure Souls you you sanctify everything that means your most pure than that of me as it were no he's going extraordinary love for these devotees who will not bear with the beings of such a transcending holiness the holy men cows and the poor and the forlorn arise dear to me as myself though that's why you see the holy manner dear to me cows are dear to me the poor people are dear to me and for loan those who are not nobody to look after they are dear to me as as myself those who view them as different and persecute them such people who are blinded by their own sins will be torn into shreds by my age like emissaries who are as ferocious as the serpents if they insult these four were the four four men cows holy men not men holy men for women you insult God's your caste will come upon his emissaries will spread you to pieces but what is happening all these people are doing so much they are not shredded but they are shedding others and he will do it later on maybe you know but cows so you should not insult the cows that's a whole of India respects Cows as mother that's why sensitivity grows from there that I am cows and like mother and the poor and the foreign so but but this I I protect them if even in the face of insult by a holy man a person seeing my presence in him remains joyful at heart and puts on a smiling face and speaks to him with words full of love as they would do to me or his children by such a person I am attracted if my devotees who are dedicated like holy people if they say something wrong and the other person can smilingly take it I am very pleased with that person for their overbearing conduct towards you these two who are my servants and who have acted against my ideas and intentions have got a fitting punishment let them undergo the same immediately and come back to me afterwards let them go now see how much detest her they are the attendance for so many years they have made a mistake and you should negotiate it with the riches but he said don't let them go now because you insulted you huh my head is bent on your feet You Are Holy you are Holier holy people are like that may you say this be pleased that this period of separation of my servants from me is made as brief as possible he's only reading this much you do that this separation from me they are also devotees for some reason they turn some mistake this separation does not longer long it should be as as little you kindly do that much this is a favor and blessing which you can easily Grant his talking to the sages there now they will next time we will read what Brahma said against all these stories okay um oh I ended I ended and verse number book number 3.16 Dot 13 bars 12 ended 13 will start next day on page 275 3.16.12 we ended um now there will be another class in 7 30 but uh but now we have a few minutes of some questions I have come let me see that question I do not understand question does the devotee go there by worshiping Krishna by worshiping Krishna one goes to Go Locker and by worshiping Vishnu one goes to goaikunta as per purana that is true you are right but sometimes a Krishna and boy they are made the question is only not much so I don't understand does the devotee go there worshiping Krishna that is the point Krishna Krishna is the one form krsna has two hands and like a human form and krsna coming down from narayana form narano has four arms and all this the description so which form you meditate you meditate on krishnava then you go to Krishna loka very simple as your mind gets absorbed in one type of thought you remain in that level so if you worship narayana with the forearm with the diadem and all these glorious the crown we just we heard the description that that type of that form then you go to boykunta loka so sometimes but sometimes in this bhakti book we make synonym Krishna is equal to narayana as for example now we think that same narayana appeared to the father of ramakrishna the description they all with the forearmed Lord appeared before they before SRI ramakrishna's father with shudhiram and he said that I will be taking birth in your home in your family in your as you will be child no so that that is that example they are that when he came when now it is ramakrishna so you do worship ramakrishna after deep concentration on ramakrishna's meditation he will go into a plane if you are not true you don't want liberation total Liberation you want like a bhakta to enjoy the presence of the Lord so he will go to the ramakrishna Luka and then they they go to the Krishna but are they different because it is the same narayana taking one form as Rama the same narayana taking from Krishna there is taking from ramakrishna so but what is the difference difference is on the name and form and shape and how you look how the appearance that is the difference so we all look at it's not Christians I am giving Krishna look I am saying anyhow these are all I mean you have to understand the philosophy of it as you think so your mind gets colored in that coloring simple formula you keep your mind like a water put in a jar it will take shape of the jar put in a bowl it will take shape of the bowl in a glass it takes the shape of the glass so similarly if the mind is kept in pure thought of God in which form your mind will be happy to see that form tangibly he will love Rama form you love Krishna form so you after death also you live in that plane where your mind was there and it will live in that plane people live in that mental world is it not everyone lives in that mental world so if it is God's form even not God's form in the in worldly sense you see someone maybe we may be 20 people sitting here we have our own liking things are different mentally we like this and that so this is the Abode of our mental condition when we live this physical we live in the mental world like dream in the mental level no so everyone sees the same dream night time everyone sees their own dream so when inter spiritual practice is done their mind gets colored with the coloring of one aspect of the Divine one form of the Divine yeah and then after death if they don't have total margin into Brahman so they will live in their mental World pure mental level pure level so I think these levels are for as much Purity comes so much they and they also not in their plane also there are divisions some will be able to live in the same plane same place where the Lord lives no Lord's Palace and you live in next next neighbor uh as you may be more intimate you'll be a guard in the house of the Lord you may be more intimate you will be the servant in ramakrishna in Krishna narayana's room to serve water to bring this that these are the different ideas about closeness to God in whatever level so I think they are ultimately they need a higher plane and as one thinks so lives in that mental concept okay thanks for that question I do not know whether you are satisfied with the question answer but The Duality is only in name and form that truth is the one okay Om Shanti Shanti Shanti peace peace peace
