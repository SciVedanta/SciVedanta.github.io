[Bhagavatam - Book 1. Chapter 14 - Verse 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMYREwYrFqo)

[Music] our salutations to bhagavan sri krishna with the son of vasudeva and the destroyer of the demons kang and chanura the darling dear darling of the mother jason and the guru of the world and the loving soul of each heart oh peace peace peace so we are now today we will read the chapter 14 of the book one and we have what he read the other day this that says that the blind king dhritarashtra was advised by vidura his brother that you blindfold you are blindfold and you are staying in the kingdom so long you know not to the proper means but by the wrong ways you are ruling and now your kingdom also been in the war in you have been defeated your your side is defeated so you are staying in the in the kingdom of judaism or arjuna in their group no you should not stay any more if you have dignity you should abandon this and go and give up your body enough in himalayas though they are kings they are the values of life so his brother bidura a very wise person he came and advised him and then they departed and where did they go no one knows when yudhisthira he came back and you tried to find out where is the where is dhitarastra where is vidura and the suta then was the narrator who was the sanjayo he said hiku was very emotionally choked and he thought what to say he is silent sometimes and then he said they'd have left and that time then thinking this he wanted to search you want to find out where they go i will bring them back did i do anything wrong to honor my father like uncle which i not give proper respect because this is very righteous person he is the last person to throw away his uncle who is who unauthorized or authorized is not the question and created so much love for his own son and others he thought that no i i should go and search that time this advice came from this judiciary when he started searching for hearing not that yet the rishi narada and naruto appeared and said that he gave the advice so you should not grip for anyone it is all this advice and ultimately he said that they are going in their own journey they have left this kingdom they have gone to the southern uh southern part of himalayas and then they are thinking he's trying to meditate there and give up their body in in deep way they could give up their body when they was wanted so so he they had gone to the ganga and a particular plot walked what in a himalayas and there's in a place it's called sakta srotas a spot where mother ganga has divided into seven divisions seven so it's a holy place to that close spot they went there a spot where the ganga divided herself in seven streams to please the seven rishis subduration in the northern was one of them sattvishi and they took baths there in the holy river apart from all the rice and rituals and that you can offer for your oblation for your parents and your forefathers who have passed away so all these rights and rituals be performed and abandoning all earthly attachment and they did not thinking of wealth family friends or money or anything tritarastro now is very peaceful now because you cut up all the attachment for and whom to attach now all the sons all his own people are dead no so only wife and he is alive so having established himself naruto in describing this story that don't owe judicity don't go to search and find them and bring them back they have finished their life's duty and now they're engaged in giving up the body thinking about god and free from detachment free from attachment not detachment and he having established himself in a subtle seat by controlling the pranas and six senses he has reason above the guna the prakriti by the practice of devotion to hari so see who are goals these though but ultimately spiritually how much they elevated so they have given up everything and they are doing their last journey to the infinite thinking of the lord they will go absorbed in god so don't go and search for them let them move on their life and there he is identifying himself and the intellectual self resolving the same into the first time he's identifying oneself on the intellectual self and the buddhi and then resolving into the chatrago the witness consciousness and the resolving to brahman and there the like hot sky in the universal sky is now sitting motionless like a pillar with the natural tendencies of the mind overcome so he's perfectly peaceful he has withdrawn the mind from the physical to the intellectual to the egos and ego and behind the brahman so we draw on the mind from the external so he is in now deep practice in the samadhi practice no so don't disturb him so do not go there and cause any disturbance to him who has abandoned all duties and actions so within five days from now he will be abandoning his body who literally the king blind king the father of oh dude and what is the name all bad names because of their characters arrogant like that so they are all these brothers these sons are gone the war is over so he has finished his job and now he is now putting himself into the fire with the five days he will now pass give up his body how lucky yogis they decide that i will give up the body within few days and they can give up they are highly spiritual people in the fire of yogic power his wife then the husband goes away the indian tradition the wife also follows the path my life's duty is done but i will also follow the path of that spiritual unity so he also entered into that yogic state this yogic fire with your husband's body along consuming with that would follow him by entering into that fire so do the blind queen not blind used to always die because husband in honor of husband husband was blind so she is used to cover the cloth as if she is blind it's a great idea to follow the husband and wife relationship also now and this happened with the king dhritarashtra and the wife now what happened to bidura his younger brother who were very wise person he said vidura then seeing all this that both of them have left a body who are come both by sorrow and joy sorrow why because he's the brother brother and brother's wife they are dead joy because yet in the spiritual goal human life end of spiritual life is to realize that supreme attune yourself into the higher consciousness so he did that successfully so bidura was very happy and then then what he did then saying that much he would go out of the broad world as a pilgrimage so bidura then went around walking and preaching the message of krishna hurry and went on a pilgrimage with different holy places yeah they have their karma they have their karma so many good karmas that's why they enjoy it like that and this karma is finished and previous sadhana good sadhana was there many people do good sadhana suddenly they fall for temptation and other things so these kings are very highly evolved spiritual people before but with the wish that i will enjoy something like that one life last life or whatever the because of that when that work is over it like spring comes out what is there inner samaskar so these are also krishna will come and they will leave and they will do that these are all predestined by their karma not buddhist hero it is the story not for all so saying so narada then after giving the advice then narada who appeared suddenly before yudhisthira in all that okay now today is the 14th chapter next chapter this is the big background now as this thing happened suto said on page 61 of this book chapter 14 verse 1 about this time the king dharmaputra had sent his brother arjuna brahmaputra is who always say remember when he called dharmakutta do this right pandava head so his elder brother sudharmaputra he sent his brother arjuna to whom to dwarka where krishna went back we heard the other time krishna went back to his own kingdom that is in dwarka gujarat to get news about krishna his he said how is now it is so much communication those days they have to go by horse ride or something speedy horse to reach there and then come back with some information so good news about krishna and the doings of the percentage of holy fame how he is doing even after several months he did not find arjuna returning he sent his brother go and inquire about bhagavan krishna what he is doing in his kingdom in gujarat dwarka but he went but he didn't come back so he did not he did not come back even after several months it did not find arjuna returning and what was worse fear evoking omens forwarding some evil also began to occur some signs of something bad you know it there are some symptoms people have prejudice you can say a left eyelid is jumping this is not a good sign something bad is coming right is doing some people say like that it is good something good is coming so some some symptoms bad symptoms are being seen here and there and arjuna didn't come back what happened why it is taking so many months to get to dwarka and come back so he was worried indicating bad times as it were seasons cease to show their wanted features and these are all seem to oh it is it should be a hot summer now it is becoming a high school like us huh now this it's not a good sign naturally out of the nature's natural rules as it were so indicating bad times as it were seasons ceased to show their wonderful features lives of men came to become more and more sinful and people are becoming liars and cheating becoming dominated by the anger greed and untruthfulness they become deceitful in transactions and faithless in relationship mutual quarrels between parents friends brothers marriage coupled were becoming the order of the day so always this fight and confusion and this is have become becoming part of life as is now modern society is what you can imagine this type of society has come back no one trusts each other this relationship is breaking people are not being truthful not doing their duties responsibilities like that the mess in the society seeing these and other very adverse womans besides the general degeneration of human character the king jedi stereo then spoke to his brother bhima he asked his another brother no there are five brothers elder brother is judistira arjuna he has sent to get information about krishna who is the king in dwarka but he's not coming back several months passed six seven months passed and then he's asking the bhima the most powerful warrior judistria said six months we have sent arjuna to dwarka to give him an opportunity to renew his friendship which is numerous associates there as also to get us and in all information about the dreams of the most holy one sri krishna ubhima it is now seven months baba six months seven months since your brother arjuna has gone i do not know why he has not yet returned could it be that the time indicated by sage narada has already come the time when all powerful lord desires to lay aside his body assumed for his supportive manifestation his question came he's telling his brother why why it is seven months past and no news from krishna and arjuna didn't come back is it that he has died that means krishna thought that my earthly what duties are done so let me give up my body did he do like that for that he gets stuck there nine it is due to his grace that we have come to possess all that we have our kingdom wealth where wives our lives our clans clansmen our victory never our enemy forces and our subjects so whatever in our life we got is because by the grace of krishna bhagavan krishna he was always protecting us so because of god so we are worried what happened to him so has he closed his chapter of this play of his earth meaning that is he going to did he give up his body or what so and arjuna may be grip stricken that's why he's not coming back just type of this this type of thinking see these terrific women's physical psychical and spiritual which indicate for certain the confused and fearful situation that is awaiting us so he got really nervous thinking that it is good it is not a good time i see the woman's bad woman's every era everywhere around and people are becoming unrighteous untruthful these what is happening why six and seven months so much change suddenly it started happening so he asked the bhima brother bhima this question and he continues verse number 11 i experience frequent tremblings of my left eye see this is the bad domains experience frequent trembling of my left thigh eye left eye left hand that that's the woman any every country has some signs of woman no it's a bad science what is bad sign in this country black cat oh you see a black cat ah we also in india when someone is driving a cat crosses the road the car will have to stop there is a risk of accident something is good all big drivers they will stop they will crisscross something wait in the car crisscross on the dashboard or somewhere just cut and take some name of the lord the cat crosses and then they'll start so this maybe some it happened before also to they say like that somebody kind of vibration is happening it means your system is somehow already affected so you are anxious or your mind is not stable so that's why there is a very good that's a scientific explanation that that means these signs are coming because your nervous system is weak normal strong nudge which people have strong nerve they don't feel like that but when it is trembling and this and that means something wrong is going on so be careful now you may not focus on your driving or you may say something which may be not proper so be careful good idea good explanation then he says that my left thigh and eye and hand are trembling i experienced palpitation in my heart that happened no heartbeat suddenly you see nothing has happened but you are worried and full of anxiety the heartbeat starts so it is not a good sign those pretend misfortune about to overtake me very soon see how this female jackal is howling at the rising sun jackals should not hound when the sun is rising that's a good time should birds shoot chirping howls jacklin is a bad sign vomiting fire at the form of the mouth and they they're vomiting fire also see this dog glaring fearlessly at me he's a dog dog is looking fierce like this yeah sensitive very sensitive so the dog glaring fearlessly at me and continuously barking at me just see this how it happened god knows that to this hero is standing and he's seeing that the dogs are looking at me barking at me these are what is happening everywhere but in nervousness mostly we become nervous and you really that time things even something happens which you did not notice before that time you will notice and saying oh why it is happening why it is happening yeah superior animals like cows go round me anti-clockwise in early days those are the signs of superstition the dog is a cow should go clockwise but the cows are running anti-clockwise and go around me anti-clockwise the prohibited way while inferior ones like assets take the clockwise courses considered proper for circumambulation this kaputa the black dome is a messenger of death and the certain birds is not a good sign to see you know so he says this kaputa the black dome is a messenger of death the owl and its enemy the crow are continuously screeching with stop without stop as he to announce the doom of the world that means all the birds and nature animals and natural things are not you say in a not really very normal mood it is going in little frightening situation the quarters look barricaded by wall of smoke these quarters all the ten how many quarters one east west north south and quarters ten quarters so east streets north south down north east and in between there's in between this building up and down huh do you know 10 10 10 quarters 10 directions 10 direction so all the 10 directions the quarters look barricaded by wall of smoke everywhere i find it has even smoky you cannot see anything clearly the earth which is mountain quakes oh it is quaking that means [Music] very bad also terrific thunder and lightning are occurring in the clouds in the sky at the time all these things are happening naturally it is a bad time yeah our east coast now in our ridgely manner where our is there from us so there they have so much storm like so much blizzard snow and the trees are so loaded with snow that the trees cannot bear anymore and they all are falling down here and there and some fell on the electric line so electric line is gone so i'm falling on the house the house is getting damaged so it's a bad woman is it not that like i know and i heard that 67 percent of the people are not having light or supply of energy so it's very difficult time so naturally you will say what is happening here is the unusual thing fierce winds are blowing certain columns of dust darkening the neighborhood while clouds are raining blood colored fluid everywhere it is not rain water the blood color and a dark rain and a dirty rain 17 see how the sun has become deemed sun should be bright the sun has become deemed how planets seem to be fighting among themselves in the skies the planets are fighting they should go in their orbit planets should rotate in their roadway they started fighting rivers and lakes are disturbed and turbine turbid rivers and lakes there are cross flow is going on and all all have lost their naturalness that's the point rivers and lakes are disturbed and turbid the fire is not burning bright even when ghee is poured on it when you put ghee we put ghee in the home of fire time the flame comes up no but you are putting ghee and it is not coming out that means something is wrong i do not know what evil time this potent the carbs are not sucking at their mother's order nor are the cows yielding them any milk the cows have a vacant blue with tears flowing down their eyes while bulls are found restless in their pains the images of the gods are weeping sweating and trembling all these habitations villages towns mines gardens settlements of ascetics are seen stripped up their joyous and prosperous look so everywhere every person animal human everywhere all are unnaturally disturbed and i deem i what great tragedy is going to what take us i do not understand i don't know what what is going to come now i deem from these evil potents that the earth now deprived of its former glory has ceased to be trodden by bhagavan sri krishna's feet which we are the unique and auspicious foot lines possessed by no other individuals that means yeah that is i think these are all apprehension of director astro right judith elder brother that means these omens are happening because the lord of the universe who was alive in the world bhagavan krishna walked on the ground everything was in order truthfulness is established righteousness is established by war and killing the demons now he is going huh so he is now leaving the body probably he is he has left his body that's why all these bad things are happening all the counter forces are taking their own previous previous situations now so what is the use of his coming then he came to destroy all evil and as soon as he goes out and again he comes then he should not die anyhow so that is the situation actually so now arjuna's return in utter distress now he's saying this 22nd verse onward he was telling bhima what is happening you go to search for what you know he was going to say but by that time o holy one by judith okay who is saying suta the narrator he is saying o holy one while judistira was thinking about these evil womens with troubled mind there arrived arjuna came back no back from his visit to the city of the yodus that means back from the kingdom of krishna gujarat in gujarat prove us no no first coming he is coming from kingdom first so now as he fell at the king judiciary's feet in salutation the latter found him a different man from what he has before he saw arjuna a powerful boy all the time supported by krishna that's why but he saw he was taken greek stricken so different man arjuna is not that powerful man so he saw a person who is grief stricken cast fallen weeping and abjectly faded with his heart trembling at the sight of his brother in his tragic mood and remembering the words of warning uttered by narada earlier the kind yudhisthira spoke towards judah as follows he saw arjuna and seeing that arjuna is not the same powerful smiling cheerful powerful warrior original he says little down looking at him then judistiro started speaking to him what his book said in dwarka situated in the land of anartha anartha are all our allies the jadabas consisting of the clans of madhus bhojas dasa these are different groups of these are small kingdoms who are supporter of krishna followers of krishna and righteousness so he's asking about how is our krishna dwarka which is inhabited by krishna and other clients of groups of people good people who lived with krishna they are the mudhu madhu family of the mozus the falling family of the bhojas the family of the daasars the sarsas satyptos who you don't know no etc living in happiness and prosperity that is the first question yudhisthira put to his brother he is surah my wishful maternal grandfather happy he is my uncle vasudeva which is several brothers doing well many krishna's father vasudeva and his family members all are keeping well are his seven wives including devaki who are sisters doing well along with their sons and daughter-in-laws he is king ukraina who fathered the evil kamsa as also his brother ali asking about who is there so many kings who are there are they alive how they are keeping all this in so don't question too many here because these are all the stories you have to know reading the mahabharata who is who what is what the king king yukroshina who fathered the evil kansa many conscious father yazoo grossen as also his brother they are alive still now are not all the cousins of krishna cousins of krishna like hidika it's is it doing well i hope so trujit and balarama sutrajit and balram the most vulnerable leader of the yojus are living in peace and prosperity who is balarama shri krishna's elder brother that means she is their family member so he's inquiring about everyone who are connected with krishna and krsna's family are they doing well are there peaceful or either there in prosperity are not the greatest of car warrior predominant noted for his quick movements in battle both doing well susanna jambati's son some etcetera etcetera are not all of them living happily so also the lord lords followers like sutto deva urdhava and other jada was supported by the mighty krsna's and rama's arms must necessarily find everything conducive to well-being bound to us by ties of love do they all think of us they are all our allies in the war they helped us in conquering this battle of war are they all keeping well they are all in good health i hope lord krishna the great lover of the devotees and holy men is living happily at dwarka and is surrounded by his friends and relatives he the original being has appeared along with balarama in this vast ocean of the yudu's race for securing the protection and good of the whole world so bhagavan krishna and his elder brother balarama they have come down from the eternal abode and took a birth in this world why to do good to the world for bring back prosperity and balance in the world hope they are keeping well protected by the mighty might of his arms the jadhavas live happily in dwarka receiving the respect and regard of all people as the followers of mahabishnu doing the transcendental region of bhakunta maha vishnu is the lord vishnu he lives in the transcendental region in the heaven as vishnu lives there similarly we hope the balarama krishna and all them are living here peacefully joyfully by virtue of their service of defeat of krishna as the chief activity the sixteen thousand and more wives of his headed by shuttle obama have been able to defeat indra and secure from his heaven such rare objects of enjoyment like parijato which only sochi the wife of indra and queen of heaven could have that means he's talking about the by virtue of krsna's power that the krishna and his wives are all living well because it is believed that he has so many how many 16 000 wives and number is so big how it's how so many wives say people will think krishna is a bad guy is it not but the point is to understand he the so many in the war he fought against these unrighteous kings and they used to take away the wives and other by their own evil force and torture them and keep them in there when those kings were dead these wives of the kings who have been defeated they used to take refuge in sri krishna said give us shelter it is giving a shelter protection and and so that's why they all were in safe safety and security with dua in dwarka in his kingdom so they are talking about that the heroes of the jaadavarays depending on the might of krsna's army have become fearless of anything and have brought under their control the hall of audience called sudharma fit for indra's house he is not krishna of such transcendent greatness living happily in dark that means like all the the in the transcendental realm in the bakun talk as we call rama krishna krishna lokana divine plane as there is always peace and joy so krishna and balarama who are living and their family members and their wives and others give protection are all of them keeping well they see the question one one question one question everything is okay okay okay oh dear one are you not yourself doing well are you arjuna but you know are you not yourself doing well how is it that i find you believed of your usual sprite sprightliness and self-confidence as you lost your confidence you have no power more anymore so are you keeping well has such a long stay at dwarka led to any coolness in their cordiality to you or to any positive insult did you went there and didn't receive you with honor and respect that's why are you so sad why why are you not courageous why are you not powerful you are not normally by that or have you been slashed by anybody with words that are unkind or rude or have you met with disappointment in granting favors to your dependents as promised by your earlier generations generating great expectation in them did you give some words to somebody and you could not comply with them and that feeling of failure is bothering you why are you so unhappy that's the point or have you who are accustomed to afford protection to refugees refugees fail to protect a brahmana a child a cow an old man a sick man a woman or any other kind of person who sought asylum with you did you feel that someone wanted protection from you you are a king you should give protection but you fail to give that why are you sorry because i see your face that brightness is gone you may be seen few reasons like that yeah maybe someone insulted you maybe someone has said you some other words or you are a courageous person you feel i have not done my duties properly i failed or something wrong with which area this wrong thing has happened uh or have you who are accustomed to afford protection they fail to that to give any protection to a brahmana or a child in difficulty or a woman in difficulty an animal like cow is in difficulty you always protect them have you failed here to perform your duty for any reason or have you or have you consulted with any prohibited woman or even if she has not prohibited done so without giving property what to her or have you met with defeat on the way from equals or inferiors so when you are coming someone attacked you who is of inferior quality and you could not battle with him did it happen so that you are sorrow that you have lost that courage or did you happen to take food without feeding old men children or others whom you are in duty bound to feed you are a king you should not eat fast that is the indian tradition but first treat others and lest you will eat did you do that did you fail to perform that duty that you accumulated your food you are going to eat and someone hungry without giving food to him you are eating yourself these values have been pro these are the books so at least spiritual values give up that's a very high level but the moral value the ideal in the society how one person should behave these are great instances very very small thing have you given your food to others before eating yourself have you left some hungry person and you are enjoying your meal so these are the higher virtue you are a king kingly duty you are not ordinary person ordinary person may sometimes fail but you should not did you do such things that is bothering you or am i to understand that a great vacancy has been created in your life by the absence of shri krishna who has been your bosom friend and the most trusted and vulnerable elders that means have you lost krishna ultimately all these other things are saying last important thing is it because of loss of krishna that you are feeling so bad i cannot think of any other explanation for the terribly depressed condition in which i find you i and you know i don't find any other reason so these are the questions how are you why are you why why are you so sad why you are not lively and because of this because of that did anybody insult you did anybody did that how many possible question or or or or so many verses now these are the all questions questions and judiciary you got to know the reason why arjuna is so weak or so full of pathos why is not bright and self-dependent and self-reliant person like people here in the chapter 14 chapter we have 15 minutes time so no question huh answer now we'll have to go this is the book yeah so and he may go on responding it will be also long then so let us start that chapter 15 minutes time is there so let us start the next chapter 15th chapter so judishido put all this question to arjuna his younger brother who went to dwarka to see krishna and to know how they are doing and how everyone is okay and to just a courteous visit because they are friends together krishna and arjuna so arjuna went and came back with a black face now krsna's ascent and after chapter 15 page 65 verse number one so suta sutha is the again the narrator the narrator after this he is narrating this happening this happening now this so what he says being thus piled with many alternative questions piled up so many questions by whom by king yudhisthira yudhisthira put these questions was full of evil for buildings at the site of his emaciated and depressed arjuna the friend of krishna was not for some time able to say anything in reply the third party responder he's saying that arjuna came and he put so many piled up questions but this arjuna was not able to respond anything quickly that he became little dumbfounded as it were no as in that as in was not for some time able to say anything in reply as he was in the throes of suffering caused by separation from krishna it can be understood as if he is suffering that krishna has left probably that is the reason he was consequently dejected depressed deprived of all his strength his strength was krishna it seems that krishna is gone that's why he is feeling that he is so depressed deprived and our strength is gone mental and physical strength mental strength also again and physical strength also he has lost as it were he only stood silent his mind engrossed in his lord he was thinking of krishna he stood silent and do not know how to respond it took some time third verse he then restrained the tears of his eyes but arjuna is such a warrior tears in his eyes is an emotional thing he is not made of that type of weak personality that they will like us will cry any problem comes we start crying before let's say psychologically those are not strong savvy vivekananda he used to cry but no one would see his cry his cry was for the good of humanity but in our tradition also cry okay you cry don't show it check it check it so that your strength will be much deeper your emotions checked will give you higher spirituality higher nervous strength so he then restrained his tears in his eyes and wiped away the drops dripping down his mind was ridden with grief caused by his love for his departed friend now you understand krishna left the body that's why he his mind was fully grip stricken revolving in his mind over krsna's various acts of love like agreeing to be in the charioteer and over his companion passionate love and friendliness arjuna began to speak as follows to his brother the king with tears again throwing and boys trembling so he now is responding to yudhisthira this response but see his condition is totally emotionally choked he's lost his old strength because his friend who agreed bhagavan himself agreed to be the charioteer of his chariot to in the war and constant companion constant giving support and service no arjuna said oh great king i have been betrayed by hari whom i took to be a friend he has deprived me of my crows which was once the wonder of even the devas he gave me the power he took away that power he because of that power even the gods used to fear me indra indra is the god of gods he was frightened with arjuna's strength and prowse but who gave it that power understand krishna gave and krishna to carry so this is the point in life also very important point we hear this type of statement in our swamis great swamis swami shraddhan and this is called the sage of sacramento people the devotees of that area they call he's the sage of sacramento and he used to say one time he came over here he used to come on vacation and he had stay with us and we used to get the holy company like that last we had it recently so so he one day he wanted to give a talk here and he will be thinking of a song which he sang hundred times two hundred times all through the life very inspirational song but he forgot the lines so he asked me to find out some music book we which we have try to find well but that song was little maybe in some other edition not in these books and he tried whole days he's such a man of brilliance memory and everything the whole day he tried and tried and tried and failed and said ultimately can you find out can you find it and when i'm just i went to receive bring him to the podium here and he frustrated way first totally frustrated he said you know ramakrishna today taught me that you have no power all power belongs to me you cannot remember one word which you have 100 200 times sang it is the most favorite song and you could not remember tried whole day as if he's telling me that god taught me this lesson you are not a speaker you are nothing i give you power that you do see that understanding here arjuna is saying arjuna is powerful all the gods become jealous about his powers but it is because of krishna now he has left my power is also taken away my self-confidence has gone my everything i have lost just as a body beat of a dear or near one becomes an abject repulsion when life is out of it this body so long speaking this and that is good when the live breath goes away what will happen this body will remain and it will become it it it it is rejectable you cannot keep this for a long time deteriorate it will smell it will do so you cannot keep it anymore so similarly god's presence has given the life and energy and everything without his presence this has become so so this world is a very unpleasant place for me when it is even for a moment without the presence of the lord i don't physical presence of the lord philosophically god is everywhere forget that but physically the lord used to work with me walk with me i was his friend and that personality is lost gone it was by his favor that i could easily overcome the prows of many kings who had assembled under the influence a passionate love had they assembled from the bridal choice shayam bar held in draupadi's coat could strike accurately with the bow kept in readiness the target of the mechanically moving fish and sikkyo drew buddhia's bride he said i was such a powerful person i went to marry drupadi so there is a trick that one keep one fish will be there in the high top no and then yeah there will be a circle there is a moving circle and you will have to not look at that and with the arrow you strike no you will have to look at the reflection of that in the water water reflection is not like a mirror reflection you should be so concentrated to look at the reflection and take the arrow like that and strike hit and strike the eye of the eye of the fish and then that powerful person will be able to marry draupadi drupal's daughter so so many kings came with prows and concentration everyone failed it is virtual who did it he said by whose power i did it by krsna's power so i that power is gone now so i am such a person of such strength and ability that strength and ability all came from krishna now that is gone it was by his favor that i could enable agni the fire god god of fire to consume the whole of kanda forest there is a big fire that that was eating away like wildfire we get in in our not southern california northern california fire it was consuming but he had the arrow he could stop dogni devata stop burning and he did that khandawa forest overwhelming oppositions of
