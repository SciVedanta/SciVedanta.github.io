[Bhagavatam - Introduction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9s3S2C57k7M)

[Music] he our salutation to bhagavan krishna the destroyer of kong chandra the darling of mother jason and the guru of the world and world teacher our salutations to him again and again so today we are starting a very grand spiritual text of hindu tradition it is called the shrimad bhagavatam it is a really difficult task that i thought that i will study for my own purpose it is such a text it has about 18 000 verses and to read it it lacks whole it takes whole life to read such a profound spiritual ideals where all the blending of the non-dual absolute truth to the dualistic idea to the idea of the puranas qualified non-dualism all the philosophies have been blended in such a way and ultimately it leads to the freedom and and devotion this text spiritual text is a classic text in hindu religion and literature they it actually put on it falls under the category of purana purana means the narrative of ancient times narrative of ancient times and through quranic literature though puranic literature take its present shape only from the fifth century but the nucleus form which it developed existed much earlier and was as old as the vedic samhitas so it is as long as it earth orb of veda time so it is however to be noted that only the purano is used in these references there are so many puranas and it is called that says it is called it is purana sangita it is separate from the vedas in the early days the recital of the quran and the sacrificial rights must have been the function of the brahman priests but as time went on it gradually came to regular delegate to a mixed cast class this suta suta means the error india was divided in so many small countries states and there are kings and the suitors were some class of people who have incredible memory they would anything recited anything said they could memorize it spontaneously the suta was this was written as told by suta in a congregation earlier days actually the story goes that there is a king pariksit by name shri krishna's grandson sri krishna's grandson and he was cursed by a brahmin rishi son that you will die in seven days because by a snake bite because you insulted my father with a snake putting in the neck dead snake putting in the neck the story goes that king parikshit went to the forest as was the custom of the time and went on hunting deer that was the a pastime of the kings and he felt so exhausted and tired and thirsty in his own kingdom so he could not find any drinking water so ultimately saw a house of hermitage and seeing that okay i may get some water so went there and found that there was a house and a person sitting in meditation in those days wonderful country spiritual country and he went and begged when he being the king of the country he begged sir i am very thirsty could you please give me a glass of water but the man the gentleman is a sage where he could not listen he he is so stepped into meditation didn't hear anything and then as he didn't hear so he requested second time and third time but king was literally disturbed but how that how much meditation you are doing you don't listen to is so much request earnest request for a glass of water and he thought he is painting he's making a show of meditation so he found a dead snake somewhere and with his arrow yeah he picked it up and put like a garden like a shiva okay now you do your meditation like a shiva and he left and his son went on to neighboring place maybe and he come and found his father's neck there's a dead snake what happened and by that time the father also woke up with so much noise and so and his son was so angry who did it to my father he will die within seven days he will die within seven days with the buy the snake bite same snake you will bite and the father was really upset and when he said my my fault the king of the country like parikshita came such a holy man descendant in the and family of the krishna such a good king and he is being cursed you should not do that please withdraw your cars it will be detrimental for the whole country but you know the son is arrogant he said my father is insulted i will not tolerate this anyhow in those days their voice their whatever comes out of the mouth of a such family of truthfulness and honesty that becomes true and anyhow this thing happened here and the king went back and by the watts of mouth he came to know and that he has been cast that he will be beaten by snake by within seven days only seven days life is there but he did not get angry with this this uh boy or he didn't make any effort to protect himself what for a king to protect from a snake king's palace whole army a room may be sealed so many things are there but he didn't take any other he took a lesson out of it oh i have only seven days to leave ah so what shall i do now just someone tells me you are only in the world for seven days what will happen so then dally think that okay let me do this job and talk to this person go for this pain happy fun in the movie and go and sing and dance somewhere and have some good feast you will you do like that or you say hi i'm only seven days what to do now and so he left his kingdom and gave responsibility of the country or his uh state to his son and then to cable just be relaxed from the all responsibilities and went on a holy land it is called that that is a holy place where there are many sacrificial sacrificial uh um worships have been done in that holy place by thousands and thousands through so many ages together brahmins performed that means an auspicious place on the bank of ganga and then he started yes and a whole community of sages and saints of the country followed that king pariksit and went on and because they lost such a fatherly king who is to take care of the whole community so like a loving caring father in in all their troubles and tribulations and he is now going away what will happen then they followed and they settled in one place and then when he was saying all become very calm and quiet and he asked that please tell me about something spiritual for these last few days how shall i pass this few days so suddenly they found that one young boy his name is shukadeva shukadeva is the son of vyasa bhagavan basa who composed the uh what we call the brahmasutras who organized the all the vedas we get now rik veda huge huge spiritual text his son and he was a he had it he has his full knowledge he was born with full knowledge so when he she he suddenly started walking through that and seeing that the whole assemblage of the holy people stood up including the king parikh and on him and respected him and then said that oh you are here what a great fortune so please tell me something i have only seven days to live in the world please tell me the story of bhagavan krishna the lord who came down as a human being for the good of humanity i want to spend these seven days in the in the memoir of the shri krishna bhagavan's krishna and spend my all day and night in the thought of that to purify myself so please tell and then he now started putting questions product sheet is putting question the king put it and response is given by the sukhar and this continued continued continued day and night and seven days came and at the end of seven days the entire book this whatever we are reading we plan to read i do not know whether i will be able to finish before my death but anyhow it is just to read out those and what reading we can do so but if you take one verse it's such a grand party it may take one class but anyhow but it is better to know the greatness of this spiritual text then at the end of the seventh day the sukadeva said okay now i have told all your i responded to all your questions and i have narrated this story life and teachings of bhagavan krishna have you any other further question then he said no i have no more question and i'm no more fear of death death is knocking at my dead door seven days is gone six days is only remaining five days four days three days two days one day tomorrow no but i am ready i am not fear of fearful about death that is the this scripture can give conquering death that is the lesson here how to conquer death how to conquer fear how to conquer our all weaknesses because it is told by what sukadeva and who is the learner the king parikshit who has renounced everything to know this truth see the context on one side student is fully renunciate who can renounce who can be a greater enunciate than that of king pariksit he was the king of india and he has left it like straw there's no value to know the truth before i die i must have to know the truth student is such high class student and you get to know the truth and have the capacity to renounce for everything in life like meaningless worthless objects and the teacher is a renunciate he's a monk he's from birth he has the full knowledge of brahman and he's roaming around free from all worries anxieties and and living in the life of freedom and that joy or bliss of god's a realization so that's why this this was the first very much studied by the sadhus monks because it is talking about the highest renunciation and talking about the highest wisdom and then in time the devotees it came into the householder people also started reading those and listening to that and then it became more popular as a text bhakti book that's why in the ac bhaktivedanta or krishna temple they emphasize this book and in india also it is very much respected it is considered as a highest text about bhakti school of thought but it is if you go to deep depth it's full of its very fast beginning is brahman you will find that if we continue to read and pay attention it's talking about even the basso who composed his past he said he took a big apology to god narayana krishna that you are infinite you are worthless you are beyond time and space and i forgive me my mistakes my my my writing this book in this way why because i am infinite you are infinite i have made you as if you are a finite you are beyond time i have put you in a time frame so this is living i limited you the unlimited absolute you are i have limited you so please forgive by this transgression this is the that's why it's a it is to be considered the great study of vedanta in all its aspects now the story should have some relation with it how then this sukadeva told this and how do we get it now so when at the end of discourse in maharaja pariksit i'm leaving now because he does not want to see the last part of the snake bite and death etc so he said okay have you any other question well he said no i have no no more question i have conquered the death i know the truth now and then shukhari was leaving the place and then other sages and saints they were so much overwhelmed so long listening to this conversation and the advice of sukadeva they came to sense hey such a treasure of knowledge will go in vain who no one has recorded no one has taken note of it what will happen then they requested shukhadeva then what will happen such as such grand spiritual knowledge it will be all lost then sugar devil looked in the in the congregation and found there is one suta suta means i have told you before suta means a class of people narrator who have incredible memory and they can like photographic memory they can reproduce the thing as they have hard as they ever seen like that so there is one suta in that category and he is being in knower of truth looking at that he said he that that person will remain that person will recollect everything what i have said and and that in that way it will be preserved and then what happened when the left hand on pariksit the snake came and died and his light big body became effulgent and emerged into the cosmic consciousness death description now this suta he went from place to place and used to narrate and he and his tradition came down but he is to narrate this krishna story in this bhagavata what we are reading what we will be reading and people at the special occasions india was that wonderful country any occasion comes they will have some spiritual festivity there these were reading they used to call these sutas to listen about god and god's glories and this is the way this that suit us from that mouth of the sutras and gradually gradually it became a tradition and then sometime it was written down and historicity is they say it's a long range where it was only shruti only hearing hearing hearing and then in some period of time it came into a text and that's the way we get this from the suta that's why when you read here you will find sometimes shuto is talking shuttle is a narrator he has nothing to do with this as like a sanjaya in the bhagavad-gita sanjay is a just observer like in your football game someone is the narrator narrator only narrates what is going on in this and that so these suitors are narrators but they have had their inner memories so sharp they can from their mind they can whatever their heart in truth they could reproduce it so this is the story that we get to this text spiritual text and that is srimad bhagavatam so there are many muha puranas in innocent and comprehensive distinguished they're from there are 18 in numbers 18 purana maha puranas there we need not have to know that much mahapuranas can be described as major puranas and also there are upo puranas they are contrast to it be described as subsidiary puranas so these are the way many puranas principle features and contents of puranas all the puranas with exception of a few are more or less sectarian in nature exalting as they do someone or another they called gods like vishnu shiva shakti that means their why they are very much focused in bhakti bhakti become little sectarian why we are we are the only sect we following vishnu the business follower visnu they will say bishnu is highest someone is shiva the shiva purana shiva parana is glorified shiva is the ultimate god and then shakti or shiva or shaktipura so this exaltation of one aspect of the deity and subordination of the others to it is often wrongly interpreted to mean narrow sectarian rivalry among these cults by people who don't understand the genuineness of this vedic religion the scripts are not to my i love visnu does not mean that your shiva is to be belittled but in dualism it happens my path is the highest path and that goes to extreme world religions look at that my religion is the highest religion other religions must be low other religions must be subdued so this type of sectarian idea comes but they don't understand the vedic culture vedic culture is that what ramakrishna said and it is there you will find this when you read this here karma yoga bhakti are all equally responded some places to emphasize already in our lecture also we do know you know when you are specifically specifically giving a talk on bhakti what do you say to create the impression that those people who are listening or who are practicing they will be encouraged to say bhakti is good better that does not mean that you have to pull down the greatness of other paths so that is the weakness of sectarianism so it says that place on bhagavat place of the bhagavata among the puranas is exactly what exactly is the place of bhagavata purana in this vast body of the religious literature it will be noted that it is included in the traditional list 18 mahapurnanas but this has been questioned by devi bhagavat which claims that bhagavatam thus relegating the vishnu bhagavata to the position of the purana some say it is not that this is but anyhow they don't go into you don't have to spend time for all these and the date of bhagavata also the date and personal present textual form of bhagavatam modern scholarship is not in a position to give a firm answer in no spiritual text of indian tradition you can find a debt which day because indian tradition is not based on debt and the truth people are overwhelmed man when it what is that essential teaching not which day who what place because they are not so much history-minded anyhow so this has a great position in the among all the puranas shri krishna and the bhagavatam his dominance in it main thesis of bhagavata is to inculcate the glory and the greatness of bhagavan sri krishna and the necessity of cultivation of devotion to him the rest of the subject matter include the accounts of other incarnation is made subordinate to it it is an accepted principle of interpretation that the subject matter of a book will be reflected in its introduction and conclusion so just from this point of view the whole of this scandals of the bhagavata deals with shri krishna and the best tool of his grace on the pandavas and the three concluding skandas deal directly with him his teachings and the time that followed so the the question of the rishis of naomi sharon just i refer to that the what question they put in answer to which suto gave out this bhagavata is most exclusively related to krishna they asked o suta tell us what was the purpose for which the bhagavan was born in devaki as the son of vasudeva tell us who are endowed with spiritual zeal about his noble and sportive activities of which sages have sung tell us about the incidence of the incarnation of worry wherein he manifested his supportive nature through his own mysterious power we are never satisfied with hearing the glories of activities of the lord the descriptions of which appeared so sweet to true ganesha at the every stage so these are the questions have been put by the racism and the consequence of this advice these are the questions and as a result of the its response the advice was the production of the bhagavata actually the shuka responded to all these questions you know one page question is there i'm not reading now that will take time so just to get a glimpse all types of questions about krishna krsna's birth krsna's super review and activity as why he was incarnated all these questions are put and the response was given in the form so and the consequence of this advice was the production of the bhagavata which describes itself what in other words the supreme lord huri who destroys all the evils of the iron age of kali yuga has not been praised in all their parts but in the narrative of bhagavatam bhagavan has been glorified in every word of it so so krishna's glory has been mostly talked about but philosophical outlook of bhagavata the impression that non-sectarian leaders would have out at the outlook of the bhagavatam on metaphysics is that it is not exclusively committed to any single system these are the sectarian idea but you read the bhagavatam in a dispassionate way then he says this is the philosophical outlook if you read that we will read that from that perspective we are belong to perspective where we don't twist the texture text by mentioning it which is vedantic to make it devotional of course vedanta also talk about krishna the impersonal krishna the krishna de personal for us it is no problem but for dualists there is a krishna his name only personal and he is god himself and there is no other god and other gods are little gods smaller gods they are less lesser all lesser always compare that is the human weakness my guru is the greatest guru other gurus are there but mine is the highest you know so this is this is all weakness of human mind but you know essentially everything is permeated by brahman atman god god is only one and even he says he is everywhere if you say everywhere and someone says christ is everywhere so what is the problem if one says ramakrishna is everywhere what is the problem because when you name you should go and fight your ramakrishna or your array if you say everywhere then name is no no no importance you can rama you call allah you call krishna you can god what it matters that's why sriram krishna's life is very very important and we can find some how it matches that spiritual ideal is matches here and the problems of modern leaders arising from the quranic outlook if this look at the quranic outlet problem will be dissension differentiation fight but ramakrishna said don't fight no don't argue go and eat the mangoes in a mango grove don't spend your time by fighting with others it's bhakti okay enjoy your bhakti it's gano enjoy your ghana that's all and ghana and bhakti will read you the same saccidananda is ananda and ghana is what saccidananda so what is the difference so they see these are the only introduction so i am not reading it only one line two line how uh idea of evolution in the tradition of purana started yes true you corrected me that is the problem so all these name things and we are so now here we find that one similar story we can find that master masa m the chronicler what he did he was also tormented in life's problem he was coming to commit suicide even because family trouble was so much with the wife and the family in living in which side to go he was so tormented he was he was escaping from the life's situation and going to commit suicide that was his plan but his wife said why are you going i will go i'll also go with you he said no no i am going to my sisters ok i will also go with you he knew that his mind is so much depressed so so he followed and that story goes that he once started from home and he came he's not far away from he hired in it is a the horse driven carriage were available those days so he rented a house diving carriage but he only it came to sambajar near the uh that place where holy mother's house is now close by so by it came and the one of the wheel broke so and it was evening so what he'll do and then now and nowadays so many people are there in the evening time but those days it is calcutta was not thickly populated like that so he remembered what to go with my wife now so he thought that he will go to the house of his one friend he remembered that in that where the he descended from the broken carriage and we'll go to their home and you knocked at that door but even the friends we will be the friend in odd hours so he said that can he stay over here then can you give give us your horse carriage or something and they actually that question was put but they could not stay there that much was final so they found how to come out and by anyhow they got to another carriage and they came to a place very close to the nation where am's sister lived so he came and they are surprised at odd hours to this they have come okay then they stayed but this nephew of um aim he anyhow got fascinated with m and he became a companion of him next morning he wanted to go to some place well he's always following him his wife was there now wife left but this nephew followed him and he went here and he said oh will you go to your place here is a paramahang song doxination and that is the way shidhu was the name of that nephew he actually came to he took him to the doctor nation and he first met rama krishna there in a very beautiful way the description in the gospel and there he describes that as if it is because he read this bhagavata to his mind he recollected azeeb and ramakrishna speaking like shukadeva they were free soul and so many devotees are listening with wrapped attention about azeeb as if sukhadeva is speaking before the audience no so that type of environment was parallel because ramadan's gospel is also same and it saved his life that's why he conquered death in that sense his he felt so much attracted he came second day like that and the description goes in the gospel you can find it so you find that it is ames mind recollected the story of the ah naemi sharon story how his life which was he thought useless to just to kill himself took a turn and gave him the touch of immortality so that's a very beautiful thing and the teachings of ramakrishna you can find the similar if you read this we read this book we can sometimes think of the similarity of the lessons because the same person no same person he says he he was rama he who was krishna he is ramakrishna in this age so that was the same divine entity for the good of humanity comes again and again it is what i said here is a prologue it says i better to read this prologue it is two pages it says the first scandal which will read the book of bhagavatu is by way of an introduction describing how the bhagavata came to be product produced and made popular the occasion is also taken to introduce the subject of the krsna's greatness which is the main topic of the purana the scene is laid in the naomi sharon very long drawn fire sacrifices that is called satra is being performed by some rishis who during the period of their rises from ritualistic duties put their questions to suta roma harana this name of the gentleman from whom we get this bhagavata that suta that recollector of the memory was his name roma harsham ramaharsana means one whose whose hairs stand on joy in erect with joy talking about god romaharsama his name was roma harsana on devotional things they especially want to know how man is sustained how man is to sustain his spiritual life after krsna's departure from the world and the setting in of the evil age of kali in reply the sutto expressions on the glory of bhagavata dharma what is the bhagavad-gita the life of devotion dedicated to the lord which could be cultivated to the study of the practice of the teachings of bhagavatam in this college we are in the middle of the or it started with the death of krishna khalid yugo started with the death of krishna declined declined decline in england and we are in the middle of the extreme decline no god knows how far down it can go the life of devotion to the lord which could be cultivated through study and practice of these teachings of bhagavata describe the glory of krishna krishna leaves in the bhagavatam which records which records his achievements and teaching it is then stated by the suta that he learned this bhagavata when it was taught to raja parikshita the king pariksit at his deathbed this suta was present when sukadeva was talking by sri sukadeva who in turn had learnt it from his father vyasa sugar they've learned from whom his father vyasadeva who was himself the author of the purana so he composed it composed means in brain that's why why in india so much of chanting and repetition was there because there was no books everything you have to memorize that's why you find so many aphorisms because to memorize for ordinary people they cannot keep the whole book but in short a based quote codified language you can memorize one after another and then going through that you can understand the whole book book in your brain all the text in your brain that's a guru mukhi bidda that's why indian tradition is that you are to go to a teacher you cannot learn without that so that because there was no book at all and also they were people who saturated themselves with these noble thoughts see book is there we don't learn deeply is it not because you are not having any book why someone is telling it can be available it can be on the youtube i will listen later on so nothing no not serious to take it now i have to take it in and i'll forget i'll lose it forever no so this was the greatness of the ancient time teaching they have to immediately work with full attention otherwise they miss it miss it the teacher is not going to teach you the listener that teaching earlier days teaching today again and then when the book will be finished this eighteen thousand verses if someone wants to say so when it will be finished so you will have to have too much attention and that's why tradition came from guru maki and then if the guru makes a mistake then you learn wrongly so see he should be responsible then he should have wonderful memory and also to be just exacting the ideas so that was the raja parikshit then he came from baso and who was himself the author a detailed account is given in these circumstances leading to basil composing the bhagavad gita there is another account how basil composed this there is another story bias was a celebrity and the in that account is also included highly devotional previous history of this age that what was that let me quickly say that the the one day bhasa was meditating on the bank of the river as you hear now the name of the bank is ganga ganges ganga narmada still now they are flowing but they are drying up now it is said that there was another green river it is called swarasvati river and the vyasa devil was sitting in the meditation on the bank of the saraswati river stepped in meditation but his mind was just less restless restless not getting peace and then the narada says naruto appeared before the beast and he said see i am not getting peace in my mind then naruto advised yes you have yes true you have divided the vedas into four vedas organize them you have written the brahmasutras but you have not meditated on the sweet sweetness of god when he incarnates you think about that and you write that compose those things then you will find peace so then he started composing this bhagavata so it says that a detailed account is then given of the circumstances leading to basis compounds composing the bhagavatam in that account it is also included the highly devotional previous history of the sage narada questions are then raised as to why the text was taught to pariksit at his deathbed by sukha and this leads to the narrative narration of several episodes after mahabharata war astoma's murderers that are taken attack on the children of the pandavas their relationship etc a brief but highly vivid and devotional account of the impacts made by shri krishna and the pandavas on their subjects and relatives in their in is then given followed by the moving description of the exit from the world krsna's exit marks the beginning of the age of kuli which was the pious pariksit the grandson of pandavas had to come into confrontation the region of pariksit is then described especially how he checkmated the degeneration of the age of koli was bringing in next in this indiscreet act of pariksit which brought on him this is scarce to die in the bite of serpent takshaka within a short time is described so this is followed by the scene of parikshit observing the vows of starvation as a preservation to face death at this point he says sukha arrives at the spot by chance and king parishit asked him to explain what would lead to the spiritual good of man threatened by the imminent death like himself in reply suko offers to narrate to him this bhagavatam which leads very quickly to man's spiritual emancipation in all these narratives atmosphere is taken to show the spiritual glory of sri krishna and to inculcate devotion to him so that we human being we take refuge at the feet of the lord when death comes suffering comes so this is the inspiration to give uh it is highly poetic and devotional and forms one of the most sublime section of the text though it is introductory form it is the final section added to the complete narration of krsna's life and glory and it may be that it was the last section to come in the development of bhagavata literature too the famous line krishnas to bhagavan swayam is significant in this respect whereas in all other places krishna is spoken of as a kaalo or wrong so or part kola or wrongs or potter here he is posited as purna avatar complete incarnation in a category different from other incarnations it marks the stage when krishna cult had dominated vaishnavism and the whole chapter might have been inspired by this mood of bhushanabas at an advanced stage of development so they are talking about whatever is now we will read bhagavatam so we cannot read anything more but we will only read the first verse to start at least we have started srimad srimad-bhagavatam means these it is chapter skanda is a whole volume it has his chapter and the chapter has his verse number each chapter has several so when you read bhagavat you will find 1 dot 10 dot 3 meaning the scandal book is one in its chapter 1 and verse number is this so every chapter changes and the verse number changes that is the way the book is described so one two three like the books will be not like that prathamaskandna this chapter is one and the verse number is one oh my god janma janma jato [Music] [Music] [Music] this world astra means this world universe it's the origin where it from origin adi means where it came from where it sustains where it dissolves that supreme brahman janma destro from where it comes and it did and also all these objects in the universe which is fine we find like the uh gotha and potter ghatta means potter means cloth canvas and also these are all it is like fantasy of the mind there is no such thing the the world you see okarche also it is sin it is you experience it because of your bad karma your mind is deluded just sarvagar but that lord who is sarvagar the unwar of everything sarva-shaktimaan all powerful and that truth which has been described in the vedas and by whose maya even the brahma vishnu they also get deluded he who that same veda the wisdom who has brought in the heart of brahma and created from his mind i salute that for foreign minister i salute that supreme lord see very fast verse is talking about what unique blending of the non-dual and the dual nameless and the name you hear the translation i read i have translated that way but let us read this this is the book we are you can refer to swami tapasyananda it is called srimad bhagavatam she has four volumes like this but only first volume we are concerned i so the first verse i am reading so his translation we read he he from whom the creation sustenance and dissolution of the universe take place who is both material and instrumental cause of it see who is the material cause and instrumental cause what does it mean this matter it is also he instrumental cause the carpenter who created he is also he the name and form whatever you see it is he only who is omniscient that that krishna we are talking about that paramatma we are talking about who permeates everything everywhere is he who is the only one having self-mastery in the world only god is the only have self-mastery we have no control over ourselves but god has created this universe by his own power it is his being the one independent entity his only independent all are dependent on that brahman is the independent entity everything is dependent on that who illumine the mind of brahma even with the vedic revelation in the brahma's heart the knowledge of vedas came who confront it is he he means that it's not a person but that god who appeared as he is talking about this krishna the absolute by whose will everything happened vedic relation of wisdom entered by the relation revelation whose wisdom is the wonder of even the greatest of the sages in whom the worlds and the manifestations of the three gunas subsist in reality without in the list afflicting him the trigunas rest on brahman on him krishna krishna is carrying triguna but he is not affected by the goonas you can say krishna you can say bruman but so subsist in reality without the least affecting just as the combination of the material elements like fire water earth etc subsist in their cause without changing their elemental nature no this earth element goes back to his earth substance you know this element gross thing goes back to the subtle like that in your dream what you see this material art is not there but you see some earth there also there you also see water also you can see ocean in the dream but that water is made of the essence of this water so he is the support of that without changing their elemental nature in whose light of consciousness there is no place for anything false on that truth supreme we meditate now you think the very first verse of bhagavata is very enigmatic in its meaning many of the cardinal words in it are vague in their input capable of diverse interpretation so all the commentators have interpreted the verse in the way it suits the metaphysics of their school you are a vedanto you can pull it vedanta you are a dualist you can put all these meaning in a dualistic way you are qualified non-dualist yes he has become everything he is a part and he is the whole you can do that whether monistic dualistic or positions made between these extremes it looks that the author of the bhagavatam has introduced the vagueness purposely for from examination of the text as a whole one will find that he has no objection to any metaphysics you can look at krishna from the perspective of infinite satchitananda you can look at him the creator god you can think that he has become everything you can think that he has become that's why we say world religion you can analyze you will find that these are the common ground brahman the absolute nirguna
