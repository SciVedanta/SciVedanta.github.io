[Bhagavatam - 1.10.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouHNv5Bjyao)

[Music] guru [Music] the destroyer of the demon kang so and chanura the darling of the mother devaki the guru of the allah all and the lord of the universe om peace peace peace so we are reading today chapter 10 of book number one we're starting here last time we read this is the krishna the war the kurukshetra war is over now the fight between the two cousins and now shri krishna finishing his all this work is going back to his own kingdom and that time everyone is very sad because the lord is leaving them god of the universe they could understand they are great people who could understand the greatness of bhagavan krishna that's why they went to bhisma and then bhisma the grand grand sire he asked some praise he praised bhagavan krishna in his highest esteem and then krishna again is starting to go back and that here the scene is described beautifully by bhagavan basu basu also had the praise and now we see what krsna's leaving after the mahabharata war sri krishna is going back to his kingdom so we read there that is the chapter 10 starts so no watch question how did judith tira the greatest among the righteous engage himself in the administration of the land along with his brothers after he had destroyed the envious sujana who waste water war to assert his kingdom so this is the question is placed before saunaka reporting that this asking and then suta the narrator is responding so question is that how did yudhisthira who is judiciary and their elder brother is judicious so judistira the greatest amongst the righteous person he is recognized as the greatest person who values righteousness and for truthfulness he dedicated everything for that the greatest among the righteous engage himself in administration because he was a righteous person pious person so how he administered his kingdom is a huge kingdom of all india and that time india was extended up to kabul kandahar afghan all those areas it was included it's a huge emperor so what is the condition of judicious administration and after he had destroyed when there is no evil from the society that jodhana and the 100 brothers who were greedy who were unrighteously occupying the country and mistreating the holy people so that was the question now then the suta the narrator is explaining verse number 2 on page 44 bottom left hand so hurry hurry the protector of the world by the success situation the life of the prakshith in his mother soon saved from extinction the clan of the kurus that was destroyed by the forest fire of fratricital war in brotherly war that has killed the whole of india now all the warriors in both sides so they are also the there is no descendant of the king uh the in the lineage of arjuna and others only parikshit is the only one and she was he was also was going to be killed by krishna protected it by exercising his special power so parikshit was protected in the womb of mother in his mother's womb that was saved and that saved the extinction of the clan of the kurus he was then pleased to install judish tira then bhagavan krishna then installed yudhisthira in his kingdom formerly assad by his cousins now judistira's mind was freed from all confusion as wisdom dawned on him through the advice of krishna as well as bhisma so listening to the advice of krishna listening to advice of the grandsire bhisma and krishna both his mind was very clean and jordana i know all the name i am confused and judistira is a holy holy person truthful person honest and man of character and dedication so he ruled the country and how it happened his mind the king he is the king but his mind was resigned to krishna that is the way of living the life we live in the world but we don't surrender ourselves to god difference between ordinary people and spiritual people is that ordinary people also do the work spiritual person also does the work original ordinary people take the credit i did so much i am such and such and holy people will give all glory to god and all everything every moment they will surrender at the feet of the lord so that that's why that was the speciality of holy people that's why this the mind was totally absorbed in krishna the lord and assisted by his brothers other four other brothers what bhima nuclear sahadeva began to rule his kingdom extending to the limits of the sea and ocean as indra rules over the heavens hindu is the god of heaven as he rules without any obstacle there is no competitor there so here also judistero free from all competiting warriors judish terror is ruling the country whole of india up to the sea the ocean no that means last part of india you go anywhere it is all all three sides are all sea ocean during his rule his rule means judicia's rule the clouds reigned according to need meaning most auspicious time what does it mean the rain cloud rains according to need that means when it is needed it rains it does not flood that is it does not create flood or it does not create drought understand that is the idea the clouds rain according to need the earth became fertile and high yielding all the crops are coming out wonderfully fruits and flowers and the animals the cows with swelling other bedsides of the flooding flowing milk that means profuse eatable things and milk pure milk available rivers seas mountains trees herbs and cultivated crops all become fruitful according to season that means everything coming in proper season the the countries prosperous nature is also helping to prosper because the right righteousness has started it is it is when the king become good the subjects become also very happy prosperity comes honesty comes sincerity comes joy comes if the king is king is polluted or evil minded the whole subjects they suffer but this is the wonderful time because judistiro the righteous king is now ruling the country during the rule of yudhisthira his subjects were free from worries and disease that means perfect health care perfect system of food distribution like that ideal condition was prevailed as also from troubles the subjects who are free from worries free from disease free from troubles caused by super abundant causes natural cause or what you call incidental causes the society became very joyful cheerful because of the presence of this type of wonderful king seven and eight verse after having stayed in hostinapool that means that callus that palace kingdom of what is called yudhisthira for some months he stayed back for few months to console his friends and satisfy his sister subhadra the wife of arjuna he paid farewell to judiciary now after staying in the kingdom and setting yudhisthira in his throne and bhagavan krishna stayed with them for some months and then he ultimately wanted to beat farewell farewell to judistira and received his permission to depart after mutual veneration and embraces he then got into his chariot krishna entered into his chariot in those days chariots ours are cars our helicopters a special plane so they had some such special vehicles to run so krishna entered into the chariot to go to his city dwarka and now it is found that dwarka was so much prosperous during the time of krishna in the historical they are what you call the excavation has been done by the marine people under the sea and they found a town with perfect system of drainage system buildings and most modern town so it was it was called the krsna's kingdom of dwarka it was impossible for all the residents of the palace both men and women such as subhadra panchali kunti these are all the family members of the royal family everyone were very much upset because the krishna the beloved the lord himself is leaving them and even to think of separation from shri krishna without feeling shocked and bewildered they thought they felt it is they felt the shock how can they live without such benign great spirituality 11th verse on page 45 spiritual aspirants who have their evil tendencies effect by holy contact never stop reciting the lord's excellencies having listened to them but once how then can the sons of pandu stand separation from the very lord with whom they have been living in utmost intimacy always seeing him touching him conversing him and sleeping meeting when krishna was there he was living with his family like a friend he was a friend of arjuna krishna was the friend of arjuna and krishna was the lord of the universe so the question is that even holy people those who meditate on the lord they get a little touch in meditation and when that meditation mood goes and the they can't meditate they feel not happy and think of these people this whole family members with whom god of the universe lord of the universe bhagavan krishna walked with them slept with them talked with them in their difficulties and their suffering stood behind them how they can allow krishna to leave their heart was breaking is it so sweet that's why they are they are very much by the all our tendencies evil tendencies effect by holy contact they don't remember they can't stay without thinking of god all the time so what the question of this pandu this judish terror and others and all the royal ladies who got the blessings of bhagavan krishna how they can forget him so they are very much upset bound as they were to krishna with god of love their thoughts were directed to him and their eyes were fixed unwinking on him while they moved here and there about him no because they used to seek krishna now and then he is here he is there so seeing god walking around you the time and now that physical presence of bhagavan krishna will be absent now how they can tolerate so it is a pain it is a severe pain for them royal kins woman whose intense sorrow at his departure brought tears into their eyes they were weeping sobbing somehow they restrained its flow thinking that such an inauspicious sign like weeping should not occur while sri krishna was starting to go home so with a soft drum beating of the drums kettle drums conch  instrument flute pipes and trumpets bells high sounding battle drums and host of such other musical and percussions instruments now sounded announcing the departure of krishna it's a very poetic description this is a written by vyasa the greatest poet so that's why it's so beautiful to read you just mentally can imagine that krishna is going to go away then all the people around in the palace all came down and the royal ladies they will never be able to see him again so they are in tears and spiritual atmosphere all the brothers they are also sad because the lord is leaving them their physical presence and that's why now he moved and this beating of the kettles venus fruits all the instruments giving him by the one the woman of the kurus in their eagerness to see him stood on the terrace of the buildings and began to shower flowers on krishna as it happens now there are flowers being thrown from the roof where the path krishna is moving and looks mingled with love and shyness or do you know held over his beloved friend the white imperial umbrella inner imagine arjuna is holding an umbrella on the head of bhagavan krishna and that umbrella is decorated with pearl garlands and having diamond studded handle uddhava and satyaki were beautiful bunches of chaudi hair from both sides of the lord that means we do the charmer in the rot time the fanning so good tawa and satyagi these two they are panning him from both sides who amidst of all these and sources of flowers falling from above shown in the street through which he passed so he was gradually going and people of the whole country or the city they are transfixed in the krsna's divine form and they are throwing flowers they are sending tears and the arjuna holding the umbrella and the others are fanning him this is the beautiful scene to imagine how krishna is living again and again where had the wars of blessings pronounced by the brahmanas brahmins are chanting mantras vedic mantras they are chanting pronouncing the blessings and shanti shanti shanti like these type of mantras what what chanting may you be happy or may you be long-lived what's inappropriate to the absolute but appropriate to the incarnation as man there is a philosophy coming and i said this book is so filled with philosophy and also story as if they are talking giving us a picture that krishna is living and brahmins are chanting the others are shedding tears it's a very common sin if you love someone as living from living leaving you you'll feel that type of pains and agonies but sometimes he said the brahmanas are chanting but chanting how can you chant god is infinite no chant can go there it is beyond speech beyond time beyond space beyond possession but when he takes a human form by maya as we are under the spell of maya god has accepted his own maya he is the boss of the maya but with that maya power he becomes like a human being like christ like buddha like rama like krishna this is the krsna's story so that's why the last line though is very simple line but is very profound may you be happy may you be long-lived how can you say may you be happy he is god himself he is always happy happiness is his may you be happy maybe lonely very godly man remembers all the time he turned on beginningless endless beyond time so how do you say believe for a long time leave 100 years these words don't carry any sense well yes it does not carry in a sense when you think him to be the absolute god brahman but when you think that he is incarnated as a human being yes he has his birth he has his childhood he has his youth he has his kingship he has his message for the world all this happened in that sense that's why he says words inappropriate to the absolute you cannot say god you live long all right god is all the time rather man can be blessed with prayer that you live long you'll be happy yeah but happiness is he you cannot pray happiness for him but that is though though that is the truth yet this type of words are coming because it is incarnation of as a man christ when he came as a man yes he is to be adored he is to be worshipped but you cannot say oh christ live long in your body no he is incarnated so that's why we can say yes your health be you long live long live long live long day now these women who are crying and sobbing the ladies of hostinaport verse number 20 on page 45 bottom the ladies of hastinapur the capital of the gurus whose minds were powerfully attracted to krishna began to chat as follows among themselves in sweet tone so what they chatted that means they they are talking about krishna krsna's presence krsna's glory it says it is certain that he shri krishna is the eternal and supreme being who existed alone as pure spirit without differentiation when all beings and materials evolutes were in a state of dissolution in him before creation and in the cosmic night succeeding dissolution where the power of nature were asleep in him they are talking they are ordinary ladies but see their profound knowledge about vedanta they are saying what they are saying this ordinary ladies of the palace they are talking among among themselves we know it is certain it is certain that krishna the lord is eternal it is all the time there eternal it's a supreme being there's nothing higher than krishna alone he's all the time and he's pure in spirit absolutely stainless without any differentiation when all beings and materially valued were in a state of dissolution in him everything was merged hindu idea of creation is that is evolution and involution evolution and involution it is not one time creation that is not the theory of the hindu thought hindu thought is that creation is going on every time and when it dissolves it's withdrawn in god and it comes out of god like you look at the pacific ocean the pacific ocean may be perfectly calm at certain point of time and sometimes it's all waves and ripples and bubbles and poems millions billions trillions come so it comes and it goes back again comes again goes back the ocean is like god is like infinite ocean from which the creation comes substance and again comes back so the ladies are talking about that that that supreme being krishna is not a man but the supreme being which is who alone exists as pure spirit without any differentiation when all beings and materials they come evolute were in a state of dissolution in him before creation and in the cosmic night succeeding dissolution when all powers of nature were asleep then the whole creation was in him that time he was there alone again when it comes out out of him the whole creation has come infinite number of living beings 22 verse he the revealer of the vedas afterwards assumed his prakiti or inherent power which causes self-forgetfulness to the jivas and which creates name and form in a nameless and formless atman baba can be taken on this topic but that is the excellence of their intelligence of the ladies and even see how spiritually advanced these people were there they can reconcile the god the absolute and god in the form and he said it is the all human form the revealer of the vedas who is the revealer of yours god is the villain of the vedas after assuming the prophet your inherent power which causes self-forgetfulness it's maya when you bail of maya god cast ma maya net everyone forgets their own nature it's not fun he himself covers and then manifests in a name and different name and form ocean only one ocean how many waves how many ripples how many bubbles how many poems limitless is it something other than ocean no it is the same ocean how it happened by maya maya means here by bridge of the wind and here you can compare that is the power of the lord by his maya he appears many which creates name and form in the nameless and formless ocean or atman this krishna is the goal which sages who are masters of their senses and vital breaths seek and realize with minds purified by the intensity of their god love so this is krishna krishna is the absolute that's why we say ramakrishna don't look at him as a man christ don't look at his man though in the human body he carries the power of his high either it's called the father in the heaven no so in saskatoon you say it is the same power by his veiling power he puts a veil and with the veiling power he creates this universe now we give the example you go to the movie hall and you want to see some movie what do you see before you go you see your friends and everybody in the u.s that's the reality and what happens then switch off that means the veil veil of what darkness veil of ignorance it is god's power and you put it and then projection comes on the white screen and we are intrigued into all the projections and thinking they may yell we cry and weep in that movie all we pay money to get enjoyment but we get enjoyed we start crying we start sobbing we start happy unhappy all these emotions are coming so which is not real it appears to be real but done my home here are different operators but in this in this world of creation it is god god alone does this play by his own inscrutable power which is called maya or prakriti here they have so krishna is the goal of all the sages because why all these sages are meditating and praying to have a revelation vision of bhagavan what you must these sages who are they they are not ordinary people like us they are the master of their senses that mastery over their eyes all the five senses eyes here knows bach everywhere they have full self-control they're not run by their emotions the sages with that pure heart they are thinking of god only this god who is one absolute by his inscrutable maya manifested this wonderful universe and the sages are masters of their senses master of the vital breath pranayama they have the full control of their prana for planning force seek and realize god how with minds purified they purify their mind every day by thinking of god by loving god so this sages holy people they meditate on krishna how they go and why why we cannot go to meditate like them because our mind is impure because our senses are not controlled we have no control over pranic energy mind is impure pure not purified there is no thing except such devotion that can purify the mind so here is giving who are talking this all the women ladies who saw krishna so many days so many years and now by their seeing holiness their mind become holy and they are saying all these high spiritual vedantic talks and there is nothing except such devotion that can purify right we want to be purified there is nothing other than thinking of god day and night thinking of his divine sport taking the name repeating the mantra meditation that will purify the mind o companions who complains means is talking to one sister talking to the other sister it is krishna only who is discussed and glorified by the insightful scholars in the vedas all the vedas they are talking about what all the scriptures of the world are talking about what god and that god is krishna that god is rama here is the uniqueness of indian spiritual thoughts this all these things we worship rama krishna kali durga shiva ganesha these are all manifestations of the one absolute so to any channel you can reach the same absolute truth but you cannot in one jump run into the absolute if you you go to the ocean there are waves you have to just enter into the ocean means you are enter into the web and then dive deep dive deep go down and then you can reach the real ocean otherwise it is surface waves so companions it is krishna only who is discussed and glorified by the insightful scholars those who are mind is withdrawn this type of people they can worship god others don't find any interest they have so many subjects in the world to focus and in the esoteric called the tantras that means it is in the vedas in the tantras it is the they all think about krishna or any other form of the deity here we are focused on krishna that's why we are referring the name of krishna the substance of their teaching is is that he the one lord creates preserves and dissolves as a sport with himself but is not in any way affected by the supportive actions they say fine because he is alone he makes him appear million that's the maya power of maya and he is a sport that say according to bhakti school that's the difference between vedanta and bhakti school vedanta says ultimate truth is absolute one there is no two penis what you see it is all your mental projection to get out of the mind but bhakti says i am within the mind but i see this world how shall i see it is god's play god is playing in every form in the form of a tree in the form of a plant in every form of wave bubble ripple is it not water is it not ocean vox wants to see that way god is playing all this is going on god's play so that is the attitude of the bhaktas that's why this holy ladies they are saying that the substance teaching the substance of their teaching is that he the one lord he creates preserves and dissolves the whole creation comes existence is here it dissolves ah for us it is a big thing for god it is nothing how many stars are going into the black hole for us oh my god what has happened here little fire has happened ten ten thousand ten houses are being burned or twenty thousand um [Music] these things have been destroyed oh god it is not the sport in the ocean look at the surface of the pacific ocean how many millions and billions and trillions of waves are coming up standing dancing fighting with each other embracing with love dissolving into the ocean is it not so it's all fun water is playing with water one wave is playing with another wave so it is all god's play going on that is the attitude and dissolves a sport with himself but is not in any way affected by these supportive actions we are always affected you tell me something i will be angry you say sweetly i will be happy so these are human but god does not get affected because you notice i am playing with myself suppose you stand before the mirror and you make different gestures and postures frowning posture sweets posture smiling posture will you get frightened it's all fun you are playing fun with yourself similarly god is playing this fun it's god's fun is going on they nothing to be attached affected by that it's for fun it's child's play child plays hey you know you go to the beach you find how the children prepare their castle sand castle how seriously they prepare but when mommy calls let us go home and the children throw away all these things and come away no attachment so this is the this holy people are like that when the rulers of the earth become slave of dark passions and begin to live on unrighteousness then in every age this krishna comes to protect the world assuming forms of pure sattva and manifesting such excellence as truth righteousness mercy and the lasting fame in the world see what gita says what do you read in the bhagavad-gita or other scriptures the same thing the ladies are talking about the same way it is not bhagavan krishna saying it is not any sage and saint saying it is the ladies of the palace they are talking to themselves they are saying when the rulers of the earth kings of the country become slaves of dark passion you see wherever there is downfall see of the kings this society suffers so much because because he's unrighteous his methods will be on nature's method he will not think for the proper good of the subjects he will do whatever his whims his personal ego so when the rulers of the earth become slave of dark passions and begin to live an unrighteousness false words false promises and like that today society everywhere you go believe all the different countries of the world how the kings today there is no king but king position is what position of the [Music] president the king he is the king so their decision their righteous decision their correct love for the country their well-wisher thing for the masses when those are gone then in that situation in every age this si krishna here is this si krishna this god comes and protects the world that's why hindu said shambhavami yugi is i shall incarnate myself again and again that's why hindus believe the christ buddhas rama's krishnas sankaras all these extraordinary people avataras is the same person who comes again and again in different costume in different countries in different conditions to help the humanity to restore them from their evil tendencies assuming forms they take the form what form pure shatter like krishna like rama like christ there is no selfishness there is no impurity in their heart only love only purity only unconditional grace and protection they come with this satiko quality they are called satiko satyaga means pure character and manifesting such excellencies and they in their life through their life they manifest excellences what are the excellencies truthfulness righteousness mercy and they manifest lasting fame in the world lasting fame why how many people have come and gone why lasting fame who has forgotten christ two thousand years past but people still remember christ lasting fame rama came i do not know historically how many thousands of years passed now you go whole of india and java sumit sumatra borneo you see rama rama rama rama rama rama rama krishna this whole flooded all over india and of course outside world also has impact so their impact is not reducing rather it is increasing because the god himself came that is the difference between big kings people remember few years big warriors they will be remembered in the history but it will fade away but the impact of this holy people when god comes himself their glory will remain continued glorious indeed is the line of yodu glorious two is the madhu forest of brazil for these have been sanctified by krishna the first by his birth in it and next by the impressions of his feet on its surface as he walked about there these are all devotional aspect no bhagavan walked in this ground what a fortunate ground is this you go there and people do that they go to holy place where bin they think krishna was walking in this ground they go and roll down in the ground to feel that their body will be purified with the touch because this ground this earth is touched by god so so in the forest of brazil from this being sanctified by krishna because he was born first and next by the impression of his feet walking on this surface as he walked about there oh wonder of wonders oh krishna the city of dwarka surpassing this fear of heaven even has come to have the fame of being a holy region for the whole world for it is here alone that the citizens see daily the face of krishna the lord of their hearts casting his merciful glasses beautified by his calmly smile so he's saying oh city of dwarka dwarka is the kingdom of krishna so it's going back to his kingdom so he's saying what fortunate are the people of dwarka they will have to good luck of seeing the lord krishna every day when he will give his darshan by seeing god every day is a matter of joke so how fortunate is that city how fortunate is those people oh companion open talking to the other ladies these women whose hands krishna held in wedlock must certainly have worshipped the lord in their past births through austerities and sacrifices for the nectar of his lips for which the gopika of brazil longed and fined is drunk again and again by these wives of krishna those women like rukh mini and others the mother sappr samba amba etc whom he took by force paying the bride money of heroism with which his mass the resistance offered by the heroic kings headed by sisupala the ruler of as also those other women who we took over in the hundreds after the destruction of naraka the son of boom all these have ended ridden womanhood of its dis repute for impurity and unfitness for freedom for in this their home did the lotus side krishna their husband always stay enhancing their joy which is conversation he is giving some historic story that krishna killed many kings who are unrighteous kings and those names have been sisu paul is one yeah the king of the chedi kingdom u.s and others and then rescued these queens and in the palace and give them shelter protection so he is saying they are fortunate they got the protection of krishna they will be fortunate to see krishna and we will be deprived we will not be able to see anymore because he is going from our place to dwarka so these ladies are saying what fortune they have they have done good karma of their past life they have certainly did prayed and meditated and purified their heart that's why they are getting this opportunity to get him among themselves verse 31 on page 47 bottom shri krishna passed along the street acknowledging the complaint compliments of the city women by smiling look and krishna going as you see in the krishna film if you see watch the krishna film you see he's always come he is undisturbed always peaceful always joyful so krishna should have cried here no because this these people loved him so much emotional he was emotionally choked but no he has his perfect balance he is equal to all so it's a big smile which is all gentleness he is looking at everyone and asking farewell from them judistira the one without a without any enemy sent a strong contingent of his army as bodyguard for krishna though he needed no protection from anyone so krishna is going so judishira is the king of this country hastinapur he gave a army to protect to carry the chariot of krishna is going and to protect that least anyone don't but he does not need anyone's help that's the point he said he does not need anyone's help god who needs god does not need anyone's help but in a material way as he is a human being so as a friend the yudhisthira is sending an army of military people contingent of army as bodyguards the pandava brothers who out of love and sorrow of impending separation accompanied the departing krishna for a long distance were somehow persuaded to go back to krishna by krishna who now proceeded to his own city dwarka with his dear ministers like uddhava this all the five brothers as it happens now we want to see of somebody what do we do we go up to a car no or you go after plane we used to go now it is they don't allow they say no one goes to see up in the plane in the airport but previously last about 90s and when he used to go you have to go to the gate you want to see of somebody take his baggage and things and then go and the your friend is entering into the plane itself inside you stand outside bye bye bye there so but nowadays you just go and in the drop in the airport or you go to the counter after that you can stay and when he's in the security line gun so these pandava brothers they love krishna so much they was going with him as much as they can go and krishna is saying now now brother you go back you go back go to your own kingdom i am now it's a long journey so i am going so you please so persuaded by krishna again and again now proceed that i am going to my dwarka which is my command my my mind that is the duties call i am god but i am called by duty so i have finished your duty here now i am going back to dwarka 34 and 35 he passed through the land of gurus the jungles the panchalas and other areas region of the yamuna region intervening deserts sobera avira lands and this the region of anarthas where his horses were found a bit tired so he went on one country after another country by the chariot and the horses horse driven chariot so chariot become tired so he went and stopped there for giving little rest to the chariot and the horses receiving from place to place the pious offerings of devotee devoted men he at last raised the western region even as the sun too was setting in the west so he went and ultimately he reached his own kingdom the capital of the kingdom that is called dwarka in the western region of india so here ends this 10th chapter we'll start next day that krishna arrived and how he was received and how he was received by the devotees of dwarka as these people were crying and they are very happy they got krishna back to their home so they are welcoming that part we will read next day chapter 1 book 1 chapter 11 from verse number one so now i end here this reading and i'll next question if any question om shanti so now some questions what is the essence of bhagavad-gita what is the essence of bhagavad-gita it is many times it is said simply ramakrishna said it is called detachment do your duty live in the world be detached that is the point we do we never know how to detach we know only to attach we do something we love someone we get attached but krishna says do don't attach but detach love everyone but that love should not be sticky love as we say sticky love where there is stickiness then there will be pain and suffering but if you love for love's sake then that is the pure so gita's essential teaching is tiago sri ramakrishna said detachment gita's ideal is don't be idle do your duties whatever responsibility you have in your action gita says no one reaches the state of actionlessness that is brahman i am brahman i am nobody this is all ignorant this all name and form you may say so but you are breathing you are eating you are coming back to your body consciousness so long you are in the body comes do your duty that will purify your heart and as the mind will be purified you will feel that i am that that experience to bring you have to create the ground without ground you only talk about i am brahman i am atman i am the absolute prince i am beyond mind death i am the witness of the these are all good but to understand that in depth we need a pure heart and that purity of the heart will come as gita says karma do your karma not like people who draws karma and get into bondage but do karma which will free you by thinking that you are your body mind is working not you you are consciousness but so long you think that i am the body you are eating who is eating ramen salad i don't eat you don't eat which you don't eat and which you are eating you are eating this eye whenever i say i this comes in my concept i cannot help it i slept i didn't sleep i am i am angry i am happy who is that i i the absolute has no happiness no hunger no thoughts nothing you are not in that state to reach that state that to purify the heart and what is the way of this is also purifying if you think day and night i am atman that's also purifying but you cannot live in that consciousness day and night you will have to eat you will have to work you have to cook you'll have to go to interact with people you'll have to take care of your body you have to sleep so therefore do your work duties but think i am not attached i am atman this is all the play of the body and mind i am not the body and mind so that is the simple way we can think that is the idea of gita is action without attachment love without attachment how we can do work without being stuck to its result and cry and whip i get a good result i'm happy if i don't get a result i am crying so no not that another question during the time when i am learning to meditate how to how do i place my tongue huh during the time when i am learning to meditate how do i place my tongue i don't understand this question but don't pay attention to your tongue when you meditate meditate on god and repeat the mantra let the tongue be anywhere you can do moving your tongue you may also without tongue movement you can utter the word mentally that is much better suppose i say oh and i say mentally think that you are saying home without tongue movement you can do that so don't pay attention to the tongue that is my idea rather you can repeat the mantra you got it for your practice and meditate on the lord what your guru has given you to think about and tongue is mostly used in altering the mantra properly because in sanskrit a very sophisticated language so your tongue movement is very important there are three types of na na no no two types of no three types of saw saw raw raw twist your tongue to the palate to the teeth and in between so the tongue movement will use it will be used for expressing some meaningful word but repeating the mantra and thinking of god that is important and don't pay attention to the term that's my idea i don't know if if you can if you can elaborate the question something more then i can think about that another question how to overcome panic thoughts yeah panic thoughts panic thought comes because it comes suddenly and we are not prepared for it or i got some prediction there is a huge fire coming and that's when you get panicked yes you as human being it is very natural to get panicked but how to get out of it we will have to think this way vedantic thinking what will happen if something happens i'll have to act accordingly if there is a fire and then i'll have to get out of the fire i will draw now away from the fire no if it is there i can stay i can protect as much like take a hose so that fire does not affect your home or if the situation comes extremely bad then what happens then you can just run away taking your most valuable thing and think what shall i show itself if any if the fire kills everything then what shall i do i will have to accept it and act according so to give the mind to think the extreme condition what will happen i will die one day if you take this ultimate step then you become fearless i'll die one day if anything happens i will fight with it and i will die anyone will die can anyone stop their death who is living for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds yeah up years is there anybody in the world we say he is 102 12 years oh my god it becomes a news in the newspaper huh 120 years okay then then what then what it will die one day and body is dying every day why are you worrying about that do your best to solve the mystery face the challenges and then be bold and don't be panicked unnecessarily panic is a mental weakness so spirituality teaches us trust on your divinity inside and then whatever happens accept it boldly a panic is weakness of the mind so that any type of witness will have to work with that i am coming to you if it is all is god's fun why do saints emphasize to be restless to realize god as if their hair is on the fire right very good question it is all fun for whom not for me i am body bound when i will be pure i will understand it is all fun to understand it is god is playing in every form not now i am very much limited with my my emotions our body identity our suffering our pain our anguish our fear because i am not knowing that i am infinite when i know that then what is this world this world is the one playing in so many forms that will come but not for me that's why it is if you say it is god's fun then you have to say you are nobody it is god is fun it's playing in so many forms okay it is god god will understand its problem what are you why you are coming in in between we are bringing ourselves in our little ego we have two egos now one this small ego another is the big ego big ego is god's ego and small ego small ego is that i with my body-mind identity without suffering with my pain with my pleasure with the feeling of joy frustration so that is i so we'll have to get out of that unless and how to get out you become pure how to be pure by practice of meditation practice of prayer practice of selfless work service to others thinking that i am serving god all these noble ideas you have to work unless that maturity comes whenever i say i you will think of the body either you will think of the body i will i am very sad why are you sad are you sad in your finger you're sad in your mind so so long you are in the mind you will feel the sadness when you say i am not the mind then you are beyond free so how to reach that flight that's why practice is necessary another question can we drink coffee before or after meditation that's a good question yes it is your habit whatever gives you little energy to do meditation take that might not help it matters little in vedanta we don't pay emphasis on whether you are fasting whether are you becoming spiritual that is the point i don't care you eat meat or you eat very vegetarian are you making are you making spiritual progress are you feeling the presence of god in you whatever makes it good go for that and whatever takes you away from that avoid that so yes some people take a cup of coffee sometimes before going to meditation because in the morning or in the afternoon that gives them the drowsiness off and the sleep mode goes away with a cup of coffee but somehow some are habituated without doing that that's okay so these are your own choice what is the view of fear of death according to vedanta fear of death is very natural as i said just now discussed this point fear of death is imminent because in hindu culture we think that we have been born and dead millions and millions of times so the fear of death has been ingrained into us even if you see a crawling ant moving you try to stop it or something obstacle and turns his face out no so fear of death is very spontaneous with that is called the reflex action like reflex action it has become spontaneous but it will be gone it will be beyond all this when one can one can think that i am not limited in the body i am not finished with the body and and as i am make an analog analysis all the time i make this analysis already are you not dying every second where is your body in which was in 1990. you have a body in 1990 no okay say 2 000 you have a body in 2000 what is that body this body is not the same body look at that your body when in the year 2010 we bring a picture photograph and today's photo are the same your hairs are same your eyes are same no it has changed everything cells are same no so why are you not crying then aha my twin 2010 body has gone ah i am dead why don't you cry because it has taken such a change and you are seeing some other appearance but they are dead that that all the cells and everything has been transformed into another one similarly when we die what happens it is transformation but we do not know the i don't see that next transformation before my consciousness that's why we are afraid unknown this body is gone we are so ingrained in the body body is gone i am gone what happens after death everyone is curious about what happens after death what what happens after death nothing happens you remain the same you remain in your dream do you die when you are dreaming you are free from the body body is lying in the bed and you are running in your dream you are running in new york what happens then your body this body lying in the bed and you are running in new york in a in a street or in the what you call park national park so this this body and that body are there together but you can separate sleep separates us dreams separates us so you can meditate and separate yourself out and after death we live in another body so to think that i am not dying i will be there so that thought is itself good another question krishna is more engaging and appealing than other avatars why do you think this is the case krishna is more engaging means to the krishna bhaktas and krsna's life has diversified aspects he is not only mere king he played like a darling as a child as a baby his plays are so sweet and so much is meditated upon them his youth has so much of stories killing this killing that this demon that demon so it is interesting in those so many ways so that we can engage our mind in god in so many ways how we can engage ourselves in so many ways with god that is the purpose of life so that's why krishna is more engaging and more appealing because different aspects are there who love aspect is there heroic aspect is there and renunciation aspect is there detachment aspect is there being in life struggle how his calm and serene war is going on and he is undisturbed and perturbed so that is the point did krsna die it is my experience he did not yes did krsna die to krishna the krishna who was in the physical body yes he is dead but the krishna who is a subtle body he didn't die think of yourself do you die when you are sleeping in your bed and dreaming in the dream body you are eating good fist there is a dream body of yours and you can have a good fist and the body is lying down in the bed dead almost as it happens similarly krsna's physical body is not visible but he lives in this that body through which he comes to devotees gives his darshan we call vision christ even is still there people have the vision of christ ramakrishna had the vision of christ so ramakrishna are division of krishna so they are but in which way not in a physical way if the physical when ramakrishna is seeing mother kali i will also see mother kali i don't see no so many people in the hinesha around ramakrishna didn't see anything but ramakrishna saw it is mother kali living presence of mother kali so it is there but with the physical body we have died but the subtle body it's called the divine body through which god is doing work for the devotees for ages together appearing before them christ appeared to how many cents in the world buddha appeared in how many lives how many saints like rama came krishna came like that krishna you go hundreds and hundreds and thousands of people are there those who dream krishna as one of my known devotee he was telling and krishna came last night and she was asking for food and i quickly got something and then there is nothing i feel embarrassed and the sleep broke so they are seeing krishna even today he may say it is a mental image that image in that way he is eternal that's why he called even gods swami vivekananda said i shall cast this body off like an old worn out garment but i shall not cease to work i shall inspire men everywhere how he will inspire his body is not there but he says i shall inspire men everywhere until the world shall know that is one with god so how you will do that it is in the subtle body so that's why did krishna die yes physical body is dead but know that that body through which god does the work of redeeming people from the problems of life that krishna is alive okay so you have some question that's what is your question you already have got archer yeah my afternoon i do not know afternoon is afternoon afternoon 4 30 on one this is good good class we are thinking of krishna we are thinking of vedanta that is good in that way thank you so we end here and we will meet you again at 7 30 in the class what is called shanti gita the song of peace we need peace peace peace peace how to find peace in life no so it is advice of krishna again but that's very vedantic aspect vedantic perspective thank you all um shanti shanti shanti peace peace you
