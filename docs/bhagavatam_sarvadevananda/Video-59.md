[Bhagavatam - 3.18.5 ( Book 3, Chapter 18 verse 5 )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkWbHkjNlnI)

peace peace peace so we are back to sorry we are little late to start but we are in the chapter 8 3 18 chapter of book number three and we read up to four parts five and this page is 224. so now they are hiran naksha and hirana the two brothers are now become very powerful and they are fighting and it starts a fight with the Lord so we have read this much that stood rejecting the suggestion baruna the heroic Ashura in the pride of his might transported himself rapidly to rasata and then got hurry the Lord as directed by Narada Naruto is gives the clue to start the fight sometimes that is there is a vision he called he creates trouble no he does not create trouble but what he does he removes the evil people from the world quickly that's why he gives this in right information so anyhow there he saw the Lord in the form of the cosmic boar gigantic like a mountain with the Earth uplifted on his tasks and having red eyes whose glare seemed to absorb the Life Energy of the Asura that means Ashura went there and saw that Lord narayana in the form of a boar gigantic board and it's there seeing him the Asura lapped out in ridicule and used some ridiculous words it is indeed wonderful said yasura he is hurry after only wild animal he further said oh stupid fellow come for a fight release the Earth the Earth belongs to me and us the inhabitants of the rasatal into whose region it has come by itself in the Deluge sent to us as it were by the Creator foreign hiding in the form of boar you shall not escape with life carrying this Earth so long as I am present here and then in 40 words used against the Lord and abusive words continued and we read up to these five verse where he said when your head has been smashed to the smitherness by The Stroke of my mess rishis and others will gather there to perform your funeral of Securus will perish themselves like a rootless tree as you their root would be dead by them so Asura says I have my mess and I will give such a blow and you will die and all the gods and goddesses who praise you they will be all lost they will perish themselves because the root is gone tree of the root you are the root so when you are killed you Narayan or killed they will also be dead by them so I will rule them the world now to this six bars I'll just go on reading because this description of the war there is nothing much interesting for us but to honor the text will run over the verses you know how heartily how angrily is actually tendency means tendency when one gets into acidic tendency how they become really hotty arrogant and all abusive in that language in their behavior and they disrespect the holy people so this we can get it to this idea only that much so six bars on page 224 as I said and volume one book three though pierced read the shots of the enemy's abusive words the Lord wore it patiently he heard all these things smiling absorb all these abusive words is not easy if anyone says something abusive immediately people react but God lord narayana yeah he seen the frightened art on his tasks he came out of the water just an elephant playing in the water which is females will do when attacked by the crocodile rather than fight his enemy then and there so they can kill the crocodile but they run away of the crocodile to create some play so that's the way the elephants do and as the crocodile would come rushing after the escaping elephant the Asura 2 which is fierce teeth and golden hair they ran after the Lord as he came out of the waters and shouted in his thunderous voice they said you were running away what is there the Shameless Scoundrels will not do the Lord now blessed the Earth at the tip of the waters in a visible place and charged it with his own power so that it might not sink again as the enemy was looking on Brahma recited a hymn In Praise of the Lord and they were showered flowers on him so the gods are praising oh Lord wake up wake up and fight the asuras the Lord's mocking response then Lord took it very joyfully and as if nothing else is he just he took it very lightly this narayana said to that Ashura who was advancing from behind with mess in hand a coat of gold protecting his body who has direct with golden ornaments and showering abusive words that cut to the quick the Lord now aroused Rouse to the height of an of anger and said now Lord narayana in the form of boar then he then got wake up little bit and with the latter the height of his anger he started saying narayana says true it is true we are wild animals but we hunt Village lions like you yes I am a boar animals but I can hunt easily like the dogs the hunting dog it's a lion eats the dog so I'll do that this steady test this detestable fellows like you Heroes do not care to reply to the meaningless blabbering of those who are the news of the god of death you pull your talking big things no the big powerful person does not care for all this blabbering they do little puss and die so you will be like the seeds he's showing his power but control also that that therefore see it is that is the word is now so sadhu because some some mind does not get Disturbed Jason when the world so but the hearty moves in his hand right no you know in one's plus 20 dogs will be just mad so here is the example like that and the world may abuse you but sadhu don't care for that go with their own dignity so here the Lord is afterwards saying that true we are wild animals but we hunt Village Lions men's dolls like you detestable fellow Heroes do not care to reply to the meaningless blabbering of those who are in the news of the god of death we who have come to steal the property of the occupants of rasatala no for certain that we will be smashed by your uplifted mess but having quoted the enmity of Mighty person is like you we have no option but to put up some fight for a chance of saving our life you are the leader of an army without any hesitant hesitation to proceed to defeat us and having killed us wipe the tears of your kit and kin as vowed by you is also knowledge it is the Asura is saying that you know that you can I I know without you are the leader of an army without any hesitation to proceed to defeat us and having killed us wipe the tears of your teeth and kin as vowed by you a person who breaks his soul and how has no place in an assembly of Honorable Men now say 13 words being thus insulted and mocked by the Lord in a feet of anger became Furious and violent like a king cobra teased by for sport king cobra is very dangerous and he spoke then he becomes very angry so then that's the insult and the mockery by the Lord in invigorated the anger in hiron naksha more India as it is in a body and Minds by the fury of his anger and breathing hard and deep he rushed the Lord and delivered a heavy blow to him with his mess that is a fight mess until I Doom just at that great Yogi can evade drama the great Lord a little side stripped the stroke aimed at his chest so foreign biting his leap in Anger rusted the Ashura who was wielding his mess round and round and he aimed his blow at the enemy's right brow but the master of mess Warfare that he was Hiram naksho buried it with his own mess he stopped it Miss versus Miss more naksha and the Lord began to exchange blows Baba what is the curse of a holy man can do all this harm which is that no Lord has to fight with this demon his own man with their Mighty mess and each enraced and bent on Victory with their bodies endured by the blows of heavy masses roused to Greater Heights of anger by this male of blood and making various kinds of faints according to the science of misfighting their fears combat in this contest for the position of the earth resembled that of a pair of appear of aroused bulls for the position of a cow there is a big fight going on now with the hidden naksha and the hirana koshipu and this oh skin of Kuru Clan Brahma surrounded by this is arrived at the sin of this conflict over the Earth between the Ashura and hirana so Asura said is my property the Lord says is my property so that is the plot of land is the Earth and fight is going on between here and naksha and the Lord so the Lord incarnated in the cosmic board whose bodily path to constitute the various limbs of jagna seeing the Asura infatuated with pride in his strength Fearless revengeful and possessed of these resistible might Brahma the leader of all the riches said to the Lord narayana embodied as the Primeval boar so narayana in the form of board so then Brahma and other gods didn't praised having obtained a boon from me this Ashura is proving a torn in the side of the world he is harassing and terrorizing the holy men who have taken shelter at thy feet and also cows and other harmless creatures he's roaming in the world in search of an antagonist finding himself without a rival so is the Brahma is saying no being empowered by you a boon for having obtained a boon from me Brahma this asuro is proving a thorn in this in the sight of the world and he is harassing all these terrorizing the holy people those who have taken shelter at your feet or narayana and all the cows and other harmless creatures are also getting terrified he's roaming in the world in search of an antagonist she's searching who is antagonist like him finding himself with the Rival oh Lord do not play with this Asura like a child playing with a snake pulling its tail he possesses many hallucinogenic hallucinogenic power power mesmerizing power he has don't wait and just pray it is okay he's an ordinary guy don't do that Brahma is telling you get immediately kill him that is the the appeal from Brahma so he says oh Lord oh narayana do not play with this asuro like a child playing with a snake and pulling it still it possesses many hallucinogenic power hallucinogenic power he's of overwinning in Pride on principled and evil-minded oh Lord it behooves thee to kill this monster of sin by your prouses before the onset of light evening is coming before Night Comes kill him destroy him otherwise which is the night time is the favorable time for the asuras when their power is augmented they can function more strongly because Thomas Works in Thomas the time of Sunda awesome and destructive is near at hand that means the evening is coming close quick action is needed to bring Victory to the devils the auspicious time called ovijit is about to end and I do not know what is maybe astronomical some astrological term or visit nakshatra or something so it's in the auspicious time this time period is about to end before retains for the good of your devotees Dean to kill this invincible Asura according to the Boon given at the time of the curse he has by Good Fortune been laid to you at whose hands he is to meet with death exhibiting your might Dane to destroy him and render the world happy make the world Happy kill kill this demon because don't wait evening is coming as night will come then they'll be more powerful and this is all the uh it is all trouble for the whole world please kill him before the sun goes down or the night before night starts and they a visit auspicious time ends now now we are in chapter 19. third book chapter 19 destruction of the former that means here are naksha and these are all going here on naksha will be killed later on now said with a side glands from the corner of his eyes with a smile at the idea of prescribing an auspicious time for him who is the time itself narayana is the time he himself is dying every time he is auspicious for him he gives the time auspiciousness and Brahma is saying this Industries has time other time will Venus pieces so kill it now so he says with the side glance from the corner of his eyes and with a smile the Lord accepted the suggestion conveyed by Brahma insincere and pleasing words so you know Nara you know accepted this inspiration from brahma's words the Incarnate board the nose born of Brahma knows one ways it has come out of the nose of Brahma seeing the Asura fearlessly moving about in front of him now sprang at him and stuck a terrific blow that is lower jaw which is mess Baba justification but one man of Wonders that means buried by the Asura's mess fell down from his hand freely asuras is powered with his Mercy protected it and this mess which was thrown to him it's swirling like that and fell down that means it could not break him now should have now got an opportunity for a decisive attack against his disarmed opponent who is desired opponent narayana his mess is out of his hand now but he did not do so as it is against the code of ethics governing mutual combat to attack a disarmed opponent thus provoking the Lord by his observance of Dharma so he could have attacked narayana because now Narayan is Miss is out of hand and so he could have attacked but no he's a dharmic person so we allowed because disarmed narayana he didn't attack with the code of war is that equal fight should be with mess with mess hand with handle open same similar weapon but such similar soul with sword like that that is the code and if the one leaves the sword give the chance to get that and then start again when the mess Filled from the hand of the Lord cries of aha arrows everywhere showing the dismay of the onlookers honoring as it were the astross regard for the rules of combat he thought of his sudarsana discuss for rearming himself so he was thinking okay this mess does not work no I have my sudasana chakra the will he was thinking of that when the devils and other divinities saw from the skies that the Lord was now armed with his all destructive sudarshana chakra they in their ignorance of the antecedents of the Asura began to cry aloud in their impressive vices he learned to thee destroy him quickly but little did they know that his cruel son of deity confronting the Lord was none but a principle attendant of his other people didn't know as if it is a fight going on with an Asura but they did not know it is deity's son and cursed by yeah I was the attendant of narayana himself he is fighting with his gatekeeper that is the major thing one of The Gatekeepers God is also in trouble that's why Duality is always a problem absolute non-dual there is no fight there is nothing all one one one but you come to The Duality then Duality God is there fighting with this attendant attendant did a minor mistake didn't allow some visitors to see him and let's see how problem that's why complicated Duality ignorance when you come into the ignorance there will be all types of hallucination and disturbances as you saw standing before him the Luther said Lord in the form of the board only discuss his anger new no bounds so the what you call kirana hiran naksha foreign so his anger should become much angry all his faculties turned into a tremendous wave of anger in here and Shop and it began to hiss out deep breaths and bite his lips gnashing his teeth and burning everything as it were with his ferocious and cruel look he lived at and struck him with his mess shouting oh you are dead with this so these are all description of the fight you know our childhood is to see Village dramas they used to jump like that with the Mason and and keep a beating like that they should not beat but sometimes they in the feet of their action they give to beating is beating so here also see narayana saying this naksha and they got more enriched and struck him at srihori and struck him with his mess shouting now you are dead as the enemy was looking on the Lord as if in a play worded off that fast advancing mess with his left leg and said to the Asura take your weapon again and defeat me he the left leg you take that hold that mess and push it take your mess back and defeat me there upon the Asura again flourished his mess said the Lord with a loud Road remaining firm on the spot the Lord got hold of the myth with the utmost ease just as a guru would catch his neck so gorilla catching a snake is a farm so the Lord is showing these examples of unique Bay it is all vaselism composition no they say Rama the Lord narayana is like he Guru and compared to that Kiran naksha is like a little snake it is nothing for her so remembering the form on the spot remaining Farm on the spot the Lord got hold of the mess with utmost ease just as gurudo would a snake when he found that his might was felt dispirated and refused to take back his mess which the Lord wanted to restore to him now but Ashura does not want to take it back now he took it three prong Tried Him to Shula he got to consume his opponent like a blazing fire and aimed at it at the Supreme Being standing before him as a boar so mess is gone tishula is now taken in those days weapons are trishula that's why all the gods and goddesses you see or these are the weapons all the weapons snake the Gada amaze and the spring Treasures three strong weapon so aimed at Supreme Being Miss narayana standing before him how in the form of a boar even as a score sorcerer holds his incantations at a Noir or at a Noah of Brahman that Valley entrusted US missile which has emitting rays of light and shining in the sky was cut to pieces with atmosis by srihori the Lord with his shirt to discuss he has another tip of the discus Sharp and he destroyed that that trident as if it were a feather cast feather cast by Guru when his Trident was thus cut to the pieces by srihori's discuss they also filled with an uncontrollable anger rushed towards him and delivered with a road a mighty punch at for his chest now now pissed which is the resident of sridevi's himself so narayana's heart is the place of Resident a mother sridevi mahalaxmi and he give a punch struck in this way oh we do know stuck in this way the Lord has Prime Evil board did not even take notice of the blow which was like a mere flower striking an elephant he thought I have given a good look but Lord friend it is like a flower someone is throwing a flower to us now 17 verse you all should have now tried various fits of magical Warfare against him magical Warfare they can take change the form they can take in various weapons who is the master of the Divine Maya religions to against Lord narayana who is the master of divine Maya dibbumaya the phenomena he created by his magic was so terrific that all thoughts that the world was coming to an end everyone thought that the world is coming to an end Fierce Windows being began to blow and clouds of dust spread Darkness everywhere so storms rained down on all sides the torrential rain of urine pieces bones blood and hair filled and heavy clouds with lightning and thunder hid all the luminaries of the sky oh Pious one mountains were seen to release weapons in all directions mountains are spreading the weapons and naked rakshasas females went about with tridents in their hand and hair disabled many types of Titans and Trunks of orgy or Greece or Grace of malevolent type moved about spreading Terror by word and deed they all Surah started yeah this is creating much disturbance by Magic Maya there upon the Lord the embodiment of all jagna released his favorite discus sudarshana to decept disperse these effects of the hospital's Magic like they suddenly saw that this mountain top is bringing weapons and this and with the description that there are mountains were seen to release weapons in all directions make it rakshasies relaxers of females whereabout with the tridents in their hand had disabled Titans and throngs of Greece I manipulent type moved about spreading the terror so at this point as a four four boarding of our sons and deeply remembered her husband's words she got palpitations in her heart and blood began to Ooze from her breasts now when his magical trapped stratagems failed that was all strategies magical strategies of hiran naksha failed the dosor again made his appearance before the Lord and in great anger attempted to crush him in an Embrace to embrace and kill the the narayana but he got out of the Asura scotches and again stood before him then the Asura began to Reign cups on the Lord which is Iron Fist where upon the Lord delivered a mighty blow to the Asura with his hand him hand at the base of the Year even as in the struck at brittle when the Lord the master of the world that struck him in a light mood the Australia's body trembled with a light mood only narayana did something and Asura's body become trembling his eyes shut out and with hands and feet outstressed he fell like a tree uprooted by the wind a little blow and he fell down Brahma and others approached him lying dead on the ground with his Heroes Brilliance it unfitted and his terrific fangs and closely set teeth adding to the greenness of his appearance they all cried out oh how fortunate he is to meet with his death at the hand of the Lord so other gods and goddesses they started praising he is not an ordinary demon rasura but he's such he has such auspiciousness that he's his dad did in the hand of the narayana that story that story is said that um thakur's story then the frog killed by the arrow of Rama but he's he's that what a great dead that's why he said why shall I Cry I Cry to Rama to protect me when others create trouble for me and when Rama's Arrow beat me whom to cry so this is the great death and they are thinking the gods are thinking that oh how fortunate he when he run naksha is opportunities to meet with his death at the hands of the Lord he on whom the joke is Desiring salvation meditate continuously with concentration in the Solitude for overcoming the subtle body which is rooted in acronyms by a kick of his foot and seeing his face before him has this Asura met with his death so he got what a blessings and yogis and Moonies they were concentrated and they renounce everything for God realization and here by a kick of his foot yeah this is a blessing the Lord kicked at his foot by his foot and seeing his face they did the hiran naksha is dying how looking at narayana departing from the body so what a blessed death these attendants of huri who have become asuras due to the cause of the rishis we'll go back to the Lord after a few more births here and there are other asuras who are fighting yeah these attendance of hurry who have become asuras due to the curse of the rishis will go back to the Lord after a few more births here unto D the support of all jugglers and the embodiment of pure satwa first unit it is that this scar coverage of the world has been killed Devotion to the field our heart with joy now Mitra said hurry we incarnated as the Primeval boar thus destroyed hiron naksha and returned to his eternal Abode of light while Brahma and the other they were sang him hymns of praise in accordance with what I heard from my teachers I have narrated to you how sihori incarnated himself and killed the powerful hero naksha in a battle that was so no more than a play for the Lord himself to hear this account of the Lord's Deeds from maitrea he might do this age the people were delighted to hear accounts even the famous holy personages how much more will they be delighted to hear of Maha Vishnu The srivastava Marked One he who quickly came to the rescue of the lordly elephant who on being ceased by a crocodile and failing to be rescued by his wailing females began to contemplate his Lotus feet what man with a sense of gratitude would not worship that narayana or such a being narayana who is easy to be pleased by sincere men with wholehearted devotion but who cares not for the adornation of immortal and unrighteous person but who cares not for the Adoration of immoral and unrighteous person God is pleased with a good Soul even with a little prayer God is blessings to them puts his Blessing but he does not show those people who are unrighteous and who are immoral 37 verse brahmanas whoever hears this wonderful account of destruction of hiran naksha by the Lord at the causal bull he is freed from the effect of even heinous sins even someone listens to this story they are fortunate they will be freed from the bondage of birth and death oh dear one those who hear this extremely holy and sanctifying narrative will be blessed with wealth Fame longevity the respect of others courage in the battle strength of the body and mind and others blessings the desire those who are desireless we loved in mukti so they will get all these if they listen to this story a fight and with devotion the glory of the narayana if don't do it does that it will bring all auspiciousness and what are the auspiciousness what worldly prosperity and spiritual Prosperity worldly wealth Fame longevity he'll be rich wealthy Fame longevity lifelong respect for others courage in the battle strength of body and mind and other blessings they desire whatever they Desire by God's grace even though listening they will get this those who devotedly pray and meditate on Nara you know he'll be free those who are desireless among all the people those who are desireless naturally they will attain to mukti at the end of life so here ends the chapter 19. so we can continue for that question is there okay no no then I I can end here how many questions or three questions we have 15 minutes okay we can end a little early that will be good so we end here we have finished this chapter 19 the story of the fight with the Iran naksha and how he was just killed his evil Tendencies are taken away so sharing that Holy Story one can get all the desires may be fulfilled by God and when all desires are fulfilled then they will be desired less and desireless people will be realized ah will be liberated from bondage so next day we will read then chapter 20 Scandal three that is book number three chapter 20 and it is the chapter is called creation as expression of brahma's moods this creation what we see there is the expression of Brahma Brahma expands so that chapter will read next line foreign [Music] now we have some questions so let us see what is the question why would a devotee choose to worship instead of narayana or Vishnu is there a difference in their capabilities uh the point is that you know who worships whom tamosic people will worship Thomas the type of ideas and expressions rajashik will worship raja's time Satya people will like satigo there's a tendency act God Appears because God wants to purify everyone so to raise him from Thomas they come down in the tamasik form that's why some forms of God so he hear their little terrible form of gods and goddesses because that is for the thomasic people they don't understand anything if you go to a very evil person and give some good advice hey hey don't do that it is bad and now tomorrow onward go and meditate on God will he listen anything he should get good blows right and left and then with this like a naughty boy his parents used to for the good take a angry form so I think that would be a devotee choose to worship why this is a tendency but but for me I may not be worshiping him that means maybe God's found but we are in our at least our mind will be happy and happy to worship not the form will be very moan in trying to see the Satya manifestation like Rama Krishna Rama Krishna Christ Buddha where there is compassion love so it is manifestation people will like that type of worship is there in one verse worship three types of worship person's worship they want worship one day and Thomas and rajasu according to their mood they worship that type of deities that type of forms of the Divine and you know that verses in bhagavad-gita and also capabilities if you give um it is like everyone is eating food no but someone is little Raja sick food someone is little thomasic food someone likes Satya food satigo person cannot take this type of food it will disturb his system hmm food they will not find any taste they will throw away the food is the food so that is the point to understand that it is according to the taste of the student God has to appear in different forms and that worship goes on continues from that perspective second question that is the fight between baraha symbolic of this struggle between lust and gold versus God consciousness any fight when it goes with God means the good versus the evil the negative person the positive and ultimately negative and positive both will go what will remain the Atman or Brahman so but so long we are in The Duality so we will buy the satik or rajasikata music so you can really yeah you can symbolically take baraha is the fight between baraha between symbolic of struggle between the god and hiranyaksha is the last and great symbol you can think that way God destroys the last and greed hey hironakshi you know means with akshi eyes are like gold attractive within court that means last and gold so it is symbolic the hiron naksha is a symbol of lust and gold it is conquered by the pure form that is distract how to destroy in that level to destroy their ego Pride everything is gone when is killed means what his pride is gone his all these arrogance is gone so that is God's grace God is all full of consciousness another question in the ramakrishna order is only Mantra of Sri ramakrishna given what if someone worships some other God this is you know this is a very private question order I I need not have to say what they give but they may give different mantras also but well if they worship some under God but you know according to vedanta there is no other God different one God is Not different from the other all gods and goddesses are the expression of one absolute truth which is called Brahman so brahman's form only brahmana rupo naranam that is called if these are all different forms are only appearance the same God Appears in different Provisions not other than God but if they like one type of worship they have to understand it is Brahman only so what is the difference between one wave called mother looks me another wave called ramakrishna and another wave called Buddha if you know the vedantic background surama Krishna my mission probably gives things this ambedantic platform that all these ideas are discussed from the vedantic perspective so I think that if this philosophy is known then there is no matter that other forms of gods and goddesses are discarded or they are not worshiped they can be worshiped and probably mantras are also there but this is Guru and the disciple personal question I cannot enter into this but they are all expression of the one truth one truth is sachidananda Brahman and that Brahman appears in different forms so there is a statement beautiful statement [Music] for the cause of the sadakas brahmana brahmana the brahmas rupadharanam he takes forms so infinite number of forms according to suit ramakrishna said the soup mother prepares the soup fish soup fish fry fish cutlet according to the test of the child but it is all fish so similarly God Appears in so many forms you see how many forms of divine mother Kali Durga and not kali's form how many form of mother Kali how many form of than even in that there are divisions there are four on their same mother name is same with six arm with ten arms with like that so so many divisions are there so that's why these are all to be understood that that Brahman takes a form for the good of his disciples for the good of devotees and to because it will be easy for them to go to to reach that goal through their choicest path I like fish fry so give me fish fry I'll be happy and I will also be strong by eating the foods someone likes fish soup give him fish soup so God is so kind like mother so that's why mantras are also there different mantras and also there are some teachings are given like that gurus give but those are private thing as I said it is personal so you your Guru will can direct you and you can talk to your Guru okay so thank you and we end here um [Music] now we'll meet you again at 7 30 in the class which is called Shanti Gita that will be in the 7 30 to 8 30. thank you all
