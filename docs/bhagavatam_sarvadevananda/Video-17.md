[Bhagavatam - Book 1. Chapter 13 - Verse 1-36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uaysCT_aybE)

[Music] we salute bhagavan krishna the son of vasudeva who is the destroyer of the demons kongsho and chanura most dear darling of the mother the devaki and the good great guru of the world and the lover of the universe we salute him again and again from peace peace peace be unto us so we are today starting the chapter 13 of book number one and there it starts we last time we heard that the judiciary after the war big war judistero became the king and his king kingdom flourished all the subjects were extremely happy to have such a generous king and people were free from all worries anxieties and everyone being happy truthful honest the ideal society because of the king was so great and then he wanted to do one there some several sacrificial fires this is called medha yoga that that sound which is a special type of jagna that is done but it needs huge amount of money why it is done he did it because in the last war so many millions maybe i do not know how many number such number of people were killed from both sides their own relatives and friends to that might have you you might have caused some sin because of killing wherever you are right or wrong by killing people you have accord sin to get out of that sin he performed a great three great jagnas and there he invited again the lord krishna to join them and krishna joined and now after with the request krsna stayed for some time with the five brothers and their kingdom and now he is taking by and bid bidding by from the five brothers going back to his own kingdom in dwarka so krishna is now almost again second time going back to his own kingdom so now viduras bidura is who is bidura hidro was a arden devotee of krishna so bidura he arrived at hastinap christina is the kingdom of kingdom his capital was hastinapur so vidura came back to austria and that part is being narrated by the narrator suta again the suta is the narrator so narrator says demise of dhritarashtra this chapter is the heading is demise of dhitarastro who is detrastro is he father of dude yodhan and the 100 evil children and he was so much a good guy but i say so much blinded by the affection for his own son's doings whatever he does he cannot say no to that that was as if he was so crippled so that dhitarastro how he passed away this chapter will relate to that the sukune these narrator says what nareta says vidura a close relative of the pandavas had gone on a pilgrimage in the course of it he met the sage maitreya from whom he gained the knowledge of the atman and returned to hastinapur having got what he had sought so video was a very highly spiritual person so he has a close relative to the five brothers judicial bhima nakula sahadeva these are the five brothers so but see the uniqueness you are such a wonderful person he went to a pilgrimage of the other part of india and then after finishing that when and that pilgrimage he met is sage whose name is maitreya and then meeting with him and learning under and guided by him he came to experience the knowledge of the truth brahma ghana mahava such a wonderful person that he made a pilgrimage to attain brahmagana and he got a guru that means that is the ideal person and taught him and so he have that and then returned to the kingdom of again to the arjuna vidura had put several questions to my trail but even by the time he received answers for a few of them he developed unswerving and one pointed devotion to the lord so he wanted to know what is life what is beyond life all this question as any spiritual seeker puts that question to that maitreya that sage whom he met on the pilgrimage but before he is asking he got the answer love for god is the greatest tool for realizing god so he received the answer for a few of them he developed for a few of them he received answers for a few of them he developed unserving and one pointed devotion to the lord that means with mere question question question people put scholarly question intellectual question that is good at the beginning but also to understand that it does not make any peace in the heart unless you have the realization of it so you understand that realization is love for god unless you develop love for god this this people that one boy was saying that i want to be a monk wrote us a letter why hey i don't like anything you don't like anything is not enough do you love god that is the point you may not like the world for different reasons that will not solve the problem but you love god so much that that because of that it makes you disinterested so here that same question he developed that key point that love god so he developed that having thus achieved the end of human endeavors he was not interested anymore in answers to his other questions so first we have so many questions this do is that question and question endless question will come in the mind because it is we are inquiring for the truth but unless you develop love for god this question will continue continue continuing because you have to intellect when you come to the connection loving connection with god then all questions will be resolved automatically you will not find much interest in asking for what you are seeking what is that if you have really developed love and in the loving connection you feel the joy of thinking of god so that's a direct source of joy so you don't need any question anymore you are tasting the sugar you did not have to say is sugar what is the sugar like sugar what is available is it hot is it cold it is sweet it is sour is it so if reasonably it seems it is so it will be too much sweet maybe maybe bitter you may put on go on question like that but when you just have a little taste of the sugar and you are having that experience then question stops what am i questioning so that is the understanding came to vidura therefore after this question he has not interested he has not even he was putting this question when he developed love for god he understood are no more questioning you are already got into the track and you know god is love you know there is so much joy you need not have to read books or a new daughter question o holy one seeing their deer and clothes kinsmen came back to hostinapur those of the royal household greater astro the grandson dharmaputra means the judiciary with his brothers jujutsu and these are the names of the other people who are in the palace that time that their relative has come back with this extraordinary quality of love of love for god so kripa kunti the mother gandhari the wife of dhritarashtra panchali means the draupadi shubha drought rona's wife other relatives of pandu family and their wives with their children gather round him enthusiastically and received him warmly as the senses of man do when the vital breaths are recovered and that means all of the royal family members they assembled around that bidura who came back after the pilgrimage having generated love for god like a wise person all of them deeply feeling the sorrow and anxiety of separation from him for a long time set tears of love as they embraced him or prostrated before him so everyone is happy to to have vidura the holy in the family of the pandavas to come back after pilgrimage after a long time so emotionally some of them were weeping and some said tears of love and as a result some were embracing him some prostrating before him deep depending on the relationship one what is the type of if you are a junior in india junior salutes the senior so friend hugs the friend so there are different levels of relationship we find that bitura has been treated in that way sitting and they're all sitting around him so seating him most respectfully raja the king judisted worshipped and honored him in a defeating manner that means as with great respect great honor the yudhisthira the elder brother arjuna treated this vidura with due respect and honour after he was fed arrested and comfortably seated then judish tira with his head bent in humility asked him in the hearing of all so judicious the king name now the king he then after feeding this vidura and allowing him to take rest and after that comfortably he is seated and the king then put this question with humility ask some questions what are that eighth verse verse number eight on page 56 do you remember how we are brought up under the shadow and care of your protective wings as chicks of the mother bird biduro was an elderly person in the family and he had so much love for god and sincere asking that he went for pilgrimage in seeking the truth and after attaining that he came back so judy steele said that when we are kids how you looked after us with much love and affection like a mother care of your protective wings as the chicks are protected by the mother bird like you are like mother you took care of our early days recall how we with our mother were saved by you time after time from poison fire and other dangers because duryodhana always applied these tricks to kill the five brothers by poisoning sometimes by putting them into a room which is made of wax to burn it so that they will be burnt alive they do not know it looks like this but it is made of wax so that's why he's saying that vidura you recall how we with our mother mandrew buddhi you know kunti mother kunti with wife and five brothers draupadi wife and mother kunti how you as a wise guardian of us saved our life saved by your time after time from poison from fire and other dangers because duryodhana is always making a trick how to kill them how to kill them many evil tricks they took and these are the fire putting to fire well then put into in difficult situation incognito they will have to live for 14 years and so in those odd periods of time you like a mother protected us guided us so we how did you nine and ten how did you support yourself during your wandering all over the world my question you went as a pilgrimage being a royal family member how you went to the world and wondering days how do you spend your days which holy rivers and centers of worship did you visit oh great one god lover like you having yourselves risen to the height of holiness sanctify the holy places you visit by bringing the presence of the narayana who resides in you he's saying that where did you go wandering in the different places of pilgrimage to which places you visited which holy rivers india is full of anywhere you got is holy of holy rivers what are the other rivers sarasvati is another holy river they're all sanctifying so how you wandered around yourself and how you supported yourself by begging food or how did you do that and now oh great one out of love for god you became a lover of god so you have raised yourself because of your love for god you have raised yourself into the height of holiness because you have become holier so and holy people the beauty of holy people is this that wherever they go they make the place holy as a bad guy going any place they make the place a dirty place no so similarly holy place goes wherever they set seat wherever they leave that place become holy no ramana morsi made the place that hill mountain top it's a holi how his holiness made the place holy ramanas rama say dukshinisha ramakrishna came and he lived there because after god realization when he lived that holiness made the place holy now people from all over the world now going to holy holy place say south pasadena we go to south pasadena why the viva economy came then lived there no so it has become holy so holy place make the place holy so you the holy because you wanted god only and you are infused with love for god so you met the holy places you visited the holy these places where you visited they become holy because of your presence that means here that's the same thing swami vivekananda i have given lectures you only go i cannot speak because he is not a speaker like vivekananda then swami says you need not have to speak you show your life looking at your life people will be benefited that's happened shanthi ashram in from san francisco center that center that that is still a holy place and it's wherever they have gone and placed their food like say saint francis of acc huh he is born there and he has his place there it has become a church and is a place of pilgrimage of the world people from all over the world come to visit that holy place why because there is a saintly person lived there that make their presence make it holy father our friends and allies the jodha members who have krsna as the object of their adoration are they living happily in their own city did you hear about them or visit them so these are the questions so he said how do you maintain yourself these days being raised in a royal family how do you maintain your food that means how you survived where do you live there is no home like a wandering monk so how did you maintain yourself that was one question and how many holy places you visited and your places of visit that make them those places pure because you are carrying lord narayana in you huh and you are like our uncle oh father our friends and allies those who joined the judiciary group the whole india was divided into two groups no one joining with that jodhana and another party joined with the arjuna's group so those who joined with us those who are allies alice what you call allies that means the allies no they are allies with us so you have visited on your pilgrimage how are they doing are they keeping well are they happy because all of them love krishna that's why they joined in our party how they are doing are they living happily in their own city did you hear about them or did you visit on your journey now dharma raja who spoke thus biduro narrated all his experiences except the news of the destruction of the jadhavur clan for a kindred man who dislikes to see others sorrowing is dis inclined to communicate to them news which is unbearable in it poignancy and which relates to the unavoidable natural causes he says that with this question dharma raj who is dharmalas judhisthira in the epitome of dharma righteousness truthfulness honesty though he is a king though he is a warrior but he has his great values so he is called the raja the king among others who follow dharma so dharma as he is responding bidura to this question vidura responded to judistira what he said he said biduros narrating narrated all his experiences how he went to different places but he didn't tell one thing that the news of the destruction of the yadava clan jada brookland jodhu wangsha it is called the in which judy means those who milk men community they have their king and then krishna was born in that community they are all extinguished but he doesn't he's praying such a holy person they don't want to tell that story he didn't respond expressed foreign experience except the news of the destruction of the why why did not for a kind-hearted man a soft person who is very spiritual person she is this he who dislikes to see others sorrowing they don't want to see someone is suffering and in this this incline to communicate to them the news which is unbearable in its pregnancy and which relates to unavoidable natural causes no to tell all these people they will be very sorrow to know that krsna's was born in that clan of the milkman community they are all destroyed because out of softness of their heart they don't want to give the news which hurts others he then spent some time there happily highly honored by all alike a god and devoting himself to the spiritual instruction of his elder brother drastic so what he did he then this vidura then stayed in the kingdom of judish tira for some time being honored very highly like a like god itself no and he staying in that place he's a spiritual person so he devoted in his devotional and spiritual instructions of the elder brother dhitarastra and devoting himself to the spiritual minister he started giving advice to the dhitaras to the blind king vitoria was in reality yama born as a man for a hundred years going to the curse of sage mandubu and during that period of hundred years arjama acted in his place in administering justice to the dead so he said that bidura was not an ordinary person he was the jama the god of death reborn in this way so these are all big stories will be behind that and i also do not know but that is the background he is not ordinary that's why he was a his presence was extremely auspicious to others now deuterostar departs now blind king he will give up his life how and he will be giving up the body so that description is coming from verse number 16. so 16 bars says after his restoration to the throne yudhisthira and his brothers were as powerful as the guardians of the quarters lived in great happiness and prosperity he had also the pleasure of seeing the faces of a grandson who would continue his line okay that means this is talking about yudhisthira do this trio then rule the country with his brothers five brothers and they are powerful powerful in the good sense powerful as like the guardian guardians of the quarters in hindus believe that they are everywhere god so eastern side there is one god to guard the eastern side like military force similarly spiritual force so as like the guardians they are protecting the east west north side all directions lived in great happiness they were happy and they made the people happy and prosperity and here also the pleasure of seeing the faces of grandson that means this manu is the grandson so they got the chance of seeing birth of the grandson who would continue his line many years just passed unnoticed as it happens with people attached to home and family and grown heatless because of engrossment in their worldly affairs none indeed can overcome this way of time so they are all happily the kingdom was continuing and the people were happy but when happiness comes people get attached no happy moment means i am happy happy means what you are engaged in eating sleeping friendship friends are very well haha who so you when trouble comes then we think of god more when everything becomes all favorable how many people can continue to think of god so this is this almost the same situation many years passed unnoticed because happy moments go out quickly bad time as if it does not move a half an hour in distressed mood appears to be years no and joyful mood you are joyful about five hours past is it oh it has become five hours no so this is the condition many years just passed unnoticed as it happens with people who are attached to home and family and grown heatless because of engrossment in their worldly affairs none indeed can overcome this way of time time swifts on as time goes on it has its consequences good and bad bidura who was conscious of all this one day addressed his brother tritarastro bidura and uncle so uncle of arjuna yudhisthira etc so bidura addressed his brother dhritarastra blind king o king bad times are ahead leave home and positions and come into the open the time spirit as death whom none can counteract or ward off is fast approaching all of us that means we have been happily staying but our time is ending a clicking of the clock so our death is approaching that is the main point death is approaching overcome by time times inevitable hour men have to abandon their very light breath how much you want to keep the body you will have to give up the body one day time is a factor you cannot stop as the time clicks on everyone is born in time grows in time then declines in time dies in time so tritarastro for the king you are my brother elder brother so be ready so then what to speak of other committed things like wealth possessions this life will go away what about this wealth what about the prosperity what about the money what about the bank balance gold jewelry what is that nothing you will be able to take so get ready he's talking to his king blind king look at yourself viduro is saying look at yourself father brothers sons and friends have all been killed in your family huh all the hundred children of this rastra they are all killed and they are all the lineages are destroyed so father your brothers sons and friends fathers have died because of oldies brothers and your children who were good or bad whatever they did in time they are killed in the war and they are gone in age in age also you are far advanced now you have become buddha old age buddha what that means old old old days yours all sons are gone you're all family and you are the elder person in the society so in age you have all advanced far advanced gray hairs have covered your body no more black hair that means your gray hair has come your age has increased you lost your sons and other relatives in the war time has shown everything is gone gone gone gone and you are practically living in another man's house it is not your house you are living in the house of whom do this terror because they are the king now you are living in their home supported by him out of mere goodwill because you are you have created this trouble you could have control your children like yodhana and others then this work would have been stuck but you didn't do you could not control and now you are staying at their house at their mercy and your gray hair has happened yeah and still you think you will leave you know be get ready time is up wonder of wonders how strong man's clinging to life is huh we all try to survive in life who wants to die in the world who wants to die one reckless people taliban people they don't fear for death okay i take a gun you taking on clean kill you kill i kill that's okay and who don't want to die only god realize people and they think that they have no death no but medium people all because of attachment they don't want to die whatever and we also human being because of our clinging to life and the objects of the world we feel attached to it so wonders of wonders uh wonderful how strong man's clinging to life is even powerful people but cannot give up the attachment to the body and mind and money and wealth and prosperity and all this name fame when you die what name look at that how many great people with great fame great name gone in the past who remembers who cares for them do you remember their name their glory only in course of discussion or studying the history people may say oh that was a king there's a bad king good king this that how hitler came hitler going how much trouble created in the world but gone time is such a killer of everything so it is your time wonder of wonders how strong man's clinging to life is 22 hours see how prompted by it you are living here like a dog on balls of rice thrown to you by the bhima with content bhima didn't like you because you created such trouble for your sons your sons created such trouble supported by you you could have done something but you did not you are a king so you are you are just living here by the mercy of bhima arjuna do this terror particularly bhima hates you the dog is turned little food and dog tall what you call trance is a tale and happily eat so you are doing doing like that the bhima's mercy is throwing you some food and some clothing and giving you and you are happily living your old days you forgot your own time is clicking and you are not aware of it see bidura is talking all these things too the king he actually he was the solo so many years he was the king you know and that this entire war was we can say orchestrated by duryodhana's son and it's supported by him so what is the good of living in the tender mercy of those very people whom you and your sons have persecuted in every day every way setting fire to their house poisoning them humiliating there in the their wife dhrupadu was humiliated in the palace by door jordana so you created all these things and you are sitting there like a blind king not seeing any anything which is noble which should not be done you are not a monk you are ruling the king you are the king and at the same time you are allowing these nonsense things so it is like just like a giving a whip so what is the good of living you are living like a king what type of life you are living at the tender mercies of those very people you are at the mercy of those people whom you mistreated whom you wanted to kill whom you wanted to give poison whom you wanted to burn alive and whom you humiliating their wife on sir accepting their kingdom and wealth you have swallowed their kingdom it is not your kingdom it is pandu's kingdom so though you are disputably clinging to your body with intense desire to keep it alive see how in spite of you it is getting worn out by nature's process of aging even like a piece of cloth a cloth you keep for some time it will be old and it will be torn so though you wanted to keep it look at this nonsense it is dying out of his own because time is killing it tick tick tick is clearing it he who abandons earth and home for an unknown destination goaded by a spirit of renunciation and the absence of any sense of self-identification with anything and casts of his body which has become incapable of serving any human purpose he is called a wise man with a settled understanding this is the verse number 25 beautiful verse and the life's purpose no what are they those who are blessed people who live in the world for attaining the higher goal of life spiritual goal of life they give up their mundane things and be courageous to go for in search of the truth and and absence of any sense of self-identification they don't have their ego to be in the world and rule others and control others no self-identification with anything and cast of his body which has become incapable of serving any human human purpose this body should not be carried like a like a just what you call incapable body doing nothing good to the world become a burden that's why many people say don't reset yet dissociate no what you call after the you are sick resuscitation so you don't bring me back in life if the body is failing don't try to keep it more so but you are not feeling like that you have become old you have become tortured and you are also your hairs are grown and you have no still clinging for your life and you are staying in someone's home at the mercy of others whom you have mistreated and tried to kill every day you should be ashamed of it no you should not live anymore so this type of awakening of the a person very sensitive person with sophisticated word it works for a crude person you have to say crudely then it does not even work so he stays telling very straightforward way to a powerful king then detour has to deter astro he is called a wise man who settled understanding now he is the best among men who having installed hurry in his heart wonder sport from home armed with renunciation self-control born naturally in himself or by the advice of others probably will not get much stories of any other country that the kings are talking about giving advice to the king about renunciation no where do you find the greeks are talking about in that vein the greek kings are being given the advice hey your body is becoming old why do you go with the sword in hand to kill others conquer others life is short pay value to the import you will never find such advice this is a wonderful india and indian spiritual tradition is like that the king is getting advice from a person who is not a king or anything but and they're listening to that if they have the guts to have ah bear with that no other she says do you know who you are talking i can take the sword and chop your head now you dare to tell me like this so he is the now who is the best man in the society he is the 26th verse he is the best among men who having installed holy that means caring feeling that lord is in my heart with that spirit wanders forth from home to home he is like a beggar homeless they go door to door door to door begging from home room to home armed what is that weapon an army armed armory that is renunciation with detachment that outlook renunciation and control self-control they are all controlling their senses not for running into the worldliness but to the spiritualizing their life born this renunciation born out of renunciation and self-control born naturally in himself that means it is not circumstantial renunciation as i say suppose i am i get hurt by somebody and i feel dejected what is this world love is betrayed and this relationship is disturbed this way what is the meaning then i may get momentary renunciation not that but carrying god in heart loving god to see god be like a wandering mom no attachment for any sense organs or sense gratification so that is the way born naturally from home to home armed with renunciation and self-control which is born naturally or by the advice of others it may happen if holy person advises gives advice and you feel inspired then it may happen with that renunciation that means he's glorifying renunciation is higher than your kingship hari means the lord hari is the name of god one one name is got hari dinara ayana or you krishna you can say krishna several names of god rama krishna hari shiva all of the different it is substitute of god carrying god in your heart moving the world like a wandering monk detach to everything to understand the purpose of life therefore conclusion 27 therefore you now wander forth in the northern direction that early days india that was the style go to the north and what is in the northern direction himalayas before your death just give up everything move towards himalayas and without letting your relatives know about your whereabouts wondering moms when they get out in nowadays communication system is so good if your phone is there people can trace you where you are you do not have to you try to hide but you cannot hide yourself police can go and chase you and find out all these yeah even the cave they can find out so what in early days there is no such system so you give up your idea is to love god and you have matured you have seen the world just renounce oh king rita raster he's a blind king he's giving advice to the blind thing that you just moved towards the north the himalayas high himalayas that's why you call the himalaya is the last result of human human birth because go and think of god think of the noble self which is like grand himalayan snow kept mountain no they were the godly place we without don't let that you are a great person renouncing without letting your relatives know about your wearables so that they don't search for you and try to bring you back for ages is about for the age about dawn which is coming now is one that leads to the degeneration of man's character now the verse 28 i think there is no question so i will then read further is there any question okay good so i'll read now in another few verses the blind rastu being thus advised by his younger brother vidura that means we come to know that judith the king tritarastra younger brother was bidura huh so bidura is giving advice to his elder brother vidura came out he he didn't enter into the confusion of despite its issues so he carried god in his heart and renounced and went back for the self-realization so now this video advised dhitarastra broke a very strong course of attachment with which he was tied to his relatives and walked away from the palace along the way shown by vidura see he didn't now he's matured all the suns are dead all the relatives are gone so he followed the vidura's instruction detached from the palace detached from his own belongings no and vidura broke away the strong chord of attachment which he was tied to his relatives and walked away from the palace along with the way which is shown by bidura a younger brother gandhari who is gandhari the wife wife of the kingdom the daughter of shubala that means gandhari was shubala is the name of father or mother subal suvallah i do not know but anyhow the daughter of subala the virtuous and devoted wife that she was accompanied her husband to the region of the himalayas which is delightful and inviting to all renouncing paramahansas as a fierce battle these two courageous warriors it is like a fierce battle is to a courageous warrior that means to take up the journey to the himalayas is very difficult and tedious because you know path is very tough austerities no home you have to love god think of god then you can endure those sufferings the next morning when judas judistira after performing his morning rides the fire ritual and worship of holy men with present sense presence of cereals cows and wealth went to the palace of his elders to make omissions to them he did not find the tarastro and his wife that means the king a real king now judistero judistero was engaged in doing other activities in this mean time vidura talked with the king blind king hitarastra the father of jodhana and others they left the palace and then went away but yudhisthira did not know that so when he came to know seeing sanjay was sitting there in a depressed mood he he means yudhisthira said to him o sanjayo why is our blind father dritu rastro where is mother gandhari who has been grief stricken due to the death of all her sons where he is our well-wisher and uncle vidura that means biduro didn't only give advice he only inspired the king dhitarastra to follow him and he was guiding them to go to the himalayas where is our will we share an uncle vidura has the worst has the worst happen have they out of resentment for anything that a slow-witted person like myself might have unconsciously done drown themselves in ganga in their present mood of extreme grief for the death of all the near and dear ones that means he is blaming judith being a good guy did i do anything wrong that this my uncle father's due to raster see why he is no more found here where his mother gandhari his wife where is this vidura they have left did i do anything wrong they abandoned me and went into the him somewhere else to drown into the ganga stream of ganga where has our uncle viduragan the uncle who befriended us and protected us after our father pandu died leaving us helpless children so this was the question then literally asked to put that question then the suta commentator the narrator he is saying sanjaya who was intensely faithful and loving towards his master dhritarashtra was thoroughly depressed and grace-taken at the disappearance and remained silent for some time incapable of griefing any answer giving any answer 35 he then burst aside his tears with his hands some somehow exercised sufficient control over his feelings and then began to speak to brahmaputra who with his mind always dwelling over his lost master so here he is saying that sanjaya you know the sanjaya in the gita we find sanjaya sanjay was the narrator he was sitting in the palace and telling the king blind king dhitarastro what is happening in the war like a narrator in our television you see something and narrate so those days something was there krishna gave him this special power so he could see what is going on and narrating that so speak to dharmaputra with his mind always dwelling over his lost master so now this sanjaya become very sad because he was living with the blind king dhitarastra for so many day years and felt some connection human emotions he said oh great leader i am in utter ignorance about the intentions of your paternal uncle deter astro and as also mother gandhari they have slipped away without giving me any clue about their whereabouts as he said don't tell them where you are going no connection just move towards the himalayas and just lead carrying the lord in your heart just make a journey so he said sorry oh sanjay sanjay said sorry i do not know where they live without any notice without any instruction they have left us so this is the end of the verse number 36 and now now narada's instruction comes to judi's terror that's then in this narada appears now in the naruto is who [Music] who is the promoter of bhakti and messenger of lord narayana krishna so he appears and guides the humanity so he is now will give some advice to arjuna sorry judistira the elder brother who was saying where is my uncle go i i did i do anything wrong to give him instruction then naruto comes so we can read that next day that will be first number 37 will start just we read true 36 will start at 37 okay [Music] sri ramakrishna panamas too so now we'll have some few minutes on questions often at the beginning of the spiritual journey as one appreciates the impermanence of the world they lose interest in work this seems bishard not bhairaj if you could clarify further ah there is much difference between these two renunciation and frustration frustration when you get frustrated you find disinterested in things doing in talking in keeping relationship and it's disinterested due to frustration and detachment also when you get the detachment means again detachment means attachment to god as much attachment to god that means detachment to the other things so when that happens outwardly they look the same they appear the same but internal feeling is different atta renunciation has a higher value it is not renunciation as i discussed that impermanence of the world idea comes to anyone it may come you can see mostly suppose some relationship is broken it breaks the heart and that time you feel what is the meaning of this world why am i here why i am doing all these friendly connections and just doing hahahi this life this is the relationship this momentary it can be just broken so that is the frustration and that also will give this test for few days but if he gets back one another friend another relationship a nicer relationship then again life starts so it is nothing wrong it is nothing wrong but this is not renunciation it is out of frustration that there is in the east of pebbles there is a story no they that that jackal wanted to grab we have the grapes it was a little high and he could not climb but he is a clever guy he don't want to say that he is he could not reach that he said oh grapes are sour grapes are not sour because you could not get it that's why it is sour if you get it then it's a wow so that is the point this is the distinction between a proper renunciation versus that which is lose interest in the work and other things because of a frustration that's bishop means frustration that's why you have used the good word bishadha not by raga say why the gita started jodhana declared the war so arjuna what he said that what he felt the that he wanted to give up everything and want to be a monk as you read the bhagavad-gita and he said krishna i don't want to fight and to kill these people but baba you have made a plan for so many years because it's unjust i'm a king i'll have to fight out for truth and justice no now out of fear or out of attachment seeing the army in the army the faces of your own cousin own uncle so then the inner feeling of attachment and and and weaknesses they arose in the heart and then he said i am not going to fight even i am being killed i will be killed that's okay that's better but i don't want to kill anyone oh that is called vishada despondency depression that's a depression but see those who are meditate they sometimes retire or they will be finding opportunity to hide somewhere and get into meditation no and those you see the frustrated people depressed people they always try to keep themselves away from other people is it not did you not see in the society those who are depressed what they do they don't like to talk to anybody they're always hiding in the door locking the door and sleeping and feeling i am what lays i don't do anything and this as if as he like a like a meditator he also tries to withdraw and do meditation in silence he another person is also withdrawing withdrawing from the society is the effect but cause may be different so love for god may be one cause that is called renunciation that is proper renunciation ramakrishna in the gospel talked about it he said that it is called marcotte marcotte means momentary or like a monkey bother with the monkey what is what is mother okay what is mother that's what i'm saying i said that so the monkey monkey bairdago monkey does not do anything sitting but watching what you are carrying if you have some eatables then he's watching watching and suddenly jump and snatch and eat so that is the monkey mercato momentary it is not real genuine love so love for god should be the factor that has a distinction between that which comes without that so again another question follow-up question a person with great virago is he or she is in more joy than a regular person is that the bliss of brahman no please of brahman yeah the question you got that a person with great renunciation is he or she in more joy of course he is in more joy who have detachment for the world and love for god they are the happiest people in the world they close their eyes they find joy within they open their eyes they see the presence of god everywhere no that is the highest joy really enunciate people because they are not attached to means detachment detachment is a negative term but detachment real genuine detachment is love for god as a result detached to the world so that type of people that means more joy than a regular person of course and is that the bliss yes it is every joy you get it is a bliss of brahman but it is not the ultimate visayananda we talked many times about this all ananda or bliss is the bliss of brahman when it comes to the the level of vishal sense organs then it is called vishayananda when it comes to practice of spiritual discipline and singing and bhajan it is called bhajananda and when it beyond that you get intoxicated intoxicated and margie there that is also on the of same brahman it's called brahmananda so it is everywhere every annan there is a spark of that brahmana but of course there is a higher on the rather than who tries to find the attached joys to the senses person's joys minus the senses there's a higher joy higher joy but joy is the same all is god cause joy percolating to less layers of clouds are lifted there when the clear layer first layer of cloud is lifted or the vishaya the sense objects then it is more interior joy so it is deeper joy so this is it is that is the joy it is then higher than or more regular person's joy it is a better joy because it remains in your memory for a long time sensory joy when you eat food you like the tongue tongue likes it that joy you feel this is also brahmana but coming through the tongue is higher joy when you think of god no external object but meditating on that you feel the peace in your just a higher joy and then higher joy when you are totally get absorbed in god samadhi that's the joy brahma brahma gaya so these are all joys but in different flights and different levels okay thank you so we'll meet you maybe in the 7 30 again and thank you for joining online om peace peace peace shanti shanti you
