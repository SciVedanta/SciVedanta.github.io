[Bhagavatam - 2.1.26 ( Book 2, Chapter 1, Verse 26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6saTBSYN2wc)

[Music] we salute bhagavan sri krishna sudeva which is the destroyer of the demons kangshow and chandurah the darling of mother jason and raghav guru the world teacher shri krishna we adore him we salute him again and again so we are reading book number 2 chapter 1 verse 26 so the question was that how to die this question was raised by the king pariksit how to spend the last days of our life that was the question and the advice was given it started by sukadeva he started giving the first sermon to parikshit saying what we should do when the data approaches no one should give up all attachment and then engage in thinking of god so it says that [Applause] last time we read the advice was that it is a subtle view of the wise people that chanting the name of the lord lord's name and this common great glory it is it motivates a desire and to love god and one renounces everything last days should engage themselves in thinking of god and he says the life long lived is meaningless rather short-lived life intensely thinking of god is much more useful so he gives this example that there was a king whose name was khattanga he when he name came to know that his death is approaching in a moment he gave up all his kingly responsibilities and engaged into the name taking the name of the lord hari the krishna so and he said that oh pariksit you have seven days therefore years should be when death approaches for you like people like you man should with a fearless and unpartnered term fearless mind and on perturbed mind what to cut off all these attachments for this body and body related people and engage the mind in god that's why it is not so easy it will go to god that's very lifelong practice when when time is with us we utilize we how much you utilize that much will be the mind normally coming to god otherwise whatever we have given our mind to the last time when it comes it will go to the body acts and pains as also to those thoughts and ideas in which we dwelt so long therefore and like a sunnah since they give up everything he will one should bathe in sacred rivers and sit in a good posture contemplate and then contemplate on mantra which is the highest symbol of brahman and making the intellect as the driver intellect is the driver the chad is the of the chariot this body one should control the senses that is traveling along the road of sense objects and carrying the mind within the mind which is further disturbed by the subtle impressions that means subconscious minds thought will come so for them the mind when it's disturbed by those generate various actions that also one should control discriminating intellect by the help of our intellect and and fixed on the lord who is the true restorer of ultimate good so control everything bring the mind from every direction if it is a past impression forces you till drive them back to god and meditate on god then them contemplating the total form of the lord should afterwards be fixed only so you first think of the lord how do you think think of say sriracha the whole body then you fix your mind in a particular part of the body particular say face the bright face the eyes the forehead or something contemplating total form of the lord should afterwards be fixed on a single organ of the lord with intense and one pointed concentration then the mind should be made objectless no object so whole body to one part of the body and that part also have to disappear and it will remain uh objectless how by merging into satchidama there means name distracted other names and forms to easter devata and putting the mind there in this devata fixing in some particular space of part of the body and that part emerging into the infinite satchida when the mind is marched in bliss that is the supreme state of maha vishnu so that is called in bhakti school maha vishnu what is mahavisnu so here it says that when the mind is merged in that bliss that is the supreme state of ma that is called the supreme state of mahavision though language of vishnu is a dualistic term so when the mind is drawn out of the influence of rajas and thomas the dull dominion day the aspirants should then strong determination bring it under the control through concentration repeat practice of concentration that will remove the weakness so it will be repeated practice repeated practice to bring back and this repeated attempt at concentrating the mind on the lord's phone which is the supreme seed of all buddha and glories will generate devotion in the mind of yogi that was we read after that part last time now is the king then again question parikshit question the sukadeva how is did haruna concentration practiced how he can practice concentration where should one concentrate where to concentrate and how does it remove the weakness and impurities in the mind so the how the concentration is to be practiced one question and where should one concentrate again how does it remove our weakness and our impurities the mind had how to do and when in reply sukhare said a person who has succeeded in practicing steady posture who have men who can sit for a long time and stay in posture and then controlling the vital energies when it's prana controlling the prana in abandonment of attachment and in subduing the senses should fix his mind on the gross form of the lord that means the physical form as we picture or is a vertical murthy of that living presence of the history and with the help of understanding the form of the lord they fix his mind on the gross form of the lord you know gross form one is the in the form we meditate our gurus give us instruction another gross form is whatever you see this is all gross body of of god so it says with the help of understanding and this universe which is the grossest of the gross entities is the form of the lord in the cosmic form all the past present and the future is there permitting this universal cosmic form when it is with this seven seats consisting of the five elements that it is ego five elements are what you know five element now now five elements will be five five elements will be yes uh kitty update bomb yes you are right what you said is right and and then add with it city after this world don't plus your ego and mind huh these are the material part of the ego and mine and this is five sheets here on but here five elements and the mind and intellect these are the seven so the universal intelligence there is the virata purusha this is called the virato the gross cosmic form now what i see this earth entire earth the physical universe that is called the universe physically so you look at this physical body as god so wherever eyes will fall then it will remind us of god so that is the birth cosmic divinity and he who is whose body is this should be the real object of concentration so he first give the idea that he will meditate the way we meditate on the divine form and in the divine form whole body then a selected part of the body and focusing there and go to the formless saccidananda and it will not go so how to do second step is given that you think that whole cosmos this is the pirate of purusa the say gross porn all the other kitty of these marut bomb the air the water all these things are constituting part of the virata purusa and in the intelligence as also mind added with it they're all that cosmic form of krishna or narayana maha visnu that's vishnu is that one who permeates all over the globe all over the world now now how to meditate on the cosmic form now how shall i meditate on the cosmic form so all these 14 planes in there in hinduism there are seven hells and seven heavens so all are form of god you think that way that means wherever you go it is not a bad place it is not a enjoyable place or it is not a hell it is not like that but it is god it is the maha vishnu's body it is ramakrishna in another form so 26 verse which starts today today is reading 26 verses it says meditation on the cosmic form this form which which is everywhere the sky this stars this earth how do you think you think this is the body of maha vishnu this is the body of and the lord so patalo is the underside of his feet suppose someone is standing it is it is the lord standing no imagine someone is standing here his foot bottom of the fruit touching the ground this bottom part is called the patalo pathalam is the lowest what you call hell [Music] no you can think that his body his foot bottom of the feet is called patal that means your mind goes there you see it is lord's feet not a bad place but all right heels heels and the upper part of defeat constitute allah atala talatala patalo rasata rasa pathala so seven this is the middle place earth and 7 goes down 7 goes up so he is describing each place like that this lowest one is the bottom of your feet flat feet like the shoes you wear and that that that bottom part this lower skin or something that is the whole universe that is the lowest hell is called patalo and then upper part your feet that is called the rasha these are different names of the health the hill and the upper part of the feet they constitute rasatala maha tala is the ankle ankle of the creator the lord who creates this whole universe his ankle is called the ankle is called the mahatma maha tala mahatma so lois is the patalo then mahatala and talatala his poor poor legs just giving some names to feed it is from a pit you go every part they will describe it is his waist is this this fingers and these are the [Music] his four legs this two knees of the cosmos of the cosmos found deity is suitable the knees what is this another seven planes are hells one of the hell and the two thighs are the beetala and atala these are different names again so how many you got you got already seven yeah his hips constitute hip we are we are in the book in the bu plane in the level so we are here or the earth sphere and is and this deep navel deep navel is that where we are not below but we are in the naval chakra and there are possibilities for us to go yeah that's why human body is better so naval chakra is the sky naval is the sky no we are not in the sky we are the earth one step down we can go look at the sky the space that means that whatever you see in the sky means the sky the sky we see that is all the stars in the sky whatever is there so in this instance patalo the underside of this feet the heel and the upper part of the foot casted rasatala doi 2 mahatala is the ankle of the creator tree and tala tala is four leg four and then two knees of the cosmos called sutolo there's the five the two thighs are beetalo and atala bithullah otto and his hips constitute debu or the earth sphere and seventh is the deep naval is the sky so these are the seven seven planes seven planes down and two up to the naval area of the virata purusa so biryatopoulou says haphap is described down and the rest of the hub the sphere swarga which is called heaven is his chest another godly heavenly plane so one chest is the maha mahalak maha and it is called the nasari swarga is spoken as the chest mahar the neck gyanoloka is the face gyanoloka is the forehead while satya loka is the head of that multi-headed being so this is the concept you think wherever your mind goes in this 24 plane you can think you are roaming in the body of that cosmic purusa whom is you called ramakrishna whom you call krsna whom you call vishnu your your um deity of observation this reminder comes now what is this matter this is the time every time it comes now anyway so sattva is the head of the baltimore now indra and the gods are identified as his arms indra we have heard so many gods and goddesses in the vedic times so in row he is and they all other gods they are like the lord's arms the quarters the quarters how many quarters ten quarters east west north south and this northeast southwest like that all and up and below so all quarters there and the indra and neighbors are his arms the quarters are his ear he hears from all sides that's why all the quarters are his ears his ear is everywhere as you turn the sound as his organ of hearing this organ of hearing is the sound the austrian is oceans as his nose smelled as his organ of smelling and the burning fire as his smell as his organ of smelling and the burning fire as his mouth the skies constitutes his eyeballs the sun and moon his eyes are the sun and moon big most bright thing people used to look before they are like they are two eyes of the virata purusa these are just to keep the mind that wherever what they're telling ultimately whatever is you are seeing it is god it is god say in a dualistic language giving the idea of a human personality human body two hands ears eyes nose hair all this description as you can visualize so wherever your mind going you can think it is god it is god it is my beloved's body you know i am roaming in him only and nothing else first of all withdraw the mind from everything so if someone cannot do that then man will go when mind goes then think this way that it is all you are seeing god so he continues you may not be interested but it continues about all the rest of the verses telling which part is what which part is what just i can read just to honor the reading he says that so indra and devas are identified his arms the quarters or his ears as the sound as the organ of hearing the russians as he knows smell as his organ of smelling the burning fire as his mouth the skies constitute his eyeballs skies the skies constitute his eyeball the sun and moon or his organ of sight day and night his eyelids blinking of the eyelid day or night when closed probably tonight when it's open it is day the brahmaloka brahmaloka his brows eyebrows his eye brahmaloka brahmalaka just giving that different higher planes and lower planes of existence the waters is four sides and taste his tongue the vedas constitutes his brahmo dandra at the crown the vedas four vedas with a foal in the crown when brahman ghana comes it reaches up to this point and yogi's great swami vivekananda when he passed away his prana passed to this pad and so it was bleeding blood came out here that means it's penetrated through the salsa chakra oh yes if your mind goes here then you need not have to come back through here yeah it it goes up up up after even leaving this body in a subtle body it's called chroma mukti you go gradually into the absolute his molars are reprinted by yama the god of death his teeth are the expression of his love his smile is the world infatuating maya his glance is the limitless creation his upper lip is the modesty lower lip is greed breast is dharma back is adharma generative organ is prajapati testicles mitra and buruno abdomen ocean the bones are mountains the rivers are his blood vessels the trees are his hairs the powerful mine wind is his breath time his movement and the evolution of prakriti with its three gunas his spot the locks of his hair of the lord are the clouds his wearing cloth is dusk oh greatest of the gurus unmanifested prokiti is his heart his mind is the moon the source of all soft emotions the tattoo the great madness elements cosmic intelligence means the cosmic intelligence great element his lock looked upon as his chit or mind stuff the rude draw is the ego sense of universal being animals like elephants camels horses mules are thought of easy of his nails and other animals like cows deers etc is west the birds with splendor cloud colors shape and powers are exhibitions of his wonderful craftsmanship the first manu is his intelligence the man is his abode the celestial artists like gandharvas biddyadhara charanas musicians they're all music music people gandharva loka means a plane where all musicians are there artists and musicians playing songs and chanting and no that is called the gandharva loka gandharva is of different plains hinduism is so much deliberate so much innocence his musical tunes with asuras constitute his brows the brahmana is his face in the first forecast brahmana is his face shuttle the warrior party there is arms moisture his thigh and he should draw his feet the sacrificial rights in the invoking many divinities and requiring a great many rituals ritualistic ingredients is the work approved by him what i have described to you is the location of the limbs and organs of all comprehensive cosmic being the spiritual seeker tries to concentrate exclusively on this gross cosmic body of the lord outside which there is nothing more in this manifest universe that means is it just this is it it may appear a little inconvenient for us to think in this way they have mentioned but hindus are habituated with this terminology from the child in not modern young boys like us but in early days people used to know all these names from their grandfather father they are in the when their baby the the stories their grandfather grandma is to talk all this so they are familiar with the terminology for us it may appear a little uh difficult to conceive but taking the essential teaching last time the mind we are to die we are only for a few days what shall i do i cannot concentrate totally on god i cannot focus in god as they said think of the whole body of ramakrishna it does not come okay now try to fix your concentrated mind in special one special part okay in the face feel that that face is also disappearing into cosmic light and consciousness so how many people can do that mind comes down and moves around the trees the plants the sun the moon the gods the musicians in la last time thought it wonders why it will go you do not know you have no control over it suppose you like music your mind will go to a big concert party there you see the music that music oh that is a physical expression of so put ramakrishna everywhere but in my case always the thought comes like that after this i have to do things then i have that i have to like the whole task is always in my mind so there you feel that is ramakrishna it is democracy then according to this formula it is all ramakrishna there is nothing but ramakrishna it is ramakrishna nothing else or you can say it is brahman brahman brahman it is the cosmic form physical form cosmic physical because we live in the physical so physical mind runs into the physical objects as a moon sun it comes in your mind beauty when it comes any beauty think that it is ramakrishna it is ramakrishna that means nothing but ramakrishna it is his physical body you know you name you yeah if you look this this your thumb and you magnify it to see its details you know it becomes so big then you can find in every pore what is happening no but it is not the part of the body it's a part of the body whole body is a part so thinking in this way one can get out of the money mire of maya because they think it is all god it is all god it is all god because mind is restless mind cannot stop mind running every direction what can i do this time you say that you should concentrate on god but how can i do that my mind is not cooperating with it so wherever it is going that's why it is said means wherever wherever and whenever your mind manu your mind jaati goes your mind goes very well total thought true there and there itself you try to concentrate samadhaya means concentrate not to turn through some other so what it says conclusion the spiritual seeker tries this verse number 38 what i have described to you is the location of the limbs and organs of all comprehensive cosmic being which we call god mahabhishtam in that term it is all brahman's physical form brahman is the ultimate reality but it is subtle form and physical physical form subtle form causal form and the absolute but your mind is roaming in the physical part but physical part there is nothing but that success try to impress hammer hammer hammer so that it will see god everywhere the spiritual seeker tries to concentrate exclusively on the gross cosmic body of the lord outside which there is nothing more in this manifested universe in this universe there's nothing but god only manifested just as the single dream see given the example 39 verse just as the single dream ego enjoys a variety of dream objects so when you go to sleep dream what happens in your one dream suppose you are dreaming one scene last night you dreamt so as a single dream ego who enjoys somebody sitting there and he sees all this sinner you know whatever experience going on enjoys variety of dream objects and you see varieties there there you can find friends you can find car you can find a road you can find drinks you can find food you can find some a beautiful flowers and all these things so varied objects in the dream you can enjoy no different dream figures how it comes projected of yourself you project your mind projects so he capital the one and only lord enjoys all objects of the world to the mental modification of all beings worship that lord who is truth and bliss do not cultivate attachment for any other for from such attainment attachments arise spiritual degradation so therefore last momento pariksit you can meditate on the cosmic form of virata purusa that form of the lord and think that everything is he there is nothing but and the grossest form what you see that is nothing but the goded god alone [Music] to to think when i am i am incapacitated and my mind is disturbed mind is going to the aches and pains of the body and then not thinking this way is even matter of joke but what is the way out other than this it is difficult but what shall you do otherwise we will have to forget god and cry at that point it is saying that it is nothing but god what you are seeing this body you are seeing it is also part of god and feel that he is not only here it is also everywhere so that may shift your attention from this body to something else and now this is the formula given in the chapter one now we start chapter two that means book two chapter 2 starting verse number 1 sri sukha again the teacher is the sukha ambassador's son sukadeva he is speaking in times gone by it was through such a concentration focusing that the creator brahma propitiated the lord srihari and by his blessings recovered his memory that was lost at the time of pralia prelims dissolution when the total dissolution happens everything gets merged as it happens in our nighttime sleep everything of the physical or mental world all converge into heart it's called the sleep it's called prolayo ours our pralaya means our dissolution every night it happens for us the whole universe converges into it sometimes you don't sleep you are sleeping but you are thinking so many thoughts thoughts are running in the mind no that means you are in the dream state waking dream and then when that dream also stops then you go to deep sleep and so so this deep sleep everything is proloyo it does not die after staying for some time in deep sleep we come out again so this proliferation universe is like that it goes back into prolia brahma went into pralaya and then came out of it so he said and that was lost at the time of pralio he again recreates the world having been unfailing in inside and unwavering in understanding through his grace his grace means economy indeed this book is talking about bhagavatam so it is narayana krishna will be the hajjah or will be under him this is the purana stories are like that if you read the shiva purana then lord shiva will be above all brahma vishnu all gods and goddesses under shiva now you are reading this book on narayana maha vishnu so business is the ultimate business grace all other gods are working so by business grace when bain again created the world how they create the world and by the grace of narayana brahma created the world again as it we see that every day how this world is we come back we've come back and see the same world last night i saw the room and this is the same room people say i'm living in this room for the last 10 years 20 years 50 years no every day they go to sleep and come back and see the same room how it happens well it is god's god's creation so he again creates the words having become unfailing in insight and unwavering in understanding through his grace by maha vishnu's grace pain is the faith developed by men in the vedic ritualism and in meaningless flowery descriptions of heavenly enjoyments gained to them so it is useless to talk about that oh vedic rituals have done brought you to heaven and this and don't believe that by the grace of narayana it happened this is the glorification of the ishta devata enveloped in the tendencies of the mind the individual jiva who is the victim of such faith wanders from one sphere to another and fails to attain what is true and endearing enduring people do not understand that by god's grace it happens they don't take refuge to god they read the vedas they go to heaven they will go here and there and they buy their karma they will go there these are all not true faith in the in the mahavishnu or krishna that will be the goal therefore a man of discriminating mind should seek only such material objects as are absolutely necessary for him to leave a healthy life and even in respect of that he should be unattached and convinced of their ap morality they should understand that these are all impermanent and if the limited requirement is had otherwise than through perfect personal effort he should leave it at that knowing that the further effort in such direction will only be a waste of labor that means he's saying you don't waste your time in any other thing but take refuge in the bhagavatam in the lord instead of performing karma doing this ritual that ritual going to heaven and this because of your karma it's bringing you pleasure and all these things don't think anyway just do it and think that is love for krishna comes why strain and struggle to get a bed when there is a mother earth to lie on huh you are trying to get a bed you will get time to get a place to lie down and mother earth is there so lie down there why seek a pillow to rest his head when the arm is there to support it when you can eat and drink from your joint palms where is the need of for vessels and plates why shake other clothes when there are the quarters of the bark clothes to cover your nakedness have the roads become devoid of rags lying scattered here and there have trees which bear the weight of their footage for the benefit of others ceased to offer their picture of fruits and anchorage he's talking of an ideal monastic or detachment don't have to be beg anywhere the in the plentitude mother earth has given and fruits are there eat fruits that means not today's context in america on the street you cannot get food but he's talking of india and india's circumstances in the in the in the forest plenty of land wandering monk you can go freedom freedom freedom you need don't need a pillow your hand is this is the pillow i know like that you want to get grass grass she said you want a soft bed lie down on the grass grass is soft you'll be a soft bed sky the roof you want a big group how big is the room just lie down under the sky so he's giving that type of why strain to struggle get a bed when there is mother earth to lie down why seek a pillow to rest the head when arm is there to support it when you can eat and drink from your joint palms why new plates and glasses and saucers and why do you need plates all the cutlery what do you need two hands that's why india there are till now a group of sadhus they don't carry anything with them they go and take in pictures someone gives you big begging so you hold in your palm whatever holds in your palm take it and eat it here yes and go to ganga drink some water wash it yes no begging no bowl even so these are extreme people of renunciation they are talking about when you can eat and drink from your joint palms what is the need of the vessels and plates why seek other clothes you want clothes and the sky is your cloth that's in nanga sadhu the sadhus naked sadhus they smear body asses only they don't have any clothing how the needs can be minimized minimized minimally do you work actually so how much we need not to this extent but even then how much one needs it can reduce reduce reduce reduce minimum we live in a civilized society we cannot be like what they are talking about is for the monks but we have to have minimum but how much is needed minimum is everyone may have different concept of minimum yeah nowadays we have to store foods and clothes that's why we live in a civilized society in early days as a palm you go anywhere you stand people will give you food you go here and sita is to come for food how we behave how we behave one day two days three days four days then we get angry no but in india they'll never the monks will come they'll beg you give and that's why now and go that is their style so but we live in a society so we have need of food we need a bed but how much is necessary how many pillows are i know you should have everything moderate and and that may be extreme but people are hurt that someone gave one house for us and when he died and he's about 110 120 pairs of shoes one hundred tailored and even the boxes she ordered they came never opened and then shots t-shirts and they pan pants and the belts maybe one 70-80 belts 70-80 piece of belt so how much you need and it was a hassle for our atmo video swami to clean all this room days after days after days so this is called the extreme and this is also the but people can have minimum have the roads become devoid of rags hurry you need a cloth why you need rags people throw away clothings there are many clothings just yeah there are some sadhus they always go to them as mashaana in the cremation ground and the clothes and things they dragged rugged clothes they use them for their when he was in austerities in alone he did that so have the trees which bear the weight of their footage for the benefit of others cease to offer piksha or foodstuff to [Music] anchor rights that means plenty trees are full of fruits you can go to have fruit anywhere so why are you too hungry why to go fill anything just pluck the fruits and eat have the entrance of the caves and caverns become bird you want to leave yourself live in a cave there are hundreds of caves thousands of caves in the himalayas just enter into it you're you're fearful about some tiger will come this year just enter into a cave and live in there actually uh there are many sahaja yogis live in the caves even today and has the unquote they have now modified cave and the diagnosis of india every day you have to pay 3 000 rupees and they will bring you the hot water and breakfast once a day or twice a day like that you can do meditation inside that's good no no that's high tech no that's the modern cave modern people under modern nah now modern people are not capable of doing that austerity if this any help is given because they're living in a different context of the society no so once once i went into a cave and stayed for few days what you say you have to go for water you come out and go down and there is a river find the bucket where is the bucket you have to collect a bucket now or you have a only baking bowl fill up that water and then you finish when it's finished then you need water go down so this austerity modern people cannot do that but to experience the cave idea i went to one place where hari maharaja did austerity in near opposite side of el habada and there uh the sadhus i just young sadhu then i went that is it possible that i can come and stay in the caves he looked at me oh you people will do austerities here people they did it who are you people it is not for you you cannot stay here you cannot live here the whole caves are all free come stay how many days you want to stay have an entrance of the cave and caverns become bad and has the unconquerable lord cease to give protection to those who seek shelter in him why then should a spiritual aspirant become dependent on rich men infatuated with the evil pride of their wealth why do you go to a rich person for money and wealth and seeking grace compassion in one's own heart he resides the all-perfect and infinite being who is truth and love analog seek him with abiding faith in his truth abandoning all worldly values by that we will ignorance the cause of sangsaru be destroyed seeing the whole world suffering in the hellish string of sanchara to the evil effects of their own actions who accept brutes will follow those falsely false worldly values abandoning the thought of the supreme being that means it is foolishness verse number seven it is foolishness to live a life which is centered around this type of misunderstanding of running into the world which cannot give us any satisfaction but begging all the time the blessing people in india it happens now those who are not so much the power of renunciation is less they wait on some grace of some rich people wealthy people they will support them no the monks but real monk will not depend on anything they will think that this is my life who cares i am perfect but because of that they are habituated you know sadhus if you go to the nanga sadhus naked sadhus they from that whenever they join in the monastery from that onward they are habituated becoming in remaining in the body uncovered so every day smearing so your body is acclimatized with this heat and cold and you can endure we we cannot do that even we sleep without a blanket over us we get sneezing in the morning so our body is not covered that way so that is the point but point is that it is a spirit of renunciation what is being talked about spirit of renunciation that's why only the happiest people are those who don't want anything we don't need anything no they're the free people they don't care for any things i don't need anything so i don't beg to anyone or anyone's grace but god god depending on god god god the wandering monks they depend on god only that that king what is the story of alexander no that holy man could reject the welcome of alexander he was in the himalayas and he was in the lying down in iraq like exactly we are seeing he has no clothing in his body he is with the palm and under the sky and happy perfectly happy okay now our nation is putting question big question question is meditating on murthy then the formless then on the identity of the awareness with the whole world of forms it's like organo to gannon to begin yeah you can think that it is all you can we can think that we cannot do these three types of meditation what in this bhagavata we read just now one in the divine form whatever gurus give to think of his form and every part and then concentrating on one part and concentrating there and that one part merging into the cosmic reality yeah very few people can do that but yes this practice can be done and with the eyes open then awareness of the the whole world what we see it is only his physical body if one can think this way he is a physical body of the lord of the universe then yeah began you are right began to be an organogano to beginner but organo these are all in the range of not began but is an atom to see began means when you see it the economies i am seeing is god but what they are teaching us to try to think this way let your spiritual journey start this way and then you gradually when you mature in three different ways then you will live in god consciousness so yes i will say all are in under organo ignorance because i am not seeing god so i am trying to concentrate my mind on the god's form and the whole form i can hold the mind in the whole form so i am trying to concentrate in the maybe in his feet or in his face and then concentrating there we find that mind is focused there and it goes deep deep deep deep deep these are all practice practice is a state of in the ignorant state we do practice when the ignorance drops up then we are free and then gana this is the physical body gano is reading this book we know this body this is the physical body of god you know so therefore that's also attempt i am trying to think it is the physical world but it is stably stable for me how much i say i don't see god here but i have to impose that idea that's a sadhana that's also in the ignorance but afterwards when you are everyday practice if one is fortunate and gets the knowledge then you can say this is the beginner state where you can find everything is permitted by god if one can think sarvam kallinang brahma it is sivam will that mean that person no longer has any preferences all food people and places will be the same for them yeah if one it everything if one can think that sarvangalui rang brahma everything is brahman everything what we are reading everything is the physical body of the cosmic lord so it is not brahman it's the physical part as you have physical part this is my physical part i have a mental part i have an er the utmon part so here so if one can practice everything is brahman every day or you say everything is shiva shiva shivashiva that will mean they had any preference yes if they can think that way why they will prefer anything but saying one thing and practicing one thing but to live that life is different only brahma ghani's super brahmanganis can live in that consciousness for them everything is okay that's right uh whatever good there is no it is swamiji said uh food uh perchance whatever comes in the sunnah in song of this one since maybe food what chance may being ill ki oil cocktail just not that judgment will go away when one is practicing sarvankar within brahma yes there is no good there is no bad in the eyes of that person but that is the end result of their practice end result but practicing period they live the duality they will live in the duality yes at the end all food all places will be the same for them another question vishal which one how can we find our personal mantra if we cannot find a guru to initiate us how can we do mantra meditation without personal mantra yes that's why you find a guru your question is how can we find our personal mantra your personal mantra so you have to go to find a teacher and then ask him or or he will talk to you and will understand your tendency and he will guide you in that line so you have to go to a guru find a guru who is a guru so search for that and when that mantra you can get then then meditation he will teach you the meditation process and with that meditation process the mantra being chanted naturally the mind will be purified and well you'll be free so you have to find the guru first right too but uh search for that and before searching try to read swami vivekananda's book on bhakti yoga there you'll find that yes in the book small book chapters are there he has talked about how what is guru who is a guru what are the qualities of a guru what are the qualities of a student so those are to be understood and then you can find a real guru you can search for guru like shopkeeping before you have a good product you can you can see the qualities and then find who will be your guru or pray to god oh god please bring my guru to my life and then he will do it god will do that another question sudhir kumar how can we get a copy of bhagavatam is teaching oh bhagavatam you can get into our vedanta catalogue our catalogue vedanta catalog and the book is the srimat bhagavata it is published by

you can order this book srimad bhagavatam bhagavata by swami tapashiya published by chennai mott oh in the chat in this chat you can link the book it is there find the link find the link find the link find the link in the chat itself okay another question is brahmaloka the same as akshara brahma in chapter 8 of the gita aksharan brahma paramam that is akshar means that is i do not know it will be higher than brahmaloka is that he said they say loka lukam is a place a plane it is plane of brahman but plane of brahman does not make any sense so it is that loka where one does not come back that is the main thing where the mind moves into that level they dissolve there ultimately that is the loka so you can akshara brahma paramam akshara brahmaparam so that is the param aksharam is the that is the brahma that is the ultimate place there we don't say loka or this thing it is brahman better to say brahman when you use the loka then it is a little one level one step down because it's a plane where you can feel a little distinction but when it is brahman then it is all distinction goes dayan silva how can one view god in everything if we do not yet have a deity deity and now you can think we can think of god as consciousness if we look at the universe modern science tells that everything is energy everything is pulsating with some power and energy so if we know how can we view god god as consciousness you need not have to think of god as a personal god personal god also people think my rama is this tree the plant everything is rama rama rama rama but in vedantic perspective it will be god is the impersonal absolute so it is called the ocean of bliss ocean of consciousness ocean of the reality so that is everywhere permeated everywhere modern science says it is not it's solid there is nothing solid it is all energy and it's all power so if it is up to modern science has gone up to that that is only one it is all pulsating with energy there is nothing solid no liquid solid these are all terms of ours but it is only energy and that energy is the one energy you can convert it into one form to the other form but it is energy is the same constant so if that energy we have found till our sadhana when scientific sadhana spiritual sadhana goes till in the back of that energy what is that energy behind this energy that's why they sell pranas prana it is the energy is the prana what is the energy behind that prana and that is the consciousness so as consciousness everything is permeated with consciousness without consciousness no movement is possible no change is possible so in that sense we can think that it is everything is permeated by god and we can feel as consciousness as bliss as joy in a whole universe we can look at full of joy how can we see joy and so look at independently look at the shining leaves of deep in uh look at the trees you see there is some beauty some joy whose joy how it is manifesting but some you may say oh i feel disgusted with something else that also we see how can i see god there that is difficult first first you see god's presence in good things noble things cheerful joyful smiling objects of the world then you try to see god in others there our explanation would be my expectation level if it meets an above we are happy my expectation level below down then i am unhappy so when you see something ugly that is not meeting your requirement of joy level your mental idea this is called joy what is light and darkness every time we talk about that light is also light waves light wave is everywhere when it is in the range of our eyes to catch we call it is light and when it is below that we call dark and when it is too high above that that's also dazzling we don't see anything so is no is light only in the middle place the light is light wave is here light wave is high there frequency changes and light wave is here low frequency but in all the three prince light is there saccidananda god is there in a low frequency we call bad people bad world middle in which we live we call good above gods and goddesses they are beyond our rich even human gods like rama krishna buddha christ etc so they are so pure but they are also in the creation so three things can be so god is everywhere my point is that god is in the holy person like christ buddha god is like in us also the level of vibration is mediocre and below when it's bad evil we call it's a low vibration is there but it's low vibration it is not manifesting no vibration why because there is some obstacle you remove those obstacles then it will be low vibration will be high vibration so that's all so we can view god as saccidananda as ocean of bliss in everything if we have the concept that it is pulsating with one consciousness portion of joy ocean of bliss everywhere but my my mind is not catching that vibration if it could catch then you'll see god everywhere they will find joy everywhere that is the state called spiritual life brings that result in our life so thank you all and then we will be able to meet you again at 7 30 for our shanti gita class the song of peace and we'll meet you next time as announced in the bulletin we end here om shanti [Music] too you
