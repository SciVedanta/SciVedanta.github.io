[Bhagavatam - 3.4.1 - ( Book 3, Chapter 4, verse 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BEdlNxud28)

foreign [Music] [Music] foreign and the guru of the world jagat Guru and adorable god of the universe We Salute him again and again on peace peace peace so we are reading bhagavat this is the story it we are in the chapter 4 and page number 157 starts there are the Krishna now is trying to finish his Divine Play and then Buddha one of his prime disciples he was always in an Ardent devotee of bhagavan used to live with him and he has she is very much shocked to lose this association with the Krishna the Lord Krishna who is his heart and soul who is this mother father everything of life so that is talking about how that the question put why the um what is that life story is by who what is called the uh they were talking to the clan of Uno it is called the bidura bidura so that that system there is not much philosophy in it but it is a story within a story within a story there is the way the bhagavata works so here in this find that that that that bhagavan knew he destroyed the all the other demons but in his own family members they become very arrogant and Powerful and they killed themselves there so he knew that that will happen but to Shri krishna's unique characteristic it shows that how he lived in that way he was super fully detached knowing fully well he saw his own life is the story of detachment so this is the example of that so is talking in the here on this chapter 4 of the book number three verse number one afterwards these genres they went and have some deep in the ocean and then they did some and they went to the prabhasa and joyous mood to prabhas in their chariots and bathe there in a holy chariot and from The Chariot they came down and they took their and performed the rituals and worship of the Gods and disease and the Piet trees I mean poor fathers and then gave so many gifts and everything as is the normal ritual they should do and presenting various gifts to the holy people brahmanas Etc in a spirit of offering to the Lord these Heroes of the clan of Krishna made low prostration on the ground and then continued afterwards these jyada was took their meal and then they drank intoxicants after doing all these rituals for their forefathers and others he started they started drinking intoxicates men then it's wine and type thing and as it happens losing their wits there upon they began to abuse one another in the most offensive manner as it happens when you get intoxicated you do not know what you are saying what you are doing so they naturally behaved started behaving unmanneredly and when the sun set by the sunset the effect of intoxicants made them completely senseless and drove them into the violent physical conflict like bamboos in a bamboo group you have no idea in a bamboo group The bamboos and the ravichado it makes Such Noise and it falls upon each other and it is not destroyed but it is inch by inch conflict the Lord seeing his jogo Maya in operation this bhagavan planned this way that these people are becoming haughty they are family members because with the power of Krishna they are born in that same family it happens no father is rich very well established sun is the son of such and such big guy naturally they become very arrogant and powerful and all the these people of the family they become like that so young youthful time they started insulting holy people which is anti-characteristic of the teachings of Krishna and so the Lord seeing his joguma it is happening here is the question everything happens in the world by the will love God Lord wanted the destruction of them also so that is how he does he does by his yogic power that yoga Maya that means by his own power through which he creates this universe he maintains this universe and he also destroys this universe the three powers are all God's power and then in Hinduism then they are not coming from a demon that is the beauty of Hinduism the creation also God plans and creation happens God protects the creation continues and God himself wishes to destroy to have redecreation that's why Hindu Trinity creation Brahma Vishnu maintenance and Shiva destruction so destruction means destruction with the old rotten to regenerate them the house becomes dilapidated then people break that house and breaking is bad because breaking news it hurts our sentiment it was yeah we lived in that house for so many days what happens when the fire starts and building starts burning yeah but sometimes you see that it's one side of this but after that you find insurance company comes and this and that they have new houses so destruction is apparently the destruction but it is by God's will it happens so here he says the Lord seeing that he is my power of yogic Maya power in operation bringing about the destruction of his own Clan his own family members purified himself in the river Saraswati that means you take it deep in the Holy river whose name is Saraswati and sat under a shadow and a a SATA tree this type of tree group that is a big giant tree he took a bath the Lord Krishna then took a bath and sat there the Lord Mr Krishna who redresses the redresser of the Sorrows of those who take refuge in him he takes away the Sorrows of those people who take refuge in God he had told me even at dwarka me means the great sendly person who was a sannyasin monk and you Dava Gita is there foreign [Music] so this is the story going on that then all these things are going on then Krishna took a deep in the river Saraswati and then sat under him under a banyan tree a circuitry and at that time he had told me even at dwarka and oh he told this story a dwarka at the time he resolved to bring about the destruction of his clan that I should go to badri Buddha means that is the in the high Himalayas there is a holy place and krsna's place and narayana's place even after knowing the plans of the Lord I mean unable to Bear the separation from him continue to follow his footsteps so even he said okay now you leave me I will go and die but you go and live in the world preach my message and give this message to the whole humanity and live joyfully he asked that asked Krishna how shall I live you are giving him up your body how shall I live there is nobody in my life whom I loved so much and only support you are my support then he said okay you giving up all everybody everything your home your own friends and your relatives some of Drake with higher picoanimity that God is everywhere looking in the universe in that Vision go out and live in the world like wandering Monk and see that it is all God's play going on in the world so with this that was the advice he gave then he said still he followed him and this is the last Point not I don't know Krishna took it deep in the river and sat under their circuitry here it is not said so going after him means bhagavan Krishna the Abode of Lakshmi SRI SRI Devi is called Lakshmi I found him my dear master and the Lord sitting alone on the banks of the Saraswati absorbed in the consciousness of Atman said there I saw the narayana Krishna is sitting under the tree and is deeply absorbed in meditation thinking of this self blue in complexion absolutely pure and calm with City in eyes sting dread distinguished by his four arms and yellow cloth having his right leg placed toward the left thigh leaning against a small Banyan Tree I found him many Krishna seated absorbed in Atman after abandoning all worldly enjoyments and paraphernalities so he has renounced bhagavan Krishna renounced because he is the king he renounced everything and then is meditating and sitting under the tree just oh maybe cousin brother okay just at that time they are arrived by chance a Great Sage his name is Mike Trio so he was meditating Krishna meditating on the bank of these River Saraswati and that time a great devotee a close friend of the sage basso basso is who who composed this bhagavat who who have been divided the four Vedas compiled them and then divided into different so that says basa's friend he is a great says maitreya so maitrios suddenly appeared there in the course of he was all over the world he was doing pilgrimage all over the world and he happened to appear on the bank of Saraswati where Krishna was and planning to leave the body so he's closing his eyes in deep meditation while that great says stood there which is head Bend and in devotion and joy the Lord Krishna spoke to me with a smiling face and loving looks in the hearing of disease the Lord said when Krishna said seeing that says what he said being the resident and the Lord said what he said 11 verse page 158 being the resident of the hearts of all I have understood all that you have in mind he said Krishna says I reside in the heart of all so I know what you are thinking soon I understood that you all that what you have in your mind I based on you that illumination of consciousness without devotion can never happen so he says to Metro he says that I confer you the freedom our knowledge of the Consciousness that is the vedantic practice no vedantic practice every day to know that Consciousness is behind everywhere there is only sachidananda so I confer that illumination God can give it by his kindness for in Europe why I am giving you because you are not in this life whatever you have done is not enough you have done in your previous life great austere practices and You observe spiritual disciplines as a result of that Merit your mind has become pure so I am now conferring that means in our life spiritual elimination is the goal but not that we have all done such good charitable activity or meditation and practice so those who have done suddenly we find that they are progressing very fast God's grace coming on them some people are not so not to worry about that the other person also did austerities in other life we have to do austerity now if I have not done it so this is the point we learned out of this lesson and bhagwan says you did not know you in this life we don't see that austerity or anything but in your previous birth you your name is Basu you worship me in great jagna performed by the prajapatis and basus with a view to attend me you did create austerity and jagga means sacrificial fire Etc to attend me to to reach me you didn't you didn't do the the sacrificial fire for attending Heaven attending name power position you can do you can do the same act um for married purpose so your purpose was to please me and to get my darshan this birth appears in which you have become an object of my grace in its fullness in this life people see the greatness of your character where our my greatness is manifested through your life in your last birth in the cycle of the birth of death so that last but because of that austere activities austere service you did it because of that of the last part that's really you are having instant Grace from me so this is to be understood sometimes we say oh if this Grace when I would have bombed been born in ramakrishna when he was here it does not work that way you helped must have some Merit you must have some qualification and that qualification or that quality you have to accrue where to absorb by your own sincere practice spiritual life does not just become people talk about that in some miracle way doing some some unnatural ways you will get the elimination those don't stay real genuinely really realization will depend on your purity of your heart the love for others your sincerity your how much you are thinking of the good of others how much you are less jealous egoless how much you are evil is all these these characteristics it needs much pure practice so you have all this and if that was your last birth in this cycle of person now you are the last but your last but one last life you did so much and this is your last so that moved by the highest devotion you have been able to follow me and see me in this Solitude at that time when I am about to leave the world of men is a rare piece of Good Fortune for you he says oh my true it is a good fortune how it we say coincidence no not coincidence your good karma has brought this to happen so we should not just throw everything in someone's hand and not do ourselves anything it is more important to you that Metro has done so much so that his Good Karma of the past life has brought him where he was he was wandering monk in the whole India he was moving and he happened to come when Krishna is giving up his body how much we call coincidence but it is not coincidence the karma has brought you there your good karma your spiritual practice has brought you where you are now is a rare piece of Good Fortune for you in the Padma kalpa at the time of creation I imparted to Brahman who occupied I never Lotus that spiritual knowledge which reveals my Supremacy so I have expressed in in a time of creation I gave it to Brahma Brahma is the creator of God so I am the lord of the Universe I give him the wisdom and the spiritual knowledge which reveals that I am the lord of the Universe I am the highest learned men call it the bhagavata so I shall reveal that to you so he says that I have learned that story of the bhagavata I will let you know submission and krsna's reply put in person hearing these words of the Lord I who amongst us to have his continuous Grace foreign continuous Grace said in faltering words with horrification all over my body and tears flowing from my eyes out of excessive devotion I said O Lord for those who adore you which is the ultimate values of Life done more to come and maksu is difficult to attain he says o Krishna bhagavan for for those who Adore You worship you which of the four ultimate values of light is difficult to attain that means you are practicing for dharm righteousness or through the collection of money fulfillment of desires and liberation it is difficult to attain but oh Lord I seek none of these that's why in our meditation in our time sometimes that we offer God all the poor fruits foreign collecting money wealth Prosperity that may be another goal then what to come fulfillment of the sense experiences and joys and and knowing all these ends in time moks I want to get out these troubles of Life Moksha these are the four goals naturally human being had but there is a higher goal that's a devotion so he's saying oh Lord I seek none of this Dharma or to come or maksha this poor I seek none of this as my interest is solely solely in serving you I want to serve you that's it's called in bhagavat says in another place if you is a real devotee he is given any spiritual power or high the higher control over gods and goddesses so you wealth Prosperity fulfillment of desires even given but real devotee does not get entangled into it they go above it they reject them because that cannot give Eternal Joy so that's why they give up anishad says and when the JAMA the god of death was telling him you child you are asking for which is that beyond death which is beyond time tell me that truth I want to know why a child like you you are asking all this question I will give you plenty of wealth and prosperity I'll give life hundreds yet no not 200 years 500 years as much you want to live I'll give that life huh I will give you all the pleasurable things in the high heaven which is available singing and don't mama don't ask me all this High fine final truth absolute Beyond Time beyond space don't ask all these things said oh Lord you are great thank you but let your all this dancing and singing and all the glories stay with you I want to know the truth of immortality tell me that you're singing you're dancing your long life you're with all enjoyment of the senses I don't want let it be with you please give me the highest wisdom so he had also said Buddha was saying it is oh Lord I seek none of this as my interest is solely in serving you I want only to be with you and to serve you even the knowing ones are puzzled about your conduct no if their dishes they leave they are puzzled with the Divine acts of the Lord those who lived with them they are titled they see that he's sometimes broken his arm he's crying his god of the universe is crying because of his leg hand has broken why his hand will break he is God of the world can he not cure instantly so it is very difficult to that's why you're always difficult to live with a great person because you see him as ordinary like us they are Behavior their anger their frustration so ramakrishna how to understand he is God himself that's why he said even the knowing ones even those who are very spiritually developed and knowledgeable in spiritual life once gets puzzle about your conduct your contact means your behavior that people say oh he has so many queens played with so many girls she played with so many girls what type of spiritual person is this but it is that is a wrong concept he is only he split himself in thousands is God himself so his activity is even the knowledgeable people gets puzzled yeah your action while you have no sense of urgency you do all these things but you have no ego sense a child plays so many things and child is a source of joy to everyone but child's actions all these detest child has no identity with anyone but he actually plays and attracts the whole attention of the whole family and others so God also is like that when he comes as Incarnation that Divine Play is very difficult to understand the Christ came he knew everything he planned he know that he will be putting into the cross and this and that he could have escaped very easily why he knowingfully well does that that's a puzzling thing for our Ordinary People I I'll be falling into trap if I know already somebody told don't go there and there is some trap for you your life is in danger what shall I do I'll never go that's it I'll try to save myself but who is there why God knowing everything he is residing in the heart of everyone and why he plays like that it's a puzzling thing it is Maya's action so your action you have no sense of agency your birth while you are Beyond sansaru you are born it seems but you are beyond all the birth and death cycle you appear to be born Krishna is born huh Christ is born ramakrishna is born but there sometimes they call their Immaculate birth Immaculate birth a child is born how is possible puzzling some people say there's too much unscientific don't talk about that but in ramakrishna's life I cannot say that father was in one pilgrimage hundreds of miles away and mother was in the village and mother revision so she saw the little light of the Shiva she was light engulfed and entered into Haroon he felt some baby and father in the distance hundreds of miles away in the pilgrimage is he saw in the night time the Lord narayana with poor arms which are reading this Nana and appeared before him and his father he said I will be born in your home and in the dream he said I am ordinary poor Brahmin what shall I do how shall I feed you don't come but you know I will take care of myself and that thing happening and mother already conceived a baby there how it happens you understand that's why it's called puzzling it is puzzling to know that you have no birth you are how can be born how can you be like a baby crying baby Christ cry and cradle she cries not in her in his script so but baby cries that's the normal thing baby does not cry so all this behavior and so the god of the universe is born in a manger how this absolute god of the lord of the universe ramakrishna born in the most poor family in the village but his father's Purity dedication respect for spirituality every village person will stand up when his father used to just walk out of respect so God comes over there so this is very difficult to understand that your action while you have no sense of agency your birth while you are beyond all these sanction means coming and going birth and death your flight before the enemy while you are the time spirit that consumes everything you are the time is under your control and you are with the Enemy you are fighting while in the time of spirit in the time the Timeless is working in the time so it is very difficult to understand your involvement with thousands of women will while you are ever immersed in the innate place you are Divine you are always absorbed in your infinite Bliss and also we see that you are a king you have so many queens you are enjoying the pleasurable life oh Lord my mind loses its bearings in wonder when I think how in the deliberations on the Affairs of the state you who are the all-wing and uninhibited consciousness used to seek my advice with great earnestness that means he used to ask you for suggestion God's asking for suggestion you find in the gospel of ramakrishna sriramuddin asking the doctor how shall I be cured oh doctor please make me cure like a child so how can he recognize that you are the you are all knowing you know everything you are the ongoing Consciousness behind everyone in the absolute sense and you behave like this it is really really oh lord your knowledge that oh Lord that knowledge which you did impart to Brahma by which one overcomes the travels of the transmigration easily be gracious to revealing to me if you couldn't consider me fit so my prayer oh Krishna please help me oh Lord please help me that impart that knowledge of Brahman so that I can become free you have done that same to Lord God Brahma Brahma created this universe you gave that blessings to him so give me that blessings 19 verse on page 159 to me who had thus conveyed my heart's desire the Lord Krishna imparted the highest knowledge about the Atman so he then Comfort the knowledge to me having received instruction on the Supreme truth from him who is the object of worship of all I trusted it before him circumambulated him and came over here with a heart aching because of his separation from him he's talking to biduro that I after being all these things listening and getting his blessings and he wanted to be alone so I came back from there for having met the lord it's my great fortune that I could meet the Lord and the list at the last moment of his life and received Enlightenment from him he gave me the wisdom I didn't have any own power so it is God who gave me by his grace gave me this experience and sorry I am I am both happy and unhappy happy happy that I was blessed to see the Lord before his departure and he kindly gave me the wisdom and I'm sorry because I had to part him from him forever I'll not be able to leave him see him in this body anymore I am now going to bharik ashram he has asked me to go to the Himalayas and the in the great pill place of Pilgrim still now people go in thousands and so they are in the narayana's beautiful murti is there which is very dear to my Lord they are the Lord narayana and rishinara and narayana they are the Lord Lara you know the creator of the universe the sage who is called Nara intent upon the good of the world are performing tapas a a human personality but he just says he is doing performing austerities in the high Himalayas and beneficial which form for the purpose are performing tapas why for the good benefit in effect intense in nature lasting till the end of the kalpa so he is always doing austerity and prayer for the good of the whole world so that's a great spiritual place of vibration so Krishna told me that you just you go and live there in the body classroom so that is the holy place four holy places Lord shiva's Place and better Narayan is not krsna's place and beautiful krishnamurthy is there there is a story in the book with Swami prabhavanan the founder of this he had the tudyananda Sami and who else two together were going to go to the badri costume Raja Maharaja their Peri OD but so much crowd huh and you anyhow so some somebody came out of the temple in a shrine and Priestly and took them to the inner shine and placed him in the front and then after seeing that the overwhelmed weather and so many people are standing in row but when they came out they saw that the same door is all locked and they started finding where is the priest is a small place is a small HELOC I went there so there are not much place to go and Priests are only few numbers there who are performing Puja every day but when they came out and had a great vision and darshan of Lord narayana Krishna they are with their field and they started to find out where is that priest God it is Miracle everything is closed but suddenly one priest came out of the and pulled them out and took them and they entered into the inner shine and they have their darshan and vision and everything and then they moved them out and the doors but when they came out then they saw that door they seemed locked hundreds of people are waiting in line but but where from that man came how they took him how they opened the door and how they take him to Rina sanctum and sanctorium foreign [Music] [Music] like that face to face with the devotees so and also because I think because of his foreign [Music] yeah so that is the so Lord is still very vibrant living there right type of devotee God plays with them and gives this type of Mystery the interested Temple is locked and people are waiting to get in and suddenly out of that one somebody came and entered the door and shut it and then he had the inner you have the special Grace and then you go and again you found that the door is closed the same way who took you how did how did you enter into that those are the questions because they thought Lord himself came down to show Grace because of their Pure Heart now this said then the biduro was very much grip stricken on deceiving the unbearable news of the death of all his friends but by his power of discrimination he controlled that sorrow now comes that he was the uncle of whom uh Judy Street and the five brothers their uncle was a very wise person he always wanted to give advice to jitterastra to stop this war don't behave this way with the Arjuna and their family you are not doing Justice it is their right give them the right thing because of that insulted and true and out of his own um dignity he left and he was wandering in there like a monk and though he was a King no so he said that bidural was very much grip stricken when he heard all these stories that Krishna left the body Krishna has already left it is talking all these stories standing with the bidura then he said bidura was very much great sticking on receiving this unbearable news of the death of all his friends bought by his power of discrimination he has a man of yogic power or he has spiritual aspirant with the discrimination analysts and discernment he checked himself his emotions said as follows in great confidence to the highly devout Buddha foreign One of Those whom Krishna had made his own Buddha was very close to Krishna and who was now on his way to badrinath and now that is going to Himalaya today is now is talking to Buddha didn't know because he is insulted him and he left the kingdom and then went around the pilgrimage he didn't know that what has happened so he when he came that all the it was great War happened and both of them were killed hundreds and hundreds and thousands of of his friends relatives they are all killed so Krishna had made his own he when he knew so she was very much gripstick and past and then he by analyzing the impermanence of the life and Atman and that knowledge of Truth he reconciled himself and then said please impart to me that Supreme knowledge about the Atman which Krishna the Lord of Jugo revealed to you she is asking biduro saying to udava that you and the last time you heard from him the message of vedanta from bhagavan Krishna tell me what you have heard for devotees of the Lord like you go about only to benefit others who resort to them that means you are only living as krsna said to dawa foreign you with the eye of equanimity go around the world and preach my message so it is krsna's order so you please tell me biduro is saying because I have not seen him last I didn't know the war is over and so many changes have happened in between my friends are all gone so what was the last message you got it from bhagwan Krishna please tell me that's why the Gita is also called last message Krishna so probably that will be a part that book will read it here the same is here we need not to read the separately we'll read it here that is asking with the biduro is asking what message you got it what is the last instruction bhagavan Krishna gave it to you I am very much I was not present I want to understand and listen to that foreign who is ordained to impart the knowledge of the truth to you before the Lord passed away while I was standing Buddha said while I was standing by him the Lord is giving up his body I heard him commanding there is she in the that wise into that night on the bank of the jamuna as if it were a moment engaged in conversation with vidura thus effiging the heart of separation from the Lord by speaking about him and his nectar in excellences no when you love someone you you grieve and be in bereavement but when you find a such friend who also used to love him then you start conversing with each other and that will give you peace in mind you know talking to each other so in this way spend the night with bidura and talking about Krishna krsna's Glory krsna's life it happens on our human life also it happens someone who come on I love someone and you love someone and when that friend is that object of love that person is gone and when we meet together what will be our conversation always talking about him his glory is he will relate your stories about him I will delete my story it happens for worldly people and Krishna is the attraction the lord of the world is the point of discussion and then whole night passes in bharanagar Monastery ramakrishna's disciples when after you know passed away when they used to sit together these two talk to each other like that talking about Krishna bhagavan ramakrishna in this story that Story Each one had a different story you know that not that everyone is at retirement with SRI ramakrishna so someone knows one what happened when he was there someone knows another part of it so the this is the nature of our human life spend the whole night in conversing about the Lord Krishna and his glories yeah maybe yeah that is the God's play also otherwise how we will know all this conversation is going on because of that and that when you speak and when you write down it becomes so big so they're talking about so many uh stories so it takes long time when you read but when they're conversing with each other it happens within a short period of time the king said what is the king king now will go back it's very difficult to go back and put now go back to the king parikshit the king said while all the leaders of the armies of the britishness and the bhujas thus perished that means brishna means the the lineage of Krishna and the bhujas they are fighting with each other all the big war is over but krsna's own family members they started fighting with each other and while even hurry the lord of the tree muttis hurry means to Krishna narayana who is the lord of the three murtis means Brahma Vishnu and Shiva had to leave his human body how is it that uddaba who is one of the chief of the business Commander alone survived now question is that if everyone is killed how this would have got saved and untouched in the war of kurukshetra said because he wants to know that his forefather so how he survived in the war since then said that the king is the parikshit and Suka that is the fundamental point where the bhagavat started the King was cursed that he will die within seven days therefore he was thinking what now the seven days how shall I spend so he wanted to know and think in such a way that last there is constantly saturated in mind they will be leaving the body and that discussion they are coming back in between these that so many to keep track of those you need a good brain so I miss most of the time but anyhow their story within the story within the story and again coming back to the original so back and forth no so now they are talking about that the sukadev said the king parikshit question that when all the leaders of the armies in the both the Vishnu vishnis and the bhujas are perished while even the holy the lord of the tributes had to leave this human body he also Krishna narayana left his physical frame how is it that only Buddha Who and the one of the ship of the the commanders of the brisnikul family he survived and SRI sukhadem started saying when the Lord destroyed his own Clan It Is by God's will it has happened his all family members are killed how because God will that way that they will also be cursed because of their immoral activities Pride haughtiness as you are saying that rich person's family boy a child gets spoiled because he does not know what is called suffering he does not know what is the difficulty of earning money how people suffer no so they become little outgoing so the Lord destroyed his own Clan by seed resistible destructive power under the guise of brahmanas cars and was himself about to depart he must certainly have thought in this wise when I have left this world the best of the spiritual men of this time will alone be left in a competent recipient with Supreme knowledge of of concerning me why he did he can actually because something has come up here look at it something has come up it comes in odd hours every time remind me for an install or something when I leave the world that means narayana says when I will give up my body I am keeping someone who knows everything about me and he will be propagating the message from place to place so that people in posterity will recall these stories and leave and find a path to be freed from bondage that's why that is the purpose of God's coming so somebody should be there say Vivekananda was there to propagate his message his life his purpose how he did but the good of humanity what he did and what he left the posterity what is his message who will carry on if there is no authentic person who can so was that authentic person that's why he says when the Lord destroyed his own Clan and he must certainly have thought of this wise that when I have left this world then the best on the spiritual competent recipient of the Supreme knowledge concerning me is in no way lesser than myself for he is never portrayed by the objects of the senses Lord thought as I was so pure so was so pure so he is the repeat candidate to spread this message you know spreading some messages always very complicated unless the mind can receive into two what is the teaching of the ramakrishna or Christ or Buddha huh you will give the message distorted message no in the classroom it happens in our school college classes the teacher teaches the same thing why so many students understand so many ways and one bright brilliant student understand rightly he gives a plus and why in the same class another boy does not get it because recipient the ability to receive their message is difficult it's different in different so Buddha was pure so he had the capacity to retain that what he has heard from bhagwan krsna so lets him remain in the world that is the purpose let him remain in the world to instruct men in the knowledge of my real nature who I am Krishna say that let there be this gentleman which is called direct it accordingly by the Lord who is the teacher of all the worlds and revealed of all scriptures went to Puerto ricastram and communed with the Lord in samadhi that's all about the lord and there because he said this so it is retained in the history and that we are getting it done written down how the body he had assumed for his playful manifestation I mean Krishna how he achieved many great and glorious things how he gave up that body as worthless trifle and act which gives encouragement to Men of discrimination but it gives only fright to the worldly an animal like men with Minds full of Desire for us giving up the body is a question of fear but in person of knowledge giving up the body is defined Joy because you are getting out of the cage of this body which is restrain your power no and there no other people of knowledge and the people of discrimination they will find Joy when death comes they don't get fearful and those who are attached to the world they want to hold on last thought that's why they will be happy even some some people in the hospital we hear many stories doctors are saying it is fatal condition but he does not want to die he still wants to leave why clinginess to the body clingingness to the some maybe some person some money some wealth something in the material world which we cannot hold on but his spiritual person can smilingly give up his body so belongs to that group so he says that how he gave up the body as a worthless trifle an act which which gives encouragement to Men of discrimination those who are everyday thinking bodies not eternal mind is also changing I should not cling to that rather I go back to unchanging reality so they will be happy to make this Transit but the world-minded but gives all the pride and fear to the worldly people to the worldly people means animal like men with Minds full of desires how he remembers him the bidura in his last moment on the Earth remembering all these bidural cried aloud in paroxysism of the Divine love cried out a bereavement though they are highly spiritual but in human emotion they are apparently was thus blessed by the Lord left the region of the jamuna and within a few days reached the place on the bank of the ganga where the sage maitrea lived so this is the end of the chapter 4 of book number three we will start next day chapter 5 of book number three so this is 36 verse we have read in this way we have not read but we have just run through the lines you know yes as we end our class here today and I'll be a little out of station so la uh is it okay so please watch when will be my next class it will be probably Tuesdays this this bhagavat class is canceled so Court October will be the next class is 4 30 class when your course evening 7 30 class will continue though I will be not here but other swamis will be giving foreign [Music] so now with little question answered questions two questions are here when ramakrishna speaks of the heroic mode of a worshiping ma is that like why does the master call Girish a hero when his baba is more like Shanta or daso Uma it is very serious question of the heroic mode uh who speaks of their own is that like madhura Baba foreign [Music] you can match something of it but we need not know we should take that attraction for their attraction how that attraction can be used but in Tantra there is a different way of worship so they say like that so you think more on that subject I am not going into it now second question is every day and after every practice we have to surrender all karmas good and bad to bhagavan ultimately even good karma is bondage but as a spiritual beginner won't I need Good Karma to help me to achieve Moksha a very good question all at the end your good and bad all is to be given up but what shall we do now shall I not do Good Karma and avoid Bad Karma true there are stages I have two transcend good and bad that's the Atman Atman is beyond good and bad but I am in that not in that stage so where I am now I should give up which is bad which is worldly which drives my mind down to the lower plane I will avoid anger frustration jealousy all the characteristics which are even a good person in the society don't carry so that's why some people can understand be a gentleman fast that means be a polite gentle person in the society then you think you're spiritual spirituality is on the foundation of the morality and and good character so for to build a good character we will avoid negative things first step and when you have achieved that level then then good is not good Good Karma take you to good place he will go to heaven there's also more fun place of enjoyment you forget God remember in our day-to-day life when they did their festivity comes singing going on Dancing going on this Puja is going on this is going on even Good Karma how much you can think of God actually in that mood the day whether we learn more in suffering when good days come we forget God so good always going in fun area in fanzone you forget God more therefore we are we don't like good also because good keeps you heaven which prolongs US illumination illumination right now I am the support of infinite Joy I can get it now and you are interested in going to heaven Good Karma you stay in the Good Karma for thousands of years there and then after finishing that Karma again come back here and again do austere spiritual practice I don't want Heaven himself then you typed it so it is better to go first to be rich to know what is good and bad give up what is bad to be good and then give up good is not good because good is also bondage in the Assamese song of the Sunnah sins the golden chain and iron chain golden chain is not less not less bondage it is much more bondage if someone puts me in a gold chain is wonders but it's cold oh it's good even it is bondage but it is much more bondage it comes because of gold value so it is not good for spiritual life they it is they don't care is bondage is bondage get out of it someone hates you that's a iron bondage you get angry and you get reactionary someone loves you that's a greater bondage it is difficult to get out of that bondage so that's why for a spiritual person both are to be given up and another question how many gita's are there we have heard from you bhagavat a guru Gita yeah as you have mentioned you can just Google such Google will tell you how many gita's you have mentioned normally know that Gita Guru Gita yes so many guitars are there meaning but then teaching is the same for all realize God that is the point [Music] how can we increase our devotion to God how can we become more spiritual while living in this material world yeah that is the all the purpose we are listening for that purpose here when you are listening to this Divine stories our mind becomes pure when you go to holy places our mind becomes pure when we sing songs bhajans kittens that uplifts we read some good book and that will thinking about the Divine so we are to engage our body mind and emotions in right direction to think about what is increased money you think holy more holy talks about it you do satsanga holy company this is Holy company we read the book that's a company of the Holy thoughts Noble thoughts a world demanding thoughts are not bothering or I am not entering into us now so this is the way to keep the mind in lofty thought will make it our progress and avoid gossip avoid negative thinking avoid finding fault with others these are the message and all the scriptures are talking so we should be careful how we spend our time our time is not eternal but we can utilize it in a positive thinking we can also utilize it in negative ways and if we engage in negative way time will go away result will be negative but if one can engage in positive thinking positive result will come my mind will be peaceful more and more and mind will be pure more and more as the mind will be pure you will be drawn to think of God you will be feeling the love for god without even even he will not like the company of people who are talking about other thoughts other other words some some devotees I find they say I don't like these things these people are talking about there are so many things going on in the world no even good things but what shall he do why not I utilize my time for my spiritual growth and that that inclination will come in their mind they will not rejoice some people say I used to entertain all these things before but I don't like anymore I don't enjoy those things so that will happen by constantly doing japa repeating the holy Mantra praying reading good books not spending any odd time rather sleep but don't spend time in nasty negative thoughts so these are the instruction of the bhagavad-gita and live in the world detest all these teachings are there so they can help us to make the mind pure and when the mind will be pure it will run for God you cannot stop it as the impure mind always runs for the worldly things jealousy hatred these that will be very much deep so similarly when the mind will be pure he will have to love God love for God will be more and more and more as the Mind becomes pure and pure and pure is our responsibility how we do that and how we don't do that how long we spend in this way the whole 24 hours God has given us 24 hours equally he is not partial that I have given 24 hours or to you on me less 20 hours no but King to popper the the most wise to the most fool all are getting 24 hours time and how one is utilizing for what purpose that will be the growth so if you want that we want to grow in spirituality the 24 hours how we can make the best use of the 24 hours available we sleep we eat we talk we talk so many things but we are also to think that it is that we are to disuse this time for the greatest purpose in noblest purpose so I think that will help us to devote our time okay Jaima so thank you all for attending and here in for this class we'll be meeting you again at 7 30. for The Shanti Gita thank you all Shanti Shanti Shanti
