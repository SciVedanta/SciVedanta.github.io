[Bhagavatam - Book 1. Chapter 16 - Verse 17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sr-UWqXH2UU)

[Music] the son of vasudeva the destroyer of the demons kangsa and chanura and the darling of mother devaki and the guru and the teacher of the world home peace peace peace so we are now reading on the chapter 16 and we are starting from verse number 17 today and the context was this that bhagavan krishna has left his mortal coil and as soon as the lord disappeared again the dark thoughts and dark ideas people bad natured people again become predominant and that was very dishearten disheartening thing as a result dharma the righteousness he took a divine form as it were and appeared before appeared before dharma and the mother cow paris it was overcome with devotion to krishna when he heard of the lord's loving solicitude for devotees the pandavas of how he work for them as charity secretary servant friend messenger protector glorifier subordinate as also how the whole world honored him then there became a conversation between dharma and the mother earth mother cow so while pariksit is verse number 17 we are starting book 1 chapter 16 verse 17. while pariksit was thus ruling following the footsteps of his ancestors he happened to come across a somewhat startling experience which i shall relate to you who is relating this shuttle the commentator or what you call narrator dharma he saw parikshi the king he is the king in the dynasty of pandu dynasty anyhow uh pandu pandu dynasty so because more relevant to pandu because pandavas so but he saw a peculiar picture happening in before him and that is relating there he found the dharma the righteousness appeared as a bull with one leg standing trying to you can see how [Music] a bull can stand on one leg so the dharma appeared as a bull with a single leg and earth as a cow distributed and weeping like a mother who has lost her child so two things appeared before his theme one is the dharma the righteousness taking the shape of a bull huh aphid is a bull with a single leg four legs normally a bull has but three legs are gone all the good qualities are gone bad bad only so how difficult for dharma to live in the society is a very interesting picture dharma appeared as a bull with a single leg and the mother earth is as a cow if he is dispirited he can sit this way in the back in this line so that you can see the faces so the the earth is a cow which is dispirited and a cow weeping like a mother who had lost her child that as if a cow is weeping the bull is a dharma representative of dharma is standing there and it is very difficult how can you think that a bull can stand in one leg just struggling to fall down but still struggling in one leg too all legs are cut are gone dharma the righteousness the spirit is destroyed and mother cannot bear anymore as if she has lost his dear child krishna so these are the two significant thing as a as a what you call symbol of a dharma dharma appeared the dharma bull is asking the mother earth cow oh graceful one are you not in good health you look a little painted and your face is without its usual luster you seem to be grape sticking are you grieving for anyone who has gone far away so the dharma bull is asking the cow asking mother earth are you crying why what has happened to you because the lord krishna has left that is the reason authorimo has entered and mother earth cannot withstand that and she is also in deep pain and suffering 28 verse are you sorry what is the cause of your sorrow dharma is asking to mother earth as a cow are you sorrowing for me who have been deprived of the three legs looking at my condition are you crying for me my condition seeing that i have lost all the three legs that's why i am standing on one leg you are feeling the sorrow and suffering from me is that the reason or and have now got only one or over the evil faith in the store for yourself in the future of being killed and eaten or alternatively being ruled over by degenerate men so what is the reason of your crying why are you crying because the what will be your fate in this author entered so everyone will be troubled good people will be troubled everywhere this may be one reason are you doing are you crying for that that you what will be your fate you do not know with the in the hand of this type of people or again are you feeling sorry for the gods who no longer receive the sacrificial offerings as sacrifices have ceased to be performed or for the inhabitants of the world distressed by indra seizing to reduce rain according to the needs in the god of rain he has stopped raining because these are mis bad people in the world so stop it because of that or the gods who are no longer receiving and there is no homo fire homo sacrifice and those sacrificial fire would bring food for the gods we do that no when we offer oh my gosh [Music] why do you give that you keep on the fire no and fire carries that oblation to the different gods ganesha gangan and namaste so you are giving shiva why didn't you put the fire fire god is the carrier of those ablation and because evil people are dominating so brahmins are not doing all this sacrificial fire to seeing that their condition are you crying for that or you are crying for your own protection or destruction oh mother earth are you grieving for women deprived of protection of their husbands that means society has become so bad or for the children neglected by parents cruel like cannibals the mom dad they don't care for their children brutal society because of the living krishna has left all honesty purity all love all affectionate goodness has disappeared from the society are you doing for this or for loudly learning imprisoned in the families of depraved brahmanas or for the heads of celebrated brahmana families slaviously serving under the disciple of the kings no or the condition of the brahmins are very bad they have been mistreated by the society and also kings is to respect them that no now the situation is different or again are you afflicted by the thoughts of these decadent kshatriyas the kingly cast who have been polluted by the evil spirit of kali yuga iron age all of the countries that have been ruined by their misrule all of the people in general who are interested solely in eating drinking mating decorating themselves and other such physical concerns and that too without any discrimination are you crying for the societies this horrible condition that the childrens are no protection they women are deprived of their rights and protection from their husband and brahmins are misbehaved and deprived from their rights and respects and the kings are so polluted like kings modern kings in many in many countries no for their own purpose at this causing so much ruin and destruction is all is it for all those that you are crying oh mother earth cow is a repentant mother of earth or o mother earth are you grief stricken because the disappearance of bhagavan sri krishna who has read you of a large part of your burden and whose divine deeds confer a type of bliss superior even to that of mukti on those who contemplate on them because of the loss of bhagavan krishna who when he was here he has supported much of your load and whose divine deeds thinking of the divine sport that convert bliss to the people who used to live and think of him or can it be your mother that your sorrow springs from irresistible times deprivation of your far famed prosperity whatever be the cause of your sorrow worth please speak out to me about it so the bull put the question simple thing that dharma is asking the mother earth why are you so much sorrowful no what is the reason then the mother earth said verse number 25 o dharma who is the bull is represented in bull with one leg bull that's why you call satya dwapara and kali the bull was in four leg perfectly balanced everyone is truthful everyone is honest everyone is loving each other respectful to the seniors junior beautiful people are truthful no dishonesty so all these great qualities are available one leg is gone so three leg the bull is supporting himself it's okay that can be but 25 of the society's good characters good uh notable qualities of life from the people's mind is gone pollution is entering into the heart of the people truthful a little twisting the truth manipulating this way that way yeah it's just creeping in and so the upper two legs are come fifty percent gone 25 25 and then the upper came another 25 percent see the society's decadence as it is going on we look at the society in what people in certain areas if you would look at that this description is perfectly matching of course kali yuga is going on for a long time yeah we thought that it will be some 25 years 30 years no it is hundreds of years it is going on and becoming worse and worse and the so and now the last one leg means anyhow dharma is little you can find in little corner here and there and good people are scared they will be tortured they will be killed they will be manipulated and bad people roaming with all my pump and pleasure and money me and wealth and this and that as if spirituality is hiding here and there all immoral things and all aggressiveness and meanness unkindness is so dominant as it were so the mother right now is responding to this question of dharma dharma himself is gone but he is still the dharma in dharma the society is making him crippled dharma is crippled dharma when the decadence of the dharma righteousness is happening in this society again and again incarnate myself but you know it comes does something as swami vivekananda said the same thing after doing all corrections in the society changing the society he money worked so hard and ultimately what he said dogs tell dogs call detail as soon as that pressure is gone from the tail boom it comes back again so that is the condition so mother earth was saying responding to this question oh dharma in the form of bull you are already aware of the cause of my sorrow mother earth is saying you know why i am grieving why i am crying what is my pain you understand that your full legs bringing happiness to the world but till now sustained by sri krishna so you have four legs those four legs where bringing have these to bring when dharma was four legged so it was to bring happiness to the world majority of the people 99. nine percent people were happy sweet loving caring no like this america what was the country's condition it was so beautiful learned some few decades ago as a country of freedom swamiji appreciated how much see the jewish people coming homeless with the tattered cloth in the new york street and then walking and be fearful about because they are coming from what you call the uh concentration camp and fear now they will carcass and you are running away which which is following you from that type of scenario there come within few days they stood up with their pride in their heart they established themselves they learned anything they so that was the glorious period of any country but majority of the people feel such freedom when i came first i used to think my god this is a country some little accident when i saw how this 911 came with the big truck and these and that and siren and these and that corridor did not know whose fault or take them immediately treatment started there and then they take it to the hospital and they finish my man's life is so valuable and when we used to see in our country one accident happen one person is slept and the driver runs away and all and other people if they catch the driver they will beat the driver into the same condition and the poor guy who has been hit he is dying the same way in the roadside no one look at that side so this is the difference values of life so that was the condition so it says i grieve for this your four legs bringing happiness to the world but till now sustained by krishna i am sorrowing over the misfortune that has fallen befallen the world by his departure from the earthly life fundamental question is that krishna the embodiment of all spiritual ideal all rule impurities sanctity love affection he was stepping on the world scenario and now he is gone so i am he is the spirit is getting lost i grieve for this world 26 verse i grieve for this world which is in the grief of the evil spirit what is the evil spirit it is called the kali after the demise of shri krishna the center abounding with auspicious qualities like truth purity kindness patience generosity joy straightforwardness restraint of mind restraint of the senses austerity equanimity fortitude scriptural knowledge dispassion lordship courage proud resourcefulness memory sense of freedom skillfulness attractiveness of form heroism sensitiveness of heart power of intellect modesty goodness of nature strength of mind and senses the divine qualities included in the bhagavata unperturbedness harmless faith fame adorability and absence of egoism my god how many qualities that's why it is not like ordinary man how many qualities makes a society good you know one should note down this point and how many qualities make a person perfect these are just mentioned see those were the qualities the society the people were having this characteristic but krishna was the embodiment of all this and he restored it but as soon as he left his own family people they become so arrogant so out unruly and they're lacking their characteristics so that is the cause because he has left these and several others allied qualities which all good and great people desired to cultivate were naturally present and therefore never subject to any diminution in krishna the residence of sri the me i have been now deprived of that great reservoir of everything that is noble from the earth all disappeared and in his absence the influence of kali the evil spirit is spreading everywhere i am depressed by the thought of the world at large in this predicament so that is my question why am i in tears the mother earth is weeping because of the passing away or leaving this earth by god himself that's why that that orphan my mother earth become as orphan as it were without the lord krishna the north of the world it is not 31 it is not only about the world at large that i am moaning but of the fate of myself you divine self dharma about the faith of devas about the faith of forefathers victories about the holy men about all the borders poor borders and four astronauts and brahmana fifty-year-old has also studied brahmacharya goddess bharara prasternas everywhere there is so much systematic things and everything is lost i am crying because this loss of everyone not only me you as a dharma and you and also the all the divine self the gods in the heaven the forefathers because they are not getting their food if there is no offering given to by jogners the sacrificial fire will carry that to the gods that is our belief therefore all are stopped so this is a terrible situation going on i am crying for the suffering of all of them 32 see devi sridhavi malaksmi for whose favorable glance brahma and other divinities perform austerities that see becoming wholly resigned to the lord left her abode of the lotus forest dawned by the love of lord and became a permanent resident at his lotus feet in order to enjoy his beauty the sacred footprints of that lord with the marks of lotus thunderbolt gold flag etc used to adorn my body dharma's body mother earth and endowment with a divine grace that excelled everything in the three worlds alas he has now abandoned me who was exalted in my privileged position krishna used to walk on me in mother earth so i was so pleased very pleased and that was the his touch would give me such joy and things now he's gone so that's the reason of my grieving 34 for relieving me of the unbearable burden of enormous armies of kings of aasuric origin and to restore to you your feet you means the dharma you and your feet by the loss of foods you were not able to stand he was born among the judos with an enchanting form so he was born in the earth as krishna bhagavan krishna and because of that the asurig nature kings they are all destroyed and the dharma was restored that's why you are very happy but now again and his departure you have lost them his disappearance is indeed an unbearable disaster that is the expression of mother earth his disappearance is indeed an unbearable disaster he whose sweet look calmly smiles an intriguing speech at once overcame the wounded pride and mental stupor of his concerts in their amorous dalliances with him and his footsteps on my body means earth earth body caused in me a festivity of horribilization in the shape of luxuriant vegetation in my it's a very poetic imagination my shri krishna's footsteps is creating holly variation in my body with growth of so many vegetations etc so now it is all gone so i am believed so i am weeping and crying while dharma and mother earth were thus talking then the raja see parikshit reached the bank of the east flowing saraswati river at kurukshetra so now this discussion is going on between the bull and the mother earth in the form of cow and then the king parikshit the ruling king the descendant of arjuna then appeared there here starts our chapter number 17 book 1 and chapter 17. it is purishit is now meets dharma and earth in a pitiable plight that is the discussion will be here by bhagavan sugar said again the narrator it's a continuation some incident is happening discussion and the narrator is listening to that and then reporting that same thing what has happened in the future so that is the way the book comes soother's position comes suta said there he found a cow and a bull apparently ownerless being tortured by a sudra sudra means a low-caste person who is heartless person that person is being tortured he's torturing this cow and the bull who had put on the insignifica insignia of a man of the royal cast and held a stab in his hand so pariksit saw before him the shocking sight a milk white bull urinating in fear and trembling on his single leg and being tortured and belabored by a sudra on the one hand and the other a cow the elder of all the requisites of that means for the sacrificial fire the cows everything goes for sacrificial fire so the milk is used as a ghee and ghee is offered to the ablation and the the cow dung in indian context is most pure it it is it says it is very disinfectant also it is proven now so everything of the cow is used for human helping humanity to go into higher spiritual practices this time so they which is really needed in performing the jagna or the sacrificial fire rendered calf-less weeping lean and hungry being kicked about by the same sudra that means he's torturing dharma and he's torturing the mother earth at the sight of it parikshith sitting in his gold inlet chariot holding his bow while strung called out in his thunderous voice in this land protected by me how do you a bully dare to persecute weak and helpless people in distress you look like a man of the royal cast but in action you are the meanest of me who are you that as soon as krishna along with the hero he called juno has disappeared from the earth you have the temanity to torture innocent people at such lonely spot you are a villain you deserve to be put to death and who are you of milk white color that being deprived of the three legs and moving about in a single one he's talking about the bull about the mother earth are you a divinity in the guise of an ox this is parikshi saying in this land protected by the might of descendant of puru's line there is not a single creature other than you whose tears are dropping on the earth oh son of surabhi sorrow not you shall have nothing to fear from this villain and oh mother when i am here to punish the wicked you need not weep like this that means he is giving assurance to dharma and the mother earth 19 the 10 verse if all the subjects of a king happen to be oppressed by wicked men the reputation the lifespan the good fortune and the like of that perverse ruler will all be destroyed it is the most important duty of a king to actually is the sorrow of the afflicted i sell i means parikshit says i shall therefore kill this mean fellow who thus indulges in the torture of other living beings so he's saying that it's being tortured by the sudra mean character person helpless weak is tortured by the bullying bullying is done by that so king pariksit said i will punish this guy and i'll protect you don't worry anymore oh son of surabhi who is it that cut off your three legs in this land ruled by kings devoted to krishna such atrocities cannot be allowed to be perpetrated i see that you have only one leg three legs are cut who has done that to you i am the king i am my responsibility so o bull there shall be shelter afforded to harmless and innocent creatures like you tell me who has mutilated you in this way bringing ignominy to pandavas and their progeny so i am here as a king and this is the condition of a innocent animal that means symbol of all religious practices and ideals i am the dread of all those who oppress the innocent only if the wicked are put down can be good then prosper that's always when the weak weak people become the good people become suppressed evil raises sweet and when the evil is suppressed good finds his way out i shall cut off the arms up to the shoulder of anyone be it even a deva if he is found to inflict wanton and unrestrained suffering on the innocent if i find anybody who is creating this suffering unwanted suffering for people innocent people is a kingly duty always to protect the innocent the police duty is what to you know to protect the innocent at least this country is good at that till now for the local people yeah his goal always goes to help the good people but in poor countries you give bribe some money bus who is oppressed he will be oppressed more and the person who does wrong thing unruly thing they'll be raising their hood and go on like like lions and big courageous people so he said i will kill them be he even a god if he has tortured the innocent i will take care of it for the primary duty of the king is to administer punishment to those who accept in times of extreme danger fail to keep up the path of duty or then for them and take to prohibited ways it is incumbent also that he should protect those who keep to the path of duty so i will do take care of them tell me who has done this or atrocities cause these atrocities to your life now dharma that means the bull with one leg he started saying in verse number 17 17 such words of solace and protection to the oppressed are indeed befitting to a descendant of pandavas for their virtues were so transcendent that the supreme lord himself undertook to do such humble service to them as acting as their messenger and charioteer and this is the proper way it is to be appreciated because god himself came and became a chariot of original because he was righteous he was starting to bring the dharma back so i being the descendant of that i will also do the same thing but you will do it is very natural because you are promising to kill that person even he be god he should be punished for killing the innocent person torturing so it is befitting to you again he again the bull continues to say dharma o great king we are not really able to apprehend the root cause of all our troubles for who is the cause of it is described in absolutely different terms by different sec sectaries different sects some russian nationalist advocating say now he's going to philosophy some some rationalist that means who are very rational people vedanta people analytical people they will say that the maker of one's destiny is oneself they are suffering because of them no we are all suffering individually because of our karma so that may be the reason of the suffering my suffering i am suffering because i did something wrong it is the normal idea others may say it is the planets oh what has happened oh sony has entered there and saturn has gone that side oh that has gone this side that is this side astrology you know some will explain this way why this time it is happening to me because of this because of that because of that because of that some say no it is my karma there is one idea another say no no the planets are doing all this there are no work only planets are troubling me suddenly some still others miman saga the philosophy the manga they say it just can't maintain it as karma your karma is the cause of your suffering although it will be it's maya huh it is we are seeing is nothing that that here me suckers will say the karma theory and there are materialists what they will say who find in nature the cause of it all everything is nature no some few have the subtle conviction that everything has its cause in an ishwara supreme being which will bhagavata lila god's play is going on who is more than that of reason what reason can comprehend or descriptions indicate so these may be different reasons some may be saying karma some may be saying nature some may be saying it is really and the root cause of our trouble is a cause described in the terms of different uh there's some rationalists will say that it's a maker of one destiny is oneself i have made my destiny this way others will say me mang chakas that it is planetary now some will say planetary system some will say the karma karma and materialist who will find the nature everything is happening because of nature and some few have settled conviction everything has a cause and cause is the ishara as ishara willed as god's will o royal king please decide with your intellectual powers which of these is the more acceptable point i have given you dharma dharma is very detached so he gave the grounding this may be the answers possible answers but you are a king now you you decide what is the cause of this my having in one leg and suffering so much sutra said o great brahmana after dharma had spoken thus that emperor introspected for a while and gaining thereby a clear understanding of the situation addressed him thus so it is saying then dharma said this and there's hearing that question hearing that response then king pariksit waited for a moment and then he is responding what he responds oh noah of dharma what you have spoken is the secret of dharma what you have said this is the secret and of dharma what is dharma so you are verily dharma come in the form of an ox so you you are dharma yourself and you have come appeared before in concrete way showing that presence situation of the world situation now that it is how the dharma has been squeezed and crippled made crippled it is prohibition even to describe adharma for one doing so in a way passes through the same experiences as one committing it also the the mental and accept bring that light could you bring that like it's very difficult so it is prohibited even to describe adharma for one doing so in a way passes through the same experience as one committing it that means even if you say that it is it is adharma that is also a frightening thing you will be punished also the mental mental and descriptive capacities of a man cannot penetrate into the mystery of the lord's power of maya because it cannot be expressed because the lord's play is going on lord's power is working and that is called the maya is working austerity purity fellow feeling and truth are the four qualities of dharma so these are eternal values being given here that austerity purity fellow feeling third and truth these are the four qualities of dharma represented by the four feet of your bull form so one is the stand of truthfulness another is the standing for austerity another for fellow feeling feeling for others and another was the purity these are the four legs of the bull dharma represented by the four feet of your bull form your three feet have been cut off means udharma by the three forces of adharma so dharma is holding you with these four qualities but three have been cut what austerity by egotism people do in spiritual life do austerity and what they do they do too much austerity out of pride i am doing so much austerity that ego not to destroy the ego but to pamper the ego purity the what purity should be that you love everyone unattached love for thinking that god is there that is the cause of your love but here purity by attachment dharma is gum what is a dharma purity gives love when heart is pure yeah good let me see it will be much helpful it will not stay off okay but it will be pulled all the way back we'll hold it actually hmm [Music] so the your three feet have been cut off udharma by the three forces of adharma so one is society has forgotten what is called austerity that austerity has taken the place of egotism ravana did austerity he has the power also austerity generates power in you but that is for the destruction of good similarly purity period love is purity but purity is gone people attach get attached to their own feelings emotions and low mental attitudes they get cut attached to that and fellow beings by blinding passions that is the attachment so your three feet have been cut off by the three three forces of adorama austerity by egotism one point purity by attachment two point and fellow feeling by blinding passion the love for others love for the society love for other people by is a is a blind person has become the passion for his own selfie oh that means i i me and mine has entered crypt into the whole parameter uh dharma now there remains only one of your feet namely that is called the truth to sustain you the evil force of kohli flourishing on untruth is now out to cut off the food also only one was that the society sustains on truth when now truth is being eaten away untruth becomes so dominant an untruth false thing appears to be truthful what is untruth that appears to be truth and truth itself is mistaken so and and look at this mother earth till the other day freed from our burdens on account of the destruction of the wicked by shri krishna she was shining sanctified and bedecked with foot marks and now deserted by him see to a lady of purity and faithfulness his cow is the symbol mother earth is a symbol of purity and faithfulness shedding tears on being enjoined by shatneers imposters of the sudra origin who have no respect for brahmana so these are the two reasons of a cause of all these sufferings for my so this is as if today's picture the society's picture is there any question come no question has come so i can finish another five minutes this chapter so society always is gets polluted by these three forces vedanta will say three qualities satya rajas and tamas they are always fighting with each other and their friend also rama krishna said they are all decoys one will kill the other will say no no what is the need of killing rajas let us loot and take away all his assets and bind him in worldliness and such the quality will come my god was the use of punishing this man anymore let us free and show him the way to go out of the forest of life so these three gunas so when thomas becomes dominant other two people become see what is going on in russia ukraine the whole world is there they are saying news is that is that what is going on have no power over them no the whole world so many good they are thinking this way what can be done trying their best maybe so this is the condition knowing everything well have as if everyone is helpless so the thomas and raja's dominant shut the quality push his head down and structurality comes up rather than comes go down so this is the characteristic so now he says come conforming comfort comforting dharma and earth in this way the great hero parikshit drew his sharp sword against kali kali the protagonist of all adharma so embodiment of allah dharma he raised his sword to destroy the author unrighteousness there upon kohli abandoned his royal makeup and fell at the feet of parikshit that that man was beating the cow and then the bull that was the kali kohli is the embodiment of the iron age no the iron mentality of the thomas mine and he abandoned his royal makeup and fell at the feet of pariksit trembling all the while with the fear of impending death the kindness king always considered to those who seek asylum with him had no heart to kill kali lying absolutely at his feet respect to him as follows with gentle smile on his lips no harm will befall you it is again parikshit says no harm will befall you now that you have submitted and made away sense to me to follow and keep up the glorious tradition set up by arjuna my grandfather but there is one thing that you have to observe never enter my territory for you are the ally of adharma so you are adharma you enter into my territory disturb all the peaceful people don't enter here greed untruth stealing vulgarity unduty fullness inauspiciousness deceit fighting hypocrisy ostentation all these manifestations of adharma always follow you wherever you are okali wherever you are all these follow greed untruthfulness stealing bulgarity all these negative forces stay with you o you ally of adharma do not on any account enter into this region known as brahma bharta where all are observed all are to observe dharma and truth and where great experts in the practice of philosophy of jagna are ever engaged in offering jagners to srihori the lord of the judah so that means don't enter my territory where people are performing holy sacrifices and things and don't disturb them that is the condition being worshipped with jugnas the lord the god bhagavan who is of the form of jagna jagnesh sarah is the ishara of jagna itself grant all desires allow happiness to worshipers he who pervades everything without and within like the air is the indwelling soul of those deities worshipped in jagna and so all the worship of heart to the deities goes to hari the blessing too from him it says just mean bhagavan ninja mani when hari is engaged into it those who are worshiping to the what is called the clarified butter milk and fire that they are performing the shang nature common omogan those desires which they pray for that happens because it is the lord krishna the god who gives this blessings to come and he confess those blessings 35 suta said what srita said as parikshi said these words with the unseated soul in his hand he looked like jama the god of death himself kohli standing before him trembling all with fear submitted thus and then kohli started saying oh emperor i am willing to stay wherever you order me but in every place i dwell i am sure to see the spectre of your arm with bow and arrow that means i am seeing you are trying to kill me wherever i go oh the great greatest of righteous men it behooves you now to specify the place where would you like me to stay i shall certainly confine myself to that place because wherever i go i cannot enter into any kingdom and whenever i go i see that your bow and arrow is just targeting me so where shall i go tell me a place where can i hide a dharma should hide so dharma will flourish but where shall i hide tell me in los angeles sutra said being thus deceased by kali he gave him four places to stay so king parikh said that you can dharma you can stay in four places those are the places where gambling drinking of intoxicants debauchery and slaughter take place you will be staying in four places that's a good and you see there there is no righteousness in those areas gambling is a trick and that trick entire ruin of the whole this war and everything happened and the all the faith of what you know judish terror happened by gambling only so guadalupe you stay in gambling or dharma you stay with a drinking and intoxicants those who drink and drug after being intoxicated they have no idea what they are doing they are not bad but they are overpowered by adharma in such a way they have no understanding what they are doing what will happen to them debauchery and slaughter and slaughter where their slaughter takes place when kohli pleaded for one more place for him to stay the clever parish she gave him gold as the fifth seat where there is gold in the lust a greed so for that is the source of all form of adharma of deceit pride sexuality cruelty and other additional fifth one enmity this is very valuable teaching here kali the heartbeat of all adam took his abode in those five centers obedient to the command of pariksit the sama putra every man who is desirous of his own welfare should not succumb to these five sources of evil to which kohli exercises his influence over them it is how in our personal life we should avoid that is the lesson coming the society will be good if society can get out of these five places especially should these be avoided by righteous king who has to instruct others in the right living even king should be also following this discipline further for exit restored to dharma embodied as bull his three lost feet austerity purity and fellow feeling and also converted the earth and made her prosperous it is that heroic parikshith that has still now been sitting on the royal throne on which he was installed by his grandfather judish tira when he set up after the great abandonment all the judiciary and other all went for himalayatra for sargo yatra going to heaven he installed this pariksit in their kingdom so he instilled these rules for adharmo to subside and even you know today's situation we can see real or thermos starts there and others are the effect with the same splendor of the pandavas and with fame spreading everywhere that fortunate politics it has been ruling on the throne of hostinapuras the emperor such as the prowse of pariksit the sun it is because of the conditions obtaining in his reign that you have been able to start this long lasting brahma sutra so that there ends the chapter 17 chapter ends so we'll start on the 18th chapter but we can discuss the last few points very important we can do it in our next class also to think about those bad qualities which is called adharma subsides and the author was to be killed and then king became compassionate why he became compassionate otherwise the play will not go on he if there is no bad then
