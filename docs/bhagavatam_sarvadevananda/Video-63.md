[Bhagavatam - 3.25.1 ( Book 3, Chapter 25 verse 1 )](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BJt8mQ6PVo)

foreign [Music] [Music] the destroyer of the demons and chanura they must loving darling of mother devaki and the guru and the teacher of the world We Salute him again and again on peace peace peace so we are reading today from the bhagavat start on chapter 25 of the book number three verse number one 3.25.1 on page 255. here that is the that is due for this advice one of the greatest advice of the Lord kapila kapila giving the kapila is the Incarnation incarnation of Vishnu narayana so kapila and he's talking about nature of bhakti so let us see what is going on here the Son of God says question to kapila kapila the founder of Sanko philosophy copila and also called the first incarnation so in order to reveal the knowledge of the Atman to win the Lord that is the bhagavan though in himself birthless embodied himself by the power of his own Maya as kopila the propounder of the doctrine of Sanko or the philosophy of the knowledge of purusha and prakiti so in order to reveal the knowledge of Atman to the men the main purpose of Avatar is coming is always the same why yavatar comes just to give the knowledge of the self Brahman Atman the reality known God reveal the knowledge of the Atman to people men means the world the Lord the Lord is who always is said though in himself birthless God has no birth no question of death God is but still he is the infinite Lord he himself embodied himself by the power of his own Maya and that is always bhagavan Krishna is the embodiment of sachidananda Rama is what should [Music] the Brahman pure Brahman say Beyond duality and then he becomes that the the time he binds himself into the time and becomes the Kingdom so kapila is like that is he who is the propounder of the Sancho philosophy you can say or what is this philosophy means the essence is the knowledge of purusha and pragati he said this whole universe will be free you are entangled into wonders because you get mixed up if you can separate out purusha is separate prokity is separate prakriti is the Consciousness if this Association makes it appear all this reaction going on and the world is 24 Cosmic principle this whole world is nothing but the expression of the 24 Cosmic principles what are 24 Cosmic principles five ganondias five karmendous five material elements and five subtle elements gross element now this air water fire earth me we are only the combination permutation this body is nothing but the expression of the five elements we are water drinking Earth rice dull they are coming from the Earth so like that air water fire and kitty up this morning these are the five space I am taking a space the body takes the space so this is the gross but when you see in the dream what you see you see there is also you have a body and they are also you have eyes yes all these things no so but how did this formed up they are found because of the subtle elements there we drink water but subtle water not this gross water we breathe the air there in the in the dream body suppose you are sleeping in your body a bit through this gross body is breathing the grossier but in the dream body also you are fancy for breath and something like that there is some air also that's the subtle body subtle water subtle body subtle fire subtle space all subtle so five five four twenty four and four other four other server huh or they call sometimes 17 elements so this is the this is Jara but they all become so much strong active this hand feed these are all matter dead body and this body only you put Prana somebody did and suddenly everyone rejoices oh he has come back to life again this is Jada matter unless Prana the life force adds to it is part of Consciousness this is dead body so everything is become active because of the proximity of the Consciousness the heat of the oven plus they all Jara the port the water the rice the the potatoes the vegetables all remain like that no heat you have not put the oven on and put everything and go away will it be a khichdi it will be a rice nothing will happen it will remain like that dead body dead body and this is fire is somewhere else and this is yes it will remain so this is the Sanchez the dualistic philosophy where it says purusha and prokity they should combine together he put the heat under the oven and that heat percolates through the pot enters into the water and to the rice and to the potato and you put your finger your finger burns the water has burned me water cannot burn you heat has burned where the heat got from the consciousness this body is hot where the Consciousness you get because the heat behind that is the philosophy of shanku mainly in in very natural so this is the philosophy and propounder is copila or you can philosophy of knowledge of pollution you have no knowledge that this there is a conscious entity and there is a material matter matter and Consciousness there are two different subjects eternally existing that is according to Shankar they are there matter is there and Consciousness is there when they get close proximity and then creation starts and if we know it is separate this I am I am not the matter I'm the Consciousness when you are free so that is his philosophy now indeed Salah said indeed my soul is never Associated by hearing ever so much of this great man we are talking about kapila I have heard so much about kapila but my heart is still asking to know more of the greatness of this kapila the most noted among the yogis the more you hear of him the more His science in the glory whatever the Lord in his absolute freedom performed by the power of His Maya of those praise what the Deeds do thou speak unto me so the song is saying please tell me the story of this kapila is the profounder of the Sanka philosophy and who has actually created this ah come to redeem and the wisdom the knowledge of the self to the human being for the good of the world so please tell me I have heard enough I want to hear more now suta suta is the internment in between who is relating this old story he said being pleased with this request for the instruction on the science of spirit Spirit that says my tree the friend of the best friend material said what he said as follows to bidura then Metro said what Maestra said after his father's departure to the forest Ama and mother Raju foreign then bhagavan kapila in order to please his mother continue to stay for some time in the Hermitage on the bank of Bindu Saras so then kapila just to please the mother so stayed with the mothers there itself and father left become a monk during that time remembering the words of Brahma the mother of kapila said one day to her son kapila talk to the kapila who had renounced all ritualistic Karma as as become a teacher of the truth of Science of the spirit so he said devouti said O Lord to whom he is saying to kapila he's saying he was up to son his own son is no more son he is thinking he is Lord he has the an addressing mother addressing the child oh God oh God oh God no there is also the Krishna when he was born we find that there is that mother father praised the baby oh Lord You Are The World in the air what beautiful prayers of Father Mutual prayer of mother is also there in the bhagavat and we may read sometime maybe no that is afterwards but before that India is just born that's okay foreign chapter will read when we go to the 10th chapter then he said that it is Krishna they are praising oh lord lord mama is not praised my name is and his daughter yeah that was afterwards but I think Muhammad is not praised mahama are doing everything mahama has not finished male dominated Society they all go for the praising narayana narayana who is how much they are talking about see not we don't hear much of the loves me anyhow now that is the way they have appeared as in the vision of mom and dad when the baby was born the narayana appeared and that's why the priest and then he instructed take me to the nanda's house that the girl then told techniya mahamaya showed them form of narayana and in mind Ma and the dad both are world with the vision and so anyhow she said then oh Lord I have been in the darkness of gross infatuation as it says are not our helplessness going into the pool of the senses I am all attracted to the these eyes ear nose all the five senses are pulling me down so I am in that condition I am now compared to the free from such longings I don't long for all these things since it Universe by the grace by digress that means oh lord your grace I seem to have reached the end of my cycle of worldly existence mother says Ah my life cycle is all ending I will be released from all bondage now it is my last birth by the grace I seem to have reached the end of my cycle of worldly existence as I have got in you a guide an excellent eye that can help me penetrate this dark barrier of infatuation so I got a new light the sunset Universe which attracts is no more attraction for me because your grace you have given me this I knew bishan you are the Lord and origin of all beings you have yourself now appeared as the enlightener of the world which is overcome by darkness of blinding ignorance even as the sun rises in the firmament driving away the Gloom of the night example in the early morning the sun comes up what happens the darkness of the whole night know is crimson color of the light comes up Sunrise think of the sunrise as it drives away the darkness similarly my ignorance is getting out I am feeling the freedom from ignorance oh Lord it befits you now to be face from me this infatuation caused by the sense of identification with the body whatever we are always connected with the body I am the body that is the cause of our all suffering so he's telling oh Lord now you remove my this last trace of touch infatuation with the body which makes me feel that I am this body this body is mine and an infatuation you yourself have imposed on all the living beings it is your Maya why you are bound you have given this infatuation thinking that oh I I everyone knows I means this one everyone knows which is connected with me is mine so you have given oh Lord oh kapila actually you are narayana so you have given this so help me teach me so it has imposed on all sick I seek shelter in you a fitting Master for those who want Center as you are veritable acts that cuts the tree of sansaru for your servant so you are ramakrishna has said that song foreign the demon the rakshasa of doubt he's got there am I this only or is their reality this doubt even we many people have a little glimpse of the truth the question of Doubt comes is it that is true or this is true so he says I seek shelter at you and you are the fitting teacher for those who take shelter who takes children you are the fitting guidance as you are the veritable Acts what is the acts X cuts the tree what is the tree tree of sanctuary the world and worldliness that is the sanctuary so to cut it you need an ax what is that your Mantra you do the mantra when you think of God that Mantra brings the idea of God no so oh you are the embodiment of Krishna so you are actually like ax to cut the wild forest of this worldliness tree of Holiness to for your servant prompted by my desire to be enlightened with regard to the nature of the prokity and purusa you are the propounder of tuition you know kapila so I am a student do you know so give me the wisdom that's the point he's saying the matter and spirit so prompted by my desire My Desire is this to be enlightened that heart with regard enlightened about what about the two things separate separation of the prokity and purusha that is the knowledge I want to have that knowledge and you are here teach me that knowledge I take refuge in you I salute you the greatest among the knowers of the noble saving truth so please tell me so my prayer says then narrating hearing the words of his mother so meaningful and calculated to stimulate interest in the path of maksha Liberation copilot the soul refuse of all spiritual Seekers spoke his face beaming with a smile that approved fully of our words so now his own son her own son now giving advice to mother see this is a very funny story you know the baby is giving advice to the mother we always go to Nevada to take advice babies go but this is a funny thing in spiritual life it happens it is said Guru Buddha I Guru Juba Guru Sankara say 13 14 15 years old eight eight sixteen by that time he has finished all this all this writing books and Etc so and who are the students students at the very old 70 80 people years old sages with beer and matted law or sitting at the feet of that baby it's a child shankara is a young boy it's a lad teaching giving the advice about to the elderly students so here also mother he's saying oh you are God you are God you do of disease I am in India dark ignorance like any student going to Guru says same to earn Buddha you will have to be saying the same thing for his eternal language for all and not now this is in past and future it will be like that because the man of wisdom his body may be young but his internal wisdom is sold no so that's why because AIDS does not count in spiritual life but in inner age internalized spiritual is the discount that's true not see a young boy maybe he's just going to fifth grade he can teach many of our old timers they do this do that do that no no there are gurus when we are in trouble with the phone and things we go to the young children now devotion it's Genesis and growth now that is the now kupilo is in the response the child has become not narayana and narayana the form of copila is giving the advice to whom to his own mother who is becoming like a sister the devoted child and the devoted student I shall expound to you that path of spiritual realization which leads to the ultimate good of men wherein there is complete and irreversible evidence of the Pleasure and Pain of the worldly existence now I am going to give you so much praise one narayana will do everyone wants praise that's if you are a woman praise the Lord narayana being praised says yes okay I am now happy I will give you the wisdom if you don't praise you don't get it that's why all these prayers in in a say in Catholic charges in Hindu prayers how many prayers are there you are these you are that you are that so being pleased with that that means you are recognizing the greatness of the Lord and you are really understanding his you you need his help to make yourself free from ignorance so that is the purpose and after praising the copula said that I shall expound to you what you shall do it is not one person that will be the history people will follow that because kapila was born and popular did this that's why the following is going on still now I shall expound you that path of spiritual realization which leads to the ultimate good of men wherein there is complete and irreversible evidence of depression and pains of the world existence worldly existence is always a pair of Pleasure and Pain but I will give this wisdom which will completely take away the ignorance and forever never to come back good gurus can do that and there are different types of gurus ordinary gurus give Mantra in the year and you do Guru said it is yours now you have to do all these things powerful gurus being give a touch boom radar and not too much you say hey what is happening okay it will be so that touch can transform give you division so here he said but it will be permanently with this knowledge when you get it will be permanently free from all Duality but vedanta will say no this will not do because you are still keeping the idea of Duality one Consciousness another Jada but to go beyond but it is true when you realize that you are the Consciousness then that much difference what is there it is not difficult task you are almost reached the destination there and with this full knowledge your mind has become so pure and rest of the thing will be natural momentum will force you there no the ball is thrown yeah it it hits somewhere after hitting the rest of the thing to go roll down few steps hey it will do automatic that's the example that they would cut us they chopped our tree they cut it cut it cut it cut it 75 percent or 80 percent and then they run away then the tree falls out of his own similarly it is Sanko if you have really experienced this Shankar that purusho is separate from prokity in the depth then that is such a knowledge of Consciousness separating apparent material things then that limiting that gap which is there that will be very easy to cross that this yoga which I pressed in the ancient days to the races who are eager to hear it the same yoga perfect in all its limbs I shall teach you now so my oh I will teach you what I have taught before always their scripture always says like that I did it before Krishna did it in the Gita I'll tell you again now and the suta means that narrators their function they repeat again and again and again and again huh the same experience same truth so that it sets in the mind we are reading the book what is the new thing every day you get I am Atman I am pure I am not the body I'm not the mind and I'm the spirit what else is there in the whole vedanta but we are doing that yeah after year after year so it is a continuous practice like that so God also says I keep this lesson once but I am giving you again anyhow so 15 verse says it is the view of wise men that the Mind indeed is the cause of both bundes and liberation of embodied beings no his reviews of the wise men wise men of the world knows what has made you Bound in the world your own mind what is the your mind your mind attached to the world and worldliness it takes us to the bondage and the same mind connected with the Consciousness and absolute truth makes us free mind is the same you touch this side or touch that side it does that this side is bondage that's that side is freedom your velcro you put this side it gets stuck with the other partner and then it does bind your leg is bound now you have to feel your leg pull it on the other side the other side of course they don't give any glue but but freedom the freedom comes from here so the same thing touching this side or that side the same mind looking everywhere God looking everywhere ugly the same mind so it is the purification of the mind and what is that yeah in the vedanta text the mind is the cause of your bondage mind itself is the cause of your freedom what is mine what mind is that which is attached to the sense Universe sense objects and that is the Mondays and which connects with the Lord Consciousness God that is freedom if the mind is attached to the gunas of prokity here are two things one is matter another is consciousness so your mind turns towards a prakiti or the nation 24 principles then you're you are worldly your mind say oh this is Jada what do I do with this matter it is the lifeless material means what it has no life of Consciousness gives the light so why I do not go to the root where is the Consciousness I go there so that's why it says when it is attached to the gunas or the prakiti and their products it leads to bondage very simple and the copula's philosophy when the mind of a student goes and identifies with the 24 principles of matter which are all Jara your car is sitting over there with so much of Indian parts and this and that no it is dead sitting there it cannot do anything if you look at the matter this is the car is meaningless now you see it as Consciousness and start the engine and you operate it no your mind is saying I will start and you start the engine and press this and press that and the engine is started working what is the glory of the engine cannot move anything without the driver what is that driving is the Consciousness adding Consciousness to the engine mixed regard car run 100 by 60 miles 80 minutes in Autobahn Road in you know Germany no speed limit go how much you can go but there is no driver of course now driverless but the driverless be someone someone gives addicted that should be there you may say driverless it but there is a driver he says okay I'll go to this address and they will go to the GPS and got even the car will start itself and take right left and you read the newspaper and the car is driving you but you are there your presence is necessary or to give some guidance or to dictate something so who is dictating this Jada world how many parts are working inside how many wheels how many all these gears and this and that rotating one to the other to the gas fill this that burning here rotating the sad rotating days that it's a big sign this body is like that it is all functioning we do not know how it is functioning doctors do not know even they they are so much advance but they do not know how the engine is working but some Consciousness is touching now if that Consciousness driver goes out stop and it goes out and the engine will stop but a dead body okay give up so this is the point that when the gunas are the prokating it touches attached to the gunas of pragati and their products it leads to bondage but when it begins to feel Delight and attractive to attractive for the Lord the purusa it leads in liberation when the mind is freed from impurities of lust and greed generated by the sense of iron mine it attains to Purity and rests in Equanimity being unaffected by Pleasure or pain no when it connects with the Consciousness side or purus Society then I and mind goes away and the signal is being gone it attains the purity of the heart and in this mind rests in equanimity then pleasure comes or pain comes you are unaffected by that then the Jiva endowed with knowledge renunciation and devotion experiences in truth the Supreme Spirit transcending Nations then at this point what happens when the Mind touches the Consciousness and bends towards the Consciousness I and mine me and mind goes away disconnects then the Jiva who is endowed with this knowledge wisdom renunciation and devotion experiences in truth the spirits Supreme Spirit transcending nature so he goes beyond transcending the nation it goes to the Consciousness he don't give he does not give the praise to the engine he praises the Consciousness very simple formula we always praise the functional side but what who is functioning behind we don't know we enjoy all the things of our life you go to entertainment industry you go so many people found and joy is going on but we do not know who is the player who is the designer who is the producer how many people go remember the name of the producer they get involved into the seeing the movie yesterday we saw can you tell the night time what we saw who is the producer don't care for that we see what has happened and how the the gentleman is even the name you forget that the playing with the dolphin dolphin putting the dolphin eye here and playing with that dolphin going down down deep and then then sitting in doing breathing see you remember all this but who did this design behind to create this movie we do not know him that is the fun of everything in the created universe whose creation we don't care we are happy with the creation thakur said that why do you praise so much about God's glory oh God you have produced your so so you go to God not to these beautiful Beauty and manifestation only our eyes are struck that's a I and mine me and mine the product of the 24 gunas huh and its products products are infinite product you know you can you can permutation and combination with few things you can do so many varieties the augmentation and combination the short the the dress how many designs are there cloth is cloth cut this way cut that way put this way cut here then add something another tapi we call Poor Man's dress but in this country that is called very costly dress because you cut a new gin pant and cut it here cut it here chop it here that is it then and hang it little thread hanging that's very costly it is resting you've got and it should hang like here and there and there then it's very costly very new design and he put it one one patch with another we used to do that in poor countries people they have one paint and has become old and it's used they will not much usable so they bring some other patch of cloth and sting it you know but here that is the design that will cost one thousand dollar more so this is the permutation and combination of the fundamental element how many varieties may be there design means all different varieties with fundamental Cube material so this this all this universe uh this Jiva endowed with knowledge renunciation and devotion experiences in truth what is into this previous Supreme spirit and that Supreme transcending the nature property subtle indivisible and unconcerned as well as praketti with all its binding power destroyed so when the knowledge comes you will be seeing only kebala that's the sankutan means onlyness what will be the only only will be the consciousness then you attention did not go to the diversity you see what vedanta says it is Oneness the same truth they are saying it will come if you are a genuine Sancho philosopher then you will practice that he will reach the same goal maybe intellectually philosophically there is a little distance to let go to complete the vedantic idea but when total rejection will come for the 24 principles renunciation you renounce you have least interest for that because same person mind goes into the purusha and withdrawn from all zero on the side of matter then what will happen your mind is totally charged with Consciousness and love and that gives Total Wipeout of the world and worldiness subtle indivisible and unconcerned truth will remain as and as a result as well as proctivitis binding Powers they cannot bind you anymore it is to us it binds the child will be money not understanding that boiling their potatoes mommy the potato is jumping does not jump even he sees the jumping of the photo this is the Consciousness that is doing it will get this no for one aspiring to attain Brahman there is no path more straight safe and practical than that of loving devotion for the Supreme Lord who is the soul of Earth but how will you Attain you need to love God see we are talking about now they are talking about love we always say no dispatch is different that path is different it is not like that you cannot have that absorption in the Consciousness unless you love him why shall you why your mind will go that direction all mind loves ice cream that's why it goes to ice cream would it Go the same in intensity for God when you are meditating mind will suck into it no it is not because I have some attachment there so when it's perfectly it is gone perfectly the mind will come on this side and total freedom will happen they buy that that is the and but that cannot happen without the love for the Supreme Lord that's very important now 20th verse is talking about a holy man you need holy company he's saying you need holy company 20th verse on page 257 the wise say in that intense attachment to the objects of the world is the cause of bondage for the soul all the holy people in the world all people who are aspiring for truth they know holy company ramakrishna said holy company holy company in the gospel most of the emphasis has been given then sadhu Sangha is like childhood meaning when people get drunk in early days before India used to do that they will put some water in the mouth of the drunk person he's too much intoxicated no to break his intoxication there is to rice rice water just put the rice in fresh bucket of water and feed that water rice water into the mouth of the intoxicated person then his intoxication will always gradually actually come up that's the belief I do not know whether it happens or not so that intoxication of worldliness will go away by feeding this Association of the sadhus holy people come to a holy company then your mind will be holy automatic you go to the bad Association his Unholy Association what happens our mind catches this vibration and mind lives in that lower plane you go to the holy person your mind gets connected with that and it gets lifted but that's why a holy man is one who is patient in all circumstances who is full of feel of feeling who is the friend of all who looks upon none as enemy who is overflowing with peace whereas virtue alone has his ornament and who has a deep rooted love for me Capital characterized by a sense of inseparable intimacy so holy person is not easy no that will not do you have to have so many qualities what is the holy person so go to a holy person check whether he is a holy or not how take this list in your pocket and go and check what what are the checking points first point is that person only man is one who is patient in all circumstances him level of patience calmness Serenity of the mind is much greater than all of us he does not get Disturbed so easily whatever happens when in a boat the boat is almost going to sink the boat man is trying to hold the whole husband and all people are crying and weeping and they're holding like that and what sorry he has a Hubble bubble smoking Hubble bubble no tension so people will think what is this this is the pieces he does not get Disturbed even life threatening situation well everyone is crying because if now it sings everyone will have to swim in the water and many many people don't know to swim in good normal water condition and this turbulent water what will happen they will sink and die so they are crying out of that and at that point when you take Hubble bubble smoke relax mode I am just enjoying my life as if nothing is there I'm finished my work and he's having the double room so that type of patience one quality one patience who is full of fellow feeling he loves everyone everyone feeling for everyone suffering everyone's misery he feels for them third who is a friend of all there's no rejection there is no discrimination there if it's real sadhu will be that he's a friend of all whoever comes okay who looks upon none as Enemy No I hate me he's my enemy I used to be removed from here he used to be that type of feeling will not be there in their mind not one quality don't take one quality you add all the qualities together and try to see in one where Holiness generates disqualities will generate in that person this is very important point we are becoming we are all holy people but when we shall be holy when these characteristics will manifest in us more and more and more and it reaches its Optimum level which over flowing flowing with peace overflowing with peace the language is very deep we can eat good holy person but who is oh his peace is as if so much overflowing mother said people say so much suffering in the world I never felt what is called suffering my child I never felt any suffering my heart is a picture full of joy picture full of joy is full to the brim in the heart you know mother is to feel that is the holiness so much peace overflowing peace nothing from outside can just destroy the inner sanctity who has virtue alone as his ornament he does not use other ornaments Gold Jewel anything but his virtue and truthfulness honesty sincerity love Grace yeah and who has a deep rooted love for me and main thing has a deep rooted love for me not superficial but he loves me God the absolute which is only reality there characterized by the sense of inseparable intimacy special characteristic he has so much intimacy with me deep connection with me only God only that means a holy person will be totally identified with God and God only so these are called Holi and Boost number literature says who is a holy man Ila really Krishna Nam Ed holy man how to recognize the holy man recognize the holy man you come to a holy man in his presence you can feel that you are you think like loving God you feel like let me go and meditate let me sit for Japan let me be more praying to him and let me feel the touch of God that inspiration that will come it's very where you can get inspiration unless that person himself has such inner hearts for God and love for God so this is very important characteristic of sense of inseparable see Inseparable intimacy with God they see he cannot separate himself from God and mine is totally tuned to God so other characteristics even make it fake in the disturbance those were those are very um big scoundrels if they see their face does not appear they are so trained that they don't get Disturbed easily they are planning their temper to do next even in that point of trouble from outside University holy man I used to think like that no when what is that then Twin Tower who did that we said have you seen his photograph I when I saw it is so peaceful so serene but how can he do that this other characteristics are not matching I understand he may be holy man but holy man one condition is not all these conditions should be he's percentage is the better closer to the sadhua so what is the cutoff percentage notice that what is the question uh all this qualities patient passion five percent patience no not same percent age yeah question is what is the cutoff percentage that above which it is now we are we we are no one is sadhu sadhu will be who has reached his culmination we are a student when in a PhD course we are student maybe one has advanced in his research for so many and years now and one boy is just entering into it he is also sadhu he's a PhD student and all a student when you get PhD then you are out when you have deep intimacy and you are absorbed in God and nothing matters and really you are established in full pleasure many patience and love for all no discrimination no fear all the characteristics has been given here then is the perfect but before that we are all students Advanced student in a high school grade school someone is a fifth grade boy someone is eighth grade someone is ninth grade summer is tenth grade and then go up and finish the school so this is the point point is that there are people like that no no that sanjana can get if I may get good sixth grade boy I can get it of 10 great boy or 10 great God because they are much advanced than me they can teach me something and I can learn out of them something else good teacher will be like ramakrishna like teacher a good teacher really good drama Krishna like teacher but ramakrishna like teacher if he teaches something it will go over it did that to touching everyone and gave that and some people could not hold it and came back to take back sadhu sadhu Sango Association give them a little touch give them that a teacher is a good teacher no a perfected person but when a student come I am not saying that they are bad or anything but that means we need that all these other characteristic to be a sadhu you need to be a fit candidate so all these characteristics what is mentioned as a sadhu we can take them as a personal practice we like to do this we like to inculcate in our life These characteristics of AJ holy man is one who is a patient in all circumstances point one then he is full of the fellow feeling to a friend of all three who looks Upon A none as enemy for who is overflowing with peace overflowing with peace five whose battery alone has its ornament six then who has a deep rooted love for me nine then characterized by the sense of inseparable intimacy so that he works solely for my sake another point he works we work for oh I am told to work this this Swami has told me to clean this room oh he has done this he said doing um you are doing work for somebody he does not think she does not think that is doing foreign he was solely for my sake in his mind that that son who is just aspiring sadhu or who has established his every action is worshiped to God my sake only abandoned all dependence and relatives and klansmen Performing depending on me he always hears and speaks of my sanctifying deeds and excellences his mind being fully given about to me no Affliction ever affects or troubles him I thought that that is the point more points are coming our question 24 such a person who are without attachment to anything except me or real sadhus such a person who are without attachment to anything except me capital they are the real sadhus it is desirable to seek their company o Noble lady because they are the veritable destroyer of all worldly attachments so we should all go to find such holy people or to imbibe these characteristics of holiness does not mean going to the sadhu but imbibing the sadhu characteristics that is most important because where will you find sadhu and you know many people go for sadhus and they fall in trap many many stories come no don't she here they are genuine Seekers of Truth went and they got bewildered into the messy area huh because they think they're sadhus therefore better to inculcate these other characteristics here each of us individually the characteristics if possible holy people but if holy people who have to find out you will go to everywhere you search and how do you know it is Holiness of course as I said in the bushnava idea that it is where seeing him if he's that much Advanced or you are a real sincere Seeker if you really go to that holy man your mind will feel you feel elevated uplifted I give you just one example not to glorify anyone but as my predecessor was here so many devotees were initiated by him or is to come and Paul and so you have seen so people used to go and enter his room and stay with him sometime and they when they go back there and heart is little pool they do not know what what they may have done he have not he may have talked with my money something else not very highly spiritual also but if people feel something there Sami sarutesananda told him that you are leading a life of spiritual life from your childhood and you did so much practice your life itself will give peace to others that means there is something generated in him he is unconscious but the impact is going there as it is very simple if you go to a person who is very many evil very negative full of negative thoughts you can feel the sensation in presence of that person so it is not that um it is not that you have to be worried about that to find the sadhu means that is also another says that they are established in that level anyhow so there is one I end here my reading ends here and verse number 24 will start from the verse 25 on page 257. okay and now is the one question a group of Swami wrote in bhakti to Sindhu that pure devotional service is free of desires other than to please the Lord does this mean that sincerity is the key to spiritual well-being says that pure devotion null service whatever you do you do think that you are serving the there they concentrate on the temple they think Lord is in the temple in the murti is not a murti but it is an embodiment of Consciousness it is it is Krishna so you solve him thinking it is Krishna Krishna Krishna You observe and with that love you will be able to realize that bhakti so that means it is sincerity but we now extend this into the outside world also he is in the sign but he is no less and outside also so in the sign you do whatever you think how many people think even in doing their inner side work it doesn't work it is a work it is a work how many people think when you're doing the central paste wow what a great costume I am doing this it will go into the feet of the Lord and getting absorbed that no it's the work work one that's really saying think that it is you are doing for me for God God and if that extends inside the temple 24 hours one cannot be in the sign today we'll come out in the world they are also extended the same God you are worshiping so that is the present day extension of his idea but is yes it means that sincerity is of course deep sincere practice is necessary for the spiritual well-being how can when have devotional service that's a very important question more everywhere is me I am serving me if I am hungry in this body I should feed because it is I am eating you know I don't feed my finger but the food I take it goes to the finger if anything happens in the body one part people do the surgery good medicine why it's my body see it is it is it is irrelevant whether it is in the feet or in the head or in the back on the leg or on the hand or the toes no it is me so the other is this whole universe that they see it is me only in different name and form so if it is different name and form I need to serve everyone that is not dating auditing thing that not to think of name and form but to think the Consciousness behind the name and form that is the Shiva ghani jivasiva Aditi vidanta is to to worship Shiva in the Jiva but what we do we do the jib only no Shiva we don't see God we only see the person we say I did so much for him see and what he did for me so is there is no God in between he me he means that person with my mind 24 principle we are talking about meme is this 24th principle I did this physically I did this mentally I supported this city and he didn't do that she didn't do that so what is God here but a spiritual personality it is my blessed opportunity I served myself God the same God who is here it's a dualistic language vedanta language is only one whatever you are breathing for others only your every breath is good for the other should be you are bringing out this plants are surviving with that you are inhaling taking their love there is greatness there is greatness you can see Divine here and there these are all thinking little in a deep sense and this is practical vedanta that's why you have to read the book which is called practical vedanta there you will find that yes every action his service to my own self as I am breathing here I did that's right oh is it that ramakrishna's idea Swami Vivekananda requested ramakrishna that used to please have some eat tell your mother we call this mahakali go to mother and say that you can eat I cannot say that but then tell for us not for you and then when he came back from old mother mother Kali then you he scolded not him he was rascal you send me to mother mother said why are you not eating through so many mouth so many mouth in your mouth you have to eat through his mouth only what they do you are eating through this this is my mouth that mouth is whose mouth the Consciousness has millions and billions of hate your head he said all God said or my head you say am I your God in capital or God so vedanta is practical and we serve everything in vedantic way too so we'll see you again when it is 7 30 and we'll do the reading The Shanti Gita Shanti Shanti Shanti okay thank you
