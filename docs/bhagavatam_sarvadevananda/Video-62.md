the world and Lord of the word universe whom peace peace peace so this anecdote story was going on that cardamom and devahuti and devati got some daughters born and now now today we'll hear that Metro Rishi is really relating the story of the cardamom says sadhu the holy man caught them and devahuti and what happened there that you said it is page number 250 and book 3.24 chapter and verse number one 3 24 1. said hearing the words of the manu's daughter munu's daughter is devouti full of spirit of renunciation and remembering also the Lord's announcement that you'd be born as his son the merciful Kodama said to the high Soul devotee which is predicted that the Lord will be born like ramakrishna born in the womb of chandrama mother so in the um the Lord will be born hearing this this was the prediction so remembering the Lord's announcement that he tell me they would be born as his son then the merciful called them or said to the household he was very Pious lady full of austerities for his Divine Purpose so he then said what he said o Lady of royal descent her name is devahuti oh Lady of royal descent do not deprecate yourself a selfless woman the Lord Maha Vishnu will soon be born in your own as your son so you are one of his under gun ascetic discipline here you are one who has undergone acidic disciplines in the proper manner now you should Worship the Lord through the control of your mind and the senses through concentration charity and adoration imbued with deep faith so the Lord will come will be born in your room therefore you should be austere practicing spiritual discipline and all these things and being worshiped by you the Lord will enhance my Fame by taking birth as your son by being worshiped by you even you are worshiping that that the Lord through the control of the mind and senses will enhance my fame my family is you whose family is this uh oh yeah says that is my name my fame will be known to the world uh enhance my PM by taking birth as your son he will also impart to you the knowledge of Brahman and obliterate the bondage of ego from you so he'll also help you to get out of your bondage of birth and death by the Lord's presence in your room material the holy that says says said started worshiping the Lord who is eternal and the teacher of all with absolute faith and sincerity and devotion he believed that that these are all true so she engaged in worshiping the Lord Supreme Maha Vishnu with absolute faith after a long time had passed in this way the Supreme Being passing into her to the seat of cardamom was born of her as as fire comes out of the fire stick then the rain clouds thundered the sky The Sounds resembling those of percussion instruments the governor was sang and the apsara's women danced Heavenly flowers drained by the Devas fell on the earth everywhere the Waters of the minds of Good Men became clear and tranquil so as soon as the baby was born foreign the whole nature become different no the God's blessing souring flowers Heavenly flowers and all everyone is becoming peaceful joyful the and the dancers the Divine dancers started dancing in rejoicing the act man the coming of the Lord like that one day Brahma accompanied by murichi and other rishis went to the ashram of cardamom on the bank of river Saraswati so on the bank of the river Saraswati there was the ashram of the sage cardamom and then came there and the episode is happening in the court the most place so all the rishis went to the ashram of cardamom Brahma established in his sovereignty new trees illumin mind that Maha Vishnu had with a portion of himself incarnated as caught them as son for the propagation of the philosophy of knowledge of Shankar Kapil Kapil it is the birth of Kapil they are talking out of devotee they called the Moses these are all indicating one one thing we can learn that this this all these Divine people are born by your true austerity and prayer it is not like ordinary human relationship giving birth to children but this Maha Vishnu is born as the says kapila the founder of Kapil sankhar the preponder of the philosophy of Sanko so that's why he says Brahma established in his sovereignty Brahma is the Creator God establishes sovereignty new through his illumine mind that the Lord Vishnu Maha Vishnu had a portion of himself it is not a full manifestation but a part of the manifestation of the Lord so a part of the Lord will be manifested born incarnated that's son for what purpose for the propagation of the philosophy of knowledge being sunk up philosophy um he said as follows in accordance with the Lord's commandment so when Brahma Brahma is saying Brahma has appeared before cardamom the says and he is Brahma is saying to kardama what he said oh son you who respect all seeing the Lord in them have done me the highest Honor by sincerely accomplishing the task I had sent you to the best service that a son can do to a father is to accept his order unreservedly and act accordingly who is the good son he who follows the father's instruction so he have followed the instruction of me oh dear and honored one these handsome Daughters of yours will contribute considerably to the propagation of the species bringing forth numerous children in their respective families therefore you must now give these Daughters of yours in marriage to the riches like marichi marichi according to their nature and inclination and the spread your Fame in this world see Brahma wants to propagate the whole world that is his job creation is his job so the devati and kardama they got first few daughters Seven Daughters so send an and the sun came the sun is the kapila so Seven Daughters and once on was born of kapila hey sorry in cardamom and devouti bahuti they got seven daughters and one son and the son become the kapila says kupila Kapil Muni we call who is the profounder of the Sanka philosophy and Brahma coming there advising them get married these Seven Daughters to seven races and they will have their children from them and that will provide the glory of the Lord and I am happy Brahma said I am happy that you are listening to me I am the father most of our fathers don't marry hmm go propagate the world and everyone wants my grandson I like to have a grandson and a granddaughter like that so here are also the same thing Brahma it is his responsibility how to spread it so he is very happy this kardama being a sage we almost withdrawn from everything he has listened to brahma's request to give birth to the children which will their Divine children will propagate the world listening to the message of the Brahma I know that the Lord has through his Maya incarnated himself as your son which is kapila Muni will prove to be a treasure for the whole world the father Brahma praise the father that you are a good good son you have listened to me and you have fulfilled my wish and now talking to the devaudi the wife she said oh daughter of Manu in order to erase true knowledge and experience the whole of egoistic action and on the ignorant the Lord who has Golden Hair Lotus eyes Lotus mark on his feet has been born to you as a son yeah like like Brahma talking to devahuti the God is born as your child now he will destroy the whole of ignorance and doubt on you also and you also doubt on you also and afterwards Wonder in the in the broad world as an ascetic a leader among men of realization and the recognition authority of the philosophy he will be known in the world as kapila and he will be his Fame continue to be to your Fame also so as soon he will be known people known person in the world and as his name will be propagated all through so you also as a mother will be remembered by the world as you know Arab God or Noah Brahman Glory your glorification will happen now listening this him to kapila maitri said having said this much an encouraging and confronting kaddam and devouti Brahma returned to Satya Luka on his Swan vehicle carrying Narada and the kumaras with him so hearing the Brahma appeared before devouti and father cardama and then telling all this appreciating both of them that though their rishis they have listened to the command but others didn't sometimes they children don't listen when when the four children were Kumar sanatana what his name so what is foreign has been born because of the grace of the Rishi devout you know said I am saying so the Brahma then praising cardamo and devakuti then what he did return to satta loka Brahma lives in these high airplane highest plane on his Swan vehicle he won he does not go in his vehicle every God has a vehicle because valuable thing then swan what you call this one this one I do not know if it is a golden Swan how he will fly I don't know what anyhow very gorgeous that is the description that the swan vehicle and yeah and then went to sutulaka and and this one was carrying Narada and kumaras switching now the bidura obidura now the praise after brahma's departure cardamom as advised by Brahma arranged for the marriage of his Seven Daughters with marichi and others he gave kala to murichi daughter's name one daughter his name is Carla and he was given to marichi who is marichi marishi and others they are the what Mauritius So Married Seven Daughters are given to seven [Music] although that will get it here he gave Carla to marichiwa to Atri Rishi sharada to angirasa foreign [Music] to atharvana so these are the different names of the Sages oh 567 sisters [Music] and so after question mark you have a dog that one is coming from there to show from me okay so so many stories are there the seven rishis were married to the Seven Daughters married to the seven races and in their name that that is the stars are there arundhati star people talk about is the brightest and that is the after question mark you dot on Big Big Dot that is these are all looks like one star another star really like that it is question mark started and they are married to Great sages their name has been given the the names are marichi are three angirasa who lost and Shanti to the heart of atharvan anyhow these are the names of these Sages this is the names of the daughters they are all married stars and this is Bhavan these are all Heavenly affairs very difficult to remember these names are also very old we don't Society does not talk about these names and these stories are not really but that says we are not familiar but one time the India was full of knowledge about these stars and the this holy people the rishis and all these things he bestowed his tender affection on all these brahmarishis now United with their wives his daughters all the newlyweds the riches with their wives took leave of cardamom with a grateful heart and returned to their respective hermitages so all these sages came sages are not moms so they have household light so they are married to these Daughters of and then they went as it happens after marriage what happens the daughters go to the husband's house so they went back to the their respective dishes home and hermitages is alone and they will hit you alone so caught them on knowing that his son was none other than Maha Vishnu incarnate one day appeared approached him in solitude and after making due prostration said as follows the father knowing that this child is not child ramakrishna is not ordinary ramakrishna but he is God so like that he had the father of kapila big to the copila and approached in solitude knowing that he is not ordinary though my child but he is God himself a part of the Lord's power has manifested here so I approached him and said what he said oh what good personality is that the Devas are moved to bless even Sinners graveling in Hell undergoing the punishments of their misdeeds you are the one for whose realization Yogi's resort to sequestered places and practice meditation and samadhi for long period oh kapila for you yogis and this is they meditate and pray to have your vision and get the wisdom what a condensation that this exalted being has deigned to be born in our anwarthy family is saying it's praising to kapila he's saying I want to get fortunate that you have come I as a father I am praising you that you came to my pity little home in this art you know what to get Fortune for us without in the last list feeling that it is something beneath your dignity yeah you're the lord of the world you have come down but then he always seeks to enhance the well-being of his devotees in order to fulfill his words and to spread the philosophy of knowledge in the world the lord who is Ever intent and promoting the cause of his devotees has now disdained to be born in my house so you are born though you are not of the earth you have so kind to remove the suffering of people you have come down as my child although your transcendental form with four arms and other marks is more fitting for you normally you are not narayana narayana means with four arms that is your normal form but you are here like even two and two feet so though you are like that although the transcendental form with forearms and other Mars is more befitting to you they are they are actually be fitted to your stature you do take a human form 2 according to the liking of your devotees because you have taken copilus formed like he says with ordinary like a human being I seek refuge in you whose feet are to be worshiped Always by Lord and Men who seek spiritual illumination so you are a he will be the sank of philosopher so under your knowledge people will get elimination therefore in whom glory is like lordliness Detachment Fame browse knowledge auspiciousness manifest in their full fullness I seek shelter in the Divine manifestation kapila who is the repository of countless powers regulator of all of the nature of prakiti and purusa manifest as time all knowing of the form of the whole universe the protector of all and forbidding all as their self-awareness I beseech you the master of all to grant me one favor now he's so many awards they are saying only to say one word thing my child you are so great you have come down you are different Lords where you are the Lord Maha Vishnu now he has come to marriage my child I have a prayer for you this is the same simple thing but this puranas are like that they go on rambling that is the art of what you call the writers no one small point they can go on talking 10 pages what is the theme theme is that my son you are great you are God yourself I pray to you something you have come down with compassion but this is my prayer what is the prayer I beseech Thee the master of all to grant me one favor by your birth I have been Freed From The ancestral debt of continuing the family life huh that you are when a son is born then they he's done his duty the man has done his duty because in early concept was there that they lineage to keep the lineage you have to keep the lineage down and down and down so if you do that then your pitrine this is there are five types of deaths in Indian ideology you are indebted to the sages and Saints of the previously for them we are here this year in they were in the rain or the gods God's grace that's why we are here the rain Sun Moon all gods they are all gods because of them we are here in the human body no every day you believe in Hindus believe that rain God is there giving rain in proper time when God is there giving all this sustenance for breathing so by their Grace we are here so they were in rishirin to your father because why in what way they have given birth to you you should not stop this lineage to continue so when he has given the birth to kapila he says my duty is done fathers the rain the dead to my father is now fulfilled so they were in prison among the human being that that type of and the other creatures like like a dog cat and all animals no so there you have a ring that's why Indian style is that they don't eat the whole plate after they keep something for this tree dogs and birds to come and eat a part of their meal that is the Buddha ancestral [Music] many many months anyhow so I have come by I have completed my my debt for my forefathers so your birth by your birth I have been freed from The ancestral death of continuing the family line I have thus had dissatisfaction of having discharged my duty I therefore desire to take up the life of him and wonderful coming internally with thee in the intense Joy so I now want to be Monk yeah because I have completed my all duties of light all the five dates I have paid off paid on my debts credit card loans I have paid off one by one so I have five credit cards so all the credit card is now finished so I am now free so I'll be wondering like a monk so please give me permission like that and they say I have just had the satisfaction of having discharged my duty I therefore desire to take up the life of a sunnation and wondered forth communing internally with you in intense Joy I will be connected with you though I am your monk but I will be internally connected with you you the Lord Vishnu narayana as my child but I'll be like wondering Monk so Indian style is so beautiful ultimately taking into the last life of tremendous Detachment and renunciation departure of cardamom 35 bus the Lord said now the boy baby boy what is the name baby boy what is the name kapila kapila the kabila said the Lord said no the Lord said kupilo he's the Lord he says to his father in both spiritual and secular matters my word is the authority I have fulfilled my promise by being born as your son the object of this incarnation of mind is to distinguish and enumerate the various categories in order that the truth Seekers may be unable to realize the Atman distinguishing it from perishable Body Mind combination with which it is confused huh the kapila the sun is now telling his father I am born I am the Lord Vishnu I am born for what purpose to bestow the wisdom what is the wisdom that people will have to understand these are made of 24 Buddhas 24 principles we know what are the 24 principles we talk maybe time suddenly they come into ridiculosopy 24 principles and remembering faculty and then 20 what are the twenty five gross elements five subtle elements five organs of perception five organs of action so twenty plus four so all these they are all Jara in art they cannot do anything by themselves only the Consciousness when it comes it activates everything like rice Dal and 20 items you can keep in a pot to make a khichuri but unless you put the heat no reaction will happen it will not be when the heat comes they start to boil jump the potato is jumping the rice is jumping the hand is jumping it is because Consciousness is behind so you have to know this is Jada and this is the consciousness knowing this separation will be free from all trouble these even sank of philosophy even one follows really if one understands it is all the play of the Jara body mind or all the same poor plus all the hand feet senses organs they may the food we ate what are we doing the yeah we are breathing in they are Allah they have no potency there is no consciousness in it but Consciousness makes them appear like bubbling and react though it is itself one can if you day and night analyze then they will be realized people because they can separate out Jada and caitama that itself the knowledge the vedanta philosophy will be saying knowledge is separation of this Consciousness and the matter matter and Consciousness there they are accepting two truth that will be the distinction between vedanta and Sanko the two things are eternal according to shanku the Jorah the matter is there title of all these things 24 things are here in your stove you will cook something so you have put water you have put Dal rice whatever now all 24 things are put there but it will remain nothing it will remain forever nothing will happen unless you put the heat below the Consciousness comes and Consciousness percolates through the pots and pan and enters into the water water becomes hot water makes the rice rice becomes hot the potato becomes hot the lentil becomes hot soji becomes hot so all these those are Jara they have no power to do anything they become hot and then that can be utilized as the creative world in the world is jumping of the Jordan matter all the matter that is strong respondent the a science has come to that point you see everything is say they go to The Prana level that is the level where everything is pulsating and there is tremendous energy electron proton D is that and the subatomic particle and two the stars and galaxies rotation and this and everything is doing all these things activity what because of the Consciousness behind but vedanta will say not to only Consciousness is the truth what you are seeing these are illusory these are only momentary so you cannot think that they are permanent and you need not to bother much about that think of Consciousness and everything Consciousness appearing that's the another step another another point will be sankh will say that here is one consciousness huh and here is another Consciousness your Consciousness your Consciousness there are so many consciousness Consciousness but one pocket of Consciousness here another pocket of consciousness there's no no it is one consciousness whatever appearing in the universe is only one Consciousness appearing as so much but sanku said no no no matter is matter Consciousness is consciousness and matter is many as matters are many Consciousness is also many so individual Consciousness individual matter they get into turmoil and they create and they create the things anyhow this subtle signs of the cell has fallen into disuse over the course of the ages and is now nearly lost to humanity when he is talking therefore I have taken up this body in order to revive it so I as a Propel I am born now the God lord to give this knowledge to the Forgotten Society the power people who have forgotten this principle permitted by me abandon your home and take up the life of a sadness so now your purpose is done and I am here now I will take care so you now go and take some nuts what conquer the Huddle of death by dedicating all action to me a child is advising father all other duties go and like a monk and adored me only aim capital and gain immortality by total designation to me yeah says take refuge in me um you don't worry about anything don't repent I will redeem you from all sins so take refuge in me so here the boy is telling his father that I am born to give this wisdom to destroy the ignorance now your duty is done as you said okay now go free me Mom and keep your mind in me and take refuge in me and we'll go as the self-evalding spirit is capital I pervade the hearts of all means see me within yourself with your purified mind and you will then be free from sorrow and attained to The Fearless state of spiritual Freedom so as the self-refunding spirit I this boy who is appearing as kapila says I in a sense I my real nature I pervade the hearts of all beings and then see that Capital me within yourself with your free refinement purify your mind and try to see who is within you I am in your heart as consciousness and you will then be free from sorrow and it and attain to The Fearless state of spiritual Freedom this is called spiritual freedom is [Music] I am art money a Jesus easy this is this prayer we can really change some people chant this is called the uh Deva conversation is son am sang Jyoti I am Jyoti and the self-evallent reality and you see that in your I am your Atman I am your real self and not only I am yourself I am in the cave of the heart of all created beings by your own Insight looking at the inner self ish he will be freed from shoka bereavement and you will attend the fearlessness state of fearlessness that is 39. as a simple self-refunding spirit I pervade the hearts of all beings see me within yourself within your purified mind and you will then be free from the sorrow of attaining to The Fearless state of spiritual to my mother I shall be imparting the knowledge of the Atman that will obliterate all sense of agency in heart now you will be freed by that way and what will be happening to my mother devotee she will ask me established in the knowledge I will keep bestow on her the knowledge to my mother I shall be imparting the knowledge of the Atman and that will obliterate all sense of agency in heart by means of that she will be able to overcome some sorrow and attain Bliss no matro my mind will be mother will be liberated my father you also will be liberated think of me I'll take care of it and I'll remove the darkness of my mother's mind don't think that I'm I'm not caring about mother devouti so I'll take care of her also and give also be free now saying so Metro again narrating the story being thus directed by Copilot circum ambureted copila prostrated him before him and set up to some solitary place as a son Nation so being thus directed by copilot boy to copila was born Who is the prajapati huh so circum ability to copila then prostrate in himself before him and set up in a solitary place of sannasu his father left for that completely detached and Silent that Sage wandered all over the world having giving up home and ritual worship and depending depending only on Atman giving a picture of the time of this this story that that you do your perform your duties in the up to third stage but when you become Monk you have no other ritual while he was in home there are rituals every day you have to have some fire sacrificial fire but when you are in the wondering this wondering most and I'm not needed that's why this is there they're called their duties as as ritualistic worshipers that drops away moms don't do because monks will be only thinking of who are they the Atman they are there so completely detest and silent that says wandered all over the world and giving up home and also giving up ritual worship and depending on the other Atman that is the sadness is like 43 to 46 verses with the help of one pointed devotion he United his mind with Brahman who Reveals All the gunas of prakriti but is beyond them so when he was wondering with the help of his one-pointed devotion his father talking about the father the sage kardama he giving up everything with the help of one pointed devotion he United his mind with Brahman let me see meditated and went deep into the consciousness of the Brahman and that brahmana reveals the gunas of prokity the what are the qualities of the prokity that means this knowledge that these are these are consciousness and what is beyond but he is beyond them hmm purusha prakriti ishara is beyond so he's saying Beyond and who is outside the relation of course an effect in display of Duality there is cause and effect but it is this place where Beyond duality without the sense of I and mine having overcome repairs of opposites like heat and cold even cited seeing the same Atman everywhere endowed with an intellect calm and withdrawn and the mind that peace like ocean which is waves at rest he United in utter devotion with vasudeva the Supreme Lord the all-knowing and all behinding being an attend to him and became freed from all bondage he saw the capital self he saw the cell the Supreme Lord in all means and all beings as residing in the bhagavan the soul apart so now the father with the help of one pointed devotion he United his mind thinking of Brahman Within and no Brahman who is Brahman who Reveals All the gunas whose light reveals that it is all the play of the gunas going on let's say gita's very important verse we get involved into it that's why we get so much upset all the 24 principles in acting with the other this world drama is going on to you and nothing Consciousness does not do anything it is there what the heat does he does not do anything when the heat penetrates into everything they function their own way each one functions differently as the machine electricity but electricity does electricity is there is light because the village City is one type of manifestation that is heat because of electricity there is cool because of electricity there is a movement or a motion of a fan of the village City your computer is working because of electricity but what electricity does it only is so God is Brahman is so he attend to that knowledge the father by contemplating inside and becoming a Wandering mom understood this that Brahman who reveals who Reveals All the gunas unless if the Consciousness is withdrawn everything becomes meaningless the light will be light bulb will not be bear of any meaning the big turbine will stop the big machine will function this no you say oh in this deep cold in Boston and the light went up and its people are suffering so much in severe cold machine is there what machine will do unless the Consciousness is there so Consciousness is a must and he understood that he is the separate Trump the material material will be there machine will remain 24 principle will live in but it will not function unless Consciousness is added so you understand the priority importance of the Consciousness so when you know it is consciousness that is Brahman separate from the qualities and that Brahman which outside the relationship cause and effect everything is under the amount of cause and effect but Brahman is beyond cause and Beyond effect without a sense of I and mine having overcome the pairs of opposites like heat and cold even and then and become even excited everywhere from a darshan huh like he even cited seeing the same Atman everywhere endowed with an intellect this intellect calm and withdrawn and the mind at peace like an ocean which is waves at rest he United the utter devotion with vasudeva the Supreme Lord under all knowing and all pervading being so with past Devotion to the narayana the supports permitting Lord in all knowing Lord he attained to him he attend to him the Kapil the they called the message attend to him age Capital to that reality and then freed from all one days and makes himself free then he becomes free from all bondage he saw the cell the Supreme Lord in all beings so argue upanishad says he who sees me the Lord in everyone and in me he sees the whole world Gita 11th chapter and verse chapter 10th chapter 10 10 11 you will find 11 chapter in the Lord whole world and 10 chapters saying everywhere it is he so he said that became the state he saw the cell the Supreme Lord in all beings and all beings as residing in the bhagavan the soul of all freed from attachment and antagonism seeing the same Atman everywhere endowed with Devotion to the Lord he attend to the state due to those United in state due to those United with him in Supreme devotion so that way he reached this salvation that is the end of this chapter 20 4. so we'll be on chapter 25 next day but here it is said between atmanam the self servedam that bhagavan the Lord is residing everywhere foreign God's body the whole universe and in everybody God is he saw same everywhere and icha the desire they so a person all gone with the devotion to develop God prakta bhagavati bhagavati negoti means the end is this the end where is this the end where all bhagavad-bhaktas reached that it is and that is the end of the chapter in the chapter of mahapurana bhagavata foreign [Music] now we will have a question I see one question and then we'll be meeting you again in the evening so after evening prayer 7 30. question is I think sankra is good to explain the concept of Liberation but devotion is how Liberation is realized am I wrong I want to eat the meal not read the men hmm is good to explain the concept of liberation you cannot say that sanku is only the good for explaining the concept it is a concept explanation an explanation if you take seriously then you know it is Jara body is your mind is said 24 principle they are Jara if you really everyday meditate on this everything is Jara here is the Consciousness behind automatically what will happen the knowledge will bloom in the heart the separation will automatically be convinced in the mind day by day day by day and then you will see the Consciousness only and that's the conclusion I hear that that that that father he experienced ultimately she ultimately experienced what experienced in him in God everything and everywhere the presence of that God consciousness so devotion is how to how Liberation is there is good idea devotional practice is good God does everything but Sanko itself also is a called darshan darshan means is a vision it gives an experience in a level if one follows that very sincerely they will reach a hype state of experience that everything is matter we are talking early they will be convinced in that and it's permitted by one Consciousness and many Consciousness versus one conscious but as you of course it is true also the devotional practice is good to make it more strong okay thank you so see you then again 7 30 Jaima Om Shanti Shanti Shanti
