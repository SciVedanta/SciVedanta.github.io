[Bhagavatam - 1.11. 1 - 39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ANf79TCXPg)

[Music] [Music] who is the son of vasudeva and the darling of mother devaki the guru of the world and the source of eternal joy and bliss my salutations to see krishna home peace peace peace be unto us all so we have seen that bhagavan krishna is now after the war is over he is coming back to his own kingdom and that is in the dwarka eastern side of india and when he is coming his own all krishna arjuna arjuna is gone already they are killed in the war so after the after the war krishna prepares to depart for this and he meet bhisma in the bed when he was dying and give him the air and gave him the the praise the krishna the praise about bismuth praise the glory of bhagavan the great personality in the mahabharata then the krishna arrived came became this u.s mother kunti she had wonderful praise about krishna that we have read and bhisma then left his body after praising krishna then he was getting ready to come to dwarka and the last chapter we read the hymn of city women when krishna is coming back to his own kingdom the all the devoted spiritual ladies they started praising krishna in a high way that was the chapter number 10. today we are on chapter 11 and here we find that krishna has already arrived in the city and his deception is going on by everybody krishna is a loving person for everyone in the world whether in this country or that country his own kingdom or outside and in krishna then what happened when he came to the entering into the city the krishna that 11th chapter we are on the reading today book 1 chapter 11 verse number 1 on page 48 so shri krishna arrived arrival and this reception that is the chapter sub-chapter suta said what who is the suta again sutra is the narrator who who is narrating this great story for us suta said reaching his own land of anartha anarthan superb means what i don't know but he came back to his own kingdom the lord sounded his divine conch in those days arrival was declared by beating up drums like kings when they come back or depart no so we that is the the whole city will know so he himself played his conch shell and that was called pancho janna is the name of that to ashrae is the grief of his people caused by his long absence a people in the country his own city and his own kingdom they are very much depressed because they have not seen krishna for such a long time when krishna went into to help the arjuna in the mahabharata war so when he came back he himself then sounded the conch shell itself white in color but rendered slightly crimson when applied to the rubbing lips of the lord the conch on being held in his lotus like hand his whole sounded like looked like a raja hamsa calling from amidst a cluster of lotus flowers this is baso vaso is a wonderful person he's a great poet so his imaginative words are very poetic expression his hand is like a lotus no it looks like crimson and color and this and that so these are all his poetic touch to the krishnas playing the the sound of the conch actually is such pure so it what it did it drove away all fear from the minds of men people were grieving they are afraid to lose krishna but all these they drove away all fear from the minds of men was the signal for inhabitants of the country to assemble in large numbers to receive their lord so in the early days that was the style when gathering and they used to do with a kettle drum and kettle and beating up the drums and people will come around that was the style in ancient all the civilization they when they uh try started to announce anything and there are drummers they will go and they will beat the drama in a village and all people will gather and then this is the announcement from government they used to say similarly they here if krishna played the conchshell and that the city the people of this city they are happy and then they assemble together as people greet the rising sun by waving before it an auspicious lighted lamp the citizens of this place with bright faces emotions charged words and various kinds of offering in hand extended a cordial reception to him who is ever satisfied with his own blissful essence who has no desire of his own and with the father and friend and protector of all so they all assembled to see krishna and they came with their gifts little gifts whatever they can collect quickly so they are all for krishna but krishna himself he does not care a care does not mean that he has no inner feeling of receiving praise or wealth or gifts that's why parallelly basho is giving the character of krishna if someone gives ordinary people some praise hundreds of people assemble around him what happens ordinary people becomes highly elated out of pride and yeah but krishna is who he says that he is satisfied with his own bliss krishna does not need anyone's grace because he is always he knows who is he he is established in his own bliss even the jivan muktas when they realized people live in the world they don't care for our praise or blame whether people praise or whether people blame it nothing nothing happens for them and nothing it changes their mood so see krishna does not want so he has no desire of his own and who is krishna krishna is the father friend and protector of all that is the lord of the universe and as a king he is like a father figure for the subjects he's like a brother to give as brother gives protection his father gives protection so he became the protector of all he has nothing he does not expect anything but he become the witness we talk about witness consciousness and all these things here how witness is manifested in the life of a personality this is the call your real vedanta that's why we go to meditate on krishna or ramakrishna like that hour is talk and if someone praises me i'll be very highly elated no if someone says something wrong not right then immediately my my my face will be black and emotionally disturbed no but he's not he is established in his own self krishna he does not need anything people are doing okay that's their their part but he himself is free from all entangled means and at the same time he is the protector people feel that our protector has come our father has come and our guardian has come who will help us to live happily in the lord and we missed him that is very difficult to see in the world how many people said i miss you they say i miss you in the speech a figurative word no really you feel the mess you miss here oh that's a touch of only divinity can attract that type of feeling we miss that's why that's why that is the point i am saying he is the ideal of sannas krishna is the ideal of monastic life no detached and then from him no one feels fear and he gives rather fearlessness the speed of fearlessness that's called vedantana we are vedaal and vedanti is what fearlessness not arrogance i am such and such what that type of fearlessness with the gone people have gone here they are fearless sometimes no not that type of fearlessness but fearlessness being established in the divine self anyhow so all these people assembled around imagination that krishna is coming out from this um and came to dwarka his own kingdom he blew the conch shell in his hand and bright face detached outlook like a shining spiritual personality he stood there and people all gushed around him and with presentation and praise they all assembled that is because you are fearful because you have your weak minds but those who have no fear they don't feel fear fearful that they the swami those who served him day and night they are not fearful you see that his attendant sami khali brahmana said he is to freely talk to him why should be fearful fear is in me they give fearlessness but you are to be ready to receive the fearlessness no anyone can give you some money are you fit for actually i i am holding that that's why it is said some ibrahimovic asked oh mara gave all these things to you what about us then he said i i can give you can you hold it if you are not prepared your nuts are not ready if i give that touch then you will get overwhelmed then you'll lose your brain you need to be prepared for no so prepare yourself that's the point they said the the people of the uh palace or or the kingdom they came and oh master salutation to your lotus feet number six which even brahma and indra worship which is a support for those who seek the supreme good because you are the only one over whom time his control who controls even brahma and others exalted beings has no sway that praise the ordinary town people and they gathered and they say that salutation to you and your lotus feet and what is your feet feet means not the physical fit if it means the abode you're about taking refuge at your at you so even brahma and indra they worship when a creator god they destroy god sustain our god they all bow down to you you are narayana and your feet means your abode support for those who have the supreme good because you are the good only as christ said why do you say tell me good and god is only good no so here he says that that everyone takes refuge in you they ever good over whom time has no control everything is controlled by time everyone is born in time he grows to a youth and he goes to the maturity and then declines into the old age and old as to decline to he click click click click click it goes on time it controls everything the sun the moon the stars it's coming in the existence it's destruction in the everything is controlled by time but you are beyond time that's why vedanta it is said the truth is timeless beginningless endless timeless spaceless time space condition this theory beyond that's the brahmana is called see when you say krishna you have to understand you are not talking about a man krishna who dances only when you say ramakrishna is don't think that the ramakrishna the man who is only you see that feature of the human personality he is that reality it has taken out of compassion has taken a human form only to draw us towards that infinite reality then with a charm comes no when god takes a human body it becomes so attractive people rush for his vision and people get purified by looking at that because we live in the level of duality time space condition and in this condition and creation there are good and bad and thomas rajas he is the extreme pure super saktik reality which is close to brahman that's why brahman with quality and brahman without quality the same thing only two aspects of the same reality like the ocean water and the ice big ice chunk created in the ocean no where in cold it creates cold is called love with that love affection god takes a concrete form so that is the you so the all the city people assembled and offered their salutation to the feet of krishna and said you are the master of everything the time has no control over it who the time which controls even the birth of brahman brahma and what and all god's host of gods and goddesses but he has no control over you you are that beyond time see how it is always blended that's why the bhagavat is to be read from that perspective saguna nirikuna we are always in confusion if god is with form how can it be without form you see you read the gospel of ramakrishna how many every or now and then turn pages you will find it's don't think make any distinction the saguna with with quality and without quality god is the with form without form but it is only one for devotees it appears to be formed you see the horizon where is horizon is there anything as such horizon have you have you ever driven a long stretch of highway you see 110 miles 20 miles 30 miles 40 mile 100 might in the front no straight road sometimes i i have seen it many times he says i see the horizon is there okay and i drove hundred mile so where is the horizon now again horizon has gone back is there any horizon is there any dome-like thing dome is there no it is an illusion so we see the limitation because we human being no in in reality there is no horizon there is no limitation of it unlimited absolute god we only look at them according to our mental state and that is necessary for our spiritual growth oh protector of the world's mani krishna oh krishna you are the protector of the world bring about our all known welfare you are our mother father friend and master you are also a spiritual guide and the lord of our adoration by your service we have attained fulfillment verse number 7 you are my mother you are my father you are my friend and master you are the spiritual guide and the lord of adoration so see that is the beauty of these people they are not ordinary they could recognize looking at krishna they can understand he is the real father real mother real friend real protector by your service we have attained fulfillment so we are fulfilled in our life because we serve you as god eight verse blessed are we that we have in you a protecting our lord for we get an opportunity to see in flesh with our very physical eyes what is impossible even for the gods the devas your form noted for you charming glances and smiles and for its super supernal loveliness in every limb we are fortunate that we see you in human form they are fortunate to have seen christ those who have seen buddha walking among them they are extremely fortunate who have seen ramakrishna walking and looking at him and playing and talking and moving singing dancing with him no so this is we are fortunate these people are saying we are fortunate that we could stay with you nine verse on page 49. oh lotus eyed one in indian style always you find lotus lotus lotus anything good they'll be lotus your eyes are lotus like your hand is lotus like your feet is lotus like you know lotus is a very adorable flower and in this country lotus is not much available everywhere no available little bit but in india you can get that's a standard in the in the in the vertical pond or in the lake beautiful lotus lakes are huh at least every time all our season seasonal that's a different thing it is seasonal but you see so many filled with lotuses no so and let us look like that his eyes are like lotus no so see the eyes are lotus your face is like lotus this mouth is like lotus hand is like lotus a feet is like like a like a like most i mean how to say praise there's a place where the word is lotus so when you hear lotus feet lotus it may not make sense for you but this writers in those days you go to a reservoir you can feel whole money reservoir is filled with lotuses all bloomed lotus 10 petals 100 petals thousand petal lotus big lotus now so it's so grand so he said that you are like that so oh notre side one whenever you are away from here to see your friends in mathura or hastinapur then even a short time looks like a tedious eons to us just as it is for eyes in the absence of the sun he's saying that i we cannot bear your separation you whenever you go away it is like i have not seen you for thousands of years we pray every day no a moments key what is the chanting moon that how i long for the day when an instant separation instant separation from the oh govindo will be a thousand years the same thing these doctors are saying if i don't see you for a moment it appears i have not seen you for eons means thousands of years that's the love for god whom you love let's say yes human love also if you have a love for each other then if you don't see for few minutes then you say ah i have not seen you where did you go so it is like mothers always feel that for the children no and the children baby are moving here and going to play and then income magma become very restless in villages today's society is different anyhow it looks like worldly attachment but it is for god that's why that attachment is pure same attachment in in bhagavata also we find that that attachment which ordinary people feel for worldly things let me have that attachment for you oh god everyone is attached that's a sign of love but sign of love for material object is nothing wrong but it is short-lived and it brings suffering afterwards but in spiritual life love there is suffering planks of separation but that is not suffering that externally you feel believed but internally you feel connected because you are all thinking of god no so that's the difference between human love and spiritual love so he says spiritual love here talking about who left aside one whenever you are away from here to see your friends in the mathura where you were born and or hastinapur the king kingdom where the murjuna and all this water went away so then even for a short time it looks like a tedious earns to us just as it is for eyes in the absence of the sun as we feel really very much frustrated when we don't see the sun in the sky you know rainy day crowded day so mine you know that's why you go to where um that uh that when there is no sun those areas many it is mostly clouded norway and other people suffering depression much suffering because they don't they don't see the sun so sun is such a thing so you are like sun in all life without you we feel depressed there's a human aspect of love divine love verse number 10 the lord who is the lover of the devotees heard these words of greeting of his people and bestowing his blessings on them by graciously looking at them entered his city of dwarka so krishna only patiently looking at everyone cow and syrian way looked at everyone casting his glands giving the blessings to that and thus entered into his kingdom dwarka city entering into the city and then entering into the palace that city was protected as bhuga bhogavati is by the serpent lotus by judos consisting of various clans like modus bhojas dasaratas o baba kukuros andhakas and bushnis who's none equalled in power that means it is protected when krishna is there the whole country feels protected like other kings they have given the examples of them as with their presence they their their territory is felt people feel protected no it was resplendent with expensive legs it was resplendent with expansive lakes surrounded by flowery and varied groups of creepers and gardens having trees that flowers and bare fruits in all seasons so the city of dwarka is so grand that the fruit the leaves the trees bears green leaves whole year the fruits the tree beaning fruits only are they give fruits we normally know the fruits they are seasonal no this season mango this season it grows other season you cannot but because of the presence of god himself krishna therefore the city is filled with such extraordinary trees and plants like that its entrance gate and the road leading from it were protected from the rays of the sun by the first tombs and enormous flags fluttering from the top of flagstaff all decorations made by the people spontaneously because of their overwhelming joy of shri krsna's return when the heart that krishna is coming the whole community of the citizens of the country they themselves ran and prepared gates and flags to welcome bhagavan krishna even if you go to the villages even people have carried this type of feeling i visited many places in the villages after coming over here and went back oh my god they prepare a gate welcoming it by no one is asking them to do they bring their own effort and they themselves prepare the gates with bamboo stick and with the leaves around them and then welcome this way and then the people are standing in both sides with cue like this someone with the flowers flowers no they are throwing flowers you will be totally drenched with flowers no uh as you move not one person two person hundreds of people will be doing that so you can imagine when krishna went back what may be the scene so this is a remnant of the tradition still now those who love those who respect they honor them like that so in that description we did so krishna is returning so they are overwhelmed with joy and that's why those decorations made by the people spontaneously not being goaded by someone no you give okay get me prepare a gate we'll get give you some money it is no they out of their own spontaneous love of the heart to greet krishna they prepared gates and welcoming gates and was praising him 14 hours the highways and other roads of the city were well sweeped swept and clean here you do it in the machine the roadside every week and the machine comes and then takes away dirt and dust of the road no but in villages in early days the road may be good road but dart and dust so people sweep themselves because krishna will come so they are making clean tipped up so the highways and highways and other roads actually it is uh understandable that in this present context we have highways and roads small but it is said that in the dwarka they found big which can carry big cars and other things high that type of road and well-built road and also narrow lanes and violence but it was very prosperous city during krsna's time when a good king comes what happens the money the earning whatever comes goes in right direction no cheating no stealing no tax tax cheating or tax taxation normal people out of love they out of bounty they give no legal so that type of society live very peacefully with a good king and when god comes as a king that's why it's called rama's kingdom rama rajya and it's very much in the history that rama's time everyone is happy in the kingdom everyone get well treatment injustice you cannot and people who are very just and truthful because of the guidance of the of sri rama and and his own personal life impact of that so sikhishna also the same way so the highway and the other roads of the city were well swept and clean so also where all the bazaar bazaar means you know bazar bazar means marketplace bazaar and compounds of garden houses no the roads were washed with fragrant water baba road is not because krishna will come not with ordinary water perfume perfumed water hose with a hose clean like that so the roads were washed with fragrant waters and everywhere could be seen decorations of fruits flowers years of corn and tender leaves at the entrance of the house houses on the way whereas various auspicious objects corn pots of card fruits and sugar can cut it that means every home as if is receiving the lord krishna decorating their entrance portion the door the road suppose right side left side is the buildings for the people of the city but each house is welcoming krishna that is the idea now 16 verse hearing that their dear one was arriving high soul vasudeva krishna's father vasudeva his father his father akuro grossian this balarama his older elder brother great prowess pradhanam pradhan different names of the family members somebody son of jambawty and others all in their excitement of love got up from wherever they were whether lying sleeping sitting or eating and when to receive krishna so all the family members royal family members they greeted krishna that krishna has come so everyone ran to greet him he was received by a lordly elephant with the brahmanas holding flowers and following it the parties sounded auspicious instruments and loudly chanting vedas we do that when our president mara's about billion what comes to any center our brahmacharis devotees they will standing in row no they will run and then take flowers and chant with [Music] so vedic chants and all these you can imagine they're all expert in this vedic literature so they all assembled and they started chanting and praising like that and they ran to see krishna whether they were lying sleeping sitting or eating they went to receive krishna he was received by a lordly elephant and the brahmanas the brahmins they're holding flowers and following it normally you in your style is like some brahmin will be there with some flowers performing little puja they will go put some tilak here some what you call grass and paddy rice they will bless with a special mantra that was the duty that's just these are all rituals whenever any um unexpected highly expected guest comes they adored them like that except them so brahmana was holding the flowers and parties sounding auspicious instruments someone is playing the flute someone is beating the drum all different instruments welcoming him loudly chanting the vedas all women of the city the artists and dancers with their chicks reflecting the glow of their year ornaments came in their hundreds to receive the lord that means the ladies who are wearing big earrings and nose wings and this garden giving the description the city ladies they also came to see the krishna actors dancers minstrels pentecost began to sing with absorption songs about the wondrous deed of the lord krsna's glory and they all started chanting the krsna's glory the lord honored all the assembled relatives dependents and subjects in a manner fitting and appropriate to each category krishna also showed his love respect and reactions to please them he behaved according to them by prostration greeting somebody his father came with frustration when a friend comes by greeting hugging so different behaviors krishna behaved to please them the lord honored the assembled relatives and dependents and subjects subjects in a manner befitting and appropriate to each category by crustacean greeting embracing shaking hands oh that time also shaking hands were there not in it is not special in america they're there it is human nature probably so according to friend accepting a friend with the shaking of hand smiles and benevolent look krishna satisfied all of them even the lowest outcasts even most ordinary people to the highest person in the society who came to greet krishna he reacted or responded to them with a smile with creating somebody with salute saluting like that shaking hand with somebody honoring him with bowing down if he's a senior that's why in the society you are brahman he is god himself that is in your transcendental reality but you need to come to the behavior or you call transactional world you behave as the society understands it no that's why our scriptures suggest that what he suggests that in the three world there is one absolute truth that i am that no advaitam you can see i am on the whole world but not not the don't do that i am the same with your guru spiritual teacher and also said behaving the world as the person understands that there is god behaves so we have to learn that whenever we are in our day-to-day life we will have to behave in the society and even you are a realized soul you should behave ramakrishna used to behave one way with the younger [Music] not in rakhal etc elderly person coming in another way and middle aged people so according to the person you have to behave that way as he entered so he said that the women of dwarka he got for the joy of sight of krishna lined in the terrace of houses so these were people were waiting in the the ground level but those were two-story building three-storied building so all the ladies they assembled in the roof from there you can view the krishna so the women of dwarka eager for the joy of sight of krishna lined in terrace of houses as krishna passed along the road indeed though they were seeing the lord every day the citizens of dwarka were never associated with the sight of the features which were verily the residents of all beauty and sublimity how can one feel associated with seeing him whose chest is the seat of sri devi lakshmi whose face is the cup of offering the drink of beauty to all whose arms are the strength behind the lord's quarters and whose feet form the residence of the holy men established in love of the lord he's describing krishna in such a way that he spit who takes shelter all the holy people sages saints they take refuge at the feet of the lord so krishna his feet is not ordinary fit of human being but it is the place where the holy people take refuge so like that his face he's been describing that it is for the mother loves me resides in in his heart so this is the beauty of shri krishna is different than that of what it ordinary people 27 verse the lord dressed in yellow silk canopied with white royal umbrella when the kings go there is umbrella holder you see umbrella holder white royal canop canopy with white royal umbrella fan with chauri's as a fan with our what we call we do that evening prayer with the that's called chowdi decked with flowers floral wraths and covered with rain flower covered with rains of flower everywhere presented this strange sight of a blue cloud trailing its course with the sun above two moons on two sides stars everywhere the rainbow in the middle and continuous stress of lightening illumining it this is all poetic imagination of byasu entering the home now let us go to the homa so krishna enters into the home entering the home of his parents he was embraced by his mother and his sisters and he in turn prostrated before them all no so krishna now enters into the royal home royal palace and then parents came entering the home of his parents he embraced his mom and sisters etc sitting sitting their son in their lap with milk dripping from the breasts of out of love they bathed him with the tears flowing from their eyes out of excitement of intense joy it is a joy of peace joy of happiness every year everywhere excitement is going on too much emotional outburst then 30th bus then he went to his own palace unrivaled in beauty and provided with all comforts and luxuries and having more than sixteen thousand quarters for all his wives seeing their husbands approached from a distance with intense delight these wives of krishna now abandoned their house they were observing in their absence rising from their seats and discarding all mental reservations they went near him with eyes and looks charming in their coins now that is the description the all from mom dad two sisters brothers as also from their mohisis they are called the this these queens they are called queens these queens were actually when there are so many bad kings ruling different parts of india so they are very bad like kong so who was tormenting the society and other similar such hiran nakasipu all these so he killed everyone and destroyed the evil and naturally their queens they take shelter at the feet of lord shri krishna so they were then they are kept in this inner courtyard of their house 32 hours these ladies full of deep and profound sentiments of love embraced their lord with their minds when he was far away with their eyes when they sighted him and through the fondling of their children when he was nearby in spite of all their efforts to restrain them tears flowed down from their eyes of those modest women due to that search of their feeling so you know it is very emotional thing happening as in human life it happens you can multiply it hundred times thousand times suppose if one loves his beloved friend no and they were away for some time what happens even here you will find that if if you see your friend after a long time but normally i see this they run to each other on a high hagen embrace no there's an in in even a tremendous emotion and when god of the world whom i loved and he in a physical body and he was out and when he comes what will be the emotion those emotions are expressed through there though they were always staying with him and though in privacy they had utmost intimacy with him his company appeared fresh and novel to them every minute of their association with him who will ever be associated with his company and wish to leave him whom even she the mother looks me goddess not not not not noted for his peacefulness never likes to desert thus 34 as the wind spreads a conflagration in a bamboo forest and destroys the same so the lord being spreading by spreading mutual antagonism among the kings whose military power had become a meanest to the land devised their elimination by mutual destruction in the war while he himself remained unarmed when he said that he destroyed the evil kings by himself mostly not by himself but creating animosity between two kings that's the kings do that evil versus evil so they fight with each other and they kill as a result good people get peace so krishna took that policy to rule the country having manifested as a human being in this world of men through his mysterious maya he seemed to enjoy the company of these beautiful women just like any other common man these extraordinary charming women whose enticing smile looks etc conveyed the message of their powerful amorous sentiments and are capable of disarming and subjugating cupid himself failed in spite of all the stock of eventually devices to infatuate the lord and overpower his mind yet 37 yet the ignorant world considered him who is totally unattached and human only in the form as one among themselves attached to the things of the world when krishna came and these gopis they're like gopis these queens they are so much excited and emotional but krishna is undisturbed and people misunderstand krishna is like ordinary person as an ordinary loved ordinary human being behave it is krishna is the same but he is unattached to everything the uniqueness of the lordship of ishara means god consists in this that though dwelling in close association with prakiti the lord is unattached and therefore unaffected by the qualities of the prakriti we get attached to things when we are with good thing bad thing that affect us but the lord of the universe when he comes he is unaffected by any touch of this just as a buddhi fails to take on the eternal bliss of atman though dwelling in atman just as buddhi fails to take on just eternal bliss apartment buddhists don't understand athman no as we do we're all intellectually try to understand sachidan on the brahman i am the eternal witness his intellect tries to catch them but dwelling in atman but krishna is not like that he dwells in the atman just as the pseudo i of man that's the ahamkar considers the witness i israel as involved and identified with all modifications so these women who are ignorant of the real nature of krishna their husband looked upon him as an uh luxurious man under their thumb in the privacy so they behave like a human being that is the point these ladies they may understand or not but shri krishna is far above detached and unattached all the time so this is you know questions yes so here ends the chapter 11 and we'll be reading the chapter 12th chapter next time last verse in last verse number is number last means chapter ends 39 now 39 i think yes 39 39 that means 11 dot 1 to 11.39 that is the end of chapter so this is the description how krishna came back and how he was greeted by his citizens the subjects of the country by his own family members how the city decorated for his arrival and how these people were close circle people how they loved and how they a filled the presence of god in it's very sometimes this bhagavata is very difficult because their descriptions comes uh um descriptions come in a human language the mostly uh human emotions come in our mind and we think that krishna is like ordinary this love is human love it language is the same but if we forget it is divine why krishna is only one if there are sixteen thousand devotees they feel the connection here and they feel the joy is it human love or it is divine love huh so this is the point to understand when we read this bhagavata that's why absolute pure mind is needed to read the bhagavat otherwise we'll make krishna like an ordinary person who is addicted to lust or lustfulness and all the behaviors as a human personality does because you know emotions are expressed in the same language hugging kissing these that they become common expression but we have to understand it is not not happening in the this way it is in a spiritual plane it is happening understand only one point you remember krishna being only one we know he is every women are the queens they are feeling that i am with the lord and feeling the presence of lord and feeling so how one person can be failed by all and everyone gets satisfaction that's the meditation i think it is like that when you meditate you feel the joy of god no and you can feel god here at the same time you can also feel god everyone can feel god and these are very highly evolved spiritual people they have the fortune to see god i we hear the ramakrishna when he used to go to some place people used to get highly charged with emotions spiritual emotions their mind would be lifted together you know so and srinam krishna's life also we hear that when he was in the in uh in jairumati kamatpukur he used to go the village people village ladies women of all different levels they used to come and rush whenever he is there lightering around him and and if they don't see one day one morning for some hours they will be restless they will come to ramakrishna's home and inquire one of the ladies will come and then they will say we are all waiting please come and then he you know suddenly we'll go there and make them all spiritually charged so to understand the play this bhagavat human expressions will be occasionally we can hear those words but those are to understood in a spiritual sense okay so now we find there is a question what are your thoughts on iskcon nothing they are wonderful because they love god in the sing and dance in the name of krishna but only one thing this is that uh they think krishna is the only way but we think the krishna is god as also rama is god we also think christ is god we also think buddha is god in human incarnation they come and they always the one person god takes different shapes and forms in different ages to help us to redeem us but one god takes the different costumes in different times so that is the difference and they emphasize the bhakti path and that's good that's necessary we also follow that but because that is focused only on bhakti aspect they don't take any other aspect into their practice more important so they pay only you get up in the morning take the name of krishna whole day repeat the mantra this is wonderful we also say the same thing only they are focused on it we also say hey do your karma in this spirit do meditate in this spirit that analyze this is not the form is not the end as god can be in the form but god is really the fondness as we are getting in the bhagavata reading now and then he is the god he is the lord he is the above everything all these ideas are given which sometimes uh in in in this dualistic feeling it person takes predominance over the principle but we talk about vedantic nirguna brahman also god krishna is saguna brahman but here we understand krishna is saguna at the same time near guna he can be this he can be that but when you are worshiping he is saguna with qualities but they will say krishna is the only lord and if you believe in krishna then you will be relieved otherwise no it is like if you believe in christ then you will be saved if not you go to hell the same type of philosophy because it is dualistic religion means a personalized aspect of god is worshipped so it is not special for any ishkon or anyone that is the nature of the dualistic religion islam only allah nothing else so there is the distinction yes allah is true we do that but god also appears in another form god also appears suited to the need of the people varieties of food is available in the restaurant why to suit the temperament and test of people so we that is the so thoughts are good but but many people are getting benefit out of that their life is more calm serene their family their family values i see many i have seen many ishkan friends who have their family very god-centered whole family that's chanting the name of krishna whatever they are doing their life becoming smooth their friendship relationship is becoming sweet rather than fighting and knocking at each other so i think and personal life and god realization some some some of the devotees were chanting the name of day and night and they see krishna himself lord in appears before him as krishna another question can we become eternal companions of god and come with him whenever he incarnates instead of getting mukti yes that you can but first you have to be so pure and realize god in all aspect and then go on and when your mind wants to go to absolute consciousness you will have to say i don't want it i want to play with you oh lord krishna says you know sri ramakrishna said i don't want to be sugar i want to taste the sugar so you have to keep yourself little down it needs a great spiritual practice anyone can be liberated for us it is difficult no that's the goal of life to understand and feel and experience god in our every moment of movement of life but these people are very special they are called ishwarakotis historicalities are not ordinary people jivan mukta and the vedanta also we have the terminology this is called brahmavir which above them they're categorically so profound in their spiritual life that they are not only known of truth they feel it in every pore of body and can express that borrow burying above that there is another category who can express that spiritually like they in the in the world religion look at that sami vivekananda is a personality ramakrishna's disciple he is also a disciple they are brahman brahmanganis but their expression is so different so who will be the companion admits i think ordinary people cannot be that we ramakrishna said in the gospel you cannot be a companion of krishna swami brahmananda is a companion of krishna shri krishna ramakrishna saw in a mystic vision that child krishna and sami brahmananda young they are playing and dancing so these are extraordinary pure soul you need day and night meditation stepped into that forgetting the whole world it's not i do not know it is a discharges are not created it's god selects you for his mission you do your own things and god picks up oh he will be my my helper so it is his choice god will select but we can have brahmagana we can have realization of god we can be a good devotee we can see god that is possible but to be a companion of god that is in his choice so that much my knowledge says i do not know further thank you what if a devotee does not want mukti but a loving relationship with god will he be forced into much eventually will he remain god's companion in next universe too yes now if it if a devotee devotees nature is that devotee what is happening hey what is happening so my attention is going equip it yes what if a deputy does not want to mukti you don't want liver mukti means liberation if someone does not want liberation but loving relationship yes bhakti wants that bhakt wants to enjoy experience the joy he does not become want to be one he wants to keep a separation to play yes that is possible and bhakta can come back again go to what you said i may be born again and again there is a song oh lord take me in your play whenever you come make me your planet i will be playing with you like ramakrishna look at that ramakrishna who was in the in the early days in kamakura to haul the village boys they were his playmate so how fortunate are they they are playing with god no so they have their good karma but at the same time that is true but that is a special manifestation time when god has incarnated in a human body now it is happening the god can in the your pure mind you can feel the lord's play as pramis promising when his last days used to close your eyes and remain like that his attendant asked oh what do you think now what do you do now alone he said i always i remain in dakshinesha i i am in kamarpukur and i there i i play with krishna when prayed with ramakrishna no that that is the leela going on now but only fortunate people like pramis can have that but promotional numbers is in that category but think who were really in the physical body when ramakrishna was in the kamar kukul so that time he is talking about that those people are especially fortunate you can think but that much different no no no no no no those are all different this is much deeper level it is no question of thinking doing thing like that it is when yeah supposedly supposedly for god is in the physical frame place and bone and that time that time those who are playing their because they are the companions of god now you can think mentally that's okay you are also but great what was that to do do you feel that you know then you are done with it but we are not they don't have to worry about motion liberation is a lower ideal yeah but if i live with him what need if i if i leave and play with god then what i need mukti mukti is a very petty thing that's why their ramakrishnan is to sing that i i don't be thinking about giving mukti liberation liberation can be given easily but not bhakti but devotion so devotion is higher in that perspective because bhakti means i see him play with him eat with him suppose you can think that when people are just a doctor no people are coming giving some present ramakrishna is speaking he's sitting in the audience feeling the touch feeling the presence mind is getting uplifted so that are very special adventure says everything is one not two then how do you explain the existence of god like a rama krishna and vishnu yes from the although it's point there is no rama krishna and kali shiva nothing is there in the absolute auditor that's called non-dual uncreate theory ajata bada and others but that absolute vedanta it is not we are not talking about that in absolute vedanta there is neither you neither me where is the question of god you are not there your god is also not there when how long your god how long you have got so long you have a body god has a body when you are not you are bodyless god is also bodyless so true there is one not two and that not two rama yes in that state of samadhi when in nirvikalpa samadhi the mind rises and merges into the absolute then your little ego is also dead so you can so your god is non-existent but so long your ego remains so long you are created someone is creating therefore up to that certain level it will continue and when your last ego you will dissolve and ramakrishna gave example remember this then probably this problem will be answered and that one salt doll salt doll wanted to measure the ocean god as we all what is god god is infinite beginningless timeless spaceless okay the doll is trying to approach the ocean huh but if really he moves towards the ocean what will happen the cool bridge will melt his salt form little by little little by little little bit and now suppose you're talking still oh god is this b god is creator god is destroyed god is okay now go in going going and you lose your put your step into the ocean the salt doll suppose you think yourself salt doll and god is the ocean infinite ocean passive equation so now you think you step by step moved into it and put your leg what will happen your leg will get dissolved then go go it as much as it goes the last stress my body idea goes mind idea goes i am in intellect i am ego and ghost ghost goes when intellect goes the total salt doll has merged into the ocean well where is the world there is no world there is no me there is no god so that is the absolute nondual state but so long we are not in that state there is god no my question is that his question is vedanta says only one so where is the position of rama krishna you are talking about yeah yes in that state there is no rama there is no krishna that's why look at that ramakrishna said to naren o still doubt he was krishna rama he was krishna he is this ramakrishna but not according to you your vedanta you talk about vedanta absolute one when you are in that level of oneness there is god is also dissolved god's form dissolves into the infinite god takes the form for you only i see the sun little round for me the sun has taken this little form but sun is never little form you go close close close close and mix with him then you are gone when you are gone sun and you become one who will say sun is big sun is light sun is heat who will say sachida these words does not make any sense another question is there difference between those brahmaluka and companions of god bob i do not know what it may be but companions of god means those who come really as we understand that swami vivekananda was meditating in a very high plane where ordinary gods and goddesses could not enter so we know this much our concept goes as there are finer and finer planes of existence in this physical world we see this war earth no microscope if you look you can see so many bacterias fill the bacteria here no we see that you are sitting i am sitting in empty space for scientists those who are working with the bacteria they see billions trillions of bacteria everywhere no i don't see it so like that as you keep your mind in another altitude another altitude another altitude all different things will be visible as your mind progresses up and up and up and when it merges there there is no you no me no god nothing but till we reach we have to move through this different planes so we need not have to bother about all these things my point is that love god and pray to god and get his vision and make the life joyful peaceful let every day be happier and peace that i am happy i am peaceful within i feel the presence of something extra not beyond this physical blood and mess something i feel inside when i close my eyes think or i open my eyes and try to see the world no enjoy that and and move on and on my suggestion would be be deep in your spiritual practice and enjoy bliss as much as you can let all these things drop because these solutions perfect solution will come when we really make a progress and we experience ourselves i am saying something i am saying according to my knowledge no but that may not be true when you really this there then you will feel something else so rather let us all make our spiritual progress let us love god in whatever aspect saguna niruguna love god finnish whether you call it saguno with the poem rama krishna buddha christ or you say it is brahman atman whatever love love love that and fall in love with that and drown into it and dissolve yourself then you know you will say what is that joy or there is darkness or light or anything thank you all so again and we'll meet you again 7 30 in the class of santi gita shanti gita the song of peace jaima om shanti shanti
