[Bhagavatam - 3.1.24 - ( Book 3, Chapter 1, verse 24)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqsWkKPpcEo)

[Music] the destroyer of the demons kang and chanura the dear darling of the mother devaki and the teacher of the world the lord of the universe i salute him again and again o peace peace peace so we are reading bhagavatam that is chapter third book skanda thought chapter one and we were talking about listening about bidura the great friend of the clan of childrena but he was abundant and he was wandering from one place to another and he met maitreya and he was asking about and uddhava he met mudtabo and then the question was going on between the conversation between bidura and the uttava now along the river he has met many holy people and holy titans many holy places he visited and in that region all temples of lord visnu founded by the rishis and gods and then he traveled afterwards so here now they are meeting bidura and uddhava met 24th verse we start today on page 147. he traveled afterwards through the prosperous land of surastra these are all old names of this our near gujarat so rastro sauvira matsya kuru jangala and others until in course of time he reached the region of jamuna river where he happened to meet the great devotee urdhava so here bizora is wandering and left the kingdom and then he was driven away by this rasta and so he was moving around and then going from one place of pilgrimage to another and he met with them when they meet each other vidura held him the syrian disciple of breosphati devoted follower of shri krishna in his war members so they all embraced each other with joy then he began to question uddhava about the men and women of his own clan and also bhagavan sri krishna so uddhava was asking bidura how is krishna how is my other friends and there who and he will be going on talking about asking about many dignitaries of the kingdom so uddava began to question uddhava about the men and women of his own clan and also bhagavan sri krishna bidhiro then started responding to the question no viduro started questioning about the welfare of others so 26 verses are not krsna and rama balarama and krishna who incarnated on the earth at the request of brahma living happily at the house of surosena after having been accomplished the good of the world that means after this war killing all the demons and all these ashuri people is krishna and balarama they balarama is the incarnation of god so that's the incarnated on the earth why at the request of brahma so living happily they are happening at the happily in the house of surosena then he started questioning further 27 verse dear one is not vasudeva a very valid alley of the gurus living happily like his own father he behaved generously towards his sisters meeting all the needs of themselves as also of their husbands so he's talking about shri krishna basudeva how he helped everyone his quality asking about some of the people of his time and then about their good qualities mentioning how are they how are they how are they now they are tasking out how is prathumna the commander-in-chief of the armies of the judas he was karma in the previous life and was born as bhagavan indiruk mini who worshipped holy men for the birth of islam so like that love to celebrate my birthday that's okay so this is talking about prudhumna was the commander-in-chief of the armies of the judas he's asking about 29 about ugroshina the king of the clans of tatus britishness buddhas and the saharas they are living happily then he's asking about 30th verse about samba what about the topmost kharwar warrior then is asking about 31st birth about how is satyaki who received instruction in all sections of archery from arjuna then he's asking about how is akura the great devotee who took shelter in the lord how is bhojas daughters devaki that means mother devaki equal to the mother of the devas how is aniruddha a veritable leader of the plenty to you i hope all others like sridhika charudasna and gada who served the lord with single-minded devotion are living happily in dwarka so he's asking about everyone's welfare and i hope that is judistria who evoked the fierce jealousy of jodhanam by the prosperity of his kingdom now ruling the land according to the ideal of state craft that means inquiring about the judiciary then he's saying has bhima bhim bhim the great wielder of the maze yeah is doing all this thing he is what about arjuna he's arjuna the most noted karwar warrior and the wilder of the bow of gandiva is he ruling victorious with all his enemies destroyed then 39 hours the twins among pandavas nokula and sahadeva who are protected by their brothers are they living happily having snatched away in war they are petrimony from the enemy so 40th person alas it is a wonder how pritha the mother of the pandavas sustained her life for the upbringing of our infant children after the death of her husband the noble and heroic king pandu is thinking about the mother pritha kunti so how his mother kunti punt is glory he sustained her life for upbringing of her infant children because her husband when she he passed away the king pandu oh dear one i am indeed sorry for this raster who has been degenerating day by day see how he has been prosecuting his own dead brothers by the persecution of his children see how he has told the line of his own sons however heinous their conduct might be so detraster is blind so how he is blind blinded by ignorance he is persecuting the innocent his brother's sons etc has driven me away and so he tries to drop me away from home though i am the best of his well-being so i he suggested no he suggested to do to rasta it is not good to go forward tell jadah not to do this but he got angry and so he let him get it through him out that's why he out of renunciation he gave up everything and wandering around the places 42 hours by the grace of the lord who has been mystifying all by his human role as incarnation i am going about incognito finding nothing surpassing in any happening as they discern the mystery of the lord in everything the lord put up with the sins of the kurus for long only as a step in affording relief to the good and holy ones by destroying all the kings who are proud and haughty with their wealth power and blue blood under the constant much of his armies the earth was trembling now the embodiment and works of the unborn and non-actionless that means he's talking about krishna he's saying [Music] [Music] and works of the unborn that that lord who is unborn who is never can born unborn and who is actionless is beyond all actions that means he is the reality only brahman actionless unborn are only for the destruction of the evil ones take embodiment right that is the idea the abu taru idea for the good of the humanity he who has never been born who is beyond all action he took a birth and he did so much activity in the world and to establish peace and harmony so the embodiment and the works of unborn and actionless that one this is for the destruction why he is embodied not for the destruction of the evil ones and the protection of the world from such persons and that is the gita's idea and purity to protection of the good people holy people and destruction of the evil there are negative destruction so he says are only for the destruction of the evil ones and one ideal and the protection of the worlds from such persons even in jiva who has overcome the goonas and the bondage of karma is free from body so how can the supreme being be embodied except for the reason stated so how a free atman saw bhagavan krishna as god himself he came down why only for the purpose nothing other to purpose protection of the good and destruction of the evil 45 oh friend give me in details all news about the eternal one eternal one who has been born among the judos as krishna now tell me about i am very much interested to know about lord krishna how he is doing lord krishna the eternal one he is all the time sachidan on the sarupa but was born as in the judo's family due to clan for the help of the deities presiding over the destinies of the world and for the good of those who follow his commandments and taken shelter in him so he's born to give shelter to the people who are in trouble in life and also to help the other gods and goddesses who are ruling the world in different departments like all the gods and goddesses get frightened when this evil force comes so gods also get thrown away from their kingdom no he will when goes in in the heaven or surahs take position and destroy the surahs are driven out so god comes to protect for their good and for the good of humanity meaning when krishna tell about krishna how he is keeping these are the questions put by whom dhawa buddha narration of krsna's has not seen krishna and everyone for a long time so he is asking when they met together suddenly in this way then vidura put these questions to tawa so now now the chapter second chapter starts book number 3 chapter 2 and we start with verse 1. so sisu watch now the sukharebe come back to the study they say story in the story now we have to go back to the story when sukadeva is there and the king parikshit is putting the question so he says that food doubles direction of krishna's life now uttava is narrating sukhadev is telling that story from the back reference see sukho said 1 being this question about the dearest of his dear ones that means krishna and all other yudhisthira arjuna and this and that mother devaki the great devotee uttawa was unable to speak for some time when this was asked could not say going to this surging emotion that what took him as he thought of the lord and master as soon as he thought this question were raised his ardent devotee of bhagavan krishna so he was choked with emotion unable to speak for some time bhagavatam small tester because of this anxiety because of his emotion he could not say something a voice gets choked so now the sud dhaba they should double even as a young boy or pipe had refused to take his breakfast when the mother called him because he was then imaged in his boy's play of the worship of the lord's image that's a story that when dawa was a small boy even five years old boy that he refused to take his breakfast mama mother is calling for breakfast but he was so engrossed in preparing the lord's image he was not like praying and chit-chatting or with other boys as the other young children play it is not but he is so absorbed in preparing the image of bhagawan god lord god lord that he ignored his breakfast mother calling again he is now an old man this suddenly is now a old man this youth double having spent a whole lifetime in the service of the lord so he served whole life according to the ideal priest by bhagavan krishna what krishna said and krishna is living then said that what shall i do now you are leaving the body krishna said uddhava talking to sarvan puritaja now you give up everything he said i will not live anymore because if you die i also die you are my friend guide and everything i served you like a master buddha with assad krishna like that such a deep relationship now you are going to give up your body so dava said i will also give up my body then bhagavan said no no no don't do that you give up everything tongue to sarvan puritaj you're giving off all your attachment and all your belongings everything body etcetera and all wealth and prosperity then you go back go wander around the world samadrik with an economy in vision seeing god everywhere seeing brahman everywhere seeing me everywhere so you roam around samadrik and then by that way you preached me that was the instruction given to them that's why you do now is roaming around that's why it says he now the uddhava now has become an old man whole life he served and loved and worked for bhagavan krishna and his so he is now an old man having spent a whole lifetime in the service of the lord now thinking as he was about that dear lord of the master continuously he could now how could he now answer these questions put to him about that great personage so he was thinking how can i talk about bhagavan krishna inability with the nectar of bliss fourth verse inebriated with the nectar of bliss emanating from krsna's lotus feet he stood for a while silent and caught up in the full sentiment of god love with the horrification all over his body with tears flowing from the half open eyes and with the flood of god love overpowering him uttava looked like one where that in the supreme object of life so when [Music] this question he was overwhelmed choked with emotion such a deep emotion so he was his whole body was manipulation with joy thinking of krishna and also tears because of the apparent separation and he looks like as he says and his love for god all this made the personality yudhaba looked like one who had attained the supreme object of life when he is so much intoxicated in the thought of krishna that it looked like he is a man of realization [Music] full of love he appeared to be a person who is very much intoxicated in god as if a god realized person sixth verse slowly descending from the divine consciousness because when vidura put this question sudda was overwhelmed his mind was going back to all the stories what happened in the life of krishna from and he was from childhood he was the follower of and some servant of krishna so slowly descending from the divine mood of ecstasy consciousness to the human level who double wiped away the tears of his eyes and began to reply remembering the lord all the while so thinking of krishna he now started telling the response all the questions were asked by vidura sur dhaba is now questioning a response and giving the reply to the questions uddhava said verse number seven what am i to tell you about the welfare of those friends and relatives of whom you have inquired when the son of krishna has set and the python of time has swallowed our clans when thereby we have been reduced to mere non-entity entities in the world is a very emotional statement emotional statement here uddhava said krishna is known in the world has left the body after the war after everything is done his duty done so he has already left because he told you krishna and rudha was with him with bhagavan krishna and he told called so now i will be leaving this body so you think of me and live in your way they say no if you go away so i shall also go away i shall also die with you then the krishna says no no you have a duty you go around with the equanimity in vision money vision should be equal everywhere see god equal who is equal only equal is brahman equal is god so see god everywhere and wander around and that period he made this vidura so bizura then he had already left home much earlier before even the war in the bipur started now he said dude he's saying that oh my god what can i tell about bhagavan krishna krishna dutum [Music] the krishna is gone because of his presence everyone everything was lighted he has left our heart and home he has left this art so our all the glories of the our clan that is all is now deemed it has become as the night has done the light is gone krishna was the light of illumina so what am i to tell you about the welfare of the friends you have asked you said yudhisthira this that mother kunti etc what can i talk about you because all the relatives whom you are inquired why that the son of krishna the krishna as the son has set and the python of time has swallowed our clan and all our all our family members were swallowed in the in the mouth like a python python does what it swallows everything the whole body detects away so time has killed everybody all these people you are talking about and when thereby we have been reduced to mere non-entities in the world we have no entity anymore because of krishna we have something no because of his krsna's glory we are glorious when krishna is known we are noah we are nothing and this is the very famous parts in the bhagavata many times quoted here and there it says [Music] this is the famous line he says that this verse says this is a misfortune about the whole world why and takur also said and the bowler dal yellow and gallo and then the group of singers celestial musicians what called the uh they came played sang and left no one could recognize them so he said bhagavan krishna it is the misfortune of the whole world because misfortune for the world at large because the god came in as a krishna and we belong in blood relation as it were in that family but we could not recognize them like the reflected moon in the water when they fish in the night time see that reflected sun they think it's a bright fish probably and they play with the reflected moon so we also played with him but don't recognize the glory of krishna so that is the repentance as it were so the eighth verse is very important it says this is a misfortune for the world at large it is only more for us so for the judus because he was born in the judo clan as the peace do not recognize the glory of the moon so long as they see the reflection of it in the water when the moon sets no more reflection in the water the glittering peace gun then they thought oh who was there whole night we played with him so joyful so cheerful so bright so powerful so god we also are like helpless people god came lived with us with our relationship he was someone's uncle someone was brother someone's husband someone's all the relationship when god came he played with us but we didn't recognize that he is a moon in the sky we saw the reflection out of compassion he took a human body and played in the world but we could not recognize we could not understand him do you know here louder okay i think little love is good yeah because you are the only regular person as the peace do not recognize the glory of the moon as long as they see the reflection in the water taking it to be the only among one among themselves so did the jojos fail to recognize that sri huri himself was still then staying with them he is he in whom all the world reside was regarded only as a jad of a chief krishna was understood as who he understood as the chief of the judo clan that he was born in the among the uh milkman group he's called jadavas so he is he man krishna in whom all the world decide krishna is a human but no in his body the whole universe exists in the 11th chapter no not which chapter 10 chapter 11 chapter yeah 10th chapter in the 10th chapter arjuna saw in the body of krishna the whole universe so that they saw all nissan moon stars all the warriors the entire universe everything in the body of krishna so he in whom all the whole world desired was regarded only we understood he is our leader so chip jayadawa chip the chief of the and the members of the jadhav clan in spite of their being clever in understanding people's mind opposition possessing high status and citizens and of living together for long with the lord only we know that he was our chief military force raja king and that position of high status as citizen we understand we are high citizen in this kingdom and living together for long with the lord it is it is now he also repents sometimes the people we saw in our life during lifetime we could not recognize their glory being very close to them day and night we don't recognize when they go away pass then we think oh my god what i missed what i didn't understand that at that time so here also this uddhava is always keeping a repentance the i was there i could not recognize his glory he is the lord of the world only we know he is the chief in our military of the uh that clan of jodus and he was very kind he was very but we didn't understand that god himself has come down so what a mistake those devotees whose minds are absorbed in sisihori the supreme spirit are never confused by the words and attitudes of those who under the friends of the lord's maya look upon him sam as relative sahamas clan clansmen and others as their enemy but we are fools but among us there are people who who know that though he is he is not overruled by maya there are now us there are people who recognized that they are not it is by by god has come and played by his own maya some as he is a relative in someone's eyes someone says clansmen another says the enemy is du judon and others he has to fight with so many asuras they taught krishna is my enemy kangshon kong so that krishna is the enemy you know so he has to fight but they know it's god himself they're acting with god himself so they do not understand so those devotees whose minds are absorbed in shri the supreme spirit those really who are fortunate people who love god they could understand that god lord has come down that those devotees only whose minds are absorbed in srihari who is the supreme spirit were never confused by the words and attitudes of those who under the influence of the lord's maya look upon him some as relative some as clansmen some other as their enemy eleventh verse revealing till now that charming form of peace even to persons without much austerity or devotion to their credit he has now withdrawn that form insatiably attractive to the person viewing it now revealing till now this charming form krishna when he was here now he has manifested and became our leader our relative but now he has withdrawn his power and gave up the body that's why he says the person without much but even we people who have not done much austerity but we are fortunate to be with him he has now without withdrawn the fall insatiably attractive to the persons viewing it and disappeared from their midst taking away even their eyesight as it were so krishna has now appeared and did his own purpose why he has come to establish dharma and other more to destroy after that he has withdrawn he lived with us though we are not so pure that we have done so much austerity or practice of meditation but it is god's grace he was born within us now he has withdrawn 12 verse the body that he assumed by his yoga power yoga maya so bhagavan when comes how the infinite becomes finite it is yoga maya yoga power as the magicians play by his power he creates so many things so similarly the body that he assumed by yoga power for a sport as a human being was astonishing to himself as it represented the academy of beauty surpassing all that decoration can achieve seeing at the raja's rajasuya sacrifice of judiciary that form of the lord so delightful to the eyes all the people felt that brahma had exhausted all his skills in making this body is so superfluous language in the rajasthan yoga then who did that do this terror did rajasthan means that he is the king monking in the whole india so those days that was the horse would be allowed to go also for the rajasthan is one all the rajas they call all the rajas kings of small denomination and they come and participate and in the participation of the big jagna done by judistero and when krishna was present there it was he was signing like felt like as a brahma god have created everything but he has exhausted all his skills in making the body of krishna that is very attractive very powerful very charming very smoothing the women of brazil the gopis stood for getting to complete their domestic duties as their minds were entirely drawn by their eyes that pursued his loving smiles supportive actions and entertaining glances the gopis were attracted by the beauty of bhagavan krsna's form so charming and so full of love now uddava starts talking about verse number 15 to 34 about the early life of bhagavan krishna first of all he said it is a great loss that bhagavan is no more in the world he has withdrawn himself and we could not understand though we are born in the same family we thought he is one of our great leader and we are proud of him and we are happy when he was here but now he's left his body and so we are all become powerless now he talks about life of krishna 15 verse just as the fire manifests in the fuel he krsna the lord of all of what is high and low assumed an aspect of his own maya and was born in the world overcome by the pity at the sight of his fierce creations persecuting the mild ones so again talking about the same thing that as a fire sometimes is there in the fuel but it manifests sometime similarly the lord krsna bhagavan of what is high and low assumed an aspect of his own maya through the maya he manifested himself why seeing is his creation he has created this universe but these fierce creations persecuting the mild ones stronger people giving trouble to the weaker people as it is going on now also look at this society whereas the power always dominates over the powerless powerful country dominating over the powerless countries so every anything goes for any country america will say you cannot do that i am getting angry so they will be streaking china will say go on i'll show you so dada all are great powers so when evil forces like that happens so she then by his maya comes even i am puzzled to find how he the unborn omnipresent should take birth in a prison cell in which vasudeva was incarcerated serrated should hide himself in brazil as if in fear of his arch enemy kancha and should run away from his own city of mathura for fear of karla javana as it were so they are storing up all these childhood stories no it is surprising uddhava said it is really surprising the lord god of the universe he took a birth i am puzzled to find that that unborn that omnipresent sachidananda brahman how to take a prison he is born in the prison we go to the mathura there what you find you go to the gel kang support the father and mother of bhagavan krishna into jail what is the name vasudeva and devaki and killed one by one all the children counts are killed they are put to jail and chained in the cell and that you can go to see the cell and they kept it in the same way again part of the shell did you see now i am saying there is the you can get an idea where he was the parents were put into the jail that is the birthplace they consider and there is a construct so the lord god of the universe is coming there's no auspicious celebration rather he is put into the jail his parents are put into the jail and he's crying like a baby [Music] so that's why buddha says again if you read then you will understand so even i buddha i'm puzzled to find how he the lord of the universe krishna the unborn omnipotent should take birth in a prison cell in which vasudeva was incarcerated should hide himself and that krishna god of the universe he was then ordered no his father take me to the other soul mathura and he is hiding out of fear of kong brenda he'll go yeah mature to bring them no more he was born he is hiding himself and went into the stealthily where crossing the jumuna river and then reached they so anyhow should hide himself in brazil out of the fear of the arch enemy conscious and should run away from his own city of mathura for fear of kaal and javana as it were so so how can i believe the god lord of the universe is fearful of a person like kansa who is an evil person and out of his fear god is frightened and he's born in a jail and in that gel he's hiding from there in the night when it is rain and then a miracle happened all the stories are there how it happened so he crossed the asked his father to carry him on the other sarsour and then i feel extremely pained at heart whenever i think of his making obeisance to his parents and apologizing to them thus o father o mother going to fear of kangso we have been forced to be ungrateful to you but not doing out our duties towards you please pardon us for the same who is saying oh being that condition i feel extremely pained buddha said i am feeling pain i feel bad when i think of his making obeisance the lord god of the universe is saluting obesity making obeisance to whom to them means his father and mother parents saying oh father o mother out of fear of puncture we have been forced to be ungrateful to you because the child should stay with the mom and dad and protect them when they become young but out of fear we departed we asked you take me to the other soul no so doing our duty so i'm sorry i cannot i didn't do the proper duty because you are you remain in the jail and i escaped as you ate as it were so i'm surprised how god lord of the universe can be so humble and prostrating before the vasudeva and devaki and saying that i could not serve you properly my mom my dad i could not serve you i got separated from you i could have do something better verse 18 whatever that has been once melt the fragrance of the dust of his lotus feet whoever that has even even one smell the fragrance of his dust of his lotus feet can forget him the mere frown of his brows proved to be the god of death to relieve the earth of our burden of evil men who is bhagavan krishna he is saying that he became so humble so small that he is frightful about conscious and had to hide himself and could not do perform his duties towards mom and dad he is saluting his mom and dad and saying sorry sorry forgive me i didn't do justice to you we are afraid of kongsho that's why we didn't but what is krishna krishna is such a powerful whoever that has been once smelled the fragrance of the dust of his lotus that means if you could take a dust of bhagavan krishna you become powerful you become powerful and the lord himself is fearful what a miracle i could not understand the glory mystery of it god is so powerful but playing like so you know same helpless so i cannot understand so whatever whoever in the world as a once have they take a dust of the lotus of defeat can forget him the mere frown and if he gets angry if he just frowns like this the even the god of death to relieve the earth and that burden of all evil men everyone gets frightened all of you had seen how at the rajoshiro of judicial even sisu paula the king of chedis who insulted krishna attained salvation with yogi's aspire but performing many severe yogic practices how can one bear the separation from such a personage so who how can i bear the separation from krishna in this way similarly krsna's realm was attained by all those kings he's saying at the same time krishna is so kind that chidi pal is raj the raja of the kingdom his name is shishupal sachin rogue but bhagavan he killed but you know he gave him the freedom liberation by killing similarly krsna's reign so similarly krsna's realm was attained by all those kings all those bad kings they all reached after death when they are killed in the war they went into heaven but to live with krishna as we chant in the morning time and chandi the mother what is your glory even those people you have killed them so that your weapon touches them and they become liberated you could have killed without using your weapon but you did it just to free them from bondage so what a great kindness so similarly krsna's kindness similarly krsna's realm was attained by all the kings who died in the field of battle seeing the smiling fascination fascinating face of krishna before them as they fell purified by the shack of arjuna so when arjuna was killing and before that arjuna is standing krishna is there in the front no and arjuna is in the back he's the charioteer charioteer sits in the front and the warrior is just behind him so looking at arjuna but they are seeing krishna and seeing krishna they got liberated from their all the evils of life he is the controller of even the tri murthy brahma vishnu mahesh he is satisfied with the enjoyment of his inner and bliss there is none equal to or greater than him the krishna at his feet all the protective deities of the quarters bow down they are crowned head with their offering krishna before him everyone bows down all the kings also yet with what great humility defeating a faithful servant did he stand before the king ugrusaina and make submission before him as the latter sat on his high royal throne we the dependence of the lord are struck with sorrow to think of this humble role of a servant adopted by the lord so he said that even ugroshina he showed respect to that person who is to be respected by the gods and angels all in whom else will you take a refuge except in him 23rd person in him in whom else will we take refuge except in him the most merciful one for lo think how even that evil women putana attained to the highest state to which his mother also is eligible for having sucked him suckled him though in the case of the demonish the suckling was with the intention of killing him so even the putana who was with the evil tendency came and he she got realized she got freedom from that life of that like that evil demonic body so i consider as devotee even those asuras and wicked men whose mind attained to concentration of krishna due to antagonism towards him for in the field of battle they saw as they fell the lord himself attacking them discussed in hand seated on his eagle vehicle so even i consider as devotees even those oscars the asuras who fought against bhagavan krishna they are fortunate because they saw the figure of krishna and by seeing they were liberated desiring the good of the world and prayed by two by brahma the bhagavan incarnated himself in the prison of kansa as the son of vasudeva by his wife devaki so therefore a few few verses are there let me read next afraid of danger from kongsho his father took him to the coward settlement where he stayed along with his brother incognito hiding his divinity till his 11th year that means after 11 years he lived in there that's the bhagavatam says that shri krishna lived in brindavan for 11 years all the gopi play we hear about that is the authenticity in the bhagavata but we see in our all the pictures and things they make krishna is a young man and all the girls young girls so as if they are playing some unethical play the young people but it is only child's play a boy of 11 years boy playing with the girls so that is the historic side of it afraid of danger from kongsho his father when a sri krishna's father took him to the coward settlement where he stayed along with his brothers in incognito balarama hiding his divinity until his 11th year herding carbs i accompaniment by the cowherd boys he sported in the thinly wooded pastures on the banks of the yamuna having trees full of chirping birds though so the childhood of krishna was spent this way the birds were chirping and these cowherd and [Music] the coward boys are during the cows so and and under the playing with the boys he left his young childhood possessed of a lion's cups majestic demeanor he delighted the inhabitants of the cowherd settlement by his charming looks by his boy's pranks and by his cries and laughter as he grew up he delighted with the strains of his fruit his friends the cowherd youths who accompanied him has attended the numerous white cows and booths of that prosperous settlement of the cowards the many asuras with magical powers and capacity to assume many forms whom comes to send against him were destroyed by him with ease as dolls by children so they are saying that when the krishna was in the childhood days so kongs have sent so many demons and what you call asuras and they can take different forms and they wanted to kill krishna but they were killed by the power of bhagavan krishna reviving the calves and cowherd boys from the effect of the poisonous water of the kalindi river kalindi river the lord krishna used to play the mother the lord krishna so and that that area was polluted by the snake poisonous snake and that is also name of kalindi kalindi kali kalyan and then bhagavan krishna [Music] and killed them killed him so he punished the serpent kaliya and dismissed him from those waters which he freed from their poisonous nature and made drinkable by an act of his will by his own will he killed this demon and also made the water drinkable by everyone for the proper use of the increasing wealth and the coward settlement he made nanda krishna made nanda the head of the settlement apart from many sacrifices for the benefit of the cows with the help of brahmanas oh friend no friend who buddha was saying to vidura oh friend when indra engaged and smarting under insult began pouring incessant rain he protected the terrified inhabitants of the cowherd settlement by playfully holding the governor mountain is an umbrella over them like any finger no in the moonlit nights of the autumn season sarath he filled a place with sweet strains of his fruit as he sported in the midst of the women enhancing their joy and praiseworthiness so he says all the glories of krishna and how he protected the good people and destroyed the evil so that was buddha's first reminiscences so this light will continue the next day we'll read the chapter third book chapter 3. we'll start there thank you um now we have some questions the incarnation is higher than god because he is god's redeeming power whereas god also has binding power avarana swati why does god bind according to bhagavatam for fun yeah he does not bind it is for fun sometimes the incarnation is higher than god because he is god's redeeming power only the redeeming god the very important point god creates this whole universe no for play but something maybe of there is joy also there is suffering also but when there is good there is bad god has created in this world from his perspective nothing good and bad painter creates women's painting but he is not angry with somebody and depicting some angry picture it's for fun a person with anger face is also creation of the artist's mind a sweet face that's also artist's mind so it is just expressing both ways there is no personal grudge or good or bad feeling in the creation of when god creates anything but there are two we find that there are two from our perspective there is good there is holy there is unholy there is sacred there is a non-sacred but when you think of christmas god incarnation incarnation is only compassion only holiness only purity that's a beautiful idea asami has given thank you for bringing into our attention this beautiful world then why does god bind according to bhagavatam god does not bind he played and he created himself it is all fast there is no when you call that creation it is like you stand in a mirror room in a mirror with one million small reflecting mirrors so you make a good gesture and bad gesture they will reflect in millions in your forms they are not created actually some good some there may be a good mirror there may be a bad mirror there may be a convex mirror then we concave mirror so your face remaining same god remaining same his appearance in different with the creation is appearing so it is not with a vengeance or anything he has created bad or good but from my side i am a reflected form of the jiva i see another is good he is bad but from god's angle there is no such division but that's why it is performed if you say why it has created is fun but incarnation is only good gone regards compassion another question we read that sri ramakrishna now and then entered into samadhi are there a similar records for lord lords rama and krishna also if so krsna's relatives should have witnessed it as well is not it it is said that god we don't know we don't see that but there are descriptions when they get totally absorbed and motionless but like samadhi or that type of description what we find in ramakrishna's life that was not really written clearly in the rama and krsna's life but she to eternal life we find that is singing and dancing and going into ecstasy and becoming totally like ramakrishna so they are examples but but that is not the point one point is there when god comes down he comes in different age to meet the different needs of people so sometimes rama has to come to kill the ravana and other demons how many troublesome entities were there when the rama was taken by the who the surat that way to save the bishop uh to save their jagna place that means there are disturbance from so many so he has to show the power of rajas the king is killing the demons and fighting and this and that krishna also had to show the need to solve the need of the time he had to take a role as a king and he has to be born in certain way and who acted rama krishna came in this age he is a pure sattor the same god sometimes using rajasthan power sometimes using shatthiko power so in this age for harmony peace and ecstatic experience they always rama krishna was in samadhi most of the time he didn't we didn't find that he's taking a sword on a bow and arrow and killing someone this is not the role of this age so same god comes in different age so ramakrishna came in this is foreign he conquered even schools and others [Music] okay so god plays in different ways for the good of our humanity so [Music] in that way i may not be very well known about rama and krishnas if there is somewhere that he went into samadhi no that is his question is that there is there any samadhi like ramakrishna going into ecstasy now and then we don't hear about that no recorded history with rama's place we didn't know much maybe those who are bred much details they can say but i didn't know yet that it is samadhi is not the question they are going to samadhi like ramakrishna goes every day now and then do you find in rama's life story not krishna do you find that is the question do you find such stories or incidents as in the ramakrishna's life going to samadhi now and then samadhi we are not talking about that anyhow okay we'll see you again at 7 30 in our santi gita class okay shanti shanti shanti peace peace peace you
