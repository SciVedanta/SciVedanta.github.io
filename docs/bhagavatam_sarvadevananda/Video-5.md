[Bhagavatam - 1.3.35 ( Book 1 - Chapter 3)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZU7-n8ciII)

[Music] [Music] i offer my salutation to bhagavan vasadeva krishna the son of vasudeva who is the destroyer of the demons kangso and chanura and the darling of the mother jason and the lover and guru of the whole universe on peace peace peace so we are in the reading of the bhagavata and we have understood the meaning shuttle the called the narrator he was describing about the mystery of one and the many because though it is a book of divine sport of krishna bhagavan krishna it is describing about the how that one absolute sachitanondo can become a embodied being like krishna so it is by the maya as we say in vedanta but this book is book of devotion bhagavat is considered one of the purana great purana and it is a book of devotion mostly but it is the expression it is the clear explanation of the upanishads the bhagavata and the teachings of the punishers as is transmitted to us through the and the activities of sri krishna so we are reading now how that one lord of the universe the abu tara who in dissents is the incarnation can behave and be many in this world so 30 verse it started we ended up verse 34. it says that the supreme being who is pure and formless spirit by his own power maya he fabricates all forms of evolutes just like a passing cloud against the sky formations of dust against the wind we find the objectivity of different things in the sky the sky gathers cloud gathers and we think it is a ghost it is a god it is a shiva linga it is looks like a mother people according to their imagination they impose those ideas similarly he is attributed to the pure subject of of sachidaan on the subject his only one absolute truth is there sachidananda and it is there the people are imagination imagination of whom of the ignorant people like us who are ignorant we see like that but to the knowledgeable people the children see in the sky so many ghosts and demons or whatever their mind some see god some say demon it is a cloud only makes some formation so we the people in the world who are ignorant they also do like that they see this manifoldness but it is only god everywhere and how it has become by intrinsic power is god's power with the power inside that brahman that's called brahma shakti here is the same idea he's talking that these maya fabricates what all this of with her evolutes like matata and the other categories so distinct from the gross body this body is the gross body distinct from this gross body there is jiva a transmigratory soul who enters into this we enter dips and goes into another body that says it is a bhakti book what type of bhakti book is this a total vedanta huh it is this it is like distinct from this gross body this is the gross body totally separate from this gross body there is the jiva jiba is a sanskrit term individual soul what is that individual transmigratory spirit who is now in this body when this gross body will be disconnected with that he will live into another body the upanishad it is said that they move like a leech you know leech how it moves is here sitting on the one uh say leaf and he wants to move into this leaf is enough he has eaten or seen enough he has to move from that place so he puts another mouth side like that and starts searching for a next place where it is stable ground and then when he feels it is stable then puts his mouth there and lifts his leg from here so this body leg up and another body already another point they have got it so jiva we also we are here now now here now settled but when i get dissatisfied with here the teeth is falling the memory is failing all these negative negative negative pain aches and pains okay this is no more a stable place to stay here the mind searches water will be next life and here and here here one thought comes i will be a healthy person i will be a rich person i will be educated person whatever the desire i will be this and powerful person i'll be like king i will be like whatever desire comes searching searching and that desire is the thought and power and there you end and gradually lift this body od has left the body left body where did he live it has not died it has gone to another again there he starts and continues his life experience and then again that's the transmigrative cycle of birth and death i know our desire whatever acting in the mind that is for me where shall i go next that's why you meditate then you made it i shall be like pure like this i shall be like selfless like this that is unconsciously making your next destination uh that's why last thought comes accordingly why someone will think of one way another thing someone thinks of seeing ramakrishna and living the body someone seeing christ and leaving the body someone thinks of some horrible picture like that because these are all the thoughts which has overpowered us but was the dominant thought coming out of that that will make them leave into the next life so that is our upanishad teaches like that so distinct from the gross body there is thus this jiva in individual all of us the transmigrated spirit whose form is made of subtle essence how that body is that this body i can see no is made of what five elements water air fire here in space we eat food that is the earth earth earth substance no anything produced from the earth all eating food is earth element no wind element it's ice here no the sam breathing then heat element is there calorie what is giving the body heat so air water water water of course we drink water you know so these are the five elements which has constituted this body when we are babies we are like this how you become this what is made of this by taking the five elements into it absorbing in the physical frame this physical body has grown or it is going to ah evolve or it is going to disintegrate no so the five elements this made of five elements is called gross five element there are five elements subtle when you dream in your dream you are thirsty and then you drink a glass of water that glass of water is not this glass of water and that water is not this water it's called the subtle water if i am hungry now and someone mentally brings okay think that you are taking rasagulla you are taking the candies and you are having nice ice cream huh my belly will be satisfied no that is the food of the subtle body and this is the food of the gross body in gross body you need gross ice cream in in dream you need dream ice cream is it not ah so that's why they say they imperceptible with the jiva which form is made of subtle essence of the matter there are subtle water subtle air that's your dream body also breathes not this air this the gross body is lying down in your bed that is breathing with the gross air but in the dream also you are running and there you may be panting for breath so that is a subtle layer so understand five gross element five subtle element so they are talking about that is made of the subtle elements accepted as transmigrated reformed life to life providing and but spirit is inside the big spirit consciousness is here around that it is in the physical it is in the subtle it is in trust migration and goes on and on when both these bodies the gross and subtle fabricated on the earth by ignorance are sublated to the awareness of their base that is the realization of brahman with these things i am not this gross body i am not that subtle body in the dream naturally i am not also the ego body i am the best foundation on which they are playing this drama of life in the physical level in the dream world and in the sleep world these are the three worlds we move around every day no we move in the waking state with the gross elements huh 24 cosmic principles here so look at the body what you have always total what is here you have your ego you have everyone have ego ego your that's called we have our intelligence mind then your [Music] ego mind and remembering faculty these are the four faculties four plus 20 is what 20 is five senses eyes ears etcetera five through which you perceive knowledge five organs of action hand feet look at you what you have you just tell what you are five working organs five perceiving organs five five ten five prana prana is functioning in five and five gross elements five gross element five subtle element five gross element is air water fair fee space etc city of these marut bomb and five subtle element subtle part of water in the dream subtle part of air subtle fire so these are the five so five organs of action eyes ears etc five organs of sorry five organs of action hand feet etcetera five organs of action five organs of perception is eyes ear nose touch etc five gross elements earth air fire water space 5 3 into 5 15 and subtle five subtle elements as you experience in the dream so five into four is twenty and four mine buddhi memory and a hunger ego these constitute the whole world now this is the gross when you go to sleep then you drop a few of them this physical part you drop but your mind still remains mind there your intellect remains intellect your senses you see there you hear there you feel their heat and cold everything is there so five organs of perception is there five organs of action is there but they are subtle subtle subtle this is gross gross gross so these all remain minus the gross part that is the subtle body 17 elements they call 3 times 5 15 what are the three organs of perception in the dream imagine your dream you have your eyes ears etc these are these five you have your hand feet to work you know that's five and also five elements there also you eat that subtle body is sustained by breathing not this breath subtle breath yeah so this is the whole vedanta sorrow talks about it it takes months and months to understand this philosophy but just quick i cannot go that my time 15 minute is gone what to understand is good that means who transmigrates get it clear today this body drops nothing drops i am high that i the jiva is inside now now he only like a leech when it wants to get out of this old worn-out garment into another then he lifts and this body becomes dead body and five elements remain here no but he moves into the subtle body till he gets a good body in the mother's womb again during that period he has on the astral what do we call that is a subtle body like your dream you dream when you dream you are dreaming in the world so we are all see this room if someone is sleeping in a big hall 100 people are sleeping 100 people are dreaming but no dream intersect interjects anyone your dream is your dream my dream is my dream everyone that means that is a different space not this space so these five elements five space etcetera estimate 17 that's why i call subtle body is 17 gross body is 17 plus 17 plus 5 plus 2 anyhow i don't so so this gross body is left the subtle body one goes why it happens but this going and coming going on when it when but a time comes both these bodies what is this body now down gross body and just in the night time is subtle body these two bodies fabricated how it is fabricated it is only only atman is there only brahman is there everywhere nothing is there it is maya it is appearing only these are imaginations of the mind vedanta called ignorance ignorance means i am not knowledgeable my mind is not knowledgeable so fabricated on the atman by the ignorance you know are this sublated through the awareness of base when it is knowledge i know that who am i this neither the gross body neither the subtle body i am the base atman behind behind the grouse behind the subtle behind the causal we have three bodies gross body subtle body dream body subtle body causal body because of all your ego body when you sleep in that sleeping time you have nothing but you have a body that's why you're coming out as i slept well the eye was there that guy was still there i guy is now working here through the body of my noise in all these instruments that's now here even in dream you talk to people your ego is still functioning there but when you that also goes away you sleep when you sleep you don't know anything and you say i slept well tell i the the guy i is there but how i functions behind the eye is the atman the sakshi witness the conscious entity behind all duality no so that is the realization of brahman when you know um in one verse he has given the entire philosophy you know that you know that you are brahmana you are atman so when you know that i am not this physical body not this subtle body of the dream body neither the body who sleeps well causal body but we know i am the substratum and the base foundation of all this body which is played by ignorance i am pure i am that atmosphere it is when maya the power of the lord which functions both as abhidha and vidya are binding and liberating is pleased to function as bidda that the jivat and supreme management when one can be free supreme realization will come when when we have to know this is happening i am thinking i am this you are thinking you are that again you think in your dream you are a you went to a sage you went to a holy past or you are facing a tiger and just chasing you or somebody is with a gun following you all this concept it's all maya and also deep dream you are also ego that's also under maya it's the shakti of brahman when you understand this and it has no connection with me i am that consciousness then one becomes liberated and abiddha becomes bid there with the means knowledge or with them is ignorance that due to ignorance we see all these things but when the knowledge grows in us that this atman is separate from that then you are free now 35 in whom him is capital who is the resident in the hearts of all beings who is birthless and actionless this births and activities as incarnations are described by the wise as a mystery which only revelation can explain no now the question comes that even janmani karmani this janma this birth this karma what we are doing the actions janmani karmani he occurred to ajanma it is happening for that who is beyond all ego pure consciousness or kartha and all john also who cannot bo he cannot born anytime he is infinite or atman is infinite our atman is birthless deathless it takes a birth it does some work how janman economy bornayanti that has been described why we are working how we are working that has been explained and described as what kobaya the knowers of truth it is revelation they come to them they are explaining how this appearance and the dream appearance and the sleep appearance are only appearances if they are not appearance then they will be all the time same is it not what is truth truth means what i see now what we'll see tomorrow what we'll see after 20 years after a thousand years before being millionaire after millionaire there will be no change but everything we see is changing so these are not true that's why he says in him without getting in the list attached to the the um in him who is the resident in the hearts of all beings that is everywhere in the heart of everyone one point who is buttless and actionless that pure self has no birth no action no suffering no joy nothing he's only bliss these births and activities as incarnations as you me as also like rama krishna buddha christ like great incarnations all are described by wise people describe to make us understand as a mystery you cannot understand that that is rahash that is subtle thing you cannot ordinary brain cannot understand that's why you have to go to the sages who understand that and sages are saying that that is the mystery which only revelation can explain so therefore without getting into the list attached or involved god he himself creates sustenance and withdraws this universe in the sheer in sheer play as far as he is concerned but not without cosmic purpose this play is going on for god this sun and moon and stars and galaxies and human beings sub human trees plants everything in the universe it is a fun going on it is out of his cosmic cosmic reality brahman its play its shakti its leela so he is concerned but not without any cause it is it is unconscionable like a child creates a fun castles these that on the shandu you see the children when you go to the play on the what you call beach and they create how many castles and other structures and then when why they create so much effort very serious he does not look at mommy or dad so they are mainly and when they play daddy and mom mommy and daddy says hey come let us go home the child leaves them without any attachment but if i for us we are very attached to our things if i write pipeline it's my writing if i say anything i said this you know we are attached so much but god created the whole universe no attachment like a child has no attachment for his created object there we suffer and god does not suffer that's the point he creates this universe like go to fun and and goes out in his own realm of joy everything is fun this is choke busily joy when he meditates or goes back to itself that is all joy when it opens it is also joy that's why they remain in joy forever that is true vedantic way otherwise you can say that there is his creation by his maya shokti he created something i think there is a second person but god knows you come that is the point if there is no i there is no u so you can say u comes because of i i comes because of you because one if there is no i there is no you that's why when we go to deep sleep there is no i no new but whenever my eye little trace of my remains in the dream therefore you are there so many thoughts are coming all this fear and anxieties or joy or fun everything and now also so ego i is the point you can say you also being the master of all the six senses that means the god we are not master but god like rama like krishna we are talking about krishna bhagavan like ramakrishna you can always think when you talk about ramakrishna so in the thing that that all being the master of all the six senses possessed of understand understand freedom he has the power he's always positioning of unrestrained freedom nothing can bind him he permeates all beings and enjoys all objects through them without involvement he permits everything he knows he is uninvolved and but he has the power of control over the senses and he permits and sits in the hearts of all and he plays and enjoys in how many forms is a enjoyable business suppose you could have divided yourself in front of others and 100 figures no and one is dancing one is singing but it is all you are in enjoying that all this fun and joy god has the wonderful capacity rama krishna buddha christ they come with this knowledge fully well it is the power of the brahmana with that power it is the brahmana himself with its own power manifest himself as this universe and he permits into the universe and enjoys everywhere through everybody no as we go we go to our we see our in the yeah um before the mirror no why do you go stand before the mirror to see yourself what to see you are you are what to see oh i want to see myself and when you go to see ourselves then we see different way we see the pure belgium glass should be there one called cape glass will be there one convex glass will be there is it not to see our wrinkles are there or not ah so all these things so god also wants to see how i look looking with the mirror i give the example that they are when god enters into a room billions and trillions of subclasses are there suppose you enter into a room you are only one and your reflection goes on billions and millions millions and billions of glasses which is concave and convex in different degrees you will look million and billion nothing has happened but you can see billion and billions and billions no and it is different so that is the creation this isn't talking about this the power of god as incarnation we as incarnation we are ignorant god has incarnation he takes this body and mind but full knowledge but with the buddha and that's the maya that's called the maya maya shakti the power just as an ignorant spectator is not able to recognize the actor behind his makeup so also no one having a limit limited and perverted intelligence depending on his skill in logic can understand the mystery of the creator's manifestation into countless names and forms as really they we know some people that's why the many [Music] people who go to see movie many times they know immediately oh it is who is playing he knows their name he is playing in this role you recognize the player and the name the fun he is doing but playing that knowledge you have but ignorant people doesn't don't go to anything any any experience of too much movies so they go and they cry and weep seeing that man is killed and that man is in torturing in the other person so these are all fun going on for money no movie means what actors and actresses are in the role for what purpose one purpose is fun another purpose is money it is for all for fun one is being killed he is also for fun one who is killing he is also not fun it is a show is not true similarly this world is going on one god playing in different roles one is killing he himself is killing one form killing himself there is a story that rama krishna one day saw that a boy a small boy he caught a grasshopper and he got a broomstick one stick and he's putting this broomstick through his body and ramakrishna instead of being pained he clapped his hand and said oh rama oh god you are creating your own trouble so he is playing with himself that is the idea brahman is the same it is only man who is without duplicity and who serves the lord of limitless might continuously in love and submission that comes to realize him in truth and in reality who will recognize the real actor who is acting in so many roles we say it is god himself has taken so many forms so who is acting in so many roles in this real life what you call our real life it is only one god he appears to be many by his maya shakti that we call the maha maya yoga maya these are the terminology of the sakta school mother worshipper school and vedanta will say only maya and they will say mahamaya with a sweeter name you go maya is a sweeter name so only the man the person who is without any crookedness in the heart that is duplicity and who serves the lord of limit who is limitless of mighty power continuously in love and submission who submits themselves at the feet of the lord they will know it is ramakrishna has become many in the drama krishna in the tree ramakrishna in the sun ramakrishna in the moon he is in every human faces he is behind every creature every created being sun moon stars everywhere it is only ramakrishna ramakrishna that's right you see when the experience came remember ramakrishna touched on the july january 1 in the kalpataru day ramakrishna touched and the toast gave him what he got overwhelmed he said everywhere ramakrishna whatever he sees trump car is coming he's standing there hurry he see ramakrishna why is trump and the trump driver he is so mad he is making get out of my road but he does not so he has to stop the trump and come out and pull him out hey have you become mad standing in my but he says ramakrishna the driver is ramakrishna the conductor is so it is nothing but ramakrishna and he went to office he has an accountant when opening in those days to leisure book cash book leisure book we forgot nowadays so early days this has written no how much money plus minus credit debit so he has to do all checking or something he opened in the office he opened he does not see anything no account figure it is ramakrishna he is drinking water no water this is ramakrishna he was taking the food plate it is no rice it is ramakrishna so two days three days he continued we have been continuous vision maya lifted seeing the one have become many and then he said o ramakrishna oh lord please take back i cannot handle this so that is the experience the limitless might continuously in love with the submission that comes to realize him him is the lord in truth and in reality krishna devotee will say krishna krishna krishna christ devotee will say christ christ christ christ christ in the front christ in the back christ on the right christ on the left christ is below christ is above bro so this is the experience of all the mystics that will happen when mind is purified by the grace of god mind becomes simple not crooked all the qualities they have said then he says oh noble sages because you have to remember the sages requested this narrator shuto tell us about krsna's story you are the person who was present when it was narrated by sukadeva to the dying king pariksit no you you you are present there you know that you tell us so he was telling you noble sages you are indeed blessed but you are wholeheartedly devoted to the lord he's praising these sages and saints or devotees who devote their whole life and purpose of life to god he's saying the narrator suta is saying that the master you are indeed blessed for you are wholeheartedly devoted to the lord the master of all existence attaining whom man is freed from the fear of recurring cycle of birth and death all our spiritual life is what more i don't want to be born in this miserable condition anymore i'll be ever free in joy nothing can create fear and tension in my mind there is nothing at all it is me only that pure knowledge will dawn it is ramakrishna it is normal no if you really know that he is ramakrishna making you angry then you can smile at him hey ramakrishna you are playing like this then intensity of that fear will go away so that called knowledge when you see the one and that one is god for us it is ramakrishna for anyone worship god in makkali it is makhali for them one who is worshipping is christ christ for them but it is the one reality as a uniform coming as incarnation so now now now how the bhagavatam now it is only preambling going on first two chapters now 40th verse we are reading we have started we have already read 35 to 39 now i am on the 40th verse the great sage vasa produced this text which is known as bhagavata which we are reading now who created it his name is bhagavan vyasa veda byaso bhagavata who is equal to veda himself this bhagavata is almost equal to the vedas vedas are profound knowledge this also has profound knowledge every word if i take time one verse i can continue three four days such is the profound meaning if you delve into it so but it is known which is equal to almost it is like vedas itself as it deals with the deeds of the most exalted god in human manifestation that is whenever is krishna they are talking about krsna so this book deals with krishna god himself who incarnated as a human being for the purpose of fun nothing and for the good of humanity or who is human it is he came down to help others who are thinking that we are non-gods we are we are not we are impure we are petty tiny creatures subject to fear all the time like you know you see all the animals if you look at the animals it is a little squirt squirrel or anything you are walking little song you say yes fearful it's anybody getting to kill me all the time running running running so we are like that fearful all the time almost dependent on the whole world helpless what helpless it is all god's play going on look boldly who is playing here it is the lord has consciousness he is not there this dead body do anybody fear any dead body whatever powerful or weak that may be so it is all dead body without god a ghost is god is there that's a ghost that's also within your ignorance so this the great sages basu produced this text which is called the bhagavata which is equal to the veda itself almost as it deals with the deeds and of the most exalted being krishna for the supreme good of the world why he does that for the supreme good of the world he taught this holy and blessed gospel to whom to bash devs his own son and his son's name was sukadeva sukadeva the son of father basso and bhasa has composed this leela of krishna who is krishna the absolute god who has become many by his own sakti maya shakti and playing for fun only so that sukadeva who was supreme among the illumined ones 42 hours containing as it does the essence of all the vedas and the sacred traditions shishuko imparted it to maharaja pariksit sukadeva the son of byaso this knowledge which you read all these pages we'll read in this all these pages that has been absorbed from his father sukadeva absorbed it from his father sukadeva transmitted it to the king pariksit who was being cursed to die within seven days death is knocking at the door only seven days life span that dying soul who is eager to know about god was being given this knowledge by the son whose son's name is [Music] samudratham and the story ethios books means the traditions sacred traditions which is saharan saram essence of them have been samudritam has been churned and brought out saw to that truth has been given to hear who by maharaja maharaja pariksit means the pariksit was the king of india then the emperor india then extended long it is not india today it was all pakistan all bangladesh all afghanistan go up to that that was one extended india from there to there and he is the first emperor of india right he wanted to give up his body hearing about holy thoughts of god now 43 verses maharaja pariksit was then lying on the bank of the ganges that was the style when you want to die just go into the secreted place detach from whole family relation think of god day and night and lay down on the bank of the kansas and ganges why ganges is considered the most auspicious pure pure it purifies your body and mind and your mind being intended on god you will think of god and live the body so you are not to come back again so king was waiting there maharaja pariksit [Music] ganga puritan surrounded by paramore civil all the greats this is the seers of truth surrounded by holy men and krishna under a bow of fast until death he was sitting there and surrendering himself to god he was waiting the death to come o holy man [Music] o holy men sitting by that sage of great prowse as he narrated the glorious accounts of the lord i to happen to hear it so among the congregation this person who i call the narrator shruta he said i was present in that congregation when sukadeva narrated this story sukadeva got from his father bhaso the wisdom it came to his son and the son narrated that story to the king of king's emperor parikshita and when that conversation was going on in that congregation i the present narrator suta i was present there and i am now relating that story to you so by the grace of that great one i too happen to hear it and this suit or narrator there is a class of people there called narrator narrate they can narrate they have incredible memory whatever you say they like photographic memory they remember everything what every word so he says with that memory i am retelling that story oh king pariksit because you told me that you are dying you need to hear about krishna so that i am going to tell you what i learned from him i shall now narrate to you as far as my understanding would permit a hong kong now i will try to explain you heart what according to my ability to explain how much i have heard and what is to be intended to be so for the guidance of the man why i am doing this for the guidance of man rendering spiritually blind by evil age of quali which set in with krsna's attainment of his abode that means when krishna left the body died that is the time kali yuga started krishna and the subsequent disappearance of virtue and enlightenment from the world when the virtues of life went down decadence and enlightened from the main front world the spiritual son of a purana has now arisen in the firmament of the thoughts it's very poetic i what i have heard being humble there i listen and i will now relate to you what i have heard no which will purify the heart now we start the chapter four now he is saying as he is what he has heard from the narrator shuttle suto is now remembering what he heard from the uh sukadeva and sukhodev is saying that bass over my father said understand do you understand this link now the narrator is telling the story what we are getting and this narrator how he is telling he is being approached by many elderly sages and saints seeing this narrator said oh ho you know about the shri krishna's life and teachings and all this please narrate to us you are very kind you have the memory please tell us so now he is telling that i have heard it from the son sukadeva sukadeva heard it from his father what i heard now i am telling what said he said that means sukadeva is saying my father said this what he said [Music] congratulations congratulating this suita who spoke as above shounoku the master of the rig veda and the leader of the sacrificial congregation said what he said oh suta the great narrator narrate to us that sacred text what is called the bhagavata this is the bhagavata which the holy shuka revealed to you which age does the subject matter of bhagavatam pattern one question which period of time this incident happened when and and for what reason this this sacred book text comes into existence prompted by whom did the sages that is says krishna produced this text why this book is produced these are questions from the sages to suta si suka the son of basso is a great yogi established in his mind in equanimity and he's always in in the consciousness of the absolute established in oneness and awakened from the sleep of ignorance sukho hides his greatness passing for a dull man while following his son shri suka who was going ahead stark naked they says bash came across a baby of heavenly sneems engaged in water spores seeing the sage they put on their ropes though they had not done so when the young sukho had passed that way earlier when the questions questioned by the sage on the reason for their strange conduct the dam cells replied that the baso still retained the sense of difference between men and women but not his son who was endowed with absolute purity of outlook arising from the perception of the same athman in everything moving about and as he did like one intoxicated a dumb dull how was suko recognized by the people at hostinapur when he entered that city after passing through the land of the gurus and the young jungles what was the occasion for this conversation between the great sage and rajab maharaja pariksit the grandson of pandavas which the conversation you say led to this revelation of the doctrines of devotion called bhagavata so you are putting question after question question after question the when sukadeva is born as a man of perfection from the birth he was full with the knowledge that i am athman i am brahmana i don't belong to him everything is only god so with that wisdom he was so that that the father brasso is running after the sun but the sun is detached from the world see suko is said to tarry at a house only for a very short time just what is requiring for milking a cow and that only for sanctifying the people by his presence oh dear one we have heard that pariksit the son of abhimannu was a man of exceeding devotion to the lord therefore we'd like to hear about the unusual circumstances attending on his birth and of his great achievements in life an emperor that he was why did this action skin of the pandava clan forsake all the might and majesty of a vast empire and undertake the power of fasting and to death and the banks of the ganga he is a powerful king of whole of india why he had to go back thinking that someone has cursed him that he will die within seven days with a snake bite that was the curse for the king pariksit so king what what a proud of a king power he is fearful about a snakebite and he gave up his kingdom and then came to the bank of india the beauty of india the emperors who is the emperor of whole india so much spirituality is ingrained he says oh i am i am only seven days to live in this world okay so what to do okay i can other people want a snake i can kill that i will manage my military force is there i build a house where no one nothing can enter no no not not at all thinking in that way a king like a like a child getting frightened no he knows life is temporary i have done my duties now let me see the ultimate journey from this that's why india is always so spiritual and tell us about the material development that's why so many hundreds of uh what you call invasions and destructions has happened to india two centuries read the history of india they are so value they carry so much value because of that everyone took advantage of them everyone stole their material prosperity and they become the biggest and biggest and biggest so that because this value has taken them to another direction not focusing on the life we need now our ram krishna bible canada came that is reviving but you know you need to live like a right and enjoy the life and also think after that experience that is not highest go beyond the material prosperity spiritual development should go side by side that's why swamiji said incent india was so great in his material prosperity in scientific development never ever one can excel that and also spirituality of course so he says that as an emperor that he was why did this skin of the pandava clan forsake all the might and majesty of a past empire and undertake the vow of fasting unto death on the bank of the ganga why he at whose feet even his enemies took shelter with all their wealth why did a king so young and so mighty think of abandoning all the good things of the world and even life itself so dear to men the devotees of the lord of noble fame live in this world not for their own sake but for the good and prosperity of the world such being the case why did a young devotee of the type of parikshita even if he were full of spirit of renunciation think of abandoning his body which was support and shelter for all the worlds please give proper answers on all these matters about which we have questioned you i consider you as deeply versed and therefore superior to me in all the branches of learning except that relating to the vedas so that was the verse number 13. so these are the questions put by the sages to know to be to know about the truth from the king parikshit's last days from this narrator narrator is telling how now sukadeva has described so these the sages first asked that sukadeva why this king parikshith is doing this he being the emperor of india and he heard that someone has cursed him for snake bite and the pamperer of the country is fearful about snake bite and he's mighty powerful is proud this you can imagine how powerful he is ruling in the whole india he's so weak person he's actually a fighter why is doing that for the power to know the truth and this life is all there but his higher purpose is to know the truth where you can conquer all fear anxieties and worries oh yeah after seven days after this this book will end seven days it is a continuously that conversation was going on day and night and the assembly of the great sages all around sages and saints are all sitting over there hearing this wonderful message from sukadeva then they kept their mind in thinking of the divine no and when after seven days came then sugar said have you any other more question well no last response they said are you fearful of death well no i don't fear death anymore i have conquered death this book is the purpose of this book is to conquer death challenges comes difficulties come conquer and conquer with the knowledge of the highest truth that is the end result of this reading of this book and he died diet means that time it is described a snake like that came and bite him and then what happened effulgent ray of light came out of his body and the divine in him merged into cosmic divine so that type of description at the end of the book we will find so we end here that is the verse number what where did i end the fourth chapter we started now pipers yeah i ended the five verse number five [Music]
