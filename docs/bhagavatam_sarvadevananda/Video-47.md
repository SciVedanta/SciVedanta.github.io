[Bhagavatam - 3.5.42 - 3.6.9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wHW_F9XDjOs)

foreign [Music] the darling dear darling of devaki the guru of the entire world and respected of all peace peace peace peace now we are reading the bhagavat now we are chapter book number three where chapter I I sit wrong with five sixth chapter nah sorry five chapters I I said wrongly 3.5 chapter and verse number will read today 42. so this was We are continuing how the creation was done and all the creation there is one deity devotee of every item of this creation God for the fire God for thy ear no similarly and all the duties of the they mix together their capacities and presiding deities of all things elements all parts of Vishnu do endowed with the capacities of change projection and movement could not bring the element to mix it into various combinations and produce the universe so first of all says how the creation was done that was described that was the question and the new response is that it is created of the five elements 24 principles all this air water fire element to limit all this and now this elements themselves cannot create anything so therefore comes the question of God entering into it so 38 verse the the deities then said oh lord your holy feet constitute vegetable umbrella to the weedy Travelers seeking shelter for the heart of shanksharu by so seeking shelter at your feet the spiritual Seekers come across the ocean of shanghsaro with utmost ease to the Lotus feet of you Lord our salutation again and again and he says ooh father and Lord of all in this fear of transmigratory existence the jivas being distressed by them tried of miseries are not able to attain to the inherent beliefs of Atman unless the sick shelter at your feet which stimulates spiritual illumination so it takes refuge in you the lord of the universe for which by which illumination and peace comes people can cross the ocean of sanction so we take refuge in you we seek shelter at those feets of yours which the Sages of the settled understanding that means those cities who have been established in their understanding that God is real and they have experienced God so we take shelter at those feet of you on which sages of settled understanding they meditate with hearts purified by faith and by love generated by the hearing of the devotional texts by which they attempt to the highest form of renunciation so we take refuge under you and as a result the sages meditated upon you and with their their heart was purified how by faith God is there and they surrender to you and they created the love love generated by hearing of the devotional texts scriptures with devotion the rate they listen by which that in listening to the bhakti books that in to the highest form of renunciation and intimate knowledge of yours they got all the sages they got it now we also take shelter at your holy feet who do most manifest themselves as various incarnations for the creation preservation and destruction of the universe I am taking refuge in you at your feet who from you manifested all the incarnations all the incarnations of Vishnu Lord Vishnu so you are the Lord of the source of all from you came all the incarnations for the purpose of what all the income for the purpose of the creation preservation and destruction of the universe and in meditating on whom your devotees attend to The Fearless state of salvation so your Incarnation is very important when you are incarnated people get the opportunity to love you to see you to meditate upon you and by that their heart becomes pure and pure and become being pure they enter into their realm of Freedom salvation 43 Verse though you reside within all beings and at thus closest to them in the real sense you are in practice the remote is entity from them so long as they feel deep red and identification with this impermanent body and also its up apartinence like home and the rest so he says 43 Verse is very interestingly saying that just just [Music] foreign I worship your food pit Lotus feet you do reside in the heart of all very close you are the closest and nearest of all but people does not feel for them you are so far away because of their attraction for their body for their money for their home for their relatives so being attached to that for them do you decide the closest and you are the nearest of the near but people could not understand that because they have not developed love for you they are far away from you though you are the nearest of Denia closest of the clothes so though you reside with all beings all beings where there is a holy man whether is Unholy whether it is educated or Not educated men or women rich or poor you reside within all being and you are thus closest to them in the real sense in the real sense because it acts so then in the truth we cannot do anything we cannot see anything we cannot act anything unless God is there no his his connection is intimately there every bulb is on electricity is connected with everyone so all the manifestation whatever is happening in the universe because of the manifestation is possible because of God's presence of Brahman and being so close but to the ignorant people is so far away because they are why they are so far away from them it is not God is not doing anything because of that attachment attraction to they feel deep rooted identification ordinary people feel deep rooted identification where where did you feel to the impermanent body this body then that they always day and night thing I am the body oh my body body there are people you meet them as soon as you go they start talking about their body is really deteriorated but body body body as much as you say we become body bound people are day and night thinking of their how much stock market going up and down up and down people don't think they are getting the same benefit and people are thinking too much they're also getting the same benefit or loss whatever happens but thinking of money and money and money some people stay whole day what is God for them but some people are thinking of politics day and night day and night where is God for them but God is close whether mind is engaged or not he is the closest up close Atman is a different meaning of course duration he is there that myself is there for this to the father nearest that means he pervades everywhere but still ignorant people don't understand that don't experience them oh all perfected being our salutation to you also 44 o Supreme Lord those whose minds are captured and carried away by the senses which Delight in enjoyment of degraded objects never get the opportunity of association with the holy men who have been Sanctified by the touch of your sacred feet so whose Minds in the ordinary in the world of Duality scene or this is the proof bhagavat reading how many people look at that I am saying but look at the interest how many billion people in the world now 15 20 25. wow and what happens to the millions hundreds and thousands what they are doing very busy and deep in samadhi oh he's here is the point whose minds are captured and carried away by the senses and senses means I is here all the five senses so captured and carried away by the senses and what the senses which this sense is carried away what this does delight in enjoyment of degraded objects degraded object is the momentary changeful object not to the unchanging object no God so their mind is God goes to that changeful thing degraded mean low value they say spiritually not enlightening and morally not uplifted like that never get the opportunity and and poorly they didn't have the opportunity of what not the opportunity of association with the holy men it does not function unless you have holy company holy they don't get a chance of holy company holy company they don't take holy company will be there they feel reactionary to run away from Holiness they're like ramakrishna stood of the fish Mass basket peace basket is like a degraded objects and they like that they like Everyone likes something or other but not God and the source of all joy and peace freedom so alone they feel by the senses which delighted enjoyment of degraded objects they never get the opportunity of association with the holy men who have been Sanctified by the touch of your holy feet holy men are holy because they think of God so they become holy so if we think of Holi or associate with them their Holiness will come to us but they do not feel any attraction for that for interested for interested as they are only in the sensual enjoyments they scrupulously avoid such contracts with sendly ones and therefore deprive themselves of all chances of spirituality spiritual regeneration spirituality is a fundamental thing ramakrina said why the Mind does not go to God it should go its nature is to go to God only because it is covered with the ignorant attachment and aversion and all these things likeness for the sunset objects which are treating which has momentary but has its apparent attraction immediate attraction people get attached to that and therefore they don't turn towards holy people they don't turn towards holy discussion they don't go to holy places to have a holy company so they deprive themselves by that oh Lord those who become purified and endowed with abounding Devotion to the you by listening to the recitals of your holy accounts and excellencies at in simultaneously to intense dispassion of man knowledge and thereby the to your imperishable state so what is the benefit of this thinking of though oh Lord those who have become purified suppose they go to the holy company to Temple chanting praying by that way our mind is getting beautified purified and endowed with abounding devotion and then generate love for God we'll go to the temples there will be so many people go but amongst them there will be so many sincere people they go and cry and we you know they sing and and dance in the name of God they are purified they find joy in God how by listening to the recitals Disciples of your holy accounts harikatha they listen to the the Pandit Pandit is explaining to thousands of people you go now when the horikata ram ram Katha I have seen people of thousands of people are assembled one person is even you know only online I see some you small boy giving what is wrong with class ah and the women I see then they are more devotional so when they are listening their tears are rolling down no so they are pure native that's why they find joy in listening to the horikata that is the your Lotus your holy accounts and God's Leela holy accounts means God's Leela Divine sport and excellencies glory glory of the Lord and the accounts of his ramakrishna's story and his glories no you we when we read our mind gets uplifted at in some this and those who have fortunate they go to listen to The Holy words and by that way they purify their heart and what it brings to result comes at in simultaneously two things one intense dispassion and knowledge intense dispersion this world the meaningless it has no attraction for me I have seen it that type of feeling will generate more and more instead of attaching attaching or feeling identified with it they will feel dispassion I don't care about this that type of this passion will come in the mind and knowledge will also come the God is the reality and than as a result thereby to your imperishable state that means they will be attracted towards that state sachidan on the state which is imperishable which does not get destroyed any time 45 percent disease translations translation and when you read the original is so much different keep beautiful bhagavata oh God your sudha um the words means nectar these words which is like nectar like words about it with the increased devotion those who have become their heart has become Vishal bisha Bishop Bishop means extended they get hold to bairag renunciation they enter into the bodha knowledge and wisdom according to means which is not Disturbed or they are Abode of permanent permanency that is now by by this knowledge these are all the dust and dirt is gone so beautiful translation if we had Diamond energy to prove into it but anyhow Happy loop is better than nothing no no okay Mama you have no mama Uncle mama mother's brother and mother's brother has good deep relationship with the childhood so if the mama is there the baby gets so much pampered but if you now have at least the blind mama is better at least he cannot do so much but with the kid you laugh you can feel at least happy 46 verse there are others who by their own effort conquer the powerful hold of nature to the practice of communion through samadhi and That Into You whom the devotees to attend following the path of devotion see but there are people by devotion they give the example they listen to your horikata they listen to your Lila by that way their mind becomes purified and they feel no attraction for the sunset Universe sense it word their heart becomes purified and they at a new state unbroken absolute state but but otherwise are also there this is this 46th verses there are others by their own effort their taku said two ways one is the monkey and a kitten kitten and the baby monkey and baby cat so one depends on mother bhakta and listening to the holy always connecting with mother and mothers they will be purified as you as well but those who have their own effort I will do I will do meditation I will do practice I will control myself I will not indulge into this by that type of resolution they others the power of yoga to get into meditation and deep concentration in the Atman the tongue and other nations which are strong tomibes they also enter into you they are also people of wisdom that they enter into the Consciousness embodiment of consciousness so there are others who by their own effort conquer the powerful hold of nature to the practice of communion to samadhi and attain to you whom the devotees to attain following the path of devotion bhakta where thakur said bhakta will also reach the same ghani will also reach the same people think that ganis are higher factors are lower but that's a relative term you talk but when you end the bhakti is same as end of piano also all rejecting everything enters into that and meditator they're going into deep they merge into that so they also reach the same destination but the method of the former is fought with great difficulty say Gita also says and those who have the body identity saying I am Atman is difficult not saying Gita never says it is impossible it is also a path strong path but it is only pure ready for that when people are capable to practice that way only if they get success when that person who is practicing at the same time don't feel body identity much but not so that of those who practice love and service of thee but those who do take the bhaktiva it is highly difficult because you need tremendous renunciation tremendous Detachment Northeast not this not this I don't care for anything of the world not only that Supreme sachidananda that but here no no no you one hour you spend in singing one hour that immediately feels something little uplifted relative I am here a little one inch maybe another and Gary also they don't feel immediately that's why they find the same destination because he is not satisfied with one inch development is happy with one inch development two inch development twins four inch you move towards the truth even inch by inch but gani no no not this that is the goal so that's why bhakto path is easier in that sense because it can give you constant inspiration to move on because you get more joy more joy and you sing or you dance in the name of God that's why many people what happened why they follow so much of the dualistic singing and dancing why because instantly when people are troubled in their life situation mind is so much Disturbed here and you enter into one place where singing and dancing going on and you join into the dance immediately you forget whole world and your mind for a moment gets touch of the Divine atmosphere right and therefore you're relatively it was here lower level it just gets a lift and that you feel so good and that brings you second day oh I was very happy there let me go second day so then they come to third day and immediately they get more and more and get fascinated that means when they are fascinated with this means they are not interested in the other things so the result is going it is easier for hundreds and thousands of people but this is difficult this is only possible for few people now reverse number 47 desires of creating the universe you did project us God thought that I I will create and how he created he projected us we came from him it is he who projected no in your dream what you call your mind projects it is not nothing else comes there so similarly here also God the absolute he wants to project means he projected himself the categories and the deities presiding over them out of the three Gunners so how you projected you took help of the three gunas satta rajasanthamas you created Satya gods and goddesses items now we find ourselves remaining in disjunction without the power come into combination required for the formation of the universe universe which is to be the field of all the supportive manifestation so he wanted to manifest yourself with the three gunas and we are also created now but we cannot coordinate with anything we have no power that's why it is mentions the two words he projected he created how would the three gunas and God's goddesses everything but they become lifeless unless he enters into it as he it is a dualistic concept as if he is creating out of himself though himself first the material thing and then in the matter he enters into it like [Laughter] now we find ourselves remaining in disjunction after creation we are feeling that we are created but I cannot connect with anything we have to join this Junction without the power to come into combination without there is a power should come to combine us required for mission of the universe which is to be the field for all your supportive manifestation through which you can play through all this created being people like you example the people create many uh say dolls and creating in this keep it but when you supportively play with them then they become alive they have not their own existence but when it is touched by the player of the doll then doll become Lively and then it is the example of a children's example children when they take the doll and they play with doll is done but to the child doll is when a hungry doll is now sleeping doll is now to be getting up and all of us in birya unhappy so yeah so many things with the doll they interact the children interact with that they think it is Lively to the mind of a child the dolls are not dogs they have their life now we know we say it is childlike play but when we are children we give value I see many people live Earth School college going hard or way they're taking a big doll and in the plane and holding all the time like a child is hold by them no that they think they are a little Lively entity so similarly oh Lord you created us and we are the three gunas we are the gods of all these senses and everything but we cannot in connect with each other by but it is which is to be the your combination required for formation of the universe which is to be filled for all the supportive so it is needed that you trust it and that's why everything becomes sportive play this play is going on everywhere 48 bars it is only when at the beginning of creation these worlds are formed that we could make our offering to you namely provide you with a field for your supportive manifestation it is only when at the beginning of creation these words are formed that we could make our offering to you when I we are created we thought that it is your offering so we could offer back to you likely provide you with a field for your supportive manifestation we too could get our food through the offering of men only after the worlds are formed whether gods are created God will depend how to eat the humans give some offering that's why you call Deborah fiberians five five dates are there in Hindu culture they were in pittyrene rishirin and human so ah right that means that's why the Hindu culture they do something for the pitties offering ovulation and things Rishi is chanting of the Gita bhagavat this is called rishidin between devourin offering some Homa homophone let them eat this offering no I am giving it to Lakshmi the boys so we are offering so this is the way up where humans are offering so to the humans Rishi human the human that's a human being is that you do serve the other neighboring human people by that that's why after people eat they keep something for the birds for the cats dogs Etc in in that is the culture that means it is all everyone should be served and they are serving us we are serving them the Gita says by loving each other and adoring each other and giving this gift we all become sustained by God it is only then that this being can have fixed center from which they could making offering to thee and ourselves and themselves take their food based on us therefore the power and understanding that would help us from the world out of the categories so he's saying oh Lord bestow upon us the power and understanding you have given us power and understanding but give that power and understanding that we would help we would help us we would help us from the worlds out of categories that means we will get out of this Earthly bondage foreign explanation of it you the undying and eternal being are the original source of us all cutest this is the vedantic vedantic godasta at the beginning you are the primordial purusa the consciousness and taking the Eternal being the original source of all the categories of all Devas it is you the Eternal one that did bestow on your prakiti and actions what you do this seminal impulse which express itself as the collective Soul Mahatma so it is saying how the Mahatma is created you are the cause you are the transcendental purusha you are the other it is the primordial Eternal one you did bestow on your property like bhagavad-gita says energy entered into prakiti and then prakiti become a lively so here it says that did bestow on your property the um gunas and actions the Seminole impasse which expressed itself as the Collective Soul called the Mahatma so 50th verse the last verse of this chapter pipe we O Lord we the categories and their presiding deities have been bought into existence by you in order to combine together the categories into various worlds it is you o God you tattoo you we the categories we have been created by different gods and goddesses and Elemental things how these so many worlds have been created they are Earth planets so many planets so many stars so here he says we the categories and they are presiding deities have been brought into existence by you in order to combine together the categories into various worlds these categories create is a planned category it is a animal category it is the what you call the many planet category so there are categories different categories has been created by you and the residing machine beings best to upon us who depends solely on your blessings the power and intelligence for taking up this work of creation so the gods were created and said God said that you take care of us and give us the power so that we can best to US mean the gods are asking best to your power on us who depends solely on you your blessings keep power and intelligence give us intelligence give us power for taking up this work of creation so they will create the other world God's circuited first with the element and God creates their departments so that is the chapter of the the chapter what we talked about the first stages of creation it came up to uh and now they will talk about others now the sixth chapter starts this book number three chapter number six verse number one so what he says the cosmic being now if they are describing about but it is in a subtle way going in a very very subtle way God as a wished and out of that the creation coming in a subtle way was created and all the gods goddesses they are helpless though created they have no Prana so purusa entered into it and now this gods and goddesses become activated and from them they will spray it all these will come come come come down so all are coming out of them out of them out of them out of them he continued saying origin of the Virat a means this universe what we see the trees the plants the animals the bacterias whatever in this universe said what he said seeing this condition of his powers God's powers the categories disjoint and incapable of evolving the universe latent in them it is out of compassion what happened he saw God given them the power with Satya rajasthamas and all the gods and goddesses have been created first what happens a factory suppose a factory to start a functional Factory you don't hire there is nothing just to fire 1000 people you don't do that what you do you make your office planner plans your office yeah I'll be having that office selects who will be CEO who will be office in church we look which department which department which department then they say you appoint now 20 people you appoint 30 people each department no that is the way the world works here is the formula is being giving the same way seeing the all the officers have been posted in their position but they cannot do anything without the guidance of the Lord so he says seeing this condition of his power God's powers and the categories different created this joined they are not connected with each other are incapable of evolving the universe written in them in them there is the capacity to manifest and act in the world of activity and the pain that they're helpless they cannot do anything therefore what happened the omnipotent Lord then assumed his power called time he then timed T capital mahakala he then assumed his power in the form of time that in time that's why they see everything moves in time we had to come to class 5 30 will have to stop there's this evening prayer will come at six o'clock so he created time T Capital an intern simultaneously into this 23 categories and entered into all the deities and other things that as a Time is a beautiful concept and and getting time click click click click click click click click click going on and they act got activated they were to do something time time time that it is God entered into time is God here that's why mahakala Shiva Lord Shiva so mahakala entered into the objects vertical the gross entities who has no power to join assemble together having entered The Joint categories as the power of Mobility and awaken the karmic Tendencies of the jivas related all the gods and goddesses have the power to add karmic or Karma impulses inside because the whole world was withdrawn like this like our daydream daytime when you dream then what happens the day experiences all pulled into your mind and again when you wake up again it sprouts so here the karmic Tendencies of these divots let him thin them he helped them to come together into meaningful combination God Lord help them to have meaningful combination so that the world functions the 23 categories with the karmic Tendencies awakened and directed from within by the Lord generated the form of cosmic being this out of parts of their own substance so all the gods and goddesses which was created how Gods entered into them as time mahakala and that inspired them to create the karmic uh potential of each Jiva and then they projected the jivas by this stimulation of the Lord who entered into them these Cosmic categories vibrated in their parts and combined together thus forming the basis for the whole universe of moving and not moving so as he entered into those things this category started vibrating it was inactive before there is dull matter now the energy has entered into him as Time and Time Consciousness moves everyone is in not if one one can lie down and sleep but time which is this time I wanted to do this only I have to do this so they run into that that means that that Cosmic being brilliant like gold and containing all created beings in potentiality lay in the causal water for a thousand divided yes unenfolded in the cosmic shell Brahman the creation is coming so it entered gradually into the cosmic being it is represent like gold and containing all created beings in potential in him is the potentiality of all created being it is such a problem it is in a very fine level in our working it has not come into the gross level yet causal Waters in the ocean no that's a causal Waters Divine years and a thousand Divine years and there they lay down for it it takes long time for creation so more than thousands of years enfolded in the cosmic shell in the brahmana which was inside this Cosmic being is endowed with three potencies Power Of Consciousness kriya Shakti the power of action the power of enjoy so that means create it created the Consciousness that I am there to enjoy and it created the creation of the power of action and also eye to it I will enjoy the power to enjoy power to work and the power of consciousness so three things are manifested by this way he divided he the Lord divided himself on the lines of these Powers into groups of one ten and three one ten and three the Deva Shakti is the one Divine Spirit functioning to everything devastated with all of us Karma Shakti is a group of five pranas and there are five forms of functioning what are the five forms of functioning digestion you know what it's called Uh burping excretion balancing the force in the body all this despite Prana Shakti manifestation and Prana Shakti Prana upana udana to five pumps are functioning and bhakti bhakti Shakti consists of the group of three but to enjoy that who will enjoy at that make a devotee an Adidas we get our life's joy and suffering through my own Karma by someone's infringing on our Karma and by some unusual unforeseen causes physical nature Nature's command so there is how many you got Karma Shakti is group of five pranas and their effect five five ten bhakti Shakti group of three ten plus three at that three three plus ten thirteen and Karma Shakti Deva Shakti is one Divine functioning to everyone so Divine sakthi is one then comes Karma Shakti Karma Shakti is the five Prana and its effect five five ten ten plus one till 11 and last is the bhakti Shakti who will enjoy bhakta who can enjoy that bhakti Shakti bhakti shaktis in the Antarctic level subjectively eleven plus three put in drama they say knowledge okay time is almost ending this Virat or Cosmic being is the soul of everything he is a part of paramaha his first Incarnation for he is said to have entered into it in him all living beings are created the birattu has three aspects in association with indrious at that more in association with the deities ADI Deva and in association with the body or the bhuta so this is another explanation means the association with Indios in association of the deities in association with the body in association with The Prana he functions as 10 in the heart he functions as one so anyhow this is the way God started creating things so we will read from verse number 10 next time we have finished up to verse number nine 3.6.9 we ended so we shall start on 10 verse a year diversification of the limbs of the birator what benefit will you get out of that the unlimitedness of the Lord's Glory so it is for knowledge the ancient sages thought in so many ways for those who have time energy the people used to spend time the now thinking we are going out of the history creation but now we are getting involved into Christian sristi knowing how the creation has been done huh it's a uh unnecessary thing but not unnecessary because those who want to think of God then they can think oh the creation has come this way God has entered into everything so everything is God so to see the world as God so we end here and and Om Shanti Shanti shantiom that's up SRI ramakrishna Paramus to so we'll be meeting again at 7 30 for our class on what Shanti Gita the peace song and now we can do some question explain why it was created I give the example in line of this to understand this suppose in your people are working whole week very heavy work and in the weekend they go to drive 500 mile distance and taking the trouble take the car take the food driving no rest and then go to the hotel and night rest and they go for fun little bit why do you do that you could have slept very well in your room after you have worked and tired so it is working more for fun people go for skiing good but why skiing and he fell and broke your arm how much time you take to practice that skiing and this and that no so people do that for fun so if people can do that God also okay he thought that I am I am the only a reality okay but I want to pray how shall I pray I'll be many I I myself will be many I'll play with myself you know that's why people keep so many mirrors in their room room or in in the dark room to see himself or herself how he looks he looks hundreds in 100 mirror he will be reflected hundred ways so this is for fun so that is the explanation there is no real child play by the child play it is Child's Play there is no meaning but it's for fun but we do it because we have some desire to do it because our ego has entered into it no desire it is not it is not for want not for one for anything the job after doing whole week's job getting the salary in your pocket you know don't no one is guarding you to drive 500 miles and then it's a laborious thing you have worked hard just relax in your room watch television eat sleep enjoy since that is the point example normally but really ramakrishna explained this way it is called only for joy anything is there no question so okay very good here are two people I see okay so we end them any any other question um foreign foreign
