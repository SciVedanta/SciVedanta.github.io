[Bhagavatam - 2.7 ( Book 2, 7 Chapter)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99vHl4EJJe4)

[Music] the destroyer of the demons kang and chanuro the dear darling of devaki and the world teacher teacher of the universe that i salute him again and again home peace peace peace so we are late little few minutes but we are in the chapter we are reading the bhagavata book 2 chapter 7 we start here so last verse was that the bhagavad 45 verse of the last chapter said oh sage i shall now narrate to you narada you're just talking to narada oh no i shall now narrate to you according to their importance the accounts of the maha visnu in a sport of divine incarnation that's called the lila avatara account which will erase the impurities that the years have acquired through hearing about worldly matters and which are in themselves extremely attractive and sanctifying to hear so he said that now i am going to talk about lila avataras the other he was talking about the previously the creation of the universe and the whole universe is his body and the beer art as if he's a kind personality in him the all the planes hindus are put in plains and more planes all the planes are in his bodies different levels like that is a cosmic now this is not human appearance this is the only a conceptual universe in which everything is permitted by bhagavan that is the idea now here now this chapter deals with the lila lila means when god comes as human personality then he sports his every action is just for giving a spiritual boosting to all individuals so how he appeared in different incarnations so those are described and how these incarnations were born in out of whom all these names and other things are there this entire chapter i'll just get a glimpse running running running over it then we'll enter into the next chapter which is the eighth chapter which talks about bhakti so it says the brahma said you said this conversation was going on between brahma and naruto so he's asking about the glory of the lord and and that we said the other time this he says that you know everything all the vedas are nothing but narayana's expressions austerity yoga all etc nothing but narayana there is even the gross object of the universe the trees plants sun moon stars everything is permeated by narayana narayana is the only reality that we have read before now he says brahma said when the prime minister booted the earth at the bottom of the ocean the lord took up the form of the cosmic bore but not human but this is also leela why the earth was submerged into the ocean lord took the form that means this as it is happening probably it happened like that when the los angeles will go under the ocean is it not and soon the calcutta calcutta will go under the ocean like it has happened with dwarka dwarka the krsna's holy kingdom that went on away ocean engulfed like that when it is all engulfed that time means deluge came or something yeah when it happened then the lord took the form of the cosmic bush that the giant bore and what he did the embodiment of all jugglers he comes out of what people did so many auspicious sacrifices fire sacrifices and out of this merit which comes that is the boar came out and that was the previous concept when you do a specific sacrificial fire fire and put oblation with mantras and things then your desired things will come up so all everything you can get out of jagna so this is the result of great jugna the sacrificial fire in order to lift up the earth the earth is going down into the ocean so the big giant boar came languages head pulled out the earth up above he tore the ushers to pieces with his task as indo-split mountains with thunderbolt when the thunderbolt stops pause they it cracks now all the mountain tops are scattered and it pierces through that so similarly this power of that and bore giant cosmic ball he did he tore the ashwas those who are creating trouble to kill the asuras with the purpose the same purpose to kill that asuras to destroy the demons god appears this is the main thing but taking a boar form because the asuras are so giant ordinary human form will not be able to kill them so so he has came with such force that he were killed as the son of prajapati ruchi by his wife akuti the lord took for first birth under the name of sujagna and we got two devotees the name is and his way wife dakshina in his incarnation as su jagna he raised the suffering of all beings in the three worlds after this work he was called hari the removal of misery by saying muni so these are all things i do not know much so i am bhumani this moon those who are good at the quranic stories so they will enjoy it but for all of you also i don't think it is we understand much of it unless you know the story and history right no but we respect and read them he was born kardama prajapati another incarnation and his wife devahuti as kapila kupil along with nine sisters he imported the knowledge of the atman to his mother kopila who being thus cleansed of all impurities of the heart and the worldly attachment resulting their form attained liberation in that very light and became one of the spirit that was embodied as kapila being pleased with this age atri who prayed to him for offspring the lord said to him i have offered myself as your son so he incarnated under the famous name so dr was born anyhow this type of description are there so so all different incarnations came manu manavataro all attending great reputation of incarnation of so all these are names for me because i do not know the wonderful stories bhagavat pandits they can explain these areas very well because they know the different historical historical or mythical stories and lastly he says as parasurama of all rival prows has destroyed in 21 of campaigns the tribe of shatrias whose numbers had been permitted to increase forming a meanness to the world who oppress the brahmanas who had given off this straight path of dharma and who behaved as if they were a veritable thorn in the side of humanity going to his condensation towards us the lord who is the master of maya was born as rama then rama was born in the line of ikshaku reluctant that much story we know little bit rama was born in the family lineage and obedience to his father swiss rama what he did he exiled himself in the forest along with his wife sita and brother lakshmana they are the ten-headed raksasaur ravana got annihilated by rama when in in his anger at the distant sita's fate he wanted even like sri rudra to destroy the city of the enemy the terrible look of his reddened eyes began to burn all the aquatic creatures in the ocean then boruna the lord of the seas was forced to even the through the ocean that what is that story they do to make a way probably ravana his enemy and abductor of his wife who rendered the quarters white by radiance of the stumps of the tusk of the celestial elephant swahili still adhering to his chest and who would walk over the battlefield in the great pride would be rendered lifeless even by the tongue of his bow this is rama's glory gun now krishna incarnation is talking about krishna so i have skipped so many verses so we are in the verse number 26 krishna incarnation now he will be born as krishna and the balram as is our part in order to save the earth from the high-handedness of asuras born as kings and will perform actions revealing his superhuman glory in his own mysterious way incomprehensible to the human intellect so now he's saying that krishna will be born in this family and this is the balram will be coming with him which is kala means the part power full power is krsna-bhagavan and his part power manifested there will be manifesting consider this wonderful happening the death of the female monster putana that means krishna killed the putin araksasi the demon demons at the hands of the mere infant and the infant boy was child that story we all know that's why he has a big story when when kong bhagavan krishna was born beforehand all this long story is there no all the demons they all the children were killed and where is born etcetera etcetera and each child was born and then father took him to the other soul of the yamuna like all this story then and then the but the kong so was frightened his enemies had been born and he has to kill but the child is not a man boy but he's a girl and when he tried to kill dash on the ground and and the baby child slipped of the hand of a strong person like kangso and said hey you kill me you will be killed by one who is growing in what is that and therefore he senses all attendees that means they're racists and racists they can change their form easily their yogic power probably they're all learn certain powers and so they can change themselves to this form to that point to that form did that form only he changed the the what is that the deer the golden deer huh he was sent by ravana to do for him so that he can abduct mother sitta so this like putana the rak so she has come and she loved the baby wanted to feed the breast and it was mixed with poison so that the baby will suck the poison and then die that was the simple plan but then baby become such powerful that she gives such a bite and out of that the rakshasi demoness putana in the name she died a big giant and dead body was found by and the child killed easily and that is krsna avatara so people think of these stories and can really describe leela that's why the leelah avatar now [Music] consider this wonderful happening the death of the female monster putana at the hands of the mere infant baby you know the upsetting of a huge cut by the kick of the feet of a baby three months old uprooting of a pair of huge skyscraping trees with the tug of a child crawling on the pole and crawling in the forest mean four hand and feet as it passed between these such things could not happen unless the child concerned is divine so he is reviving by the blessings conveyed by the shower of his look the cops and cowherds that would have died after drinking the poisonous poisoned water of the jonah river and this purification of those waters by merely indulging in water sports therein which had the effect of expelling the terrible poisonous and many tongued kalyan these occurrences could not happen unless he were divine so he's talking about how the kaliyo the [Music] that big snake which has put in venom into the water and the cows are going and they are drinking that water and they are dying and then krishna then jumped into the river and killed that kalia and all these stories how it is possible for a boy unless he is god and his this divine play is going on people think about the glory of krishna so the killing of the putana raksasi the and the killing of this the snake what is the name of the snake now no [Music] [Music] anyhow so he said i should not confuse people by giving wrong information but these are the stories of this early childhood of krishna will you talk about more of the philosophy but this has his own charm those who know detail i forgot i yelled so hard but i never paid much attention [Music] [Music] now that he up on imagine naval powers prows my powers would save the gopas from the first fire while they would be lying asleep on jonah's bank in imminent danger and that he along with the balrama would again transport them end mess from another forest fire asking them to just keep their eyes closed meanwhile such act must be surely be deemed divine so forest fire no and bhagavan stopped that saved us society said the people saved his friends with the help of balarama that is his mother jason i would find that all strings and similar binding materials that she could lay hand on would be insufficient to bind him and that she would be seeing all the world in his yawning mouth at first with doubts about his reality and then full understanding of it these are all indication of his divinity that that story that it is joshua he said you have you have eaten makhan no you have stolen makkah and didn't you eat it no no no i didn't eat my own then let me see ah and in the mouth a spread mouth she saw my god the whole world know so the mother jason would find and that's why you want to string the baby not to go outside and do naughty things and when he tried to die so it took her and tried to die and the boy becomes big so big that that's that does not you cannot tie with it so he collected and she collected another rope added with it and doing as much rope she can collect but krishna becomes so big the baby becomes so big say mother then saw the bishop on a great grand so to believe all this is humanly possible so these are divine play actually bhaktas live with this type of similar this type of lila the play it's called the divine play god's play god is all powerful he does all these things to bring faith in us that there is a divine spirit that nanda another story would be freed by him from the fear of disciples some burunda that the gopis what is that cycles of the burundu burundu was angry with him now what happened under the father none the story is what none though that nando would be freed by the krishna from the fear of the cycles of buruna buruno was angry and he was pouring rain probably that the gopas would be set free from the cave in which boma surah the son of maya surah would be setting them in that at the night of gophers fast asleep after the hard level of the day would be lifted to boi kunto these are all stories out there who are lifted to bay kunto who are sleeping and all these are indication of his divinity when on the gopas failing to make the due sacrificial offering to indra then indra got mad the latter would sin turn in shall reign that much we know that's why you see the baby krishna holding govardhana with the finger like that the entire mountain covering like that and that is nothing for him to hold the mountain and and boruno is trying to poor reigns and this because he didn't offer they did this they're offering love to krishna and not to indra so hindu the god of rain got angry what you dare to do that so i said punish so what indra can buruna can give burun gives torrent children and torrentially in every house will be flooded and submerged and all will die but to protect them you know don't worry okay pull like that whole mountain and you all come under this mountain so rain will go over the mountain and you will be accepted and that way the krishna saved the entire and baruno was defeated in that way when because they are failing to make the due sacrificial offering to indra the latter indra would send torrential rain to destroy the whole brazil the lord then at the tender age of seven only a child of seven years child would be protecting the coward settlement by holding with a single hand the govardhana mountain over them for seven days as if it were a mere mushroom so so this is the power can anyone do seven years boy raising the entire mountain and torrential rain is coming and the people took shelter under that mountain and the rain didn't affect them while engaged on moonlit nights in the rashford lands with the gopis of the brindavan gujarat's sentiments have been heightened by the prolonged and rapturous strains of his flute he would be destroying emissaries of kubera trying to carry away the gopikas so there is another story you know you know this story mostly we know krishna praying the fruit and all the gopis lovers of krishna in the night and they'll all heard the voice this is where from the the music is coming the plute playing is going on so all rushed and meet krishna in the moonlit night so wild engaged on moonlit nights in the rashford dance with the gopikas at bindaban and he would be destroying the emissary of kubera trying to carry away the gopikas so he [Music] destroyed the kubera's emissaries who came to carry away the gopis that story i do not know the following are among those that would meet with destruction at his hands when his krsna's and they are all killed who are the the wrestler of kong show the elephant kubo lawyer of pito when he was he was playing in the state telling the story of childhood on he started with the baby krishna sucking the breast of mother and that demon came he killed that demon lady who and then saying as he is now growing now all these stories of krishna playing food flute and this and that but now kang song asked hey you come to my i have not seen you for a long time come to my kingdom and when he came so he engaged the see the prows of that with the wrestler big wrestler the the what you call the court wrestler child who can wrestle and kill so many people and the baby a child of how much he was 12 years old maybe 13 years old because bhagavan krishna left ben down and never went back when he was about 12 to 13 yes according to bhagavata so the 12 13 years boy and kong want to kill him so he engaged the royal what you call wrestler the big wrestler which is the top of the kingdom and to engage fighting with him but he killed him maybe but 12 years boy killed that big wrestler then they gave it to that okay let me he is so powerful let him fight with a elephant the big giant elephant so these are the names of that the wrestler of kancha the elephanta whose name is kubalaya peter then ultimately kongsho kala javana naruka surah oh so many names seven powerful bulls sombra seeing men becoming more and more stunted in intelligence and lifespan and therefore less and less capable of comprehending his teachings the vedas he would be born as bachelor in sattabati so next after that his message will be forgotten then he will be born as best them and would divide the tree of the vedas into different branches to be preserved by different sections of scholars so it is like what you call the prediction it please the prediction what is called in the book uh in christianity it is no and judaism the book is there where they say prediction now it will happen uh that will be god will be born this way and his power will be like this so it is just this type of prediction naruto is hearing prophecy other divine manifestations next when person passwording nature becomes strong adherent to vedic rights therefore become powerful and thus a menace to the world's welfare like the asuras possessed of the wonderful aerial vehicle built by maya and used by them for destructive purpose then we'll be born as buddha with a form that will charm and attract mind of those men of asura temperament towards him and to the atheistic philosophies that he would be propounding in order to draw them away from the misuse of vedic rights so he is saying the buddha will be born next after this next when even the places of good men and the excellence of shri hari ceased to be hard when the vedic teachers turn to be all atheists because buddhism takes to nihilism negative negative negative no god no this so at the downgrade level of buddhism vedic teachers start to be atheist brahmanas begin to behave like sudras when vedic mantras like swaha swadha basat connected with the sacrificial rights ceased to be hard anywhere people forgot to do the sacrificial fire and we do the mantra you know that type of language went away from the society as it were people forget to do some sacrificial rituals then bhagavan would appear at the end of kali yuga a sasta for suppressing the evil spirit of kuli yuga and he says he will be born as sasta what is sastra in the function of creation as tapas myself brahma rishis and the nine prajapudis in the functioning of preservation as dharma jagna mutti manus devas kings etc and in the function of this destruction as adharmo sri rudra serpent asuras he the possessor of infinite glories and excellencies manifest himself in various ways in kali yuga they will appear in many ways anyhow these are all predictions so i am done to 39 verses because we cannot understand money as i said i don't want to confuse you that i am reading only the stories and what are these when don't to spend much time rather we'll go to the next chapter so it says the lord will be born yeah this is the yeah lord will be born this time when the society's condition will go down when the society will be like that he will be born again as buddha and after buddha again people will be agnostic and no god and they will give up all the vedic rights and rituals then i will be born like this so it is all such prediction and now we are kali knows if he is if we thought that way but it is some other description here maybe spirit is that inextricable nature of the lord's glory it may perhaps be possible for an intelligent and capable man to count and calculate the number of dust particles on this earth but not the powers and excellences of maha visnu and maha visnu the great visnu his glory cannot be understood even you can count how many particles of grains are in the earth earth grains are there god's glory is much higher than that that means if you that's why it is like we hear us put on to says no if even mother saraswati writes to tries to glorify your glory you lord shiva for time immemorial no and wisdom unfailing wisdom writes and what page not this page this surface of the earth is like a page and she continues to write all over and continues for life forever writing like that that glory of the lord cannot be expressed this we understand little bit 48th verse verse number 14. so it it may perhaps be possible for an intelligent and capable man to count and calculate the number of dust particles on the earth but not the powers and excellences of maha vishnu see how wise positions he held together the whole universe in himself while everything in it from pradhanam that means the rudimentary state of prakriti up to satta loka the most highly evolved state moved as a traffic speed by the irresistible might of his feet neither i nor you not the great sages like sanakas who came into existence before you before you means before narada other sages who came know the extent of his mysterious power how little of it could others know even adi says who has been singing his glories with his thousand mouths through all the time has not reached anywhere near its end to whom so ever the all-knowing and all-powerful bhagavan is gracious they surrender themselves wholly and in absolute sincerity at his feet and thereby overcome his deluding power of maya which others can never do such persons never entertain the idea of eye and mind with regard to the body which is food for dogs and jackals 32 that means to whomsoever the all-knowing and all powerful bhagavan is gracia that means god's grace who is fortunate to have the grace of god the simple meaning is that this we understand who can know you oh mother unless you are gracious you open your self to the to the child no so similarly to whomsoever the all-knowing all-powerful bhagavan is gracious they then surrender wholly at the feet and in absolute sincerity at his feet they take refuge in his speed and thereby overcome his deluding power of maya maya is lifted because he has taken surrender and then which others can never do such persons never entered in the idea this type of people they have no ego in them so long the ego is there god's grace does not come ramakrishna said when there is a mountain the water does not accumulate in the top of the mountain water collects where the bottom no so when do you go i am such big god's grace does not come over there god's has come to those who said i'm nothing that that beautiful story that that's the story the cow story the cow normally normal voice is what the cow says that type of noise they make and ramana said because say hamba means i am i am i am see that's why there is so much suffering for the cows bull bull bull suffers because i i so that's why he suffers then he said but you see then they are slaughtered and their meat is eaten and this and that and that trails today they bring and then they make a what you call string out of the trails of the uh of the cows and then in india two my name blow up the cotton when you bring the cotton to make the quilt they keep it in the sun and they go on striking with a cord and that card made of the cows entrails and then strike with them and that makes a noise and that noise is a realistic experience we can cannot then this makes a noise [Music] [Music] and i have transferred into thou lord you are everything i am nothing you are everything to whom so rav said then the cow is released from all suffering so that means he's teaching that so long we have ego i am somebody i am something i understand how you the god's grace though tries to help us but it does not catch rain rock falls on the top of the mountain but water does not grow there it goes down where it is too i am humble so the humble person gets a god's grace so such persons never entertain the idea of eye and mind with regard to his body and this body is what they say food whose food jackals in the in the in the in those days we have now township so much township jackals are not found otherwise if someone is born body is dead what they do they stride their burn and humburn bodies are remain here and there so jackals should use them for eating that means this body and you are proud of your body and your mind say no and then god's grace you will get 43 births oh dear one by his grace god's grace i have gained a little love inside into his spiritual power power that's called the yoga maya and bhagavan krishna has the power it's called yoga maya shakti maya means one that which is not there that appears to be true the magicians can create something which is not there similarly yoga maya is by his grace i have understood this a little into his spiritual power the what the god's power yogic power of creation what is that you you missed inaudible his wife their children and then he goes on giving the names pranti deva dilipa sugravi uttanka sibi all these mentioning great names arjuna vidura all these about 10 20 names are here all these have been have by his grace come to understand something about the play of the lord's yoga maya and have overcome it so it's by by god's grace these few people whose name he's mentioning they have overcome the maya spell by the grace of krishna by the grace of bhagavan women sudras and even men of lobart like hunas sabharas and even brute creation can overcome the yoga maya if they in life follow a footstep of their lords devote devotees so anyone who have no opportunity to do puja rituals this that of that that's why they are talking about sudras working class people 24 hours engaged in work they are not capable of studying scripture doing puja they will also be freed from maya sutras new logo and birth like hoons sabharas they were tribal tribal people that tribal culture they cannot think of atman brahman or god love even they even brute and those are brutal people creation can overcome this creation brute creation brutal people brutal animals by yoga maya why if they in day in following the footsteps of the lord's lord's devotees they follow the footsteps of the other saints other devotees sadhu that's the idea those who are the i cannot do but i follow the footsteps of the sadhus then how much more can we can men who have chances of hearing about the spiritual philosophy from competent teachers attain it that is we are more fortunate he says that by god's grace even those who have no culture no spiritual culture no environment in their life to do the spiritual practice they simply follow the footsteps of the holy people can overcome and now those who are able to listen to the harikatha the glory of the lord huri how fortunate are they they will get much more benefit out of it so 47 the supreme bhagavan is the same as what is known as brahman we are talking about krishna he is not krishna he is a supreme god is the same which is known as vedanta called brahman is all brahman brahman is what the spirit the supreme spirit who is of the nature of unbroken bliss untouched by sorrow peaceful fearless always the same all is unaffected now this bhagavata is such a book when they want to say use so many vocabulary to put that idea in our brain that fat unborn we say unborn beyond time stress condition must finish but bhagavath starts in 47 verse and 48 lombard line there is no hyphen gap see it starts like in one part and there is no hyphen gap itself it goes to the other so i am saying that that brahman is what that brahman we can take this idea of brahman in other areas he used what bhagavads people say bhagavat is always bhakti kunta bhaktiv but he says bhakti that bhagavan is brahman statement in bhagavatam party say seventh verse if we can say shatter [Music] so the basis language is so profound and so so and he has this flowery expression so much expression endless expression so 47 verses the supreme bhagavan is the same as who is known as brahman the supreme spirit who is of the nature which is brahman is of what nature nature of unbroken please oj on broken please so unbroken bliss untouched by sorrows peaceful it is fearless always the same always unaffected of the nature of consciousness stainless beyond the opposites of cause and effect even the vedic statements cannot describe him fully all the vedas are trying to talk about brahman but they cannot describe it nor can ritualistic actions requiring the help of many accessories which requires the ritualistic actions which require many help of accessories help one to attain him they will not be able to attain that krishna that which is buttless deathless motion like that maya the cause of impurities is ashamed maya who creates all the imperfection in us maya is veiling our wisdom eyes maya even runs away when he sees krishna when he sees the atman because he is saccidananda therefore maya have no place there so maya the cause of impurities is a same demand to stand before him the self-control sages having overcome the waywardness of the mind and become established in the supreme cell of absolute self-mastery abundant even the means that took them to this state since they realize that state as natural to them just as indra the master of the clouds no need not preserve instruments to dig a well for his use and the indoor does not need a need to dig a well getting water because all water is under his control so similarly the supreme cell becomes one becomes to self-control sage having overcome the waywardness of the mind and become established to be self-supreme self in absolute mastery they also abandoned that type of thought and took them to the state since they realized the state as natural to take that state of krishna to take their mind goes where the ramakrishna said that i like to test the sugar and not eat when to be one with sugar so they these people realizing they come down and enjoy the bliss of krishna he the omniscient he mr krishna the lord omniscient omnipotent lord 49 mars who is well known as the best doer of the fruits of performing the prescribed duties and the rights is also the being who grant moksha the highest good to experience the spirit in man who is a part of that immortal being is never destroyed when the perishable body resolves all vedanta body goes but the spirit does not go all the body resolves into its elements just as the sky is not destroyed when the pot contained in it is destroyed pot can be destroyed but space remains the pot space and the big space are the same the space is now here the space of this temple and the place outside is there any difference it is the one space even the space of the wall goes away and it will remain the same so similarly brahman is also so oh child 50th person have no i have now described to you in brief this is in brief the nature of all the nature what is the nature of all perfect being bhagavan with the source of the universe there's nothing existing that is not included in sri hari the original being who is neither a cause nor an effect this brief account of the manifestation of the lord is what is called the and this is called the bhagavata bhagavata story means this is bhagavatam bhagavan story the story of god the supreme being himself gave the knowledge of it to me i have also given to you a brief account of the lord's glories and attributes you please elaborate them you elucidate it with the help of your imaginative power in a way that will generate devotion in the mind of men who is saying all these things brahma brahma is saying to narada narada i told you in brief the glory of the lord you have your own skill you elaborate it and go on spreading the message of the lord's love and glories and his lila so you inducinate it with the help of your imaginative power in a way that will generate devotion so that people get fall in love with god you pray say that way so it goes to everyone srihari who is the soul and support of all god is the soul and support of all so you go on spreading this message of lord god so that ordinary people fall in grow in devotion for god 53 that is the last part of this seventh chapter whoever describes and hears with faith this account of the lord's maya or his mysterious manifestation of glory and delights in so doing will not be infatuated by maya so maya cannot do anything we will not be able to do anything to a person who can be finds delight in this thinking of lord in this way where whosoever describes that means it is talking about the preaching let this message be preached to the world that god is the only reality god has created everything god's power is everywhere and we have to worship god with humility no ego and when humility comes god's grace will automatically come upon us and we will be able to free so listening is good but also talking about him is good so last verse i will sanskritin [Music] will not be able to delude that person who goes on thinking of the lord's glories as also describing it to others so that others grow in love and devotion to god so this is this end of chapter 7 i do not know how much you enjoyed it but anyhow om shanti shanti shantihi harihom thatsa sri rama of course i didn't do any justice because 53 verses i've read in one hour each verse can be taken the pandits will take one verse no hurry hurry ten thousand people will be sitting over there and they'll with music with explanation with stories elaborating okay yes brahma is saying you narada go and preach this message to the people so that they get the best out of it in this is is there any book the stories of bhagavatam stories from the bhagavatam yeah you can find huh so answer is sami what are from buddhism book name is stories from the bhagavatam you can find also sorry also so i am responding to your question yes there is a book available it is called the stories from the bhagavatam i think not author publisher maybe swami buddhist it is a 2 2018 edition you can inquire in the auditor's room yeah another question in parts of this shiva mahima sutra says how can i describe you when you be on the mind body senses when the self is limited unborn yes i refer to that yeah the verse said that in the shiva muhim no statements to true that the your muhima is so great your glory is so great no one can describe how can i describe you well beyond the mind body yes when the self capital is limitless unborn and eternal how can it be known yeah that's why it cannot be known but it is known when when you merge and come back as a in your own body you don't some people may merge in god forever forget that but those people who are called jivan muktas are liberated while in the spree in this life so they when they come down so they enjoy they can enjoy not us so when one is moving to god and going going going and enters into the divine entity forget about total ego then they are one with that cosmic reality but when after that it comes to body consciousness they again enter into the body and that time they enjoy the bliss of god it's called the bhabha mukha and other things okay thank you you
