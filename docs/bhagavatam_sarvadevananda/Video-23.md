[Bhagavatam - Book 1. Chapter 18 - Verse 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f23tNN4kQ0)

[Music] we salute the world teacher jagad guru sri krishna who is the son of vasudeva and destroyer of the demons kongsho and chanura and the most dear and darling to mother devaki from peace peace peace be unto us all so we are today to start with the 18th chapter of this bhagavata the book i am reading that has it the page eighty eight zero so what we read the other time the suta the narrator was describing that this is the bad time this bhagavan the lord krishna who has come down in the human form he has left his body and as soon as it left all the evil forces they raised their hood like now you see what is going on all over the world look at that the human mentality what is going on so and then so again to [Music] bring back as if the righteousness which is called dharma when every person has his own duties and responsibilities they forgot people are behaving which is unmannerly selfish curing hateful sinful so this is a very worst time so king pariksit then knowing that he made a jagna and he there after the jaguar he started the holy blessing to come for him purified said these words when he found that this evil force which is called the kali kali we call kali yuga is the iron age iron is means where dharma the righteousness is reduced as if like dharma appeared before him like a he saw i've seen it harm that a bull stands on the four legs but now the bull has lost other three legs the righteousness and good time is gone and this is the curly the bad time so all the three support of the bull which is dharma righteousness is gone and lost so feeling that and also see the mother earth is weeping and crying and seeing the condition of this children who live in the world because when i unrighteousness raises his hood naturally all the good people get punished unnecessarily now this sun enough in his parikshit he got he was the king that time so he then opened his one seat of soul in his hand and looked like jama the god of death himself kali the embodiment of all unrighteousness standing before him and seeing parikshit's valor and strength he became little fearful kali became fearful and submitted out of here he submitted to the king the emperor pariksit emperor i am willing i am willing to stay wherever you order me but in every place i dwell i am sure to see this picture of your arm with bow and arrow so barak is going to destroy this evil so embodiment of that evil is the kali and as as the arrow and bow and arrow is targeting him to kill wherever he goes so he surrendered to the emperor pariksit and said that wherever i go i am fearful give me some place to leave and he surrendered at the feet of the emperor or king pariksit grandson of arjuna so but a good person always forgives so purifier gave him not killed but forgive him and then he begged for give me some place to live where shall i leave so suta said being deceased by kali he gave him four places to stay where this dark negative force will reside no he said you cannot reside in my kingdom get out because we are troubling our people which we do with negativity and all these things so he gave four places to stay in these are the places where he is gang where he's gambling he already will stay where there is gambling you will stay where there is drinking of intoxicants and you will be debauchery and slaughter take place so three places is your place that means not in every place so those people who are weak and having this type of there is the negativity leaves there the age of dark age remains there so when the curly pleaded for one more place for him to stay in the clever works it gave him another place and what is that lost gold as the fifth seed the whole world is fighting with gold now russia is fighting for what getting the wealth of our the treasure house so that they will be so there is you leave so five places that means you can what a beautiful idea that we want to see anything evil and we want to be good we need to avoid these five places or five moods five mentalities so one is the mentality that to gamble and get rich and by that point you so las vegas is our very good example people go with tons of money and go on playing and playing and exhaust everything by chance one may hot spot everyone thinking that i will get the what you call hot jackpot i'll get the jackpot but by that with that hope they exhaust everything so gambling second point is that in drinking of intoxicants no that you know where people have that too much they lose their mind they do whatever they don't understand what is going on that means it takes away their senses their understanding their everything third point debauchery and slaughter where there is some type of animalistic sacrifice or people are treated badly you know torture and this and that and the another place he has given that it is the gold for which the whole so these are the five places this uh unrighteous spirit what is called the kali kali means the iron age yuga this age is called iron age so these are the places now it has become prominent now kohli has expanded in many places so currently the hotbed of all dharma you know dharma means righteousness adharma means unrighteousness so took his abode in these five centers obedient to the command of pariksit so every man who is desirous of his own welfare should not succumb to these five places of evil though kohli exercises his influence in these places especially should be avoided by a righteous person who has instructed right living so pariksit restored to dharma they embodied as bull has three lost feet by what he gave back as it were the bull got the strength now because evil has been withdrawn from all places it is given located to these four five places so it got back his three legs as it were so that means the bull can stand now dharma and the society can stand well so what are those three first is the three lost fit is that austerity purity and fellow feeling and also comforted the earth and made her prosperous so this king parikshith by destroying the evil of this thing from the society meaning he ruled in such a way that heavy punishment will happen to this type of poor bad tendencies where there is serious so people become good the good power then could prevail and the evil forces are subdued so the dharma again rose up but he said that as a result as if the dharma the righteousness which was bull symbolic is the bull he now stood on the four legs what are the by how what is the process by which lost fit all the lost fit came back three things in life people should do austerity should maintain purity and love for all fellow feeling and also comforted the earth and made her prosperous the naturally the good people come up means society prospers love feel feeling then purity of relationship purity on suffering for god or austerity in practice all these noble things become and the mother earth again become very happy with them so it is this heroic parikshit has still now been sitting in the royal throne on which he was installed by his grandfather judish tira with the same splendor like that of his pandavas that means arjuna and judistira with fame spreading everywhere that fortunate parishion has been ruling on the throne of hastinapur that means for india or as an emperor all over india he is ruling such is the prowess of pariksit it is under his father's name is the father obi-wan knows son whose name is pariksit such as his prowess it because of the condition obtaining to in his reign that you that you have been able to start the long-lasting brahmas up to anyhow so now sutra shooter the narrator can con continues said suta said the king pariksit had once the good fortune of being saved from his death in his mother's womb by the all-powerful krsna's grace even though he was born by the missile of us that is a great story you know when he the bilis obi-wan knew if this parikshith was in the um his mother then there the war was going on and the arrow was to kill this parikshit why so that there will be nobody in the lineage of arjuna if he kills that child then there is nobody to be the inheritor of the uh king position empire position but krsna-bhagavan krishna which is special application of power that stop that effect of that sending that missile and beside anti-missile war all this like that so once then this parikh was saved by the lord himself bhagavan krishna when he was a baby he was in the moom of the mother uttara by his resignation to krishna he was he was able also to rise above all fear at the time of his death which he met with through the bite of the serpent dakshaka occasioned by the curse of brahman there is another story again another type another death when he was a king that story that that is the starting of this bhagavata also that he oil when he is the emperor he went for hunting as the kings do go for hunting hunting deer and he went inside the forest and then he got really very thirsty and does not know what to go what to find water so he went and found that there is a hermit home of the hermit so this king then went there and very politely asked the gentleman who was meditating as a brahmin she was meditating and he asked sir i am very thirsty could you give me little drinking water bhardt person the brahman the brahmin he was absorbed in deep concentration so he didn't hear then again he politely requested could you please give me a little drinking water and third time also so he was so hungry thirsty not hungry thirsty and for a little drop of water the king of the country is begging at you and you are showing a feat of meditation no so he thought so out of anger why anger came suddenly then he found a dead snake somewhere and with the arrow he picked up that and put in the neck of the sage you know then he said oh you are meditating be like shiva shiva always wears a serpent in the neck no so you meditate you are a samadhi person and i am begging for little water you cannot give me so he did that and that was the cause of another curse came upon him his boy his brahmana boy he was playing at the distance with his other friends and when he came back he saw that dad is still absorbed in his meditation and the dead snake is hanging on the hay on his neck so he said who has done this not knowing anything of the context whoever has done that we will have to die by this bite biting of this d this snake snake bite he will have to be he'll be you'll be get a bite and you will die out of the bite of this thing seven days one week seven days [Laughter] seven days so but the king did that and went back and went back but when these words came back to him that the brahman boy has cursed seeing his father being insulted thus and when his father came to know with this when the son woke up after such a time he said what has happened what did you do well i have i have cursed who has insulted you my father whoever has done he will have to die within seven days and then he said ari do not know he is your king he is the most benevolent king and he has understood his spirituality dharma in the goodness in the society are you cursing him brahman boys are so powerful whatever they say truth follows them that's the beauty of the insane brahmanas so he said you withdraw please withdraw your curse but no i won't he has insulted my father he will have to die and that hearing that word then the parikh said that oh is it yes so he handed over all the responsibilities of his kingdom to his son and then he gave up everything there and only to die wait for seven days thinking of god so that purifying himself he will give up this body so this is the second time he came and he got the advice which is this bhagavata it is said by who sukadeva this great sage sukadeva narrated the glories of ra krishna bhagavan krishna so this saved his life second time meaning that he is saved from death altogether so the second line let's say this when you read this book every line has some story back it uh like like in movie sometimes you go plus back this is flashback stories so that's why it is interesting but you have to remember these stories sometimes if you don't remember you don't enjoy the beauty of this great epic this is not ap mahabharata becoming a disciple of basha bhasa's son sukha he cut up all attachments for worldly things he means this king parikshit and at into the knowledge of the lord before he abandoned his body in the ganga so he attains we say that when you attain the knowledge then you conquer death so he parikshit conquered death again by listening to the advice of sukadeva with the son of bhagavan bhasa and this conversation spiritual conversation that saved him before his death those who always speak and hear about the excellence of lord and who seeks refuge at his feet remain unperturbed even at the time of death so suppose you are listening to that we are listening to that if we listen to this message with sincerity and love then our heart will be purified that's why at the point of death this ignorance will disappear if you constantly listen to this divine message so long as pariksit the son of evie reigned the evil curly though he had started penetrating everywhere found it impossible to cause any serious degeneration as i was telling no when this kali was cornered by the king parikshi no that it will stay only in five places and the gambling pace and the place of all this so all these places but not in the society general society will be free by his own prows he did that and now again the king parikshith is leaving his body and again koli raising his food entering into the home front into the work prone into the day-to-day life situation of the society penetrating into the situation we know that when people in the um place and when they go in different place they have their one style of lifestyle but we don't see it in the home front we don't see in the office front we don't go in into the society society should be livable for the honest people no but again this colleague raised his hood no doubt kali the cause of adharma had made his entry into the world the moment shri krishna left it bhagwan krishna left that time they tried to raise a hood and in the following that krsna's foot footsteps when pariksit was ruling he carved them but again when he is leaving his body then again the evil force is penetrating into the society pariksit who was like a honeybee in grasping the essential good and everything abstain from killing the evil called koli because there is one great excellence you may say why king parikshi did not kill the koli the dark age the dark thoughts upon the totally totally why didn't he have a list why he gave five places for them why this compassion is it not that question may come if he has killed it then the society would be permanently free from that but no what is the benefit of this age if we live in this age bad side is this everywhere rampant bad people cheat they're cheating they are miss in a sweet face sour inside saying something in one and doing something else and not living with the truthfulness honesty sincerity love which are the characteristics of a good society but it is just raising its food so koli because of the one great excellence but what is the greatness why he didn't kill this curly totally that reason is that it is very important for us to know one great excellence pertaining to this age in this age is that whatever good you do listen this is very wonderful one whatever good you do it fractifies immediately a little little spiritual practice he'll do little living a good life honest life you show give some charity love blessings to others you will find immediate joy this is the beauty of this kali yuga it practices immediately that's one part but not so they will deeds people are doing so many bad things they are not getting punishment so quickly but you are doing something good you can give get at least your in your life you can find inner peace so that is the benefit of this and second part is very important besides in the kali yuga koli aja seen occur accrues only to the sinful deeds but not to sinful thoughts you know you know our mind in spiritual life we find i want to think of holy thoughts only thoughts come hey what can you do you know but this is nothing bad if it comes in your mind unless it is in action you are free this concession is there in this age in other ways you thought this bad thought you will have to get the punishment then it was there also also even you taught something so traditional means all good people good competition among the good students to get a a plus a plus grade and all bad boys here you get y a plus how it did little something and they were you got the a plus so he says in these days this is the bad thing is that in the 20 in action if you do something you harm someone you really do something bad it's action will come in your life quickly and quickly if it comes you understand that i did that bad that's why it has come no but if i did something in my last life i am suffering now i say i am a good guy why am i suffering there is really a bit difficult to understand and consequences that we have in our mind enormous amount of bad samas impressions of different life bad thought comes evil sin thought comes anger comes frustration these are all mind but that is no sin that is not to be considered as sin as this bhagavat's opinion the beauty of this is is that you do something good you get the good result you do something bad immediately it not it will do maybe in some time other or its impact is less but mental thought is no sin kohli is like one who is cowardly before the brave but the brave before the cowardly that happens now you are a good guy a bad guy comes and bully you no his power is bro but when police comes or some gun point then he comes down to zero no so he holds no fear for the good kali the embodiment of bad the skully holds no fear for the good but like a wolf he is always vigilant and alert to pounce upon those who are thoughtless and unobservant if you are not very careful this negative forces jump up on you negative impact influence comes upon you as questioned by you i have now it is you means the king where is he as questioned by you i have now described to you the sacred story of pariksit which is intimately connected with the life and doings of krishna so this krsna's life this pariksit is intimately connected with bhagavan krishna the lord krishna all people who desire higher evolution should drink deep at the spring of the excellence of the lord revealed in his numerous actions that are fit to be remembered and comprehended that means what how can you live a holy life you just think of the holy deeds and actions krsna's life krsna's message krsna's playful days thinking of god's what you call the leela lila means divine sports if you think of that your mind becomes purified and that will give you liberal liberation so therefore the risk is now there is he said rishi said o suta suta means the narrator or narrator you are the gladiator of our hearts may you leave a thousand years and for you are broadcasting the excellence of shri krishna which confirms immortality on man who hear it whoever hear the glorious life of krishna bhagavan krishna his mind will be pure so actually you are great oh narrator you are great you are helping us to keep our mind in noble thought to us who are engaged in this long sacrificial right upon certain results a right which has made our bodies cold black from the smoke of the sacrificial fires you are bringing the invigorating drink of divine excellences the nectar that avoids in the lotus of his holy feet so we are doing sacrificial fire you know early days people used to perform sacrificial fire and then that very rigorous spiritual practice continuously you are in the oblation and the fire a flame is there we do 45 minutes some ablation actual oblation may be 10-15 minutes before and afterwards we start to ignite the fire in the homophile no and but suppose day and night you are standing before the fire huge fire that your your skin will be black skin yeah that's why he's saying long sacrificial rights how we are performing and we do not know even whether they shall release the result or not you do some karma you get the effect this jagna the sacrificial fire you offer oblation to gods and by the gate and grace of god you can attain your desired result but i do not know whether they shall get or not but o narrator you are describing this holy story of pariksit connected with lord krishna i am getting bliss immediately see the result of the karma in the sacrificial fire whether i will get it or not i do not know but i am getting immediately the heat of this fire is making my skin dark and it is austerity i am doing but your words are giving me instantly a peace in my heart and my love for god is invoking in me so i am thankful to you no a right which has made our bodies cold black from the smoke of the sacrificial fire you are bringing the invigorating drink of divine excellence the nectar that abides in the lotus of his holy feet that you are think yeah you are bringing our mind into that's why meditation is much higher listening to holy words are much higher than that of ritualistic performance ritualistic performance you should have to do perfectly every item should be there suppose your worship time you see how the nuns do the flower we bring so much flower and you go to siva prana mataji she picks up the flowers a little spot here and throw away a little throw away how much whether shorting out cleaning perfectly doing collecting everything properly sitting in the altar this way difficult it will purify our heart of course it is done for god but when we listen directly the glory of the lord our mind gets saturated with pure thoughts so that is the great bloom for our inner peace 13 verse heaven is not equal in value even to a small part of what is attained by contact with holy men that's why it is called heaven you go to people every religion talks about heaven no why here is suffering here is old age here is disease but what is our concept of heaven there is no old age you will be always young there will be no lack of food you can get plenty of food whatever you want to eat no your youth will remain forever so these are the concept so after day performing such rituals you may go to that heaven but i am feeling this heavily you are here now when you are talking about god and nectar-like thing so even even is not equal in value to a small part of what is attained by contact with holy men now you are a holy person you are teaching me they talk about holiness about christian shri krishna and his life and pariksit how he ruled the country righteously honestly so listening to these holy things is giving me the joy more than heavenly joy even liberation is not equal to it that's why it is called holy holy association is so valuable there is a statement you get touch of holy company holy people talking about god that impact even for a moment bhavati bhavar nava it has the capacity to take you across the ocean of world and worldliness and sadhu and sadhu-sanga is like a boat which carries you over the river of the worldliness and takes you to the other sore of liberation so he says that that's why his ramakrishna in the gospel you'll find he talks about holy company holy company holy company that's why holy company our holy reading of the holy book holy association lifts our mind uplifts our mind that's why he says even liberation is not equal to it holy company is giving instant joy how worthless and ignoble then should be the worldly enjoyments now even heaven becomes meaningless what the question of earthly enjoyments are fun who is the worth the ganesha that will be surprised with the hearing about the lord's excellencies which are considered as their secure asylum by all spiritual experience oh lord one you have taken refuge in the lord who is the one resort of all great men describe the noble and sanctifying deeds of that hari srihari to us who are so keenly desirous of hearing about it so he's saying oh good learned one you are the most person of wisdom a man of wisdom you have taken refuge in the lord you yourself have taken refuge in the lord and describe that noble sanctifying deeds what the lord did it in his childhood in his adulthood how he destroyed the demons how he played with the gopis with a pure love and when he was a young child so and we are keenly desirous to hear about that we are here we wish to hear about that you please help us 16 verse the divine knowledge which the sage suka communicated to parikshita a vast intellect and which helped him to attain to the feet of maha vishnu may you be pleased to narrate to us in all details he is saying that sukadeva the son of vyasa related the story of krishna and his birth and his divine play but purishiti is now gone sukhadev is gone this narrator he was in the congregation and he has a memory photographic memory so he is narrating these stories that's why he is being requested that you give us that wisdom that stories of the divine sport so that i can contemplate on rome them and become free from worldliness it is coming because meditation are of three types we talk about this again and again what are the three types one is you meditate on the divine form say christ you meditate the god as christ is in me god has rama is in me rama krishna in me no so you think of the divine form his eyes his hand his whole personality you know the divine personality or you can if mind does not get settled you can think that this christ in the walking in jerusalem going into the mount on the mount and then giving the sermon there think of that you can move with christ alone this kalila we can think of ramakrishna that in the dakshinashar where he was meditating was preaching the message of love so you can think you can go there you can sit with him mentally you can go there this is divine play who cannot contemplate on the form divine form of the personality you can on this action god in action is moving here touching someone singing songs going to samadhi and coming down again again encouraging people and bringing joy to everyone so you can leave your mind in this consciousness so he's saying that those accounts of divine actions those accounts of divine actions and excellencies are the expression of god's unique spiritual power and they were imparted to pariksit and this for his good and for their edification of all devotees so this question this divine spouse and all the glorious stories of bhagavan krishna was said to pariksit when he was going in the death bed for seven days seven days this message was narrated by the sage deva and that same story oh you narrator you please help us because we are not present that time they do now we we are not present there but we are getting this book because of the narrator what he spoke that was again came by generation to generation and was recorded and we get this record that way so original speech was given by the sage sukadeva the son of bhagavan basu now the narrator said verse number 18. how wonderful do myself born in a low family i have been elevated by the regard you learned and high bond personages are extending to me great men can even be by their words it is the worrying fears generated by the inferiority complex of a low birth he's saying i was born not very highly educated only my memory is sharp i have heard this narration so i am relating that narration but you are sages you are so great that you are praising me for this therefore it is you are great it is humility how much more must be the purifying and in living effect of repeating the divine name of him who is infinite and omnipotent who is called endless because he causes the manifestation of endless graces in his devotees and who is the only support that holy men seek that means he's saying you are praising me but how great is god whose glory i am going to sing if you can this he this god krishna he is not a man so he says that krishna the omniscient he's infinite brahman that's the point you know when people talk about krishna and make a cult of it krishna is the only way krishna this krishna don't limit krishna here it is said they what in the end living effect of repeating the divine name of god who is infinite and omnipotent who is called endless because he causes the manifestation of endless grace in his devotees and which is the only support that the holy men seek all good people only want to take support at the feet of bhagavan the lord krishna no you call krishna equal brahman you call whatever name you give christ buddha whatever but here is the question of krishna so the krishna devotee is making makes sometimes a very demanding demanding what you call proposition that krishna is the only god because krishna is ananta krishna is omnipretent omnipresent no but this brahman is krishna is brahmana that is the thing this bhagavat is telling no so krishna is not a man so krishna is brahman himself enough has been said just to indicate his excellencies which nothing can equal or eclipse imagine rejecting the suit of brahman and other powerful deities who were mad after her she the goddess of all wealth and good fortune felt attracted by his excellencies and sought the humble service of his feet although he cared not a jot for her the water which brahm brahma poured at his feet and which flowed down washing his nails because of the holy ganga sacred enough to purify even mahesh sharashiva who other than that maha visnu the grantor of liberation deserves to be addressed as the bhagavan that means he's saying who you can think that he is the god this this krishna is the god himself so brahma even and other gods they take refuge in krishna so you have to think that krishna is the ultimate god and you take refuge in him alone by in inches intense devotion to his feet the introspecting sages easily overcome the deep rooted attachment to the body and attend to the state of paramahamsa which is the final of spiritual endeavor and is characterized by universal love and peace and passive understanding o great vedic sermons or sages in response to your question i shall tell you what little i know of the subject but the effort of even the greatest philosophers and theologians to depict maha vishnu's greatness is limited by smallness of their capacity just as a small bird's flight is in their immeasurable sky these are what's saying lord vishnu is so great is greater than that of other gods that is to glorify who is your own chosen ideal you always glorify he is the greatest so others are just offering their salutation to you so he's saying ultimate this book's ideal is krishna and he is called maha vishnu muhammad's name is the great vishnu visnu means who resides in the heaven he has his forearms no shell in one hand padma the lotus another hand some chakra chakra discus chakra the mace and padma the lotus his forehand holds these four things one chakra means the destroy the evil the circle krsna's chakra it it will protect you power gadha the mess to destroy the evil these are the two for evil and flower lotus and shankar this conch shell these are the signs of auspiciousness and devotion so this krishna they glorified that that krishna is called mahabishnu maha means great vishnu means the lord narayana he's the great great great lord even shiva and other gods worship his feet to show the greatness of narayana so you can think of your ideal also my rama krishna is the greatest of the god no these are all manifestation question of manifestation of the sachidan on the manifestation so he says i'll be very happy to say what i know little i'll relate to you so the book starts almost here no already as a ticket so end here in discretion of pariksit we'll start from verse number 24 so 18 chapter 24 book number one will start next day good question okay we end here um [Music] now we'll have question answer let us see some questions so nishant is putting a question when ramakrishna left his body he appeared and said i have only moved from one room to another so is it that when krishna left the body he did not really leave the world only in appearance is the other room the other side of maya outside the imminent or just different layers of subtlety within maya itself since brahman is not different from his sakti here the question is that that's why she krishna as you said krishna left the body physically he is not there no we don't see the physical body when krishna passed away so his physical body disappeared means it was cremated or something as anyone's body will be done but the krishna principle is not dead even now people are getting the vision of krishna so actually he is in a subtle body and god keeps these bodies for the welfare of his disciples thousands of years may pass no christ is dead or still alive in one sense he is dead is it not in one sense he is dead his physical body is no more but he is dead no today also some saint in the world is having the vision of christ he now at this point so no they don't die that way they are by the for the good of the world they keep their subtle bodies that body works for the liberation of others you are praying to krishna krishna krishna krishna god appears in the form of krishna he is the physical body he is not a physical body in the divine body in this pure my mental state you can experience that and i also heard that they can also appear in the physical body because god has all power what is the problem of it so we need not have to think that krishna being dead means he is physically dead and dead forever no one dies even for us even if we die do we die totally no we remain in a subtle body and subtle body takes another body no and again come back to the physical body until and unless we become totally absorbed in god and vedantic way that i lose my all ego identity with the body mind emotion etc and you go all merges and then i become one with the lord till then dis coming and going coming and going going on and god also when he comes in a human body but the only by the compassion out of his compassion he keeps maya in him so and this rotation of birth and death continues right and those subtle body can appear to you when you are intensely meditating on that divine personality that's why christ can be even experienced now and then rama krishna caitanya buddha those who are worshippers in that way they see even the gods and goddesses god send god it says they are already subtle that's why this question does not come there but when he embodied being with flesh and bone walked in the ground for their case we don't see their body but they don't give up their body swami vivekananda said in one place bhagavan sriram krishna has left his mortal frame but he has not given up his body yet he will be working to that body for a long period of time to help the humanity to give them the eternal bliss and peace so other room other room means in a subtle body the other side of maya that is the transcendental state if you say other side of the maya where there is no maya so there is no maya then he is one he is in his own divine absolute state omniscient omnipotent beginningless endless that brahman state but when he takes a subtle form and subtle form takes a good gross form so that gross form is gone but subtle form he remains for the good of the devotees to give their son to guide them to him hold on their spiritual life to inspire them ah it is advisable to stick with one type of meditation or practice other types as well like lila dhanu what do you recommend i think that i have heard that you try what guru has told you to do meditate in that same way but it will be also helpful when the mind is not settling down you can try this meditation on the lila the divine sport you can think rama krishna you can think ramakrishnan induction is sure you can see that he is going to the kali temple and you can follow him living your mind will be with sriram krishna then you can go into the enter into the kali temple with him and you can find that he's singing kali song and singing singing he's going into ecstasy and losing his outer consciousness now just all these as we read in the gospel so many beautiful occasions we can find out yes we can do those meditation it will help us that is up to your own choice when you want to do and if sometimes may also do meditation on the absolute but we cannot do meditation on the absolute but we can try thinking of infinite ocean ocean of joy ocean of light or sort of consciousness these are the ideas given it does glimpses of deito non dual but you cannot think up on non-dual because how can you think your mind is itself is limited it will limit everything but it is you can take advantage of this type of meditation and and rome in that meditation only taking parts of the upanishad taking a part of the bhagavad-gita or ashtavakra shanghita or vivek churamuni or some books very inspirational ideas about the non-dual truth is mentioned you can just keep your mind absorbed in those areas and play go on so yes so it is recommended both ways both three types of meditation everyone can switch one to their meditation every one can switch one to the other to the other but preferably depending on your tendency you can do more on the form if you are that way some
