[Bhagavatam - 1.7.9 - 1.8.1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SklLFtDV0V4)

[Music] [Music] the darling of mother jason and the world teacher i salute him again and again on peace peace peace now we are back to our reading today seventh chapter verse number nine but just to say few words we got the view that the narada appeared before bayasso who was meditating on the bank of the river saraswati and the sun was rising and naruto suddenly appeared and saw that vyasa is not happy so he asked how are you and then he said i am i've composed these these this this but i'm not finding joy so what then he said what he said so what did the great bash within after because you have not talked about god and his glory you have talked about the highest truth of vedanta but you have not mentioned anything about devotion how to live in the world and enjoy the bliss of that god who is infinite but again takes the human form of saguna brahma you have talked about nirguna brahma so much but you have not meditated on sagunabrum so that thought took position in his mind so what then sonaka said what did the great holy say is best they've then be when not not other than departed after giving that advice narrow the left and then because of what he did the narrator describing that on the western bank of the river saraswati there was a resort where holy men used to do and meditate and that place name as samyak prasha is sanskrit name of a place like we call hollywood like that there was a place some of brasov and that was most suited for spiritual retreats and people meditating so readings say he then went there and sitting in his asrama and the beautiful with the groves of beautiful trees and then they said vyasa went into samadhi and after this in his pursuit and made concentrated to divine love he had the perfect vision of the supreme being he got the vision there and the power of maya it is by the power of maya that jiva individual though he is in in reality free spirit mistakenly considered himself as body the product of the gunas and then invite all type of suffering he in his meditation he failed that he also realized that the panacea for the suffering the suffering of humanity from now also since the time immemorial to all the sufferings which we human personalities go through pinasia or released from the suffering is to remove the ignorance abita or maya is how his devotion to the lord that illumine says therefore that illumine says it's best one there so then composed this bhagavata purana this book we are reading now it is called sata sanghita another name sanskrit name like swamps meaty shruti it is called saat samhita that is the scripture of devotion and he composed this for the benefit of the men who are groveling in the ignorance of spiritual nature after composing this bhagavatam and carefully reveal revising it himself the vasudeva says baso then whom he will teach his son as we know sukadeva was extremely pure and noah brahman from the very birth he was born into wisdom he was born when there had been no maya so he found him the best suited student he composed that and then gave it to him now the verse 9 starts so naka said again is contemplating power excellence sukhari is a man who is always absorbed in the highest knowledge he because he's a par excellent brahman ghani normally people born here with spiritual practice one day they get illumination and more and more and they get the fruit from maya but sugar there was before birth he had his total knowledge so a targeting renouncer this is sukadeva's adjectives renouncer who is not interested in anything but absorption in the self like swamiji he does not want anything but to be in samadhi so sukure was like that how did he then take the study of this very extensive scripture the his question is that sukhadev is born brahmagani and his mind is not in the world at all so he was absorbed in samadhi all the time how he was taught this you say that he was taught to sukadeva how sukharev could listen to it and memorized and kept this then suta the trans who is called the narrator narrator said it is true that sages were absorbed in cell in the cell capital cell are not in need of any book learning but they are endowed with spontaneous devotion motivated by no self-centered desire such is the inherent attractiveness of lord theory that when such contemplative stiffed in the atm and consciousness are drawn to him this is one of the wonderful words quoted many times by many people it is called atma hamas [Music] though these people like sukadeva they are absorbed in atmarama in the arm of the cell totally absorbed nirvana they have no tie in the world they have no bond bondage in the world free from that in the lord personified lord krishna or bhagavan kurwanti taking bhakti they have tremendous love when they come down from samadhi what they believe they cannot live with the mundane this world of this in which we dwell that's what they nearly want to live in the high state of spiritual consciousness they live in the pure love for god or gurvanti or hui taking bhakti they do that bhakti that devotion or who it means which has no reason and rhyme why they do you cannot question that it is spontaneous spontaneously taku said bhukti bhakto when he comes down from samadhi he cannot live with mundane world she used to need that say pure souls around brahmanando rakhal and kibali nori and rakhal all these youngsters and highly uplifted spiritual people were around him only so such is the inherent attractiveness of srihori that is the god attracts their mind that though his mind going to shoot out in samadhi to bring the mind down they are captivated in the love of nara you know god as ramakrishna used to live in ma ma ma ma makali he used to call the personified god as only mother mama such is the inherent attractiveness of theory that even such contemplatives were steeped in the atman consciousness are drawn to him because shishuka the son of byaso was extremely fond of devotees and their company and because you are strongly fascinated by the excellencies of the lord he took the trouble of learning extensive literature so that he might serve the lord and the devotees by expounding it therefore though sukhodev it is impossible for him to bring the mind down but he was absorbed in learning this lesson of shri krishna from his father that is vyasa for the good of the world because he will then preach and pronounce that message all over so now 12 verse it's going back to the story of the war war incident war battlefield in the kurukshetra the war where arjuna was battling with the opponent forces that story it says i shall now narrate who is saying this again the narrator he says i shall now narrate to you as a background for shri krsna's life story because this book will be relating talking about the story of sri krishna's wonderful spiritual leela divine sport i shall now narrate to you as a background for shri krsna's life story on account of the pariksits birth activities and death as also the departure past return of the sons of pandu meaning this book is described down the how krishna was there and krsna's role in the play in the mahabharata in the great world and how she krishna this king parikh who is talking to sukhodeb that is narrated here in the book so how this parishioned king parikshit died and how the departure of the return of the sons of pandu how the pandu the son of pandu the five sons they came back to life when the heroes of the clans of kuravas and pandavas had attained to the consummation of a hero's desire that is dying in the battlefield they all took a note that you shall die fight and die so in the battlefield for the warriors that is a big virtue that in the war i'll be killed or i'll kill that's all if i kill my victory my victory is mine i enjoy the birth if i am defeated i will die and i will go to heaven and enjoy that's the belief of the warriors so so dying in the battlefield was laid low with his thigh broken by might of big breakout desire as of doing what he thought would please his master sudhana stealthily cut off the head of the five sons of pandava by panchali panchali is drupal you know panchali you would draw with your juno arjuna arjuna's wife five brother's wife as they slept as they the children were sleeping in their bib house by house turkey what is that vivas biba house what is meaning b i b o u a c what is that b o u a c slept in their bib house at night that means these five children were sleeping and oh temporary camp and after the war there is no tent there is no cover that means it is open yeah that's uh if the son of the five sons of drupadi uh after the at the end of the day they were sleeping and then unethically they went at night and sudden they killed them killed us just five heads of the children but when he presented these heads even to sujana was not pleased with it and for none would be pleased with such an extremely heinous act then panchali the madrupadi when she heard of the very brutal way in which her young boys had been slaughtered overwhelmed with grief naturally mother will be extremely grieved when the five children are killed like that not in the war but when they are taking rest at odd hours normally there is a protocol of war you cannot do in after the sunset no war and when they are sleeping without any weapon you go and kill them it is unethical so that naturally the mother was very upset and five children were killed at a time no was overwhelmed with the grief and began to weave and well with torrents of tears flowing from her eyes their upon the hero archuna the one with a wrath a drone crown tried to console the draupadi or panchali what's his arjuna said arjuna said to his wife who was crying and weeping you know when i have reaped the head of that despicable brahmana the murderer whose name is astama with arrows released from my bowl govinda and put it before you and when sitting on it you have attended to the cremation of your sons and after its completion taken your ritual back they know good lady then alone shall it be time for me to wipe the tears of your sorrowing self it's a warrior talking to the warrior wife no i will kill this guy who has killed the five children and before that i'll bring before you his head cut head and then he will be sitting there and all this other children will also be cremated together but then you will be rejoicing many i'll kill the enemy first who has killed unethically killing the five sons of draupadi and five brothers thus somehow comforting his dear wife with such a flow of words pleasing and flowery arjuna having krishna as both his friend and charioteer started in pursuit of finding asattama then where is asap so he asked krishna please drive my car chariot to find where is asata and started in pursuit of asuda the son of the preceptor who is astra tama ashram is the son of the guru his archery good his teacher who taught him archery don't know so drona's son is aswatama asatama killed the five children and took their heads before arjuna they would do jodhana but door jordan was not happy because of this unethical killing no but anyhow now arjuna is now angry arjuna is to find out where is astama and he is changing masatama and in pursuit of astama vasutram is the son of as i said his guru arjuna's guru whose name is drona this is very complicated in one day to remember all these i cannot remember all this very complicated but anyhow we understand that draupadi's five son was killed by one gentleman asatama and arjuna gave comfort to the wife don't worry your tears i will kill the killer and present before you then you will be happy to take a revenge so like that and arjuna now asking the charioteer krishna krishna take me where is your tama to find him so now they are chasing us who is the asylum is the son of his own guru who taught the learning of weapon how to utilize and warrior so holding the son of the arjuna having krishna as both of his friend and territory started in pursuit of astama the son of druna holding in his arjuna's hand the terrific bow of gandiva and seated in the chariot with the figure of a monkey in his flag in melbourne that's been arjuna's chariot always carried a symbol no because arjuna is the military chief on this behalf so everyone knows oh it is who is now here present the military chief is here then which is a frightening affair and a serious powerful person most powerful person in the world is now before me to kill me no so naturally everyone will get frightened so he gave that in his chariot there is a flag and in his flag there is a symbol what is the symbol monkey only one with the monkeys the figure of a monkey and display monkey means human now seeing the fast approaching arjuna from the distance this also tama who killed this innocent children the murderer of the five children ascended his chariot with a trembling heart and played as fast as he can as he can for fear of life as brahma once did out of fear of anyhow so he started running seeing that arjuna is chasing him to kill now astama of brahmano parentage finding his father was a great warrior so finding his horses exhausted he's running away but the horses got exhausted then arjuna was approaching very close and himself becoming helpless even to the escape now thought of brahma's missile in those days there is a weapon called brahma brahma brahmastra the creator that is invincible if that missile is done it is like atom bomb and in those days that will destroy the the entire country there is no escape no counter missile is created for brahmastra you cannot stop that if once it goes out of the hand boom but to get it you have to do as in extreme austerity and you have to know all these how to put it how to stop it no those control so missiles on the means or to brahma brahma michael as the only means to save him so how to protect so he threw the brahmastra that weapon missile though not knowing the withdrawal of the brahman messiah you can throw but you should know both how to throw how to withdraw astama confronted as he was with an instant threat to life now performed the necessary purifactory rights and the mental abstractions and released that divine missile he lost his mind and he released that missile now now this missile is going towards you but arjuna has also he knows this missile how to throw and arrest and withdraw so then seeing the fears and radiant energy spreading over out of that missile and threatening his own life what you know said as follows to krishna o krishna without the mighty arm because this is addressed to arjuna that asama who killed the sons now he has thrown a missile which can destroy the whole earth and it is directed towards arjuna so it is running towards him so he said oh krishna you are my charioteer also you are my guide and everything now what shall i do please protect me no so o thou the mighty arm o savior of the devotees to men burning in the fears of sansaro you are the only heaven of safety oh krishna you are the heaven of safety you are you are the origin of all you are from you vedanta again coming you are the source of all creation and the all comprehensive being with the lord himself transcending the prakriti you are beyond prakriti by the power of your spiritual potency chit that was not affected by the material potency mayasaki because you are manifestation of the consciousness therefore the maya the ignorance cannot touch you thus you remain unaffected by all changes as the universe the universal self you are the universal self everything changes but you don't change you are the atman you are the absolute by the power of your grace you bestow on the jivas individual jivas grappling in the ignorance generated by maya the means of spiritual appointment so this incarnation now so now two while one of its own purpose might be to face the earth for burden of the wicked men is really to provide your devotee those who love is exclusively directed to you with matter of devotional import to contemplate upon so you are born to redeem the suffering of others in this age so now those will devotedly pray to you you will protect therefore o lord of all lords here comes a mighty radiance of terrific prowess multi-pronged and facing all direction no you have seen that in ramayana mahabharata they will find if you have seen you know online you can check on those what you call the check on those a movie they will find when they're throwing that arrow it is multi-pronged rays radiate from all direction you cannot escape you will be covered by all there is you go that side that side that side it will be all such a huge area of race that means you cannot escape because it is brahmastra so i know not what it is and whence it comes no it is approaching please see i am covered by that you will not be affected you are god yourself but i permanently pray for you so protect me that is the request who did arjuna did to whom to krishna the charioteer and who through the arrow astama asatama who is the son of arjuna's guru archer guru who who taught him it is the guru's son being versus the both are sons we call guru's children no the student is guru's children is guru's son his own son versus his student son the bhagavan said now bhagavan is saying verse number 27 on the page 30 page bhagavan said this is the brahma missile released by the son of drono frightened by the prospect of his own annihilation he is not an expert at it he had learned somehow but he do not know how to control if you are given a big huge destructive missile and you don't know how to handle it what will happen it will kill you also so he does not know he does not he's not an expert at it for he does not know how to retreat it how can we try it okay you can throw you can withdraw there's no other missile that can con counteract this brahma missile you are an expert in releasing and retracting these missiles now combat and destroy the might of this missile by yourself releasing a brahma missile against it now now you throw another brahma missile it will interject inside and understand missile and anti-missile no in the big one modern day one you see in early days they have such powerful missiles and anti-missiles that's why it is called the indian old civilization was very advanced in technology also it is not that today is only missile they using all these data that one such missile can destroy the whole nagasika nagasaki missile it is similar like thing it can destroy the array of people and but you have to know how you can diffuse it suppose you have put in a wrong direction you have to have the power to retreat it no so that's right then then sikhishna suggested give this simple response or you know you are also master in this missile this is called the brahma missile so you know how to control how to retract so you throw your missile so that it will interject and it will be diffused then the suta again is coming to the now what happened to us now arjuna was in fear and arjuna was instructed by bhagavan krishna that you put another homicide now what happens this is the verse number 29 is narrated by the narrator says hearing the words of lord krishna originally terror of his pose purified himself and circumambulated shri krishna by way of adoration of him and then released his own brahmavishi to destroy the opponents so he then threw the weapon why it is said purified you know i think what you know in the big war you cannot hastily do anything you have to concentrate there is code number and every passcode is there in those modern machines you go everywhere there will be some passcode password passcode so then to concentrate that purified thinking of god inside means mind being calmed down and then he circumambulated around bhagavan krishna three times purified himself and then he when that adorned by him then released his own brahma michael to destroy asatama opposition 30 when the brining radiance of the two missiles joined in confrontation that aliens overcast all space all the quarters and the sky argumenting as the brilliance of the sun and the cosmic dissolution does when the fire emitted from these mouths of the or the seizure joining with so this is the so it is like two missiles now fighting with each other and it the brilliance of that is dazzling and it is the whole area of warriors are confounded with that seeing that brilliant hit burning all the three worlds all who are affected by it thought that it was really the fire generated at the time of cosmic dissolution as if the whole what earth is going to be destroyed now 32 ascertaining the view of sri krishna arjuna then retracted both the missiles so interjected and now he has the power to withdraw both the time of the arjuna retracted both the missiles as they would otherwise cause great destruction and distress among the living beings 33 then arjuna his eye is red with anger approached a cruel loss of tama and tied him up with ropes as if he were a sacrificial animal so he caught now you know last weapon is gone from the power so he tied this asafa who killed his five son and then going to take action within 34 with an air of anger the lord said towards you know as he dragged the rope enemy by force towards his by was that means the same place where they are killed or you know this villain of brahman deserves no pardon kill him he has slaughtered mere boys innocent and asleep at night they say it is krishna is giving instruction don't be compassionate now he has killed your five innocent children now he is through the brahma missile and you throw your brahma michael and we extracted and withdrawn now get a chance now he is under your control therefore just take action now kill him because he has slaughtered the five mere five children five boys who are innocent asleep at night a man who knows right conduct should not slaughter an intoxicated man or absent-minded person a madman a man asleep a child a woman an idiot a refuge a frightened man or one whose chariot is broken into the battle even if he be an enemy krishna says these are the rules that you should not kill a person who is unmined unmindful absent-minded and you go to go and kill no you should fight with fight with strength that means not to a child not kill any woman and a fool or a refuge or a frightened person give some scope and fight like a beard like a warrior warrior should be strong to fight with another warrior thus on a merciless criminal who seek to thrive by the slaughter of others death inflicted is but a boon for if he leaves he will degrade himself more and more by his cruel propensities if you let asatama now go you may be feeling little compassion now if you do that this person will create more trouble for the society by his ill behavior 38 and besides you have promised panchali when you just talk to your wife drupadi in my hearing i have heard that oh esteemed lady what you said you said to your wife oh esteemed lady i shall 40th bring the head of the murderer of your sons therefore let this hateful sinner the murderer of children be put to death at once a same to his own tribe he has violated the sentiments of his master even because his father is such a warrior and he should not kill innocent children sleeping at the night time in open space where there is normal protocol no one should come and hit them now suta said again narrator narrator is continuing 40 verse still arjuna did not like to execute asatawa the son of his own teacher drano in spite of the prompting of sri krishna whose intention was to test arjuna's sense of right conduct actually krishna was also giving some suggestion to see how much arjuna is a man of character naturally anyone will kill but next arjuna where the divine krishna both as his chariot and friend moved to his bibe house and informed his sorrowing wife of the capture of asukama seeing astama in that condition tied up like an animal and hanging his head as him of his own despicable act the noble panchali draupadi was overcome with piety she made frustration to the captive as he was the son of their venerable teacher druno they are unable to bear the sight of asthma in bondage she cried out in great concentration release him release him he is brahmana and also a venerated elder being the son of our teacher see dhruvadi she was crying before and now when the asothama killed his in harino's and children but now you see she got emotionally affected and thinking don't kill don't kill don't kill he's my guru's son so just release him that's he how how the uh greatness was you can say forgetting that the own anger or frustration or loss because respect for guru [Music] and guru's son yeah my guru after all his good my guru's son so you have captivated him tied him and he is now shameful just standing before me so please really is really existing her husband arjuna really is really his release in the form of his son he has stands before you donate himself he's giving advice you the son you are seeing the son means think that his guru is your guru is standing here in this form the one who has taught you the whole of the science of arms together with all the secret mantras connected with to release and retract of the powerful missiles besides his mother drona's wife who is the sister of kripa has survived her husband and is still alive for the snake of our heroic son that means his mother will be believed if you kill astama that means guru's wife she will also feel so much pain if the son is killed my lord you are well acquainted with the rules and righteous conduct it is not befitting that the family of the guru is put to suffering by you now he is giving the advice now she was crying and now she is giving the advice no no you should not kill these gurus we are we should be righteous or guru's son we should not kill him we should not do any harm to him see on the other hand it deserves your respect and adoration at all times let not his mother the daughter of gotama and the faithful wife of drona weep and well and have tear-swept face like myself going to the death of her offspring so let astra tama's mother have no tears if you kill him she will be crying so don't do that see it's a compassion if the if the tribe of brahmanas is provocated and enraged by the actions of unregenerate kings these kings and their followers will meet with total destruction in the sorrow of those anguished brahmanas so brahmana is considered very high position in the society no so he is saying he is a brahmana son particularly your guru also guru's son so whatever they have done but we should not kill sutra again continued o brahmanas the king dharmaputra the king dharmaputra highly appreciated these words of dipanchali huh oh brahmanas means he's saying oh brahmin people who are listening to me you listen the king dharmaputra highly appreciated those words of this draupadi as they were righteous lawful merciful sincere balanced and praiseworthy in every way all others there men and women including nuclear saudi arjuna and lord krishna bore of devaki appreciated the plea of drupadi panchali so everyone appreciated the attitude how a mother who has lost five children killed unethically like that be so compassionate and now protecting the protect the killer who has destroyed his own children no so everyone started praising and they drove the mother who lost the children then bhima said to a very angry mood execution is better favor than release for a villain of this type who though it served neither his masters nor his own purpose still murdered the sleeping children for mother's sake so what is the reason so he should kill them bhima bhima was always a little aggressive among the five brothers hearing the words of bhimasena and of the daughter of drupadi lord krishna the forearm studying the face of his friend arjuna told him with a smile and bhagavan krishna said now all this conversation was going on krishna listening and krishna now is giving what he wants to advise krishna said 53 verse even a degraded brahmana should not be slaughtered so this is the mystery that's why bhagava mani bhagavati is the story of ramayana mahabharata is talking of so much ethical principle at the point of death at the point really it happened that the five children were slaughtered at that moment see the values which they are carrying respect for the brahmana even he is not the right type of brahmana he should not do brahmanas would have some rules to follow they cannot just go and do something unethical but still from your side you should respect the brahmana so what a great value there is to carry so krishna said even a degenerated brahmana should not be slaughtered if elena's murderer should be killed both are my injunctions one he is not taking this side not that side he said even a degenerated brahmana should not be slaughtered that's one instruction a villainous murderer a model who is like villain should be skilled both are my injunctions i say this also i said this also act in a way that will be in fulfillment of both you do act in such a way that both the ideas should be maintained you have to fulfill the undertaking that you gave to gave to comfort of your wife namely to bring the head of the assassin over you have said that you will bring the head of the assad you have also got to do what is pleasing to bhima bhima said he should be killed to panchali means the draupadi wife and to myself krishna act in a way that will accomplish all these three how can you do both so krishna is putting to test and saying now you apply your buddhi and let the all the three things can be accomplished at a time oh my god you have to kill you have to bring the head and is the brahmin don't even brahmin don't kill but kill in such a way so that all these formulas are kept intact bhagavan that's why bhagavan also creates trouble for us two types of statement it's directly said do this and that's okay no he gives us the judgment you can do this this is the consequence this is do this is also rule this is also rule but do it in such a way so long you are in the world so that it it it makes a perfect sense that you have protected all the considerations you have considerations all sutra said arjuna understood what the lord had in mind and accordingly he shared off with his soul the head of asukama together with the crest jewel that was a natural feature on his head so he took the sword and killed asut and his head was having a crown he's a big warrior they have their as the military people you see how many stars and these and that and that and the gap and all these are there no so with that asata my head and with the sword they killed who killed arjuna be left of his spiritual aura by the sin of his child slaughter and deprived of his physical brilliance by the loss of his question astama was sent away from the camp of the pandavas so now execution for a degraded brahmana consists in sharing of of the head tucked confiscation of property and expulsion so the inflection of physical death is prohibited along with krishna the pandavas who were bemoaning the death of their children next attended to their cremation and other rights so all then went to together to do the last rites of this astama and also their children now shuttle said verse number oh this here is the end of this chapter so along so the execution for a degenerated brahman consists in sharing of the head tucked confiscation of the property and expulsion what is the he says let me read again arjuna understood what the lord has in mind and accordingly he sheared off with his sword the head tucked sorry i was wrong he didn't cut his head it tucked tikki tikki tiki they cut it it is an insult for a brahmin if you cut his top tapped and take away his property and throw him out of the kingdom that is like killing that becomes like killing so the head that of the astra tama together with the crest jewel in his head the honor you take out that honor this is the owner of brahmin you took out that cut it this is the owner take out of that now and then a feature of it believed up the spiritual aura by the scene of child slaughter and deprived of his physical brilliance by the loss of his crest dwell asrama sent away from the camp of the pandavas thrown out of the pandava camp no military camp that is a that means it's killing it's almost killing because your honor your dignity that has been lost execution for a degraded brahmana that is the norm of the rule norm of those days consists in sharing of the head trapped confiscating all the property and expulsion the infliction of physical death is prohibited huh don't kill the brahmin but you take out the traffic fallen brahmin if you do that do something wrong take out the jewel from his head and take out his property and throw away from the ground that won't blend that is the punishment means it's almost like a death the infliction of physical death is prohibited that is the rule along with krishna the pandavas were bemoaning the death of their children next attended to their cremation and other rights okay so then they left and went into the cremation ground to do the last rights of the children dead children but what happened with australia also tama was with the cutting the tapped of the air and the crown the jewel taken away and then thrown out and then out of the pandava camp so that is his death as it were now chapter eight so question key away so we'll start the chapter 8 next day okay if there is some question for 2-3 minutes chapter 8 first book skanda chapter 8 krishna's preparation to depart after the death of pastor tama what will happen we'll read that [Applause] this book only the complication of this book is this unless you have very deep knowledge who is these characters what is their background then you cannot enjoy very much but overall even we do not know much but we can try to make a link between this and that and also you get the values of the society even in the war field when your own son is being killed unethically how do we behave what are the greatness of indian culture and tradition what the question society was so much uh holding on to high ideals and that's why the war is war against the injustice and other things societies and good bad is always there you cannot do anything of that and good and bad is always there what is the question jaima om [Music] are you enjoying this i do not know huh because unless you are very much um attentive otherwise you see it in my mind will all be complicated what is going on there you see i i only misunderstood the head and forgot the tuft tuft of the hair i said that sword and kill no didn't kill krishna said don't kill because brahmana should not be killed so you have to keep that honor at the same time how is called real death a very honorable person if he is insulted that's a death for him with a values like that a very honorable very respectable person if we can insult in front of others it is almost like a death to that person yeah all these things in that sense he has killed us and drove away and tapped here and the crown jewel jewel of the crown all taken away property taken away is a honor taken away and then thrown out get out of this land uh so how to overcome panic and negative thoughts loop yeah it is very difficult panic is panic negative thoughts loop that's also we have to counteract those things i think thinking of god always positive thinking and positive thinking negative thinking can be counteracted by the positive thinking panic when it comes we have to think why i am panicking what will happen oh this what is happening now they see the condition arjuna could have panicked to death but he took a resolution he'll kill he will kill the perpetrator so that is the one panic comes if we know what will happen i will die one day last one is death okay if i die early that's okay why i'm getting panicked many people that's the problem we are all not or not only this who is putting the question but we are all in our problem when it comes what will happen what will happen what will happen if this happened then what will happen no see if this earthquake comes what will happen we'll have to keep water we have to talk some flashlight we'll have to array will you be able to collect them when suddenly something happens yeah by god's case you can sometimes even the thing will be there will forget so when it happens you will take care of it but now why panicked don't go there this nakshatra this star is bad for you you will fall in some danger your health will be hazardous don't go don't go don't do don't you don't worry you are a panic panic panic panic no don't get panic you think i will not indulge in trump something wrong but if it happens i will not face it when it will come it will come there is a there is a word uh more again more vulnerable before our real death every day we die hundred times before our real death what will happen what will happen so that's why we can counteract by thinking ultimate thought that is nothing to worry one day i will die everyone will die here the hitler is also so powerful he is also dead and this powerful people created so much problem in political arena they are also gone they are calm they go what do we panic and consequences if it comes i will see what i can do at that time so that gives the strength and negative loop positive thinking that's why now when i am not in the deep negative impressions let me think of positive think of positive thinking positive thinking mainly we are spiritual seekers so we should say think of god keep your mind charged with some noble ideas take some mantra of the bhagavad-gita take some mantra of dupanishads read something of whatever if you are ramana maharishi it read something of the gospel of rama krishna so think whatever uplifts you that is the process another question i request to make these classes as twice a week thank you if i could do but i think it will not be very interesting for most of the people because so many names and stories i'm getting getting confused but anyhow but that would have been much better if i could but let us go on with this way and we will we'll see if any time it happens but not now i thought that i will be reading this is a wonderful way to read continue continue reading and know as much as you remember as much we understand that's all another question is worshipping krishna the oldest faith in the world that i cannot say before krishna was rama before before that god is worshipped in different ways mother worship also was there so we cannot say that but god worship of god in different ways have been started from the primitive time it is going on worshiping the power the spiritual energy the divine is worshipped from the beginning but krishna of course krishna's impact is tremendous impact in bali java there you go you can find the impact of rahama ramas rama krishna they have actually it has gone into the very bone of indian culture that's why we are talking about the ram charity management they talk about rama's life story yesterday we were talking about in the evening and rama's today ten thousand people will be listening to the rama's glory they will sing this state of bhagavat bhagavata reader if it is difficult to express in the english but in sanskrit and hindi are very close when hindu speaking people are there and these narrators are there they have studied it well in depth and they steal some stories and sing some songs in between and in relating captivating 10 000 people will be listening to that talk so yes krishna and rama rama was before krishna so i think that it is god whoever comes down in any way in form they have their impact and they have actually created this spiritual growth in in the society and it lingers till now thousands of years being passed so it has not stopped but it is still continuing i i cannot see any question computer action there is a question in the computer okay is there any spiritual significance of teachings in the story of asiatama yes that we can think what is the story astra in the in the mind of people always there is a crooked side of it we don't want to do the thing in right straightforward manner but stealthily we do that so they are to harass arjuna and to put the defeat of arjuna that was the idea so asthma take a very wrong course it should not have been taken if you want to work go for a walk like a warrior face to face the rules and norms so that type of tendency is there in everyone as well is also our mind so we should not encourage that type of thought more rather rather to be honest and sincere and take the challenges of life in the right manner i think that may be the teachings of the story significance that we become victims of life strategies and problems but should we behave like arjuna or behave like astama if astrothema could have got a chance he would not have excused arjuna but arjuna being that because arjuna got the guidance from krishna he said you have to kill because he is ibrahim not following their norms but again he should not kill even brahmin does something wrong because he is your guru's son no you should not do and balance all these things and he found out with intelligence how to live in life balancing all this situation and yes they're destroying the ego dishonoring him because he's not behaving like a brahmin as he should have behaved as we should behave we don't do that so if someone comes in our life to guide us and takes little this type of method so we should not be upset we should learn that yes that evil negative things should be avoided from life and be always positive because someone does something wrong you should not be equally going to that level there is a uh in bengali there is a word when they're fighting with each other the dog bites the dog or dog is angrily goes and bites some human being yeah it is the activity of the dog dogs normally do that but is will you as a human being go and bite a dog so this is the point there may be something but you should be little sensible you should follow the norms and the spiritual values okay thank you yeah so now we shall be again here at 7 30 for the class santi gita the song of peace by bhagavan krishna again we got krsna's instruction here also but that's also one krsna's that is the same war only again another son of krishna is squealed and advised by krishna okay very vedantic book and very interesting book thank you shanti shanti you
