[Bhagavatam - 3.5.1-26 - ( Book 3, Chapter 5 verse 1-26)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0j4dpNU5H-s)

foreign the son of vasudeva the destroyer of the king demons gangshu and chanura dear darling of the mother and the guru of the old entire universe from peace peace peace so we are back to our reading of the srimad bhagavatam and we are in the chapter 5. it starts with the question that question was from Shuka the sugar said and it is talking to bidura the greatest devotee of SRI Krishna he said that shizuka said we are on the chapter 5 verse number one questions about the creation and this universe and the glory of bhagavan Krishna so shishuka the eternally free spiritual soul midura who had attained great purity of Mind by Devotion to Krishna being highly attracted by the adorable personality of maitreya approached that great Center of spirituality at his residence in haridwar and put to him the following question is directing the story about what happened the question and bidural and meeting the Guru or teacher Sage Rishi which is who is on residing on the bank of Ganga in the haridwar so he put this question approaching my trail bidural put this question for the question question said second verse in this world people do various actions in this world people do various actions for happiness from those they neither give perfect happiness but they do foreign happiness nor they are able to get over all those conditions that produce unhappiness so people are engaged in this way the question is this the whole world everyone is in action and in this world people do they everyone is doing some work and the purpose from these we want to get happiness but people don't get happiness neither they get happiness nor they are able to get over all those conditions which produces unhappiness in our life so we are doing some Karma to overcome happiness but it is not possible to do that not able to get over all conditions that are causing us unhappiness on the other hand from one set of actions only a new cause of unhappiness are found to rise you do one thing think that it will bring good and that being some other other this dissatisfaction unhappiness therefore you go my Trio you an all-knowing person should please tell us what is the best for us to do in life now how we should live what shall we do so that we don't get entangled into this unhappiness or that eradicate the reasons for which our unhappiness will not be affecting us third verse misery is the fate of those is it because he's the doctor so he says the misery is the fate of those who out of their evil Deeds of the past are indifferent to the worship of Krishna and consequently become unrighteous in conduct people forget God they are really unhappy people in the world they cannot get perfect happiness because what they do who those type of people who out of that evil Deeds are the past our sons are bad karmas Bad Karma the past they are indifferent to God being different to Krishna and to worship of Krishna and consequently naturally become we live in the world in unrighteous manner in their conduct so they cannot find peace that means what is indicating that those who are dedicated to God worship the person the God as God as Lord Krishna is God or anyone now it is we are reading bhagavata that's why Krishna so unrighteousness the exposition of them those were righteous person they trust in God the fear of God they don't behave wrongly because they are dedicated to purity so the question continues it is for affording Relief to such persons in misery that great devotees of the Lord like you oh my prayer a move about in this world so you are moving around in this world because of that oh holiest of holy months tell us about the Noble Path by which those who Worship the Lord and have their hearts purified by devotion get Enlightenment and knowledge of the Eternal truth inspired by the Lord who resides within them so in spite the Lord resides in the heart they that Noble Path by which those worshipers of the Lord I can have their hearts purified by devotion get enlightenment how one can get Enlightenment who are dedicated to God please tell me tell us how the bhagavan who is Ever free God is ever free God creates the universe he is not under anyone's control but still telling how the bhagavan deshara who is Ever free and is the controller event of the Maya by Maya God creates this universe is the master of the Maya so being the master of the Maya how he assumed forms as incarnations how it becomes like a small person like Krishna Rama how he becomes like ramakrishna caitanya Buddha how he becomes the infinite God by his own Maya but assumed for as Incarnation spawn and how he is without any desire create this world he said God has no desire and who creates this world why he creates if he has no desire why it is created is a mysterious thing we we have desired that's why we do all the activities we have a desire to have some say to see something to you we go in one place we have the idea of experiencing some sweetness we eat something but I have no desire then why shall I do all these things if I so how it so it is this question is that God he's self-willed he has no need but why he then takes a human form and how he will take a form unless he has some desire what is his desire them and how the desire being and how he brought about subtle conditions in it with means of with means of livelihood for everyone describe to us he how he the one existence whose blessings even the greatest says sick enter into the Creator created world and assumes diverse forms see it is Supernatural says that sachidananda that Brahman he has entered into the universe by Maya and this 40 World you see he has become this so how it is possible that's the question describe to us how he what is he one existence that is Brahman absolute describe to us how he one existence whose blessings even the greatest stages are seeking the great Saints and sages are seeking the blessings of God no how he himself enters into the created world and assume diverse forms and afterwards at the time of dissolution withdraws itself everything into the sky of his heart and remains without any modification everything comes from God it comes out of God remains in the world as active world and again withdraw it is like every day we sleep when you go to sleep what happens your whole concept of this world it's good bad happiness misery pleasure pain when you go to bed what happens all consumed within nothing is there when you are sleeping but again next morning when you wake up from your mind it again comes out and you see the world but when you are sleeping this world vanishes for you so God similarly creates the universe from him and is displayed sometime and when he wants he withdraws everything with him that's why it's called God is the creator sustainer and Destroyer three aspects creator maintenance or Vishnu narayana and Destroyer he destroyed Lord Shiva the old to destroy but all these three is issue it comes from one one God one God manifest in three ways and creating this universe maintaining that and consuming it but where does it come from it comes from God goes back to God and this what Universe then what I am seeing now I am seeing whom I'm seeing table chair man woman which is all God but the question is that how that absolute one existence that is called sachidananda Brahman become like this how it is possible the infinite has become like this so this is the question please let me know you are a great Sage you are a seer of Truth oh my true please tell us in his by various incarnations when God comes down he takes various forms you know in every condition we have in Hinduism ten avatars or all these types of even human subhuman or different manifestation but it is all ishwara manifesting God manifesting so in his various incarnations play the Incarnation for the welfare of the world what are the sportive actions that he enacted so tell us how in God came down for the good of humanity but the good of welfare of all how he came in the um what he did so he's asking about all the incarnations when they came how they came into existence and how they did the sportive Divine Play our mind is never Associated by hearing about the actions of that one of exceeding Holiness that means he's saying I am a student of spirituality I'm never tired of hearing talks holy talks huh Those Who Have Nothing spiritual inside they will not entertain any God talk there is a little story you know there is ramakrishna story there is one fisherman woman after selling the in the market was returning home but her home a little distance on the way you as well maybe late for after wine winding and coming back to home but it is becoming dark so he thought she thought that what shall I do and on the way she found one lady she said do you come you can stay with me for tonight and tomorrow you can go and she has a beautiful flower garden and then they gave him to her to rest but she was not getting rest and she called the friend Garden lady said that oh I am not getting rest what has happened I I cannot bear this fragrance of the flowers better to bring my fish basket and the fish basket was born and sprinkle some water so that smell becomes strong and she was so happy to sleep after keeping that basket near her head that means she is familiar with them every day with the smell because all the time they work with the fish so the fish smell appears common cold but flower is little sophisticated fragrance she is not appreciative of that that's why here it is said our mind is never seceded hearing about the actions of that one exceeding holiness I am now I love the flowers fragrance so much that I am never tired of having better fragrance higher fragrance so God's words listening to the holy life of the Incarnation and their spiritual Deeds it satisfies brings peace in my mind joy in my mind I want to know more I want to hear more about God [Music] but that Joy but it is temporary joy and dependent Joy that's the problem every Joy is good unless it is independent every day is dependent and dependent joyous hot sleep Joy so we want joy longer Joy and longer and longer longer lastly we want such Joy which never goes away so that is the difference only Fisher everyone is happy the the worms are happy with the dirty water and so every creature is created to like one thing according to their songs called Tendencies so tamashic tendency Thomas I just sucked and Beyond all are searching for joy but this is the difference we are not happy with any Joy because it is time bound it is short-lived it is beginning it is then and the reaction any Joy what relate to good food feast all various items sir 20 items maybe say say just an example in a fist day you take little little little little little and you get Aha and after eating what you do where is hajmala there is some digestive way and they know let us go for a walk let us go for something are you wait you should enjoy but enjoyment was in the tongue and now the trouble comes in the stomach now your gas you cannot sleep you cannot stand you cannot do so this is the problem of Joy it is Joy but it would be anything reactionless afterwards you think of God you love God and dive deep and dive deep he'll be more and more and more saturated and no reaction uh no question of losing that but this is this is we lost it tongue here and goes here was gone is lost it's now the question of the whole body to digest that all the tasteful food is tip of the tongue to the throat only this much time so long it is there and then it goes it it's a big struggle for the whole body system to digest that this acid secretion that that and that indigestion and this and that why because it is always coming little bit though Joy is the same Joy what are those categories from Prime mineral staff of which the Supreme Lord formed the regions within the cosmic spheres what are those categories of entities of different spiritual entities lives in different spheres which is asking about what are those categories from the primevial stuff of which the Supreme Lord found the regions within the cosmic spheres and the Realms Beyond wherein are found all species of conscious beings including the deities presiding over the various fears to review the time we are worshiping all gods and goddesses even we are worshiping the trees the plants the uh the art even we are worshiping the what is called the rat bahana and the Ganesha Ganesha you worship but you cannot give up you worship Ganesha only and you will not worship the rats that don't do rat is also God yesterday month of they are chanting the Mantra there is they're talking them Puja if you are observe online it's available now also they are rat the snake and even the lion the Ashura itself he's the god also so that is how different people live in different levels of mental state gods and goddesses in higher Place demons and and what is called goblins they live in different level human live in one level so tell me how these different spheres are created and God has created and how different levels of spirit many entities live there besides describe also how the self-born created narayana who created narayana if you say you say this world is created by God then I'll say who created God you cannot put that question who created God then means they say God's Garden God's got it but in our relationship yes I am created by my mom and dad but where from my mom and dad want their parents where they are born their parents their parents and Go ultimate go go go go how far you can go put in generation hundred generation then you go where we come from one and then you've got a child everything comes from God but a god comes from aware this question is called Maya you cannot put that question God created out of his own Maya who created God he himself created that's why you know to say that sachidananda Brahman by his own Maya he makes him many he was said that I am alone only alone means only there is no one parallel nasty almasti there is no one second hi Mother Durga said I am the only one in the whole universe who is parallel to me so that is the one but why do you come from one I created myself have you created myself how can you create myself yes I have the power to recreate create manifest and manifest that's called the Shakti power means Shakti and the dominant dormant power that's called Maha Shakti the great Shakti Maya Shakti Maha Shakti mahamaya all these names are given so God created himself by his own power besides describe also how the self-born Creator narayana who is born by his own self no one created narayana brought about the differences in nature how God who is self-created he differentiates differences in the nature of action poems names Etc of various creatures I have heard many times about the duties of the various orders in the society from the mouth of biasa that means he said I have heard that the what are the duties of each level of people in the world enough of that I no longer desire to hear anything concerning the worldly life therefore I long to hear only about the Excellence of the Lord to see them in devotee he says I have heard enough of the world I have seen the glories of the world but these are all temporary futile I want to know about the glory of bhagavan Krishna the Lord narayana which will suit my heart I am I am not interested in it people are interested no every student you ask what are you going to study some will say one subject another will another subject no at the cost at the cost of others or and I don't like other subjects it is my most favorite subject so what should we the most favorite subject of a spiritual person God Only God because God can give us Eternal Joy anything you get money how long money can get joy you earn money whole life and make a big bank balance one million two million five million even billion even trillion when you just leave the body take one penny out of the bank account you spend your whole life for beautification of your body and your beautification of everything when you go take one gray one piece of hair with you all to be deposited here you got it here it will remain so what will you go with you that love for God that peace that containment so that is the point I I am tired of all these things I have seen all this so I am not interested in that I long to hear only about the Excellence of the Lord this is my only desire I want to share about God he whom sages like you praise and worship is like you praise and worship instructors what man would be what man what man would be Associated by hearing about him and his excellences which entering through the years of men completely raises his worldly Tendencies leading to defeated births and deaths I want to hear about that and the holy words of the Lord if it enters into the year and it transforms the mind and it becomes a pure and that completely irresists our all worldly desires and planning of the world and leading to that depleted desire which comes inside that will go away by repeating the God's name so and the birth and death we are always in the cycle of birth this life is because of the last lives Karma last life was before because the previous lives Karma the karma is bringing us again and again that Karma the cycle of karma will be stopped together that is saying that our Karma we are being in the circle so I want to hear about your glory God's glory tell me God's glories so that I will never be born again I will living in the realm of the consciousness of the Divine so tell me I want to listen that's the question is put into my Trio your friend basso too Desiring to describe the glories of the Lord there is a means to draw man's mind gradually to pure devotion he has adopted the method of describing matters concerned connected with the worldly good of man at first in the Mahabharata also they talk about the world and worldly development can be meant managed that Gita our our spiritual Vedic literature says that in the early biddha there are two types of biddha secular and spiritual foreign one is secular knowledge and another is spiritual knowledge Vedic time there are two types of knowledge given to everyone why because by secular knowledge you earn good money you have good house experience their life and see that it does not fulfill your desire then you turn to paraavida technology foreign by which that imperishable divine state is achieved everything is perishable you achieve anything by Karma that karma is you can find you are going I then if you find those two boys call them just call them so so it is that also Mahabharata also did the same thing as they talked about the world and worldly development how you can mature in worldly development and the second is then turning towards God for the Fulfillment the mind of man who hears reads about the excellences of the Lord with deep faith and attention will along with the growth of devotion cease to have attachment and attraction for worldly objects this is a disease of ours worldly attachment we are attached to the worldly thoughts not to God and while deserves how much you attach net result is dissatisfaction after you get it before you get you live in anxiety shall I get it I am trying to get it if it someone comes you get angry in between the path suppose after so much struggle you get it when you get a few moment will be of excitement then you'll think no no I don't want it I wanted something more something greater a person earning money say I have a hundred thousand Joy I know one person hundred thousand he will be satisfied with hundred thousand jobs no two thousand two hundred thousand five hundred thousand are you happy satisfied there no go on so to reach that point to get a job of 500 000 is not a matter of joke but being there they say I have no time I have no time for a second for me I cannot sleep I cannot do and then after time get exhausted then he said I got this but I didn't expect 5000 jobs dollars even earning but the anxieties tensions and all these things are going on then you say I don't want it getting there but you are dissatisfied still so that's why it is said that the mind of a man who hears or reads about the excellences of the Lord on the contrary if one hears about God he meditates on God goes to Guru get the Mantra practice spirituality what happens and listens to this bhagavat and holy text it purifies the mind and that's what happens deep faith and attention if one hears this message will along with the growth of devotion the love for God will grow inside and she is to have attachment and attraction for worldly objects world is not bad money is not bad the house is not bad good clothing Etc is not bad attachment is the bad thing when you get attached you can be attached to a very very something very Petty that attachment cause suffering attachment sees that in the whole life you look at that wherever I am attached there is my suffering if you can detach okay I'll let it be then you are free whenever we keep ourselves now this will be this way and I want it and then and hang on then you fight more accepting God you get attached to God aha what a great life mirabai was attached to God mirabai was attached to God she was a princess wealth money Prosperity all this does not mean anything to harm no so it is that is why it is said that he who has developed the Delight in the thought of the Lord have not only that some feeling of Joy if one develops that joy that feeling of joy that I am thinking of God and I find Joy inside what a great life that that will free him from all attachment and Greater Joy and joy and more joy will come without any reaction reactionary Joy is the worldly Joy and frustration comes afterwards many people rich people they suffer all through in depression and suppression I have so much wealth so much thing but what is the peace inside so that's why if you one can generate love for God and test to hear find interest in listening to Holiness or the life and character of the Holy Krishna Rama or Avatar saintly life they attempt to the perfection [Music] and they get who was developed Delight in the thought of the Lord will be freed from all Sorrows from all sorrows and suffering if you want to get out of Sorrows and suffering this is the way not the other way that does not mean that you will not be in the world be in the world but not of the world be in the boat but not in the water water should be a boat should be in the river no but River should not enter into the boat so we live in the world that world should not bother us inside so to detest from that that is called test for God so how the test for God will come Narada says satsanga when you go to the holy company thinking of God talking about God mind becomes pure and you see how many people Saints in the world have got peace in the world they have nothing in the material world as it were but they are the most peaceful person in the world I feel extremely sorry for people who due to their own sin have no opportunity to hear about the Lord's excellences their money they have wealth but they have no opportunity to hear about God and now it is available everything that's also look at that on online you go you go for YouTube and try to talk listen some talk or bhagavat or Gita or upanishad everything is available available all types of religious practices no but when one opens what is the test where one person moves one person moves for a movie watching a movie one person for the politics one person for this material or Sports and sports games and what not all variety types of science art literature books novels these that entertainment but who goes for searching for God and who finds not only goes there who finds joy in that those who are getting Joy they are unfortunate their life has become purified little bit otherwise taste will not go you will not like God will be your disturbance as some people come to dakshineswar when ramakrishna was there they could not even sit in the room of ramakrishna when he is speaking such wonderful spiritual dogs but they have no interest they they could not as a peace basket they will be happy in the peace basket not in the flower garden and that's why they suffer the suffering goes on Life After Life and in this attachment so he says I feel extremely sorry for the people my true is saying I feel sorry for those people Sankara also said what is what a misfortune uh getting this human body getting all this capacity to know who we are who is in me what is that consciousness not knowing that just live a life of ordinary life birth and death and suffering and misery and disease and death is very sad story is a is a lost case as it were so they are fortunate who being in the body having everything loves God because they cannot see because due to their sin they have no no opportunity to hear about the Lord's excellences and all the more so for those who in spite of such opportunity are indifferent to it some people have no opportunity there are people in the world suppose they are living in such condition that there is no opportunity say we you go to uh what Afghanistan live over there and you try to hear about holy words where is Holy words only rules regulations and our disciplines and this and that and there is no open scope for the women to come out to go to school to learn this learn that all this but those who are having that opportunity and that opportunity they don't use it really there uh they are daily to be repented upon so they are so some people didn't get a chance some people's chance is there but don't take advantage of this chance so this is an example CRC this is the example the class is going on opportunity is here to come and sit people are around here have no taste does not feel attraction for this it is it is really Phi upon them according to this book that they're getting this opportunity they don't take advantage of it why not to blame anyone the bad karma in the mind which drives them for more important they feel it is more important other things rather than God when you feel for God when the ramakrishna said when you will you realize God but when like the student went to a teacher and said sir when shall I realize God he didn't say anything he took this student and took to the pond foreign and put him just dipped him into the waters and holding his head under the water and one minute two minute five minute and he's now restless and his money just put money going to collapse he released and he came up what was your feeling I was panting for breath I was dying to have a breath and when that type of thing will happen for God then you will realize God ah so this is really we are very surprising we can watch our mind and one is good or bad in that way this is the bad tendency which tendency is forcing me to go for other things more interesting and if there is an opportunity also we don't take the advantage of those opportunities so that's why more so for those who in spite of such opportunity are indifferent to it the lifespan of such people who indulge in and talk of only worldly matters is consumed by unwinking speed it up time now our life will go away the clicking of the clock does not stop for anyone not for you not for me not for the holy not for the Unholy not for the president of United States not for the homeless guy time click click click click click click it goes on that's why he says the lifespan our lives for an allotted life you are for 100 years someone maybe 90 years whatever the lifespan the lifespan of such people what who indulge in and talking of only worldly matters they find great joy you bring politics they excited they will he can go in fighting energy will come up when you talk about that each one has a subject no and that time you find this is fighting with it is arguing in this favor and this paper but when it comes to talk about God there's no interest in it oh you go to the temple you are becoming spiritual you don't come to our party this weekend party most of the people cannot come because they say I am a weekend party is important how many party you did how much joy you got it how much peace you Attain and check if you go to a holy place and have little good tendency then you will see what type of joy you can find inside so lifespan will go away that's why I say who indulge in talk up on worldly matters is consumed by unwinking Spirit of time that spirit is unwinking spirit is always that life is going on but time is clicking clicking clicking clicking no one time does not stop for anyone the how do you utilize the time in which way good way in a way where you get Eternal peace or you get engaged into whatever way you like it is your freedom God don't blame God but it is not to be blamed God is not to be blamed God has given us equal opportunity every day I am given you 24 hours every day and now you utilize which way this mother durgas Durga Puja time now I I know some of the people are doing a hundred thousand times repeating the name at least 10 days 100 000 Times They Are repeating they they're utilizing the time this this day is 10 days and we are also utilizing 10 days if you ask how many times I thought of God how many times I take the name of the Lord count yourself see how you have utilized the time and how you others are utilizing so it is the utilization of time their lives if they do not use for the right cause and talk of worldly things consumed in worldly time their lives are indeed lived in vain because the life will go one day and death will knock at the door then you say hey come wait wait wait I have something to do but I know you will have done enough so life you have done now come with me and where will you go according to your thought according to your action who is thinking of light Purity they will go to the pure animal plane those are thinking of dark counts and wildly not they'll go to the worldly level that's all so where is the freedom where is the Peace that is on in even one side o Friend Of The Afflicted so describe to us the essence of his sanctifying deeds his means gods krsnas his deeds and excellences extracting it as a honeybee draws the nectar from flowers from our benefit narrate to me whatever actions of the Superhuman worth of superhuman work the Lord performed in his descent when he assumed his divine power for the creation preservation and dissolution of the universe tell me when the lord of the universe came down and took a human body and moved in the life he has his play of the childhood play and gopala playing with the mother jasoda tell me about those stories tell me about how he played with the gopis how he was spare all the time engaged in Divine play with the pure hearted souls or Sages thank you at 10 minutes are there okay and let me do another period we can go to the question later now now in this response this sukadev the great says he said that Divine says material on being this question by this bidura bidura put this question to the sage my Trio in the who lived in haridwar for the spiritual good of the whole world replied us now these are the questions put by midurga to the sage maitreya and now my Trio is now responding to the dead Plies 18 verse O Holy One you have put the right question it will benefit all the world it will contribute to the fame of you who have dedicated your heart and soul to the Lord his praising bidura That You Are Holy you have dedicated your life to God bhagwan Krishna so you are fortunate and these questions are very genuine I will respond to those questions and that will benefit not only you but it will benefit the humanity that's why we are greeting today we are getting benefit whatever the response we are getting here this is no matter of wondering in you who had your origin from madhurayana and you have be have by your wholehearted devotion almost captured hurry in your heart so you are Great Soul you are carrying holy the Lord in your heart so you are fortunate Yama who admins the punishment to all beings from their sins was cast by the sage one W to be born in the world of men you are that Yama born of Basil in a sudra woman you are certainly beloved of the Lord and all his devotees for at the time of his departure from the world of man he remembered you and commanded me to impart to you the knowledge that gives spiritual enlightenment so it was already you are a holy person [Music] bhagavan Krishna while living his body he commanded me to relate this answers to you already he commanded but you are now putting this question now I shall tell you one after another the supportive activities which formed the expression of his yoga Maya read the resulting in the creation maintenance and dissolution of the universe so I'll talk about you how God the lord of the universe took birth and how he creates maintains and destroys this universe all the spiritual question in the beginning the Lord bhagavan along alone existed bhagwan alone existed 23rd verse it says Atma atmi Channel so he was in the beginning the Lord bhagavan was existing alone only there is no two no one he was the essence of all and he was all everything he the pure Spirit was the master of himself all that is called the many was by his will dissolved by himself so he is the only alone reality and he himself by his own will made it manifest in this whole universe there is no one forced him we are we do work and our compulsion of our desire we do work by compulsion of our masters where we do job even in home or in any front of our life we work because Guided by somebody forcing me but here God no one forces him in his own self-will by his own will he created himself and created this universe and this non-dual and self-drivening Seer saw no objective when he was alone he didn't see any object that sachidananda Brahman who was his only reality Alone vedanta says there's only one reality that is Brahman that is called Ananda it is there it is of the nature of Consciousness it is of the nation of bliss and there is no parallel no creation nothing to be created so that was the only thing this non-dual and self-revealing Seer share means the Consciousness Observer who sees inside in us there's somebody seeing all these things because God is seated in the heart he sees everything good bad whatever thinking what you are doing you can hide everybody but you cannot hide the Seer who is seeing inside you and that is called God so he is the Seer she saw there is no object when when power and this manifestation subsided and the Seer alone remained the spirit thought of himself as non-existent as the subject has no relevance without any object what is called Maya is the power of the witness of it has got the Dual nature of being in the states of cause and effect it is that by which the all-powerful one man unmanifests the whole universe that one becomes subject and object that there is only one reality he saw there is no parallel so he created by his willpower made himself divide into two Rama gave the example he put the water in a bucket and then put a stick and if you see you will see the stick is divided into two but sticky stick it has not divided into two but you see like that so this world he creates of appearance the Lord possessed of The Power Of Consciousness and manifest as purusha cast his seed deflected Consciousness in his Maya whose prostitutes of the three gunas are agitated by the power of time hi vedanta so he says ultimately it is by the power of Maya he himself the one absolute manifested and created this universe so this is only one question this up to verse number 36. we will see next day right 27 this is the 27 verse I will start next day so we have read after 26 months three book number three chapter five 1-26 is that really what's the question now we will have some question huh we end it here the class is ended here um now now we'll have some questions but one question has come till we have to see what this question and we in the kashipur garden house swamiji was up all night practicing and being Restless when Master called him to debate and said to him to be patient but at that point he had already attained need we called samadhi at the kashipur house light and he had seen the vision of mankali in the temple of some time ago what then was the Restless for was it to make it his own is then the ultimate goal to be restless for A4 is to be established in samadhi you know we don't understand this what is this tremendous Joy when one realizes the truth and he got everything yes and need to be called for samadhi also he got it in dakshineswar and also he had the same mother Divine mother Kali in seeing mother everywhere but second time he had difficult to somebody within himself only but saying God everywhere is the highest part that's what Abu said that he will go to the highest better than this all these things so seeing Temple seeing with him is limited but saying everyone said that he didn't reached that is why he was Restless okay that's a good idea in kind and then he saw a mother in the temple okay Consciousness inside now there is his Restless to see everywhere so that to that means establishment you establish in your experience all the time being in God consciousness and murugan another from the term of bhakti yoga that you see suppose you are so pure and you are very close to the Mountain what is called made of um which mountain that magnet Mountain when you are very close to a magnet Mountain and someone puts you little pulling you separate your iron iron piece of iron and that attraction what is so powerful and still you want to do but you cannot go sometimes you feel in your personal life you are thinking that I will do meditate and have everything ready and some obstacles come in between and this one your mind is very peaceful you are going to Joy enjoy the Bliss and you are driving into that and that moment some obstacle comes so it is a tremendous uh attraction for divine comes which is resistable and he's talking about that probably he is restless to have that absolute merging into the samadhi and not to normally his whole life he tried whenever he went he went to be in samadhi but you can understand whatever this is too high state to understand otherwise let us be restless in our present condition not to be satisfied with what we are living for we are talking and we are living in the world of Duality we are living in the world of eating and sleeping and dying let us have some something higher life and then we will understand more but it is good to question like this I think the he wants to be totally seeing God actually I understand that we have totapuri could see God everywhere at the end seeing God Transcendent that was God within or in a transcendental God but to imminent seeing God everywhere there's the last one now I think probably that was the reason he is restless to have it anyhow that is my assumption but uh God knows when you are much more deep into the spiritual practice it will come to you another question coming from Bill you mentioned mirabai it is hard to find English translations of the alvars can you recommend some good translations always yes I I think you can write to me then I will try to respond to you about the books available I'll inquire also okay you can also try online and probably you'll find it okay so anything more no okay so we end here we will have another class soon is six o'clock will be our evening prayer at six after that 7 30 we'll have another class that is the Shanti Gita I will start that thank you for attending um Shanti Shanti Shanti peace peace peace to all
