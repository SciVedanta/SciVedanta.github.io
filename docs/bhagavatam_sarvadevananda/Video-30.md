[Bhagavatam - 2.2.22-34 ( Book 2, Chapter 2, Verse 22)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72UKGqcczUc)

so [Music] [Music] we salute bhagavan sri krishna who is the son of vasudeva who is the destroyer of the demons like kang and chanura and the dear darling of mother and jason and the devaki and the guru of the entire world we salute him again and again so we are back to our reading of the bhagavat and we are reading in the book two chapter second and verse number 22 will be starting today last time we read that how a yogi how a yogi experiences how his departure from the world how he will come and sit behind them so that i can see your face go little one step left left space out because we are still covered situation so little space out so the yogi how a yogi leaves the body that was the discussion last time from verse number 15 of this chapter second chapter book two second chapter 15 verse two but as we read at the end of twenty one so what it says that spiritual aspirant then tries to control the energy up sooner she restrains the energy not to go down and then raises the consciousness one layer after another layer in the chakras come to the heart chakra and then goes up to the bottom of the neck that is up to that range is the heart chakra's range and it moves from there to that this chakra here and then from the spine up in the back is saying that he he raises his consciousness higher fire up and then let it go to the brahmarandra that is the the crown chakra so the vital energy that resides in the navel we read that should be raised further to the chest on ahata and united with the aspect of vital energy which is prana energy residing that it's called pranavayu udanavaya pranav then from there the aspirant sued with the help of his willpower carefully raise the energy little by little to the root of the neck that we shoot the chakra here we sew it here normally but it is the back side so and until uh and unite with udana uh udanubah is the upper side by you right so they're the function of the on the different functions of the same vital energy as force run away where is that boy horse he doesn't know uh the vital energy residing there and from that point the energy should be raised should be raised to the root of the tongue that means this next next chakra which is the upper limit of the vishuddha chakra this chakra range up to the with the upper limb we should tongue and just below the tongue is here and then that should be raised from there to the middle of the eyebrows the agna agna chakra and then this destructor going down that the seven orifices the orifices of the eyes ear nose and mouth should be then restrained to prevent so the prana energy does not get out through the ear to the eyes so checking all these lower points of movement of the pranic energy the yogi because they practice their spiritual discipline so they have the control and they check all those points not the last vital energy should not get out to these lower planes of consciousness and if one is without any desire no desire for worldly things and and even for god or heaven heavenly enjoyment also one stays there for a moment with his spiritual insight fully uncovered and then piercing the brahmanandra at the top of the crown unless the body realizing oneness with the supreme being so that is the greatest yogi who reach transcending their limitations from chakra to chakra to chakra to chakra and restraining all the energy not to get out through any other chakra other than this crown chakra so that we did the other day so we start reading today from verse number 22 on page 100 of this book what does it say it says how is yogi how a yogi transcends different spheres up to brahmaloka there are also spiritual spheres raising the consciousness from one level to the other level to the brahmaloka the plane of the brahman so how that is possible that is also is described here now good so the world of becoming which is the product of the combination of the gunas prakiti has several levels of regions what it says bhagavata says the verse number 22 which is structured there are this world of becoming this world has become i don't see it that way come and the no no you use it you sit in a way no in the back and come here this corner so that we can see the face at the same time so you are not using mask anymore to try to use it because we have resent some of our nuns also got something there in the in the retreat better to keep little i am doing it because i am now speaking i cannot of course i have it in my pocket so so say 22nd verse says that this world of becoming what is this becoming means become it was brahman brahman has become the world how it become is becoming means in this not only in the growth but in the subtle level there are planes of higher consciousness [Music] [Music] they call higher and higher and tallahat these are different planes you know we live in in our own level of where our mind resides where is mind we live in that consciousness no people can live in this world in a hell our people can live here in the contact of the divine entities day and night and totally absorbed in god and joy and bliss outside things are happening it does not matter because they have the power to keep the mind in another level so what it says here this world of becoming what is this world is the product of the combinations of the three gunas satya rajas and tamas three gunas permutation combination the entire universe of becoming not only in the growth in the subtle level also there is a punishing world of what you call the downgrade hell and enjoyable fun and enjoying and this and that to the serenity to more serenity like swami vivekananda in the plain of fire even no ordinary people can give no gods and enter there in a higher realm than that he stepped in samadhi almost merging but not yet much almost merging not yet much so these are different levels so he says this this entire universe wherever you go highest peak to the lowest one of creation this is made of the three gunas and also of prakiti and has several levels of regions if the yogi is desirous of any of this like the brahmaluka or the region of siddhas means those who are perfected people believe in that so there are similar type of people who have done the spiritual practice and raised their consciousness in such a level they live there let's say we want to go to ramakrishna loka means what there will be the presence of the mind will always feel the presence of rama krishna holy mother vivekananda brahmana shivananda all these luminaries and uplifted souls and not only that it's dancing and singing and joy and blessings is going on as we read in the gospel and other areas so so that type of experience will happen and he will live in that consciousness so long he lives in the level of the mind mind is living in the physical body now we see this realm of reality mind raised into another level of consciousness you will see the another line it's like psychological patience you go to everyone swami is hallucinating sam is seeing this some spiritual people they are also seeing something some divine entities mother durga some seeing the feeling the presence of the saints no so different levels of consciousness sid does then he leaves the body alone the indriyas organs and manas so that's the world of becoming that means this world of becoming which is the product of the combination of the three gunas it is nothing but the combination and permutation of this gunas of the prakhiti it has several levels origins finer level subtle level that's why gross subtle causal but in one jump we cannot say this grows to social so there are all infinite number of planets in between grows to subtle and then subtle to causal here is the causal so in between there will be infinite number of space and experiential areas and then beyond when you merge yourself into the supreme so who will say what is there so there is nothing nothing or vedanta says that is called brahman buddhist will say nothing vedantist usually brahman if the yogi now desires of any does his desires of any of this like the brahmaloku or the region of siddhas then he leaves the body along the injuries organs and malas that means that they live they live their body through the senses so let us see what senses mean 23rd verse 22nd verse says [Music] it is the plane of the senses senses are eyes yes no strength concept perception sense of perception the movements of the masters of yogi who have become subtler than even air are on unrestrained and restricted but within and without this cosmic sphere so the movement of the masters of yoga those who have done practice of yoga for a long time they don't live in the physical plane so live in the mental plane so they who have become subtler not this physical but in the sub like our dream you just compare yourself then you'll be you have to glimpse of that in dream we sleep suppose 1000 people are sleeping and 1000 people are dreaming everyone's dream is different no in the dream someone is having fun someone time seen terrible fighting going on huh someone is still torturing someone someone so it all this according to the mental condition each one's mental condition they're in the different though apparently their body is in the physical level their mental level is so so we can understand that if the mind by spiritual practice one raises consciousness so we may be all the people meditating but our mind will be in different plateaus one level to the other level one dot to the another doctor see infinite number of potential possibilities are there so the movements of the masters of yoga who have become subtler than even air how they become means they live in the consciousness which is subtler than the air that means finer air is a gross the air we are breathing this gross air they are certainly air no there you know in the vedanta sorrow those who have red you will know huh opanchikrita it's a technical term panchikrita means five assimilated together that's all five combination is kichuri air water fire all this mixed together maybe as we say it is what did you eat today people say i have eaten rice and dull you and rice and then only two items you have said major in bengal people take so much rice that's why the name comes right rice but not rice only so many other items there is they prepare so many 510 items other other items they don't talk about that some some say what is the cook what is the food you ate today pasta did you eat only pasta no with did some saw say some these and that you are not mentioning that but majority being the so people talk about that it is their the um subtle it becomes the mind the movement of the masters who have become subtler than the air this air heater what we are talking this physical air is the half of the pure air subtle plus one eight of fire one eighth of subtle water heat no kitty update so four rest of the four one eight one eight right and measure is half as i said rice and i ate rice what did you eat i took rice today i took past pasta today you don't take only pasta you don't take rice only you start you go to the hotel and you say oh what are them what did you eat you refer them principal mill but you have other meals also associated so similarly principal air it is air physical layer is the combination of major part of its subtle layer and rest of the other parts all combined together creates the this physical air so you now rise into subtle level so subtle you live in the level of subtle air subtle fire subtle city of these murdered bomb pipe so the movements of the masters of yoga when i become subtler than the even even the air that means this body is now heavy you but when you live in your mind that nighttime dream how how you weigh if anyone weighs your dream body it will be lighter than the air this here see that's why they are saying that it will be who becomes subtler than the even the air are unrestricted both within and without this cosmic sphere naturally he can move here you can move there if the air air can move everywhere if it is finer than the air then it can go to brahmaluka to naroloka to develop all different places can move according to their own capacity those who are devoted to vedic ritualism they have done jagna offering ablation chanting debating mantras vedic hymns and they offer some vedic sacrificial fire then those who are vedic ritualism can gain the exalted goal of these aspirants who are endowed with knowledge austerity yoga and samadhi so by those who are doing vedic ritual that's why it says you by jagna you can attain any any level you want to go you can be human you can be god you can be demian in the you go to the gandharva loka with your own spiritual practice of offering a juggernaut oblation to the juggernaut that's why in ancient times that is so popular you can reach heaven you can be a king you can be this and by by only performing jungle the merit of that juggernaut will carry your subtle body into a plane into that where you can enjoy what is your cherished desire so the vedic ritualism those who are devoted to vedic ritualism cannot gain the exalted goal of this experience who are endowed with the knowledge austerity yoga and samadhi but they were practicing yoga was activating austerity who are practicing samadhi these ritualistic person cannot reach that the ultimate they can reach to to go their lower planes but he cannot reach that plane which is uh the highest plane of brahmaloka because they are talking about brahmaloka passing through the luminous orifice of the sushumna now it is saying that boy the energy was slipped and no we are talking about how to meditate in that chapter it is going higher and higher from the chakra to chakra to chakra and came to the crown chakra and then passing to the luminous orifice of the sushumna this is the sushumna and travelling the path of brahman in the spiritual firmament the liberated jivo of the latter type first attains the sphere of agni yeah these are you have to believe it how you know wow question how did you go because when they leave the body they are saying because the yogis they have their control and their brahmaluka they it's penetrating the crown chakra then the subtle body yeah it goes up when that the traversing the path of brahman because they thought so much control how did it come that they thought day and night are brahmana that's why it didn't go to the all the other organs and other areas and restraining in every corner the body is lifted up lifted the subtle body of the soul is gone in the spiritual format so traversing the path of brahman the liberated jiva does not ordinary people those people who have so much merit that they have liberated themselves by their spiritual practice the liberated jew of the latter type first attains this fear of agni how it goes it is the ogni loka you can say the pure sphere of agni freed from all impurities caused by desires as soon as you go fire kills destroys all types of dross so being freed from all impurities caused by the desires he then attains to the luminous susumna sphere or the sphere of i don't know the sphere of the shape of a shape of a crocodile there is a sphere we have to hear being i do not i cannot explain because only the yogis who can go they can tell this guy you know obscene so they reach their plane of sri hari that is the spear sushumna sphere of lord god the ultimate very this book is talking about in our ayanna and the lord of the universe who is also called as krishna incarnated krishna so they go into that plane of hari srihari transcending this sushumna sphere which is like a hub of the universe he attends to an extremely subtle body which is unaccompanied by any deity he attends to maha mahalaka which is the most venerated abode of those who contemplate on brahman so those who are thinking i am brahmana etc day and night they are talking about their journey they have been liberated here how did their soul gets merged into brahman this description is given so it is only we cannot you cannot challenge why what it is not the why what it is the way it happens and where the sages like brighu with their lifespan of eons abide so you go to reach that plane where the sages like bhrigu they leave their life span of thousands and thousands of years there because it is not merged yet to the brahmana but it is only journey they are talking how the journey mind is becoming subtler and subtler and he has been preached from all attachment of the world now it goes we only hear that mar came to buddha at the last point only one word which level which fear we do not know probably they are describing little further details of those journey when the time of nuemita they lived there for a long period for joy and namity kaprolaya pralam is dissolution namitika means intermittent this world goes into how many times the world has been destroyed and again it came in the same creation in this earth planet earth historically if we hear oh it was all flooded all covered with this all the animals died and then again creation started so it is it is called intermittent pralia intermediate dissolution of the fiery heat emanating from the mouth of the adi says burns of all the three worlds the yogi halting at tapuloka leave it and migrate to the still subtler and more transcending region of brahma which is resorted to be the most highly evolved jivas and who is last for two pro paro para that means immense stage of time which constitutes the life of your brahma we are talking up joy you know spiritual life is joy but how do you know here is a joy and maximum joy what do you get here that is the limit now you know your mind traveling by yogic practice we are saying that this so long in the body you can feel you can say mind has gone up you good meditation today you find joy in it but go to higher and higher and higher now it is not that question that it is that the yogi is departing from his body so as the crossing all these chakras piercing the brahmarandra they become just it is it becomes lighter the soul he this body is so heavy but this mind body is so fine it is it light lighter than the air it moves on on on and it reaches the plane by this is the plane of srihari and then the transcending the sushumna sphere is in the hub of the universe as if the whole universe is rotating from that source hub of the universe he attends to an extremely subtle body which is unaccompanied and he actually reaches there who takes him there no gods and goddesses can go there it is by own pure purity it's my own long practice it reaches there unaccompanied by any deity he attains is the heaven normal concept of heaven maha is further up he attains that moloka which is most venerated the buddha for them who who meditate on brahma brahman who contemplate on brahman and where and that plane only are not ordinary sages can go and stay there the sages like brigu with a lifespan of infinite time time eons eons means thousands and thousands of years no when a calculation of time expands so they live there in that abode when now staying there and now even the nuemetico proloyo means intermediate dissolution when it has this happens that means in that time what happens the fear heat i'm emanating from the mouth of the adi sesha narayana lies in the serpent lying that the symbolic symbolic that but this fire which comes out destroys all the desires burns they are all three words of the yogis in the three words who bhuva saw these three lokas their burns all these three words the yogis of the yogis and the halting at the toppo loka mahajana tapa tapologa leave it and migrate to the and more transcendental region of brahma which is resorted to be the most highly evolved jivas and which lasts for two part of those immense stage of time which constitutes the life of brahma so these are all concepts of longer joy higher joy greater joy prolonged joy now that's why in the underbody it has been of the [Music] it says the joy one young man gets here he'll multiply by thousand times suppose that joy which one young man with a good health and enjoys the world suppose he has become the emperor of the whole world think how much joy multiplied thousand times multiplied thousand times so there is a calculation they have given this only indication the joy is becoming bigger and so faster and vaster and people get stuck there because shake you suddenly you become billionaire what will do and you billion billion then you suddenly become trillion then trillionaire what you do not know how to spend the money that says yogi's yogis who do austerity and then they can stay there with stan no you have that guts like that but princely people can enjoy no we are hearing that our swami ishat manando went to the arab countries and he was invited for some interfaith meeting india that what is called who's remarkable story he was invited and he was talking about the power the food the amenities the things they eat the things that some use for their food and for their dress and thing by god gorgeous and so fine and so nice and he kind of didn't think of a little bit in in your opinion whatever that so then so there is another but those people who live there every day that is common for them but you could greater and greater greater and greater that's it people all are expecting to go to heaven because if this joy is limited there will be long joy so not that that is not infinite actually go more and more and more and more so yogic practice and yogis go to higher and higher so there is no sorrow in that realm of brahman no [Music] decrepitude of oldies no death no kind of suffering except the one feel painful feeling namely the sorrow which arises from sympathy for the jivas subject to endless suffering due to their non-understanding the merits of the divine service it is such a high flight that's why it is called the buddha state of buddha buddha is a state they could merge into the absolute totally but still they keep a little trace of their ego what is the purpose they keep a desire what is the desire desire is no kind of suffering or any painful feeling the sorrows which arise only this they also suffer even in that state what that's suffering for all humankind that's why this place from where avotados come or you can say the special adhikari purusha we hear in the ramakrishna's great master or the divine play so it is a sphere higher and higher and higher spear where they don't have any need for themselves there is all their sufferings gone all their pain anguish everything gone they are established into the endless joy but still they are not loss of pain if they in that state that pain does not remain in their heart pain to redeem the world the sufferings of the world that shankaracharya said such a bhagavan though he is ajo john birthless there is no decay or loss in it he's the lord of the universe he does not need anything but bhutan to help the buddha created being out of infinite compassion for them feeling their suffering they incarnate so oudhikari purusha also they bring their associates he comes god himself comes and keeps these people to be in that plane not allow them to merge like sami vivekananda was willing to get into samadhi and ramakrishna said no you will have to do mother's work and he is trying to go to samadhi he can go it but he will not allow and said until you finish my mother's work you will have to do all this so that is the point that he feels the compassion the pain there is a pain but that pain is not for anything for his own he has accomplished everything a little trace of duality remains and that duality out of infinite compassion for the seeing the pain they feel oh these people are suffering so much let me do something some people can understand i shall be born again and again to remove the suffering of even one one person in the world no even a dog has their uh that even the suffering of the humanity that's the part so that means this yogis transcend in different spheres goes to the plane what we understand that in the gospel and other place says that it is called the merger before the brahman with the brahman not in that state little place that's he called ramakrishna is to stay in this age and that side is infinite and this side is the becoming the world level of world grows and grosser and grosser and grosser or from this side satellite and subtler and subtler and satellite this age of all subtleties it is low coming sphere so it is a sphere of brahman that means not brahman you are talking about sphere little stress of a pure ego and that ego of compassion the ego of feeling the pain for the suffering humanity demands anyhow this is just to know what happens how the yogi passes beyond brahmanda how did it go again the verse 28. so the 20th verse says how the yogi who has attained to the brahmaloka this plane which is the highest state of brahmanda the shell-enfolded universe that means the whole universe you are talking about it's individuals of duality transcending transcending transcending and going to the last phase ramakrishna it is called the bhabha mukha in that last state how the yogi was attained to this brahmaloka which is the highest state of brahmana goes beyond it now is described now they are talking about how it goes beyond that all the categories evolved from prakiti constitute these cells and the yogi passes from the grocer to the settler through the identification we teach so this description they have given yogi's practice and raises their consciousness like hiking you go from the ground and go up hike little up one level stay up to that level enjoy the vista and experience and stabilize yourself you go to koilas you will be going like this one step one night another flight another night two nights three nights no enjoy that plane and then go go go go so each flight has its own charm own beauty pastor experience of joy ultimately you went to the brahma loka how will be penetrating that also so that is described here all the categories that has evolved from prakiti constitutes these cells and the yogi passes from the grocer to the subtler to the identification with each they identify i'm going to i'll i'll go to heaven and do that all karma and everything that is there then say no no no i go to higher next higher plane so they do again jump on their austerity practice etcetera and they are also practice detachment the detachment for other things otherwise they cannot go mind will pull them so buddha saw the mar but mark would not do anything christ also last temptation they call this temptation grossly they describe how they will describe this subtle and see how difficult the language language is always complicated and we have no idea about that so that's why saying they'll give up that grows to subtler to settler and subtler and then they are staying in brahmaluka and then from there the untouched by any element of fear he touched he with his linga sharira subtle body because that time mind is still there attends to oneness with the earth with the element it gets baba we don't understand what they're talking about no just imagine pretty element preliminary element of the earth from that which is caused the water water grows earth is more gross then saturn is the water the water's origin earth's origin that means the five elements they're not that gross form subtler subtle as subtle as subtler from form of which came from brahman only all these all the qualities came from them so going back to the source we came back this way down and we are here now now it is the turn journey back with the cause of the water element and from that water element it is which is called fire element and from that fire element to the wind element fire is restricted no wind is much bigger because you know look at the earth a fire happens in one place two places but how much is the air air is everywhere so it is bigger that means subtler means master master faster and from that fire element to the space a castle element which is a symbol of the all-pervading brahman akasha is the closest example of brahman is the akash where people give the exam god is like space everywhere to indicate everywhere so look at that air is limited along the earth no and then air element to the fire element to the air element and from that element space in the space all the stars and galaxies and everything is there how big is that so that sphere is increasing expanding and dimension which is symbol of all perfecting almost akka so that's why it is example normally in vedanta books they give two examples one they give the space example or earlier they give the example of the ocean and we are too limited what shall we think of big big expanse of reality but it is the growth to subtle to subtle they go now how the yogi transcends the subtle aspect of elements out of which are formed the objects of the senses is from the objects of the senses is now stated now how this the senses are also made of the five elements and these are the five elements in the external world how they can the senses can help us to go beyond this all this realm of five elements that is described here the sense of smell he dissolves in a subtle element smell the sense of test in the subtle element of test the sense of sight in the form site where sight is related to the form you see some form then your sight eye works so in the sense of touch in the tactile element the sense of hearing in the sound element and the organs of actions in their respective functions so you retrace them back the eyes as a sense of smell is dissolved in the subtle element smell so this is the smell you get a fragrance perfume it is so subtle you can you go to the root of that smell so yogis can go that i do not know what level they are talking about just to understand subtler you have to how to as a eyes are seeing you have to go to the root of the eye [Music] is the eye of the real eye realize it is the eye so go back from here to the real go back from the hearing to the real root of its sound sims symbol no so all the five senses are to be brought back to the root of them the senses of test is the nail element test the subtle element test the sense of sight in the form the sense of touch in tactile elements the sense of hearing the sound element and organs of action in their organs of actions in their respective hand-fitted center in their respective functions next how the yogi transcend still higher categories is now described the yogi dissolves the bhuta suksmas subtle aspects of deliverance in their sources that means it is going back it is the product so we are in the product level we draw the mind from which it is coming that's why it's the language the bhuta suksma suksma bhutas subtle elements in their source gross element we talked about gross element coming of the subtle element now the now subtle element should have its source push them back to its source subtle element to its source the thomas aspect amkar what is that that is the ego that means ego for us it is so fine but it is it is gross in the eyes of the experience this ego our little ego petty you identified with the five senses and five sense of action and five senses of perception they are saying bring them back to its source bring them back to your soul and then ultimately it comes to the ego the organs in their ego organs in their source the mind and the presiding deities in their source so has three types of mohamkara satika rajasahankar and tamasu so he says the to the the thomas aspect of what when the yogis dissolve the bhuta suksmas suks babuto subtle element it brings back to its ego source but that is called the thomas now the organs in their source to raja sahongkar the mind and his presiding duties in their source of satika hong kong see how we are going back we know what is it ego is a buddha's five elements withdrawn into the subtle cause that is the damaso ahankara and then ankara's three types of and then total we call the ego so the term the organs is our five sense organs organs are to be brought to the resource sources rajasoy organ mean organ of action etc it is rajasi so it's it is coming from the rajas the mind and the presiding deities mind is subtler mind is that's why mind is called the eleventh organ five sense organ of perception five organs of action and they all are controlled by mind if the mind is not their hand cannot function eyes cannot see i see but does not see here hear but does not hear so my mind is going back to the so mind going to the sattika the sense organs going back that is the rajaso ankara and the subtle aspects of the elements five elements pancho bhuta they would trace back to that so divided into three it is a bhakti book our imagination because we have no concept but who is saying their dishes it is who is saying shukadeva is saying sukhadeva is born brahmagani so big scientist the greatest scientists but he's telling us to give give us idea no as as as we as he told about that the swami went to saudi arabia and he was entertained in which way they are describing so what do you understand wow do you understand that what he has experienced but people like us will get a glimpse of that understanding that's why this description taku tried to say and his mouth becomes subtle he cannot speak okay so then then then he dissolves in the ankara in its cause the maha tattoo in the gunas and the gunas in the prakhiti so they are merging into matata to it is philosophy if you keep the mind in sankhya philosophy how it is everything is merging into marching and matching much the dissolved in the prakhiti he becomes clothed with bliss prakiti laaya sankapilaza he says prakitilayanam prakitalaya people people who get into margin to practice these are the people so with drawing with drawing drawing like that they go into the saktika rajashika tamasika ego and then that goes to the root what is called the prakhiti and dissolve that prakhiti he becomes clothed he becomes uncertain level that she sees nothing but bliss all around with bliss and then abandoning all adjuncts he becomes one in nature with the self capital which is utter peace and bliss so there he becomes absolutely individual soul merging in that level becomes established in perfect peace and bliss oh dear one he who goes along the path leading to the lord never returns to the lord's spirit if one can go penetrating these fears and spears and spears it is that level he cannot come back again o king these are the two paths of spiritual progress eternal spoken in the vedas of which you wanted to know first is the path of immediate salvation and the other is the gradual salvation you reach that point how you go immediate hear itself or it may be gradual you have come to higher plateau stay there enjoy that experience from there you go higher and higher and higher experience bhagavan vasudeva himself revealed this to brahma you may say way how do you say all this it's only bhagavan vasudeva bhagavan krishna has him himself revealed this knowledge to brahma who worshipped him with great devotion in ancient times this book is vishnu book so naturally brahma should request fall at the feet of bishnum or shiva all will have to come under vishnu that's it to give us the good taste of devotional attitude to bring there is no other path of spiritual fulfillment so easy and safe for being caught up in samsara as the path of devotion to the lord but brahma himself impartially scrutinized the vedas thrice with deep concerned concentration and the conclusion he arrived at was that the most efficient efficient means of spiritual evolution is that what generates intense devotion to huri yogis go this way but by law by devotional practice you can be there so i can end here is after verse number 30 to like 34 on page 102 birth number 34 22 to 34 only 10 verses okay so i don't ask questions because i do not know all these if they are all the bhagavata says i am just reading it the yogis who practice how they transcend one plane to the other plane to the other plane really how do we know without practicing we cannot meditate little bit and this what happens it goes to the plane and leaving this plane and higher plane and higher plane to the three gunas how the triggers are merging into it and how the top of austerity spiritual factors lead the yogis with the yoga controlling this this this they go to the sphere to speak to sphere like that but all this can be loved by only calling upon god this is the beauty of this book the yogic path is so many serious and difficult but you just cry to god take the name of worry by his grace it will happen ramakrishna said if you can cry for god people are doing pranayama kumbhaka pranayama because the body can be estimated such that if you stand still it will be like a no breath come back means breathing air is arrested that means dead body dead body has no more any breathing goes that's why he has left the body but yogi's be remaining in the body can arrest them flow of the breathing and stay almost ramakrishna by simple sheer mind moving into mere samadhi his body the breath stops doctors don't feel the pulse with the stethoscope no everything is gone like a dead body kumbhak she says ramakrishna said if one can cry for god love god with whole heart and soul and cry this will happen spontaneously you need not have to do the knock on all this breathing exercise and go for how many inches here how many inches here and all this measurement and thing ah all this wine to withdraw from here to there to there the god that is ramakrishnan that is here they were coming to that point they are all things true yogi can go that way let them choice but you as a doctor you can also reach the same destination by simply sincerely calling upon god and loving god to the full extent okay okay no question is good for me i do not know much of this journey so what shall i say like that raku said no there's someone saying i had it my uncle's house we have many horses in the cow sheet we have many horses and they live in the cow sheet of my uncle that means he has no idea how big is the horses and horse can be needed what type of room is needed to accommodate them that means he has no concept so he's talking so most of us like that because particularly these areas how the mind goes to this more to the elemental state and elemental state to the finer element and there to the like this mind is merging in the air and that is called the rajas yeah so so we'll read next day from 35 of the 2 2 35 now 34 sorry 2 to 34. om shanti shantihi hari um so hope to see you
