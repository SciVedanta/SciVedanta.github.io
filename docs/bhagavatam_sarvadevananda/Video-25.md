[Bhagavatam - Book 1. Chapter 19 - Verse 9](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlFuIN_2Yg0)

[Music] [Music] [Music] he we salute shri krishna the son of vasudeva the destroyer of the demons kangso and chanura and the dear darling of mother jason and the guru of the world om peace peace peace now we are in the chapter 19th chapter and we are reading that how king parikshit was cursed by the son of that brahmin boy because the major problem was that the king wanted king wanted he was in the forest went for hunting and he felt thirsty and was asking for no not getting water anywhere he was begging for a little drinking water he was also hungry but this the sage was in meditation he could not understand so and out of anger raised then pariksit put in a snake on the neck of the king the sage and then his son cursed that who has done this mischief to my father will have to die within seven days by the snake bite and that was the situation and when he heard this and also he got tremendous renunciation coming back to his kingdom he gave the responsibility of the country of his to his son and after doing that offering that then he took leave into the forest of naomi sharon on the bank of ganga and then that situation he is totally withdrawn his mind from me so the kings and everyone was asking him not to take that decision she will die within seven days so last seven days you wanted to be totally absorbed in the prayer and meditation like that and hearing about bhagavan krishna's life and story so that was going on so the eighth chapter eighth verse is where we start conversation with the rishis now when he the king the great king of great name and fame for his pure character love for the subjects unique respect for the sadhus and the holy people so when he left everyone becomes sad and all the people from the country or the near the palace all they followed him and and when they followed they get together many saints said says and saintly people so eighth verse we start with he says conversation with the riches about his resolution that pariksis resolution so what is that getting the news what news news of pariksits fast on the bank of the ganga that gong on the bank of the ganga the king pariksit is not drinking anything he is totally fasting and many holy men then with their disciples they gathered around the king so any whoever hard oh the king is going to has those days the dying means they don't stop drinking eating natural death and on the bank of ganga that's why it is famous that you want to you will be liberated if you beyond the bank of ganga can die on the bank of ganga so king was going so hearing that many holy people with their disciples and then followed the ganga bank of ganga and they reached there and such sages who are in themselves center of holiness visit places in guise of pilgriman only to enhance the holiness of those places so people gathered from all over india and they are all holy people and they come to a holy place name sharon is a holy place and also to see the kings passing away and to be present there and then who are the sages he has named about about a dozen or more names of the sages they are found their name we found in different places whether the same people into punishable women we find those names brigu is not the father of gyaso some other for us so same repeated name baby but big name or in the who are sages well-renowned sages they all assembled so their names i read one or two as i said it is otri vashishta and several others including large number of maharishis great races rajas raja and rishi that means they are the king of some particular areas as also they are rishis they are holy people raja and rishi rishi means knower of truth they are known of truth at the same time they rule the kingdom they're the small pockets of territory as states here 51 states so like that we've been no small states so kings of all those territories they all assembled raja rishis maharishi's devourishes they were just means they are god's celestial being almost but they in the subtle body they also appeared there when a very auspicious place assembled there the king respectfully received them king who is the king pariksit who is dying so he respectfully accepted and received them and bowed them at their feet after they had all sat down comfortably the king made due prostration to them again and then standing before them with hands held in salutation conveyed to them his ideas what he wants he said his ideas as follows what he said i am indeed the most fortunate among kings because i have become the object of the blessings of all of you great men who is that so the king parishes said that i am indeed most fortunate because you all came and gathered here and i can see you all you in this holy environment you have created because i have become the object of blessings because you came to see me so i have become the object of your blessing you love me to bless me you have all come so i salute you all men of the royal cast who have to do many reprehensible acts are like objects cast off even further away than the water flowing from the feet of brahmanas at their ablution to me a sinful man of that type whom attached intensely to home and its affairs that means i am an ordinary guy i am very much attached to the world and worldliness though he is a holiest king out of humble nature he is describing himself i am fortunate that you all came here to bless this sinful person like me who am attached to the world i am attached to the worldliness but he has the test proves that he in one word he could give up his kingdom no palace and all this so but he's humble he's saying who am i attached to homes and its affairs the great lord of all has now come in the front of brahmana's cars the brahmana's boy has cursed me that's not a cause that's a blessing because of his curse i am going to die and you all holy people assemble here to bless me so i am so fortunate that because of your presence for when death is near at hand even a man with great worldly attachment will be filled with fear and become prone to accept an attitude of devotion and renunciation what me what the question of me everyone in the world even totally attached to the world when death comes mind people become detached no when you see people say our devotee one devotee is in the condition of dying condition he she has stopped drinking anything for last how many days now ten days maybe eight ten days or something and she's saying i don't care for the body this body will go away what is there in it i am detached from the body no because he's in the near death when because death makes us renounce everything a king will have to leave everything behind at the point of death a poor guy he'll have to leave whatever even nothing in his position but to give up everything so this is the way that already every person gets fear of fear and become prone to accept an attitude of devotion and renunciation so and i am now here by your blessings i also is following that same path may the holy men and the sacred ganga accept me now devoted entirely to the lord i don't want anything now i am ready for death and i am on the bank of the ganga holy place has also in presence of all you the holy people so this is my prayer may the holy men and the sacred ganga all of them accept me and now i'm entirely devoted to the lord as their servant let the treasure has pakshaka takshaka is the snake the category of the snake which will very very venomous so that name is takshakar the treacherous takshaka prompted by the brahmanas cars the brahman boy has scarced me because of that that treacherous snake takshaka inflict his fatal bite on me let death come to me in the form of that snake and bite me i care not for it if you holy men are pleased to recite to me the sacred lord conveying the excellence of maha vishnu the all-pervading being i am totally detached from everything and i don't want anything i only want to hear from you about lord maha vishnu mahavishnu who is mahabisnu great visnu lord visru from which all avatars descend narayana they call narayana with the sankhya chakra gada and padma the sankha and padma lotus so narayana horse in four rounds these four things that all pervading he who pervades everywhere that maha vishnu nate late [Music] i want to hear about him you holy people you have assembled you tell me about this life and greatness of that maha vishnu and i don't fear at all if the snake comes and bites me i will accept that but before that i want to hear about god simply i want to hear about god please or you all holy people have come i salute you please help me and tell me the story salutation to the holy ones whatever embodiments i am going to have in the future may i have in every one of them love of the lord facilities for association with the devotees and free and the feeling of harmony with all life ah that's a good prayer seventeen verse says the uh seven year that sixteen verse sixteen verse says if i am born again suppose i will die this body is to go die but if i am to born again that you you please bless us bless me so that whatever embodiment whatever body i am to take again going to take in the future me i have in every one of them in all these bodies i am born in any after hours if i have to born by my karma so let me be born but there love i i am born with love for god i born with a tendency to love god and at one point i love god facilities for association of the devotees i am born so that i get an opportunity to meet the devotees it is very rare no in your few people get the association of the holy people from the birth itself there are many people in the childhood and in other situation they are so disturbed no disturbing situation the childhood grows someone's there the gang i know i know one one family used to live with us he's now gone to glory so he came and samishanan was gave initiation mantra but she was born in an environment gang members whether just growing up you have to join either this gang or that gang otherwise they will kill you he's innocent boy but he grew and that's why his life was miserable and then coming over here staying with swami he learned he used to do the chanting here dropout nighttime joppa with and he used to come they served swami also so but born in an environment which is not congenial for spiritual life but it is a different lifestyle yes so if i i'm born i want to be born in an environment of the devotees and facilities and feeling of harmony with all so that i i don't born be born with some animosity with others anger jealousy frustration that type of so that is my prayer you all bless me you are all holy people assembled here please talk me tell me about the maha visnu and his glory and the life and bless me if i am to born again so that i am born with three conditions may i have every one of them they i am going in future may i have in every one of them or this life love of lord let me have love for god let me be born in a association of the devotees and let the feeling of harmony remain in me for everyone 17 deciding thus and placing the reins of government in the hands of his son parikshith the king established his seat facing north on the southern bank of ganga on a bed of kusa grass arranged with the tips of the grass pointing eastward is giving a vivid description we all meditate facing the north or facing the east as a normal style when there is no chance then you face any direction but in indian tradition is that when you meditate or you make alter the altar should face you but you should face either east or the particular north that decides that how will be the house orientation and then from indian perspective the way the ocean is coming from that's why they think that when they sit they are thinking towards the himalayas the north or east is glorious because the sun comes and all darkness goes so these are the two reasons in the east and even in india all the muslims they face west because from india kaaba the mecca that is on the west side so that's why they face these are the symbologies so this is the parikh is saying that his bed was prepared where he will die how the bed is prepared purified establishes seat he made a seat how facing north and on the southern bank of the ganga ganga southern and northern so he is on the southern bank facing the northern side on a bed made of kusha we we do the kusho grass in the puja time we are using kusho grass and khusha grass is auspicious that's why in india the people meditate on khusho grass this this seat is made of kusogas asana that prepares a collect crucial grass and make a flat arsenal like that and still stitching it like that that's kusha we call kusho asana so he made the bed on the kushasana in the tips of the grass pointing eastward and east very hot so this is the where the bed is prepared when the king just started his fasting so now he started to fast the thrilled day was the gods were thrilled and soured flowers on the earth in his honor and sounded the drums again then that means gods were happy seeing such an auspicious king giving up his body in this particular way like a yogi thinking of god requesting every holy people to speak about maha vishnu his life and glory and with this prayer that if i am to born again i'll be born as a devotee with devotion due devotion it will be protected this way and this and that all these things now when the king thus started his past then the gods in the heaven become very pleased and they are showering flowers on the earth in his honor when there is blessings from the heaven coming that's the idea all those great riches assembled were the power and the will to bless people they heartily congratulated pariksit possessed of divine qualities on the resolution he had taken so all the holy people blessed him from the heaven the gods blessing and the earth the holy people they blessed him they spoke extolling shri krishna of his fame then they started talking about krishna and his glory his name and fame and the extraordinary character that she said o royal says this great act of renunciation is nothing strange in you and others of your dynasty who are always devoted to krishna that means oh king pariksit you your father your grandfather this lineage of all of you do you belong to the royal family so the everyone at the end they renounced they did that duty and when the duty is over handsome total renunciation there is nothing strange in you you are you belong to the same family so you are you get renounced here as you have renounced now it is nothing strange because you are born your father your family everyone did that so it is a blessings and you have done it exactly following your forefathers four see how your grand ancestors abandoned as a trifle their throne and crown in order to attain to the lord how they give up all your kingdom and and the crown of the uh what you call emperor no emperor's crown giving up everything they and ultimately went to their abode of freedom the lord and the rishis said among themselves then they talked with each other he is one of the greatest devotee of the lord he's talking about pariksit he is one of the greatest devotees of the lord we shall all stay here itself till he abundance this human body and attends to the realm that are untouched by change or solve let we shall be present we will not go away or many people come out of sympathy and salute and stay for few minutes and go away we are not going to go away we will stay with parishion till he leaves his body and that means that spiritual atmosphere will be maintained yes and also i think he was enlightened how can he ask for another birth you know oh that that is out of devotion the devotion they say if i am born if that means it shows us this devotional aspect to it they will may not be born but you know holy people say say if i am to be born i will be born like this so that my early days that my atmosphere will be i will be spiritually involved and i'll bond holy atmosphere all people will very giving me the sages will be around me they say imagination if at all but true they need not have to be born that will get it ultimately humility they are expressing their humility hearing the words of the sages which were well balanced soul and sweet solemn and sincere pariksit more eager than ever to hear about the lord replied with profound expression of respect so when this this holy people are talking about this this is the most devotee is the lie in the lineage of his father and grandfather their the arena the path of renouncer they can renounce anytime they are the kings and emperors of the country but they have the wonderful detachment so they are not ordinary kings so and glorifying his character then the parikshith more eager than ever to hear about the lord replied with profound expression of respect which he said just as the vedas appear in the satya loka in an embodied form so have you all great men came here leaving your own stations stations so then king pariksit again saying that you all great people you have your other duties and responsibilities you forgetting that out of my out of your own love you have come to see me here at this point person is just like you have no mission that means you are all free souls here or in the higher world because you are brahmacaris you have no responsibility no duty duty belongs to us who are ignorant for a man of wisdom there is no duty he has gone beyond duty so you have no duty oh sages you are all great people of realization you have no need no responsibility no duty because you are free from all bondage but still personalizes like you who have no mission here or in higher world other than blessing others in the spiritual illumination oh lord and advance o self-controlled ones putting all my confidence in you i would like to ask you what i should now do especially what one like me with death imminent should do please advise me my date is imminent seven days already some hours are gone so please guide me tell me what am i to do at this point of death please tell me your considered view and when this discussion was going on then arrival of sri sukha that is the auspicious moment they are discussing and suddenly sukharev sugar is who has actually is the composer of what a bhagavatam this book basically is the composer mahabharata poor vedas divided into four group it was never done before so such a powerful person his son is sukadeva that sukadeva suddenly appeared as the other maha great sages also rishis are already assembled and sugar there appeared who is sugar he gave her free that story he was he was not getting birth because he was always in the mother's womb growing and he wants that whole world will be free from maya he cannot enter into the realm of maya so but the whole world is full of maya so how can we enter so the brahma and or what i god i forgot had to be associated so that this art was little spirit moment free from all maya and that is the time this sukhari was born and being born easy because he is free from maya birth as soon as he's born it already they say he has not 18 months like 10 months but it is 18 years 16 okay so immediately being born he started walking because he has management who is baba who is mother who is father so without no attachment because born without maya so he wanted and that is the sukhadeva the born with the knowledge of the full brahman there is no maya can touch him so that sukharev suddenly arrived and also it is killed for rishi son of rishis they are eternally free souls they call sukha sanandana sanaka sanatana these are all sahasa sasa four saw four sages they are said they are brahma's child born only eternally free and they are only they live in the world appear for the good of humanity wherever they need to so they should say that sukhari arrived on the scene 25 verse says that but while they were discussing they means these holy people the rishis the maharishis and they are discussing and she said what shall i do please tell me at this point simply silent or i want to hear about the lord narayana maha vishnu so while they were discussing among themselves the question put by parikh sheet what is the question she put that question now what shall i do i am determined to give up the body and my body will go by the biting of the snake takshaka so what shall i do now please you are holy people please advise me and at that point the sun while they were discussing among themselves the questions put by production they are arrived by chance sukha the son of vyasa who was habituated to wonder amount aimlessly who shot or depended on nothing external so these are the qualities this sukadeva who is he that his nature is he wanders around he goes wherever he wins no to help people to free people to touch people too is so self-willed habituated to wander about aimlessly there is no meaning and purpose he goes in wherever he wishes to bless others we who short or dependent on nothing external he does not depend on any anybody any person any place any home any food any uh rich person's favor he does not depend on anything who bore no insignia of any caste or order people you have seen that those who are in the question about tradition they will make a mark here this is shiva mark no this mark is shiva mark then then that different style is there so so you see that and then people can say oh they are bhakta they are devotees devotees of shiva saman krishna bhakta seeing that so seeing that you can that's insignia in their forehead or in the body you can see that they are uh oh they are bhakti of krishna so some are mother worshippers rey dot here red everywhere no red marks so by insignia you can earn but he is a parabola like ramakrishna he has no insignia in his body no root drugs or bead hanging on the neck no outside sign that's why he says not on nothing external who bore no insignia of any caste or order who went about as an obod our dude means abu dhut is a class of people who goes wherever they like they lie down wherever they like they eat whatever they get no they are free soul they don't care for anything external who was ever merged in the butt there were even marched in the bliss of atman anyone can go around when any homeless person can go around here and there but he is homeless but his homelessness is dipped into the wisdom of atman so he says who was ever merged merged in the bliss apartment and was surrounded by a crowd of women and children that means he is coming a naked boy like takur a really little cloth or not cloth and sukharev is almost naked accepting a lion cloth maybe so all the household people children mother they all circling him he looked as on only 16 years old he that means you are correct i was saying 18 no 1816 so he's 16 years old his feet arms thighs hips shoulders cheeks were proportionate and attractive in that formation that means a holy person his all features are very perfect and ramakrishna's features will perfect swami vivekananda's features are so perfect the nose the eyes the ear the forehead the finger hand everything is very unique and attractive in the formation his neck with auspicious lines resembled a conch his eyes were long his brows are charming his ears equal and his nose high our ears are not equal not equal oh he says these no ears are equal the holy person their ears are equal i do not know oh all are not his eyes were long and prolong eyes like like rama rajiv his eyes are long big his ears equal and his nose high nose his broad and well formed chest his shoulders having collar bones well covered with flesh his long arms his deep navel his abdomen with auspicious spores were all both beautiful and imposing the quarter saloon covered covered the nakedness of his shining blue tinged body while his curly locks cascaded on all sides it's flowing in all side curly hair no very beautiful description of sukadeva looking young attractive and glowing with a coombly smile on his lips he always drew the attention of women the girls get very attracted to a boy like that perfect body perfect look perfect eyes perfect features hairs are so curly krishna the similar the krishna attraction of the women because of his beautiful feature sami vivekananda attracted the attention of the women in that that's why blodget said no mrs blodgett said in the parliament of religions man if you can withstand this onslaught then i will call you god and he proved he is god he was unattached with this but the world is attracted to him so that is the beauty that means physical beauty is unique for a holy people and especially those are born for like that purpose who is free from maya and all these now looking young attractive and glowing with a calmly smile his smile is so sweet charming smooth on his lips he always drew the attention seeing him approaching then the only it was calm quiet moment all the sages are grips taken the king maharaja pariksit is going to leave the physical body no and the serious situation so there came the boys coming seeing him approaching the rishis who could perceive his hidden spiritual glory through its external science got up from their seats to honor him the senior raj or sees devorsees maharsis all the great names they have given and seeing that boy with extraordinary character understood his holiest of the holy person they all stood up with reverence and for exit too received the honored guest by prostrating himself before him in complete resignation so he surrendered himself at the feet of this guest the thoughtless women and children who surrounded him now left and duly worshipped he took the seat of honor he was he was coming back with his children and young seeing a young attractive personality so all gathered around the village people are also following and when she was greeted by the king and all the holy people so all those people left and then the thoughtless women and children daughterlessness they don't understand the glory of that or ordinary ordinary person people they all surrounded him no they are all left and duly they worshipped he took the seat of honor then this child 16 years old boy shukadeva took his seat of honor everyone gave a sip to him and he sat there surrounded by the group of brahm versus raj orsis they versus sukadeva the greatest among great man looked like the moon amidst the planets and stars many a beautiful description this is bhagavat is a poetic book she is giving the example in the imagine then moon and then starry starry sky in the night no the beauty so it is like that he is like a bright brilliant light of soft soothing light amongst the stars of wishes and maharishi's great divorcees and etc also was giving the expression when he was 16. started writing the commentaries by the guru's advice 8 year to 16 year he composed the commentaries of gita upanishad and the brahmasutras the same age group the devoted king after prostrating again at the feet of that great sage was calm and whose spiritual insight could not be deemed by any circumstances now spoke to him with palms joined in salutation like this so the king again parikshit who is dying he with the folded palm talk to whom talk to the sukhodeva oh you mean says it is wonderful thirty-two verse oh you mean says it is wonderful to contemplate how a lok shaktriya lok shakti means khati is the warrior he is again with humble words they are using i am a very low person in the shaktio group no has today been honored by so many great men i am audio ordinary a warrior class man but i am honored by so many brahmins and holy people here and owing to your mercy you have sanctified me coming here as my guest you have also joined me as a guest and came to me even the mere remembrance of holy men like you purifies the homes of devotees much more sanctifying it must be to have an opportunity to contact you and do physical service to you so i am fortunate you come to my home though i am dying i am the king given up though but this is my territory i am now here and you have come to my house as it were i salute you i will respect you as a host of you oh great jogin that means she could understand it is the sukadeva that's why he's praising him so highly o great yogi by your very presence even great sins of people are destroyed if you cast a glance someone's sin will go away just as asuras are in the presence of maha vishnu and when the asuras come to lord vishnu by vishnu's grace they become pure shri krishna loved the son of pandu dearly and befriended all members of their clan i hope that for the satisfaction of his father's sister's children the son of pandu he is extending his mercy to me who am descendant from them so i am a descendant of krsna's family that's why you people are so gracious you are showering your blessings upon me otherwise how could men especially one like me on the threshold of death get the opportunity of meeting an enlightened person is like you i am an ordinary person how i shall be fortunate accepting i am born in the clan of krishna so that you people like you will come in my place and bless me get the opportunity of meeting an unenlightened person is an enlightened person is like you whose movements are mysterious and who has come in readiness as it were to clear all my doubts i have so many doubts before my death to remove those doubts you have come as a blessings of god and why because i belong to the lineage the lineage of krishna therefore i ask you ask you o sukadeva enlightened one o teacher of teachers what constitutes the most important duty of a man faced with imminent death it's a very good question what is the duty of a person who is dying now what will be his duty huh that means really think of calculating i will not finish this i wanted to do that are you to forget that think of god only no [Music] yeah that is you are taking too much responsibility the world is full of garbage where is the garbage less place as much as you clean someone will have to clean your bed also your bed sit also so you cannot stop that but the date is imminent you know you're dying on within seven days what will you do what will be the question so therefore i ask you oh enlightened one or teacher of teachers what constitutes the most important duty of a man faced with imminent immediate if you know you are dying what will be your dog oh great one tell me what such a person should hear about repeat do remember and worship that is the point when someone is dying what he should do tell me such a person why is what she should hear about will he hear about stock market then how much fund is there my ten thousand dollar is there okay give this to that person and interest should go to that person will you say talk like that that will go in the world if you know it you are dying now what will be your duty what type of message you want to hear that's why we say sing krishna repeat the mantra of god so that his mind becomes uplifted repeat what will you repeat mantra repeat the mantra do what action can be done at that point of death remember and worship what worship shall i do what remembering mentally i will think about also tell me what you should not do in this respect what to be done but not to be done please tell me because i have only seven days to hear about oh holy one your habit is
