[298. Panchama Veda 298 - “Sri Ramakrishna’s Prayer”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xe1gtiUyYaM)

namaskar their devotees and friends and this evening we'll be studying the gospel of krishna panchama veda and the main topic will be the prayers of sri ramakrishna sri ramakrishna's prayer so let us begin um a we know that it we were reading the accounts of the march 11 1885 with the devotees in kolkata and he was talking the last time also he read this particular portion narendra is a boy a very high order he was introducing a narendra to girish girish chandra ghosh we know he was a very famous person and they were not knowing narendra was only hardly 16 17 18 years young boy naturally and girish was already well known personality and girish was coming to sirama krishna not very the very recently we can say that it was 1885 almost uh the march so few months before he started visiting sirama krishna so he was introducing the narendra with narendra was not present there narendra is a boy a very high order then he is mentioning he excels in everything vocal and instrumental music and studies again now the the quality is the moment we talk about the person so naturally introducing what is the quality the quality is the worldly qualities whether he is a very good student he is excellent in this subject that subject she has got these that suramar krishna said that in the beginning and immediately is telling again he has control over his saints organs this is very important for the naturally those who are having the control over the saints organs they are a very excellent type of people so people those who are having different worldly qualities but don't have the control over the senses they commit a lot of mistakes but here suramar krishna is mentioning and this is the special type of qualities then he said he is truthful and has discrimination and dispassion so this spiritual side that he was introducing then not that the ramakrishnan never did anything by planning but still when he was talking these when he said this that afterwards acted wonderfully because all of them this particularly girish gosh ram datta and all others the householder devotees who are supporting the young people and these words of the master obviously was present in their mind and they could understand that noreen is going to give the lead he is the leader so he said that he is truthful and has discrimination and dispassion viveka and bichar bichara and bibeka discrimination then the bichara what is the bichara what is good and what is bad what is truth and what is not so that is called this with the most of the people they don't have that type of discrimination that's why the most of the people though human being they're having the hate and all the features are human but the the differences because of this good and bad they have the correct type of discrimination they understand things properly they understand that everything that we see in this world the name fame property wealth all everything is so temporary so that is their mind in the upper and upper mind constantly they think in that way obviously uh this passion they are not attached to those things not that they are leaving they are there but not attached to that so their behavior their thoughts their way of the work are completely different then so many virtues in one person ramakrishna is mentioning to aim to master marsha the lord said what do you say isn't he unusually good the master mashay was obviously he was one of the founders of this ramakrishna movement so suramar krishna when he was talking to master mahashay and he was convincing because afterwards this very young boy he will be leading he will be taking the flag of sirama krishna so he is making the whole field the this is the unique way the the god works and not that he is planning but it is almost like naturally it is having like that and master masha he is mentioning is he is so it is entering into their subconscious mind master aside to him then he is a very the keeping the him in the in the confidence he is telling to the master mahashaya he meaning giddish gosh has great earnestness and faith so he is introducing different the the devotees so girish kosh apparently completely different type of person he's a drunkard and he goes for the drama and his life was completely different master masha and others they were different but when the ramakrishna himself is telling that he has great earnestness and faith so master mashay aim looked at girish and marveled at his tremendous faith girish had been coming to suramar krishna only a short time and had already recognized his spiritual power within a very short time he could recognize the spiritual power of bhagavan sirama krishna to aim he seemed a familiar friend and king's man related to him by the strong bond of spirituality girish was one of the james in the necklace of masters devotees friends when and avatar comes the surrounding him so many great personalities also they come the girish is having great faith but this faith means it's not that somebody said and immediately he accepted he was not of that type his character was completely different it was very difficult to convince him but even then when he came when he talked to sudama krishna he when the lifestyle of greece chandra ghosh and of bhagavad-gita was completely different the heaven and the the hell we can say the difference but still the girish game he made of sudama krishna and immediately could recognize the spirituality suramar krishna didn't show any miracle to girish the how could he recognize him that this is very important majority of the people they always think about some supernatural power some miraculous power and then only they say oh he has the great power but spirituality has nothing to do with the supernatural power of spiritual the miraculous power completely different it's the love it's the unselfishness and that girish could feel and the lord god who came in the form of bhagavan sirama krishna he is giving recognizing that and giving the certificate and he is telling the girish has great earnestness and faith so this is girish is so lucky narayan asks the master whether he would sing and sudama krishna sang of the divine mother he is the avatar but even then when an ordinary devotee is requesting he is singing why to rouse the spiritual the mood in the minds of the devotees that is the only way they work the avatar come to establish dharma and what is dharma faith belief in the existence of god and that comes through different way sometimes through emotion sometimes through understanding discussion sometimes through reading sometimes through meditation and if we see the sudama krishnas the the work ministerial work he is utilizing all these things he is visiting different people in different places and when he is going he is not just going to that particular person inviting others also over there and in the small group he is developing that not that they are very rich people no not that they are completely illiterate people so it is mediocre group they have education and they are not very poor so they have the intellect to understand and they have the in the in the the worldly life also since they are not very poor so they can afford time for these spiritual practices the surama krishna used to sing and now he is singing cherish my precious mother shamma tenderly within oh mind is a bengali song very famous song jotani hriday riko you have to tenderly very carefully you have to keep the ma mother kali within your heart most of the people even today they do not know about goddess kali sometimes you know in the movie and other places they will be depicting goddess kali as a very peculiar it is nothing like that but anyway you know that shakti is the power of god the wind we see the rama and shita who is shita is the power of god we see only in a girl lady form and we think oh the as we are having the father and the mother is like that it is not like that the same god who is having the intellect is also having the power that power is depicted as the lady as a woman you will find very if you if you notice in the hinduism the brahma who is the creator he is having his shakti sharashati he is creating and sharashati is the goddess of knowledge for the creation he needs knowledge and knowledge is that power so brahma's power is knowledge the vishnu is maintaining and when you are maintaining you need wealth that vishnu's power is lakshmi so this is the way it they thought and these are all symbolic way presented the hinduism lot of symbolism is there and we have to understand that intricate philosophy through this so he is mentioning in this way cherish my my precious mother shama tenderly within o mind the majority of the hindu temple you will never find kali mandir kali temple why in america we have seen because the people who are constructing the hindu temple are not very much clear about the tantra because i am really sorry to say that they always feel tantra means something where you have to sacrifice the goat and you have to do these nothing like that is it there are different ways different varieties are there so i feel that they should understand it they must understand it because this is the power this time bhagavan sirama krishna came and he worshipped god is kali and kali is nothing but power and power is nothing but knowledge so this we have to understand and this song shirama krishna is singing yatani somewhere i read that there even the rabindranath tega so they were not very happy because the suramar krishna worshiped goddess kali and sister nivedita wanted this ravindernath and swami viveka and the issued together and so that they can work together etc so that is a all different type of discussions are already there books are also there so here we find the same conception kali means something very terrible and we should not worship the wrong conception salam krishna completely broke it a lot of other things if we read you'll find there are some people are trying to grab the power but suramar krishna's prayer that we are going to touch that point we will find he doesn't want that and he is teaching one should not pray for those powers and he sang again another song o mother evil blissful as thou art do not deprive thy worthless child of bliss again he sang about the bliss of divine mother behold my mother playing with sheba lost in an ecstasy of joy this mother is the she is active shiva is the knowledge and the same knowledge when applied that is called mother so it is not the male or the female the shiva is male and the kali is female it is nothing it is just symbolic as the child is born out of the mother so the creation of this universe it has been the rishis and the thinkers they thought it should be given as a mother form so they have given this mother form so playing means what playing means the creation is going on how with the knowledge who is that knowledge the source of knowledge is the sheba so this is the way we have to understand the devotees listen to the songs in deep silence after a few moments ramakrishna said i have a slight cold so i couldn't sing well so when the god himself is singing singing means is a prayer the description of the god and the goddess god and his creation through music through tune so that naturally those who are little pure minded and there they get that particular blessings and they became very silent krishna is bringing them again their mind to the normal plane by saying i couldn't sing it's well because i have a slight cold gradually it became dusk the shadow of evening fell on calcutta for the moment the noise of the busy metropolis was stilled gongs and the conch shells proclaimed the evening worship in many hindu houses devotees of god set aside their worldly duties and turn their minds to prayer and meditation this joining of day and night this mystic tree light always created an ecstatic mood in the master master bhagavan sirama krishna when it is called sandha sandha means when the day is going away and the evening night is approaching that the meeting time is called sunday the dusk or the slowly slowly the mind also become automatically calm and that is the best time for meditation sirama krishna is to inspire people the devotees seated in the room looked at sri ramakrishna as he began to chant the sweet name of divine mother after the chanting he began to pray what was the need of prayer the sri maha master mahashaya and who is noting this is very correctly commenting what was the need of prayer to a soul in constant communion with god now whenever the suramar krishna he is talking he is thinking a constant communion with god so that that this master mahashaya srima as because he was with that's ramakrishna for quite some years so he could recognize so he is commenting what was necessary for him to separately praying to mother did he not rather want to teach airing mortals how to pray that's very correct sirama krishna is teaching the how to pray addressing the divine mother he said this ramakrishna's prayer o mother i throw myself on thy mercy i take shelter at thy hallowed feet i do not want bodily comforts i do not crave name and fame i do not seek the eight occult powers be gracious and grant that i may have pure love for thee o love a love unsmitten by desire untainted by any selfish aims a love curved by the devotee for the desire untainted by any selfish devotee for the sake of loves alone and grant me the favor o mother that i may not be deluded by thy world between maya that i may never be attest to the world o mother there is no one but thee whom i may call my own mother i do not know how to worship i am without austerity i have neither devotion nor knowledge be gracious mother and out of thy infinite mercy grant me love for thy lotus feet this is the prayer of the mother now what we notice fast to pray to mother pray to god pray to almighty we have to have the faith if we don't have the faith in the existence that of that god then we won't be able to pray this is the first thing and second that when we are praying to before that i am taking out abolishing my ego that's why i am surrendering to god so here in the bhagavad-gita also we find the very clearly it is mentioned in the first chapter of the bhagavad-gita arjuna bishodha yoga arjuna was lamenting and he was telling what i am going to do now because the in the opposition all my friends my relatives my guru my all senior people they are there i have to kill them only for a plot of land for this kingdom he was in turmoil and he was thinking what to do and what not to do then ultimately what he did when he was going on talking lamenting salil archivising analyzing god sri krishna he was sitting over there quietly never commented anything when the arjuna said shisha's he said o lord o god i am thy disciple shardi means instruct me teach me and i take refuge in you prapan nam tuam prapannam i take refuge in you unless and until one is coming and surrendering the god's grace will never flow so that is the thing we have to understand the bhagavan sidha krishna whenever people ask him how to realize god he suggested and it is very famous he suggested four steps first sadhu sangha what is sadhu-sanga a person who has already realized god or having some knowledge about god go to him and know about that god and then you retire in a secluded place shadushanga holy living in a quiet place alone third is bichara the discrimination oh that gentleman that sadhu that monk he was talking about god and he was giving some example i have also read is it possible and like that you have to go on discriminating where in a quiet place in isolation where other people are not there different type of thoughts are not crossing the mind if you are discussing with others then their views will also influence you so you should be all alone the sadhu-sanga the holy company nirjan bash and the secluded way you have to leave then bichara you have to use your judgment and when you are convinced yes there must be something some power which people they call as god and so that must be there now comes the prayer the prayer means you have to have all these three steps before if you don't have any idea about the god to whom you are going to pray obviously dedication won't be there and you must have that conception that's why the panchama way the gospel of srama krishna that we are regularly reading reading for so many years and every time not this is just you know i am reading but majority of the people devotees the followers of suramar krishna they all they read individually they have the time at least one or two pages everyone will be reading that gospel and the more and more and more they are reading the more the clear understanding is coming so this is the conception the shadow shanga means one should understand the idea of the god and what is god and second he will go and go on brooding over those teachings of that holy person and he was telling like this he himself is living like this so that means it is possible and of course caitanya mahaprabhu was there he was having tremendous intellect he could be a great professor in those days he was already he left all those and now we find whether those professors at his time before him and after him so many thousands of scholars came the people have forgotten them but caitanya mahaprabhu people are remembering and he will be there all through the similar way the sri ramachandra sri krishna and all these great sages the great souls are there so it is true what they get it must be the peace it must be that's the simple life but high thinking that is giving them peace how it is possible by controlling the saints organs so this you are as you have heard in the company of a holy person you are now brooding and judging and discriminating and analyzing and coming into conclusion yes it must be there and from there your journey towards the supreme begins so this is the way the spiritual life goes as ramakrishna holy company and living in an isolation then discrimination and finally it is prayer that suddenly we we go to temple we go to church we go to the holy places and we pray but we are not prepared to pray that's why the prayer is not answered when we are prepared and we go and after the prayer you will feel that god is listening to your prayer and you are going and appealing as the child is going the son or the daughter is going to their parents and asking i need these i need that and they know that their parents have listened to it and it will be considered so that is the way this is the prayer the cerama krishnas in the uddhava gita also we find that is in the bhagavad gita the brahma shiva indra and chatur kumar the four kumaras sanak sananda sanatana sanat kumar they made krishna why the lord krishna by that time decided to give up the body and go back to his own abode so they went and one i am just quoting one line natasmate we are bowing down to you here also the humbleness when we are bowing down what happens our ego goes away in the western country of course because of the social condition it is cold place and the people are all they have the great self-respect and independence etc they shake hands with each other nowadays of course after the the corona so they are not even shaking hands some are confused with that they will follow the indian way of namaskara and some are touching the two elbows and by that way greeting each other so this is going on so why we go and bow down because by that way we show that we are humble and please help us and as long as there is ego the other one to whom we are going to god or the guru or the teacher or the preceptor they won't be able to give you their best their advices even if they give they'll be doubtful is he going to or is she going to accept this so that should not be so in the hindu tradition they always they go and they prostrate before the holy people and there is a they call shah ashta anga the salutation with eight limbs of the body what are those very interesting the both the hands the hands then forehead lips chin chest abdomen thigh and feet these eight parts of the body you are you are lying down on the floor and the hands stretch the whole these eight limbs are touching the ground that means i am so humble before you oh god please accept me and listen to my prayer this is called shah's friends this is all culture that it has developed so when we are going uh to god or to a holy person to a teacher we know what is the difference ego if the ego is there you are not going to learn anything you are not going to get the blessings of god because it is only the ego that separates us from god and nothing else it's not that god is somewhere else and we have to go and achieve some people they constantly think that when we are going to achieve god where you are going to get god they go to different places in the remote places and the more it is difficult to reach and the more it is holy the all these thoughts are there it's okay for them the as more they are torturing their body they are thinking they are becoming purified uh different type of conceptions but what is the purity purity means when you are forgetting the worldly things and what is the prayer that the sryama krishna is teaching us oh lord o mother i should not have any desire for this worldly things the physical comfort etc why then only i am becoming purified so they're very simple very straightforward but still most of us are we are confused the moment we think about the purity we think about the food we think about the drink we think about the dress we think about bathing in a holy river all this that helps nothing wrong but actual thing is when the mind is completely detached from the worldly things then it is pure and with that mind when we are applying to god there is no i there is only very humbleness is there and we get the blessings of god so that's why suramar krishna is and he is mentioning over here let us read again o mother i throw myself on thy mercy i take shelter at thy hallowed feet so this is the complete self-surrender and when we are surrendering surrendering what this body no ego we are surrendering our ego the i sense so what is this eye sense as the vedanta very clearly very nicely explained is the reflection of the same god or the consciousness on our intellect so what is there of i so i that whatever you have given i give it back to you and i become with you merge with you i take shelter at your feet i do not want bodily comforts i do not crave name and fame so what is the purity purity of worldly things first is physical bodily comfort second is subtle name and fame the most of the people particularly those who become monk they give up the physical comfort it is possible and many many poor people even if they don't want because of the situation they don't have the physical comfort it doesn't mean anything if you are walking bare foot sometimes some people think holy person means he should walk bare foot and he should wear this type of dress which is good if if the person is feeling like that others are also getting inspired it's okay nothing wrong but that is not religion the poverty statement people they don't have the proper dresses that does it mean they are very spiritual no so we have seen that and the bare foot in the in the in the poor country if you go and you'll find measure it to the people can't even afford as simple as the shoe so naturally they're walking bare foot does it mean that they're spiritual no it is mentally so he is mentioning that first is physical and second he said that name and fame this is very important majority of the people they they give up all those then they come out and their monks not married everything was there but they get stuck up on the name and fame some of the people they'll be clapping they'll be telling oh you are so great and all this the more they hear about that and slowly slowly they start thinking and self-hypnotizing themselves i'm a great person that is again the bondage i do not seek the eight occult powers the some of the people i have seen particularly in the west they are very interested in eastern religion why occult powers what are the occult powers you know that ashtashidhi shiddhi means that the subtle the occult powers the ostrom is eight first is anima the sanskrit name anema mahima garima laghima prabhti prakhamya is is anima means small those who are having that power they can make their body very very small in the ramayana if you read that hanumana was having all these ashtashiti all the eight powers so when he was crossing the ocean to reach to sri lanka then he made one time he made his body so small then no one could notice him mahima means gigantic when he decided to cross the ocean with the lip he made his body gigantic there are different different stories are there when he went to bring the medicine from far distance place and he couldn't recognize that particular harb so he lifted the whole mountain and brought it to that particular place where lakshmana was unconscious for his treatment only it was necessary so this is a huge body very powerful mahima then garima is heavy it becomes so heavy that it is impossible for anyone to hold laghima it become very very light then prabhupti obtain anything that is the power that when some people are having this occult power anything can be it's not that just some names no it is possible you know himself is telling that he is a high order very high order so when he was wondering as a paribrazika as they call say it in sanskrit when he was wandering in different places in india and trying to know the situation of the people of india that time he came to know that one of his sisters passed away and he was very sorry for that naturally so he wanted to in those days it was very difficult for the late there was no telephone there was nothing this type of communication come here so obviously he was wondering how to get the proper information so there someone told there is a person who has this occult power and he can bring this information for you what's the occult power he has control to ghost and this ghost according to his order as he gives and then he they get all this type of information anything so swami vivekananda he went to that gentleman requested him to bring the information about his sister and after some time he truly those ghosts came and reported it is true that his sister passed away in calcutta so that was the information see so this is when the person spiritually so high like swami vivekananda but this occult power why suramar krishna himself wanted to give this all eight powers to that narendra narada vivekananda he refused i don't need but it was there not that it is not there people some people they were happy and very interestingly when swamiji thanked that person for the information for the confirmation of the and that man told will you please bless me keeping your hand on my head so this is the way it goes the spirituality is completely different thing and this type of power and prakhamya nothing impossible to get that is prakamya issued to our lordship and bashish ability to control others mind life death etc that we have read in the jesus life that he called a dead man to come out and he got up and came out he became alive so jesus was having that power but he could save his himself when he was having that particular that power that he could give the life to a dead person could he not save himself he could but he didn't try that so spirituality is a completely different thing and this type of occult powers are completely different so some people they are confused and they think this type of powers are the spirituality it is not so you see srama krishna is praying i do not seek the eight occult powers be gracious and grant that i may have pure love for thee friend this is called spirituality what is spirituality pure love why pure love love we are all having but it is all selfish love i love my keith and keen i love my country i love my religion i love my community i love my family like that so it is all selfish love limited love but when i love each and everyone without any boundary that is divine love and that is why it says it's called pure love a love unsmitten by desire when i am loving god there is no desire here i should say some people they always ask swamiji shall we not pray to god they call takur that means ramakrishna lovingly the devotees they call bhagavan sudama krishna as takur takur is a very colloquial bengali word for god so can we not pray to god for my son for my daughter for my family for my mother father i always say yes why not there is nothing wrong in it to whom then we'll go so this is the god this is the father this is the mother is there and i am in this family i am over here i need some the blessings from god i go and talk to mother and say mother will you not please help me sometimes we the monks we belong to an organization and we are also working for the society we need some type of things to whom then we will go and say we go to mother only we pray but here ultimately says that i am not having any desire that is for the mukti that is for the spirituality so what is spirituality pure love this pure love not for anything worldly is the spirituality and he says i may have pure love for thee a lob unsmitten by desire untainted by any selfish ants a love craved by the devotee for the sake of love alone and grant me the favor o mother that i may not be deluded by thy world between maya this maya is the power of god and it is under the control of mother and maya is such a power that bewildered people i mean the educated people very clever people and sometimes the spiritual people are also under the control of this maya when some people they go and then go on praying touching the feet offering some gift and going on telling you are so holy person please keep your hand on my head so that i and slowly slowly that person also start thinking yes yes i'm that power i'm having i must do like that slowly again they get bound the friends this is the way when we are working for the uh others with love obviously the good result come to us when you are praying to god obviously the good result come to us by that way you are generating the spirituality and you are purifying yourself and when you are slowly developing that the obviously the people will be attracted to you well how you will know that you are developing spirituality spirituality means pure love spirituality means unselfishness so obviously that attracts people and when they come and that creates the problem again you start developing ego oh i'm a great speaker hundreds and thousands of people are listening to me they are recognizing me all the great the society people they are all coming to me by that way you become isolated you become once again the very egoistic person and you go down again so it goes on this circle is terrible why maya what is this maya no one can explain what is maya but we can understand we can feel that it binds and it bewildered the mind deluded the mind that is why the prayer it is your power o mother suramar krishna addressing the supreme god as mother anyone can address the god as father or any way they like but here the mother the supreme god we are praying oh mother and this you you should not bind me with the maya that i may never be attest to the world i may never be attached to the world so if we read each and every word the few lines only but it gives the complete shape of practice what one should do to make the advancement in spiritual life prayer how the prayer comes faith how the faith develops sadhu sangha with the holy company and of course the wants a judgment then afterwards this prayer what type of things i should pray to develop my spirituality non-attachment not that we have to live give up whatever we are doing wherever we are we must be there performing our own duties but at the same time we must be careful not to be at this with this and he is mentioning and he say oh mother there is no one but thee so this is the main thing there's a complete self-surrender and understanding there is nothing but god the god whom we are also addressing following the teachings of bhagavatam krishna's mother because mother is compassionate mother is love the mother listened to the children so they are telling oh mother there is no one but thee whom i may call my own mother i do not know how to worship i am without austerity i have neither devotion nor knowledge be gracious mother and out of thy infinite mercy grant me love for thy lotus feet again it comes for the love love is a great world when someone asks swami vivekananda how you will explain your guru sri ramakrishna swami vivekananda mentioned l o b e personified the love is that concern for each and everyone sometimes physically we cannot help but we pray for that person unknown person but the suffering people we always pray the whole world because our gurus start before you pray to god you must for yourself you must pray for the benefit of the whole world isn't the unique is not beautiful so when you are thinking let everyone be happy let everyone be healthy let everyone understand each other and be free well from the anxiety comes misunderstanding only when i am talking with someone or looking at someone i develop some misunderstanding but if i can understand his or heart temperament then no no anxiety oh he is like that is okay this is the way you have to understand so that gives a soulless a calmness a tranquility and self-confident i am all right i don't have any problem because mother is there the self-confidence is also mother is there devotees friends that we should not again misunderstand this particular point with the vedantic view that means advaitic vedantic view advaita vedanta different the hinduism has different approaches here purely dueting here we are considering the all power is nothing but my mother is a different uh conception is a devotees conception dualistic conception so we should not again mix up with advaithic view and why you told that other day it's nothing like that it's a dualistic view the mother is there we are uttering every word of his prayer altered from the depths of his soul stripped in the minds of the devotees the melody of his voice and the childlike simplicity of his face touched their hearts very deeply master masha the recorder he is mentioning whether other people or not master masha's mind was very much touched by that girish invited the master to his house saying that he may go there that very night so girish ghost house was not very far he came to balarama's house from balaramas to girish almost next house the master don't you think it will be late there is no sale you may return any time you like i shall have to go to the theater tonight to settle a call there it was nine o'clock in the evening when the master was ready to start for girish house look at it the timing the nine o'clock in the evening and it was not the present day kolkata it was say almost 150 years before not much of electric light or anything not that much there is no conception of electric light even then bhagavan sirama ramakrishna and he has to return to dakshinesha that is also very far from there even then he is going why only to rise the spiritual feeling in the hearts of the devotees and there are some people even at that time it is late evening nine o'clock in those days their people used to go to bed even then some of them they are following sirama krishna why to listen to him so there are people or very worldly minded they think the world whatever the name fame and the money power that is sufficient for me and after me my son and after my son his grandson so that the separate type of thing whom we usually call war that is jagat it is like that and sudama krishna is to address them samsari so these are the different type of people they are very narrow-minded selfish and they think this is the life we must have to enjoy but spiritual life is a con the completely different life so these people they like so much mastermind shanks and others nine o'clock they are following krishna it was nine o'clock in the evening when the master was ready to start with the girish house since balarama had prepared supper for him sirama krishna said to balarama please send the food you have prepared for me to girish i shall enjoy it there at nine o'clock sirama krishna he was thinking to eat now he's asking to send to girish he did not want to heart balarama's feeling as the master was coming down from the second floor of balarama's house he became filled with divine ecstasy he looked as if he were drunk narayan and aim were by his side a little behind came ram chuni and other devotees no sooner did he reach the ground floor then he became totally overwhelmed narayan came forward to hold him by the hand least he should miss his footing and fall master expressed annoyance at this a few minutes later he said to narayan affectionately if you hold me by the hand people may think i am drunk i shall walk by myself it is nothing like that and i think sometimes ramakrishna he when he was in that mood if anyone not very pure in mind touched him immediately that particular uh the thought in his mind was to break so he expressed this type of thing many a times only when babura maharaja that his name was babur ram ghosh when he used to touch him salam krishna never said anything why afterwards he said swami primananda afterwards he said that he is very pure like radha radha means the embodiment of love for god so that is there the girish house was not very far away the master passed crossing at the bosh barra lane suddenly he began to walk faster the devotees were left behind presently narendra was seen coming from a distance at other times the master's joy would have been unbounded at the thought of narendra or at the mere mention of his name but now he did not even exchange a word with his beloved disciple as the master and the devotees entered the lane where girish lived he was able to utter words he said to narendra are you quite well my son my child i could not talk to you then every word the master spoke was full of infinite tenderness he had not yet reached the door of girish house when suddenly he stopped and said looking at narendra i want to tell you something this is one and that is another so siramu krishna having this is one that means the one who is now talking with you this is and another the god who is residing with me so that's ramakrishna is mentioning writing who could know what was passing through his innermost soul at that moment friends will stop over here and then and the next day again we'll read from this page the page number you may note 732 732 of the gospel of sirama krishna thank you so the first question is from vishvaru ghosh he's saying please repeat how to pray to god oh vishadoop one hour i spoke and you asked me to speak for another hour so please listen to it it will be there in the youtube you please listen to it and you'll find it srima vishwas is asking when we have well-wishers who do not mean good to us how can we love them shima you are telling that whale wishers again you are mentioning that they don't love you or want good to you so no that that means they are not well wishers it is better to avoid them so if not loving at least avoid them and keep distance with from them and don't hate them it may change you know their attitude may change and pray for them oh god they're also good people but they are misunderstanding me and trying to harm me so please change their mind and thoughts for me so if you pray that will be good so thank you friends let us chant this mantra and we conclude [Music] is [Music] [Music] namaste [Music]
