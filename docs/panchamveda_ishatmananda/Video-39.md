[40. Panchama Veda 40: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdPXH7jZQ3M)

you let us begin today tavakotham foreign now previously in our discussion bhagavan sriram krishna is telling shakti alone is the root of the universe this is the realization this is the ultimate truth but sometimes some people they do not understand properly what does it mean shakti in one place it says that i am alone i like to be many and in other upanishads and in other veda also it clearly mentioned that in the beginning there was only one and that was absolute it it there was no two then how come that so many things have come then they are explaining that one wish to the same one becoming many so one is the consciousness then he is thinking and immediately the whole creation is coming into being so always there is a mystery even the science is going on searching how the universe was created this universe how it was created they're going on forwarding so many other theories big bang and all this but in the vedanta it says it was the supreme consciousness which is known as the brahmana and it thought that it will become many it became many so it is the manifestation of that type so this way it goes and then one gentleman has written me a question the if it is the will of god that this universe has been created and all these things are going on happening then why should we try to realize god why should he meditate why should we do all the good things morality what is the necessity because if we are the part and parcel of god if it is the will of god then we are not we are nothing this is a very old question majority of the time people will be asking now the answer is the moment you are thinking i have nothing to do with this i when you are addressing yourself as i and i have nothing to do anything because god has created me and god in his mercy in his play in his divine leela is doing everything i have nothing to do who is this i if you think that you are the part and brussel of god the question won't arise because you are the part and parcel of the god so if you are not thinking that you are that part of god or your god yourself then you are separate from god then the question of going back to the root is coming so that is the thing we have been given particularly the human being is having the ego that i consciousness again that human being has been given the capacity to discriminate what is good and what is bad and that is the reason only human being can reach to the source to the god to god realization etc utilizing his capacity and what is that shakti ramakrishna is thickly shakti alone is the root of the universe and what is this shakti the primal energy and again immediately siram krishna himself is mentioning all the upanishads and our scripture is also mentioning that this shakti has two aspect avidya and vidya in the hinduism in our philosophy it is very clear the good and bad is coming from the same god and this is the question is again is a question is a mystery how god who is all good can create bad and if the bad things are there in god again then the god is also affected by the bad sudama krishna he gives the answer very simple and that's why i have given the name panchama veda it's the knowledge and that knowledge is given by sirama krishna the modern day of bhagavan the swara and in such a simple manner the snake is having the venom but it is the poison but nothing happens to it but when it bites to someone else that happens the similarly god is having both good and bad with then avidya but it is not having any reaction it is neutral so the bad is also the abhiddah is also coming from god so that is the reason we have to understand this the power of god is doing all these things then what is the religion means realization of the truth what is this truth that the whole universe has been created by god this is first i also am created by god okay now i feel separated from god because otherwise i would have said i am god myself since i am not telling that since all the time i am feeling differently i am thinking that i am small i am doing these and that this is good this is bad all this thought that means there is something that is make me different than the god and what is that something of idya and what is religion going back to the source and the source is the truth the knowledge and all the religion is nothing but the process to go back to the souls to god and religion means knowing and merging with the creator knowing and merging with the creator that is exactly what has happened in the life of all the great saints and sages everywhere in different religions in different times in different places but the problem again that they cannot express it clearly why siram krishna again he is giving the example a doll made of salt and it went to the sea to measure how much water it is it's there in the sea what happened it never came back it never came back to give the report because the salt is made out of that water it is the source when you go to the source and you are mixed with it there is no chance to come back and tell others and that is the reason no one could say properly what happens we'll find that here itself when the master masha he is asking what happens when one realizes the god with form and god without form what is the difference between these two realizations srirama krishna whispered something at his ear but the master master didn't disclose it didn't mention it perhaps it was not possible for him to disclose so that is the when what happens after the realization here again we find that sirama krishna is telling see the after the realization after attaining god one forgets he gates his external splendor the glories of his creation this is the first criteria how i will know that he or she has realized god the first and foremost thing is to see whether he is having desire craving hankering for the worldly things if it is there then he has not whatever may be the claim this is very clear the moment anyone is thinking even in a subtle way even within the mind no one is knowing what is happening within the mind so but he himself or she herself knows what is going on in his mind so the the moment one is declaring that i have realized god and i can take you to the god the only one thing that we have to notice whether that personality that person is craving for the worldly things name fame and jewelry and the property and all these things anything it is sure that he has not realized god and the moment one realizes god he don't need anything because i have reached the source what i am going to do with the other things those who are working under the king they always try to get their salary increased but the prince neighbor he is not in the payroll of the king he knows this is my kingdom i am to be going to be the king someday everything is mine he doesn't bother about the salary scale why this is the thing why we are so very careful about the world because we have not seen god because we do not know about god so all this that we are seeing externally is attracting us telling after attaining god one forgets his external splendor the glories of his creation then he is giving the reference hanumana hanuman some people were asking what is the date and you are not fasting and you know this is the day then hanumana said i don't know anything of the day of the week or the fortnight or the position of the stars i don't care i think of rama alone except rama there is nothing in the mind and that's why those who are externally thinking today is a very holy day we have to fast today is this i have to bathe today is this i have to go today these external things are there in the mind and those who are going on thinking of rama then why they will do it so this is one thing is very clear that in the beginning we must have to do it and then slowly slowly when we reach to the ultimate then it doesn't matter because for whom we are doing for rama and the rama is already with me one person came and he was sitting before suramar krishna and then the moment it was dusk evening he took out his jabu mala and tried to do japan sirama krishna gave the hint ikane abbar oshof keno why you were doing all these things here ekhani here means you are sitting before god and the japa and taking the counting the beads for what to see the god and now you fool closed your eyes and taking the name of java god i am here before you so that is the thing one has to understand and sudama krishna says how far all the scripture will take us what is the benefit of the scripture only it works as a map and by following the map when we have reached the place i throw the map it is not necessary so similarly all the scriptures talks about god give the description about god and in a different way they are telling us and these these are the hints so how i will know a holy person a realized soul in the bhagavad-gita also shri krishna is giving a big list and here see ramakrishna is telling he will never have any desire for the worldly things and then he is giving the example of the hanumana and then master himself is telling after i had experienced samadhi his own experience is telling giving the hint that he is god himself after i had experienced samadhi my mind curved intensely to hear only about god and nothing else so that these are the things that we must remember see one couple they rang me and then they were telling that their daughter purchased a bhagavad-gita that i have in bengali i have given that gita they have got now they are telling the moment we get it up in the early morning and after doing all our thing we put on that and go on seeing that gita hearing that gita because both are retired whole day and after the known little rest again we'll see the gita it's not that they are liking mind gita but they are attracted with the devotional words maybe that the way i am explaining that they are liking that difference meant to man person to person but the what i am telling it's not the story that i am telling i am only reciting bhagavad-gita slokas and then explaining in my own way but if the desire to know about god love for god was not there these words of bhagavad-gita would not have attracted them so at least to some extent this is the example and we can understand the mind is becoming pure bhagavan sirama krishna is telling my mind is to crave intensely to hear only about god then he is telling one thing more he's talking about krishna kiss person who was a brahmin very austere brahman but he had faith what is that that each and every soul is nothing but god the moment you take the name of god it is so holy it can make anyone holy krishna kisha he was traveling he felt thirsty he want to drink water and he found one person very low caste he is carrying water he said can you please give me little water to drink how can i sir you are a brahmana i am a locust person it doesn't matter you only chant the name of shiva say that shiva ham shivoham and you are pure the tremendous faith in the name of god once i have uttered the name of god nothing is going to happen to me the tremendous faith so what happens when you realize god first and foremost no attraction for the worldly things second a confirmed faith tremendous faith that by taking the name of god i can achieve anything and everything because name of god is the most holy thing once you have uttered with all devotion everything is achieved bhagavan siram krishna said if anyone has altered sincerely wants my name he will surely come to me look at it only once we are taking the name so many times but along with the name so many other names are also coming when i am telling sri rama along with sridharma all rabbana and ravana's whole family is coming so that is the reason when i say rama it is only rama so he said repeat the name of shiva and this thing who can do the when you see the rama srirama he is accepting shabari why she was going on repeating the name of sri rama she became purified and whatever she was offering with so much of love for god everything was purified never cared about the family that he she belonged to that chavery though apparently low caste she became the great devotee of sri rama there were so many people at that time of rama who knows them but each and every one who has read the ramayana will surely know about shabari anyone expounding ramayana the life of rama will talk about showering so this is the immortality why because that low-caste lady came in contact with the god how through love and faith rama will surely come and when she was offering rama accepted and again we find in the life of bhagavan si rama krishna he was he was not touching anything if it is not given by a holy person but the same ramakrishna without any hesitation drank water which was brought from a hotel hotel was run by the british and the cooks and others were muslim they touched the glass and it was a glass that previously orthodox hindu never touched it even then see ramakrishna oh this is clear water no problem give me hygienic but at the same time not creating any difference those who has realized god the third thing is no discrimination between the cause creed and language or gender anything because all each and everything is made of god god has created it is the reflection of god god in different forms this is the unique thing so how i will know that one has realized god these are the things and whether those who are aristocrat educated rich people can they talk about god no not at all when these things the ramakrishna was explaining suddenly he said one day jatindra came to the garden of jadumon lake jadhaven lake's garden is adjacent to dakshinesha jatindra was a very famous person he belonged to the tiger family that rabindranath's family and ravindrana stegar family was very rich and they were cultured family and because of the rabindranath's father he started one separate a little separate from the traditional hindus the brahma-samaj so people used to know them when siram krishna came to know that jatindranath has come to the next the garden house of jadu malik he went there i was there too then he was inquiring because he's an educated person and what is the view of his uh about religion about the human life etc i asked him what is the duty of man isn't it our duty to think of god and jatinda replied we are worldly people how is it possible for us to achieve liberation look at it complete doubtful even king yadishtira had to have a vision of hell even king yudhisthira had to have a vision of hell in the mahabharata they say as because he was telling judiciary said that the elephant they killed vehma killed the elephant but judishila said your son and for that he had to see the hell he need not to go but he had to see that sudama krishna was not at all happy and he said this made me very angry i said to him what sort of man are you talking to that dark tiger of all the incidents of yudhisthira's life you remember only he is seeing hell there are so many other things the judiciary has done he you are not remembering that only one fault or whatever that you are mentioning you don't remember his truthfulness his forbearance his patience his discrimination his dispassion his devotion to god look at it the positive way to look at people those who are always negative they always find out the negative thing even in the good they will say god is good but why he has created these problems the problem is so do you know why this problem so i was about to say many more things when riddha stopped my mouth this ramakrishna is the realized god he never cared about with this person because other people are very very careful because anything the relation with the rich person and naturally that counts the ordinary people will always having tried to have a connection with the rich and powerful people high and mighty if you have a relation with the people in the higher ups naturally you can think that i will get these i will get that those who have realized god never bothered about that so he went on telling the yatinder what type of person you are the similar things happened to another person also he was a magistrate and he was a very good writer he was a patriot and he has written books on the life of sri krishna it was a very but the idea was not clear what does it mean even a highly placed person an educated person well-versed person may not be having the clear idea about life unless and until you have come to a person who has realized the god you will never know what is the goal of human life there's a bhagavan sirama krishna very clearly say the goal of human life is god realization and the god realization for that what you have to do you have to proficient the shakti of god and the death shakti the power of god is not separated from god though in our culture in our tradition in our religion always they try to depict the shakti as a woman as a lady as a god is why because the male female conception is very clear in our mind we know the father and the mother so the creation means father and the mother so to utilize that idea our ancestors the rishis they said shiva is male and ma kali she is female they are creating sustaining and maintaining destroying this universe we understand that and to make again one step further they made shiva only lying just like a dead man shiva is shabba shabab means the dead person dead body and this shiva is lying like a dead body but the mother kali who is active standing on shiva not away from shiva on shiva why associated connected otherwise the shakti cannot work so the shiva is that intelligence but inactive and same thing when active this is the explanation of bhagavan si rama krishna is a goddess kali and that is why when they were fighting both of them madhu and goitaba fighting with shriek the vishnu bhagavan now all the gods and goddesses they were praying to the power of god please you come you arise and then you have to kill this two demons and they were praying that means whatever oblation offering we are giving to god it goes to you only whatever offering we get to give to our forefathers it goes to you only because you are the source you have created everything then in another sloka dharyati is you are holding everything and you are maintaining sustaining this world and in the end it all merges in you they have written it in the chandi you are the creator you are the sustainer and you are the destroyer bhagavan sriram krishna himself saw totally in his front he was sitting in a different divine mood under the banyan tree at the nation then suddenly he saw that a beautiful lady coming up suddenly from the water of the ganges and from the ganges she came on the road and she was coming towards bhagavansi ramakrishna who was sitting under the tree and when she was coming she became pregnant then she gave a birth of a child and then she was maintaining that child and giving all love to the child and suddenly she became a terrible figure and the the child again merged with that and again it is also melting and mixing in you so he saw it the whole creation the power that is why he is telling that ada shakti you have to satisfy the ada shakti wherever you go go and pray to the mother and then only you will get all the blessings and now the narendra and the devotees they came to meet ramakrishna and they were singing kirtan the god's name narendra was a very good singer and he was singing the bhajan immerse yourself for evermore o mind in him who is the pure knowledge and pure please he was singing that song and sudama krishna was very happy satyam chinmayama mana shahari all these songs used to sing and when they were singing keeping silam krishna in the center they were dancing if you go to the that room of sriram krishna is not very big but even then they used to enjoy a lot still those beds which suramar krishna used to use one bait a little maybe six inch higher or four inches that was his bait to sleep and another almost similar type very simple ordinary wood and that was his sitting place he used to sit over there and discuss this is side by side and only a pitcher full of water that was there in the room and nothing else and some of the pictures of gods and goddesses including the jesus christ and hanumanji ramachandra and all those gods and goddesses some people they are very angry with us i heard i went to a center private center and this traditional hindu temple people they're also hindus they came they saw it and then they had written a very strong letter to them why being hindu you can keep and the same altar with sirama krishna the picture of jesus who is not hindu how this can be look at it and they were asking that they are asking like this and do you have any doubt that jesus is god or not you know as siram krishna saw him he must be god and the god for everyone he cannot have for some few peop few people of a special country or some group of people not like that god for everyone maybe that your love is for surama krishna but it doesn't mean that you cannot respect other what is there they do not know what real hinduism means that's why they are talking like this they are orthodox people narrow-minded people it has nothing to do with hinduism and one person also wrote to us i visited the vedanta society i found that on the same altar bhagavan buddha and sudama buddha hinduism and jesus was never a hindu why you have kept them i didn't reply to you because you won't understand suppose they are there what harm to you you have come to a temple and you are offering pranam if you don't like to offer a pronoun don't offer you just see it take the picture and go away this occur okay and these are the very narrow-minded and this is the reason bhagavan si ramakrishna he advented this time in the modern age and he is giving a new definition of religion what is that the moment you have realized god and you are having an idea about god all this narrowness will go away and that's why this time we have observed all the this jainism and whatever came in the different time we have observed it why because we believe all are leading to the same goal because we have faith in bhagavan sirama krsna's divine words and here after the song the cerama krishna was in the center and they were singing and dancing one must be very happy when one is with god why the kirtana why they sing and dance that is the best way to express joy happiness and in the last november when we are observing 150th birth adversary i was constantly going on telling the devotees that you must have to sing a bhajan and then you have to dance expression of joy when people are coming the devotee uh swamis are coming we just observe take the snaps but it is over no you have to show that you are joy and to express your joy the song and dance when the music is their song is there the best way to express our joy with rhythm with music with tune that is the song and what was the song the meaning of that new people have come is a new person come and see look at them they have only two bags hanging from both sides what is that tyaga and bahiragya do they it is hanging from the both side come look at it see i told them to explain in english also the meaning but anyway this was the first time i was also very new and it never they did i could not make them uh another clear my idea so this is the way and you should not feel shy to dance before god sudama krishna himself used to dance before everyone and why i don't care about the criticism of the world i don't when i am very shy why i am shy because what other people will talk about me i am concerned about the world mirabai who was a princess who was a queen she never hesitated to sing and dance on that same road where her subjects were watching and she never thought what is going to be repurcation why not that she was calculating but it never came in her mind it was so much of love so much of love for god except god i never know anything so that is the reason when music was over see ramakrishna held naren in his arms and long time and said if you can sing properly and express the joy through dance god becomes so happy this what shows he came and held northern for a long time and said you have made us so happy today this is the reason and the same not in when who was singing the young man he saw so many people are sitting so he was careful about the music the tune and the rhythm and all that that the sriram krishna didn't like him when the song was over he said today your song was like without salt some curry if you are eating some something without salt what happens no taste at all so your song was like that he was singing to please the other people not for the god one person came to sing and he was trying to see it keeping his back at the god i told you singing for god only sing for god and all other people whom you like to face they will be very happy even sitting at your back so that is the thing our idea should be only and only and only to please god and nobody else and that is the reason sirama krishna and near the east door narendra and other devotees were gossiping this is another thing when they came to surama krishna the god in the temple not in the young man and as the things were going on in that society he was very conscious about that he was talking with the means the master marsha he was telling not indivisible how do you find the young men nowadays even the plato also he said at his time nowadays the young men are going to astray they don't follow the tradition this is the complaint of all the time norin himself was a very young man only 18 19 years but even then he was thinking the young people they are not properly studying and not maintaining the that's over here they are not bad but they don't receive any religious instruction aim was telling then don't receive that that way the norm told you you don't mix with the young people i mix with them i have seen them what they do they are not paying any attention for the study they are doing this and that suddenly sri ramakrishna who is the guru this is the duty of the guru responsibility of the guru the moment he found that narendra and master moshe both his disciple and they are talking about many other thing except god immediately came and master ramakrishna became grave and said to him he didn't say to narendra because naren is very young and argumentative the moment will say you should not talk like that immediately he will put another why not this is also so like that so he came and rectified the master marsha who was 29 27 29 a little elderly person the master became grave and said to him grave means he was concerned they have come here in the temple in a holy place and to god himself and even then wasting time about the worldly things and that is not their concern they should not be spending time so the total attention should be on god he came and told him rather seriously this kind of conversation is not good it isn't desirable to indulge in any talk but talk of god you are there senior you are intelligent you should not have encouraged him to talk about such matters he was guiding master maha you should not have encouraged him to talk about this and when i was in andaman people there they are good people but in the andaman the new civilization is coming up when the the refugees from east bengal came they were settled over there and the refuses from other places also came it's a new totally new civilization so they were not knowing but good people they came they used to come to our astra in the puja time and usually mainly at the time of the prasad when the puja in the morning nine o'clock nobody is there totally takurma swamiji and with three swamis so three is two three six people who used to sit over there when it is almost 12 o'clock when the oven is over this to know his timing was there then it will be so much crowded because immediately after that there will be prasad and they were interested and the ladies will be coming and shouting inside the temple we had a small in a room to see nearly 50 60 people could and these two from there oh mashima my auntie i didn't meet you for such a long time where you were have you gone to calcutta i told is this the place that you have to ask this question you can ask afterwards this is a temple but this was difficult to tell them so what i did the moment they started coming i told now you continue your homa so the houma will be when they come for and along with that ice to chant has to ask them to repeat that slowly slowly slowly they got the interest in that and it became really a very good devotees group and previously when i used to read the bhagavad gita only three persons used to come and sit the one was from our asthma itself that elderly person retired and bachelor he was there so he used to come and sit and he used to bring his friend another person who is to come that there for the walking he will be going and forcing him to come and sit down you have done a lot of exercise come and see that the man will be coming and then he'll be every sunday he'll be grudging and third person is to come and sit and with a very devoted like this with the clothes i will be listening and noting down but the moment i am over you'll be going out i never could talk to him so after one two three the i think after fourth i talked to him i told self please wait i'd like to talk to you you come regularly and so devotedly you listen but i don't know your name then he said swamiji please don't mind i am from cbi from the polish and as because that time the bjp movement was going on so anyone wearing the geru are the sannyasins so the police used to go on noting what they are saying etc so they were the only sannyasi have come into andaman i have given this because i understand bengali so what discourse you are giving i don't listen to gita i only note anything against the government you are telling or not then you have attended all the four lectures one month is over do you find anything against government or no so it's okay then he said i am getting interest in gita and then they purchase one copy so both things will be your duty and your dharma so like this and then slowly slowly so many people started coming they got interested so this is the beauty the attraction of krishna in a very simple way he will be explaining then he was asking a devotee can you guess who is the devotee so rama krishna asking a devotee do you ever have dreams when all these things were over after the dinner suramar krishna was walking a little on the baranda and he found that a devotee is sitting with another person suddenly he came and sat with them and asked the devotee do you ever have dreams do you know who is the devotee master mahashaya the master mashay when he wanted to hide himself he always quoted devotee a devotee it is he master himself and he has always mentioned three more or the aim are the devotee like these only so the people on gays who is this mahindra looked at him came and asked him have you seen it do you see dreams then the devotee is sad the other day i dreamed a strange dream see that he didn't disclose salaam krishna looked at him and found and said i saw the whole world developed in water sorry enveloped in water it was merging within in the water there was water on all sides a few boats were visible but suddenly huge waves appeared and sank them i was about i was about to board a ship with the other few few others when we saw a brahmin walking over that expense of water i asked him how can you walk over the deep water the brahmin said with a smile oh there is no difficulty about that there is a bridge under the water i said to him where you are going he said i am going to bhavani poor bhavani poor bhavani means the goddess pura the place of the goddess the city of the divine mother bhavani poor the there is a place in calcutta called bhavanipur it is not that bhavanipur srirama krishna mentioned about the bhavani poor the place of the divine mother wait a little i cried i shall accompany you then that brahman said and the master sadama krishna say oh i am thrilled to hear the story again the devotee was explaining the brahmin said i am in a hurry it will take you some time to get out of the boat goodbye remember this path and come after me then the master ramakrishna said oh my hair is standing on end please be initiated by a guru as soon as possible so these how he could understand this was the dream that master mahashad dreamed to saw and the indication is very clear everybody is going to be drowned by the water of worldliness and this person somehow noticed the brahmin that is srama krishna himself and he is walking on the water that means the it is no difficulty for god to survive in even that situation and he said you a time is not right for you yet you follow this path cannot come after me then surama krishna said this is the very rare thing he said be initiated by a guru as soon as possible this is unless and until we are taking the name from a guru we cannot keep our mind in a proper way this road that he has shown you have to remember this path and you have to follow so the initiation from a guru is necessary and this is in vedanta sometime they'll be telling your mind is your guru but for whom who has already controlled the mind but for the ordinary people it is necessary to have the initiation to take the name of god we go to this person that person do this do that listen hear read we know so many things but we cannot concentrate the american boy who is to come over here he used to go to so many places he he comes i think for i have some a month he i didn't see him and this he used to go to so many places listening to so many things reading so many books and very intelligent the moment i will quote from a gita immediately you said this is from this chapter i don't know where from which chapter i just quote i remember the sloka and relative but he knows the chapters even so this is the beauty this is the special but without the initiation mind cannot be concentrated on a particular god and take the initiation from a guru he never said to me from me to any guru and who can be guru that we have to understand the person who has already crossed that path he only can be a guru otherwise not how we will understand that he has no desire for the worldly things he has no hankering for name and fame so these are the qualities that sudama krishna said before here again he is explaining bhakti love of god is the essence of all spiritual discipline the love of god is the essence of all spiritual discipline even the islam even the christianity even the buddhism anywhere the moment you are going to god what actually we do we pray to god and the moment it is a prayer moment we are going and loving that god that part of mind or the act of mind is called bhakti and these bhaktis afterwards ramakrishna will say in this modern days naradiya bhakti naruti bhakti means in previously it is only love here it is mixed with gyana karma and devotion the bhakti the definition the nara shandilla has given the definition of bhakti but at this age in the modern age we should have to follow the path or the devotion the description of the devotion definition of the devotion given by the great lover of god narada whatever you do everything should be given to god when you forgot to remember god paramob you must feel pang that today i have forgotten to take the name of god so that call bhakti according to narada this is what bhagavan then once shanashin entered into the uh room of bhagavan si ramakrishna he is a nanak panti nanakanti means a punjabi and he said to master namo narayana sirama krishna asked him to sit down a group of sanctions nanak panties they came and they actually greetings rama krishna that is the traditional way the sins they will be greeting because the pranam or the greetings that we are offering not to you but to the narayana who is already there within you so namo narayana then the master was talking with them the first sentence he said nothing is impossible for god no body can describe his nature in words everything is possible for him and then he is explaining what he said nothing is impossible everything is possible for god and then he said nobody can describe his nature because the story that he already told nunes the doll made of the salt salt doll how can it go and measure the water because it's made from that the one who is actually merging in god cannot come back again to tell and who can give the description personalities like surah krishna jesus personalities like bhagavan buddha personalities like the jain dharma gurus so
