[203. Panchama Veda 203: The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ClFyyZ_2E2U)

a bully dodging our today serum Tichenor speaking about his own experience as a also a very important topic that one should always be read ponder and practice the 2ds society why should I be one sided surround business telling why should I do one sighted Sarang Krishna asked himself this question and we know in the last class we were reading he were discussing the varieties of practices that he has already done himself and he was using the spiritual curve different diverse spiritual curves addresses marks so that people can understand the different type of religion you know that those who are following the worshipers of Goddess Kali they always take the color braids and whatever they are using the dress is all red color and those who are rich diverse white color sometimes yellow but resolve like this so different type of curves and Sudama Krishna last time we heard he told this all is one should be respect to that why because it is symbolizing something he's not the person who is wearing but because of that particular dress and color we are remembering something else too that he is telling now one question may be asked why should I be one sided when the ceramic Asian is asking this does it mean that one should follow all the philosophies and all the spiritual practices this is also a question that may be raised does it mean that we have to follow all the paths that is absurd first there are so many varieties second the life span is very short when we usually try to understand or get that maturity to understand almost like 25 24 25 26 years and then by 50 60 it is all over 25 years or 30 years can I follow all the paths now it is absurd then they'll be no depth then how come some tissue is asking like this sometimes some people they will ask him heaps Adamo krishna is asking that all perhaps are the true then why you are not following the Christianity this is a foolish question you know Saddam Krishnan even mentioned like direct what he made now let us analyze a little otherwise there may be some confusion shall we be vacant and decide not only toleration but complete acceptance what does it mean not only tolerance but acceptance if God is the only creator he must have created different shapes different religions different temperaments he is how a devotee a faithful a believer of God can raise doubt the first argument why should we accept others because what God has created how do you know we'll accept God there is no other creation no other creator so obviously God is the Creator God is the creation and is all God's play if we believe in hog faithful they believe in that way go to any religion they would say God has created and then because of my ego I separate them now this is of course a one if it is a social or political perspective when you are discussing this point from the social and political perspective people may differ but when from the spiritual point of view now you cannot a true spiritual seeker can never say that my path is the only and the best path and God has created these and all others are Devils we know completely wrong but this is the only point that I wanted to make it very clear to myself and also to you because through these only we can understand the unique personality that Saddam Tichenor the personification of religious harmony the ceramic dish nur is a personification of the religious harmony sometimes people don't understand this and they doubt what they avoid but this is the greatest thing that was discovered practiced and propagate the white discovery because Serrano Krishna is the only person who followed all these paths himself in his own life and then he discovered that all the paths are leading to the same goal and then he propagated as many faiths so many paths but for whom begin not for those who are thinking from the political point of view from the social point of view not for them but for those who are taking religious seriously if they are taking the religious for their own benefit the business benefit our political benefit our social benefit no question not now we are not questioning them we are not discussing about that our sees those who have left our heart and home those were so sincerely praying to God millions and millions of people they are so sincere to realize God but unfortunately somehow because of their ego which is supposed to be completely eradicated getting fandom increased by some wrong understanding that's why this gospel of Salaam Edition is so important and what we need to make the spiritual progress only two things one determination and second free from ego Robinson Ramakrishna said you must judge before accepting you must judge and in his inimitable way say you must see among the daytime or also in the nighttime then except that is look at his life what he is telling and what is behaving how he is leaving that is very important and then only we should accept after accepting after judging and then accepting we are determined that I am going to follow this path so determination I am going to follow this path but at the same time completely ego free ego free otherwise if the eye is there how the God's grace will come do you listen to that from see Ramakrishna you know that the ramakrishna mission which was founded by Swami Vivekananda in 1897 officially that was and in the very first day when he was giving a guideline for the monks he said no connection with the politics he was a patriot no he was a lover of India anything and everything of India used to love used to love so much when people were criticizing him personally hidden protest but when people criticized the India even the Mongols raised and he challenged that man should not criticize India because it is the land where all the truths were manifested Sathya and that person when he is forming a monastic order he said you cannot do that why favor ISM the moment we go to cast the vote we favor some party some person and then we are not favoring or supporting someone else all over the world the Ramakrishna mission launched the return to society mom's nuns they will never cast gold nowadays a new system has come I don't know here in an India note ah I don't like it even then you are not liking someone and liking someone so we don't go but all people are coming to us all political people they come to us beat sometimes people they make mistakes you know when the Congress was there there's to come to us and the BJP and this to come to us I was so closed with the Bajpayee water will be a debauch P the was it what was there I used to like that person and he was the Prime Minister Prime Minister is not a person is a post though obviously in India if you have to work and we usually work over the earth for the development of the society so we need their help their cooperation government guidances government health obviously but we never ever get in people make the mistake one should not there's a beautiful article that has been published in a Bengali newspaper and after and they cleared it because one should not have the doubt about the wine Ramakrishna mission zombies are not going to cuss the port because of this as a monk if I go and say I favor him and I support his political ideology and do not do that he seems to be a monk or a nun he seems to be a monastic person some other stealing some a Drishti equal psyched admit how it is possible we follow the ones ramakrishna and then that the person who is giving the his ideas into a structure that is Swami Vivekananda we are the followers of Ramakrishna Vivekananda and for us it is only the same thing each and every one we needed to follow other paths but must not criticize we need to follow a path of course and we are following the path of Vedanta but we never criticize I yesterday went to one organisation and that is a ddos semaj some of you must be knowing they have a awesome over here in Chicago and also in Fiji a group of people totally dedicated to that one personality named Rd don t have a philosophic they have a practice I went i sat and noticed their how they do it they're practicing mostly Vedanta but explain expressed practiced in their own way what wrong they're doing it in their own way I happen to practice that but I am a support they accept yes I believe if you are true you can by following this path you will realize the goal we went to a Jewish community they were having their spiritual practices there something they were telling we don't understand anything of that because Langille language is completely different the Hebrew original Hebrew they were speaking and praying and sometimes they were getting up when all everybody is getting up we stood up they turned to the left they turned to the right many of our devotees we all went we practice that we did as they deep and there is a book also we opened try to understand read nothing wrong what is there we had liked them very good people how could we do that because we have the followers of Ramakrishna Vivekananda otherwise most of the people will never do the frames we have to understand this is the great difference of Sri Ramakrishna philosophy and his the way that we practice that philosophy ceramic isne he is in one place he is telling once a cache of house I found myself in a new mood the brahmers always speak of the impersonal therefore I say to divine mother look at it impersonal there's also Hindu but in the Hindu philosophy some people do not act up the personal God is impersonal and did you not believe in the personality so I said to divine mother taco was carrying the divine mother in his start so he I say to divine mother in an ecstatic mood mother please don't come here they don't believe in your forms why for the suppose I am my mother is with me and visiting some place and then those people are not giving the respect my mother accepting my mother ignoring my mother how I failed they may be of the same religion same social status and same culture same language but naturally if you know what should I come over here they are not paying respect to my mother see Ramakrishna I was in a different mood that length sentence you must read ketchups house I found myself a new mood MWD friends these are the very subtle points when you read the Gospel we read casually and immediately think oh this is the serum of Krishna just one para before he was telling I accept everyone and here in the case of Chavez he is asking karma Kali not to come over there or look at it wrong so you have to understand the mood here cinema Krishna is completely dedicated to goddess Kali and as a son he is ever careful for the respect of the mother his mother but he was worshipping advaita way he realized the brahman so this Radhika question listen to these words of the master against sacred sectarianism and remain silent Master smiling now I will give you some example see our Sri Ramakrishna he is accepting everyone he saved and in his behavior yes next line he is telling the joy is in a wonderful State of Mind nowadays he falls to the ground while chanting the name of Hari he devotes himself to guilt on meditation and other spiritual practices till 4:00 in the morning the whole night that person is engaged in spiritual spiritual practices he now puts on an ochre row and prostrate himself before the image of God once he accompanied me to God our school house there's a different person the different gerado here he went over there from the bush Nava I pointed out the place where Kidada used to meditate at once Vijay prostrating himself there again he fell prostrate before the picture of Jatin na diva this Vijay Krishna Kshama does you know he never accepted saraishness philosophy but sadhana Krishna is so proud of him this is the catalyst city this is the broadness of mind this is the acceptance of all paths and creeds and philosophy this is the important point this beat krishna' krishna' me is not a disciple of sri ramakrishna saddam Oh Krishna was explaining just other day we read how his own disciple afterwards he became famous and the first president of the Ramakrishna order shaman Ramananda the first experience spiritual experience and he was explaining it with great joy that my son has risk to the the summit and he is successful in spiritual life he was telling all other people the same way he is with great joy and pride and Happiness is explaining about Vijay Krishna Goswami who was the wish Nava in the beginning as a young man he started his life by not accepting any images he joined the Brahma movement then he separated himself from that you know the Brahma movement started by that one person it was not actively problem this was a so much and then the ketchup Jenn Dechaine came and he separated Ruben Donna's father was there then keshavjee Anderson separated the in Vijay Krishna Ashtami separated from Keyshia all small small groups and they were breaking and solder and Brahmo Samaj the Vijay Krishna Goswami he was the leader of the Shaad Randhawa Samaj ramakrishna is so happy that he is making a great progress in his spiritual life master he respects me very much we about the video - 'no but it was difficult to reach him one day he is Hakan XD somewhere else that miss Vijay Krishna is very busy going here and there giving the talk lecture and discourses and retreats all this now the person is asking why Sousa is asking they his presence has created great trouble in the shavon Brahmo Samaj Sutherland drama semaj which was actually formed by the Vijay Krishna they separated from the other group and this man is asking Sri Lanka the brand new still him now look at it the brahmanas tell him you mix with people who worship God it formed the grandmas are also Hindus of course they say no we are not in two years separate from into a spaceship so grandmas are not at all happy that Vijay Krishna Vaishali is coming and mixing its Ramakrishna who is the worshipper of Goddess Kali so those people at the you mix with people who worship God at Falls you are an idolater BJ is liberal and straightforward then cinema Krishna giving his statement unless a man is kindness he doesn't receive the grace of God it doesn't receive the grace of God friends I was trying to point out these thing those who are sincere for the religious life odd thing these are the instructions but who are casually taking they're having so many other vacations along with that also they are using the religion no problem for them so they go to some Shiva temple our Shiva is the great no other gods can stand okay what them is okay and then they go and support the team and the hockey team or these and then this is my team the Bears that the best no one can beat them okay so my Bears team and also Shiva and all of them because I like them so I don't accept others but those were sincere they like to truly realize God and like to realize the joy of spirituality for them he is telling like this ceramic is not talked to the Mukherjee brothers now we are coming to another point Mukherjee brothers Mahindra the elder had his own business Breanna the younger had been an engineer after making some provision for himself he had given up his job minder was 35 or 36 years old the brothers at home both in the country and in Calcutta that was mostly in at that time the rich people in Calcutta they were having the same thing they will be having a house in the city and some in a big place the cultivated land and house and all that in the villages they were rich people educated people and mostly this temperament of the mainly the Indians after earning some money enough now give up and then pursue for the religious development one young man has written to me he's an engineer and he told about that I came over here and I am successful I earned some money and I think now I should retire because I am already 28 and I'd like to join the ramakrishna mission so at the age of 28 he came to know about the bacon and the he real he read a lot of books now he has he is thinking that the time is shot if I like to become the monk of the ramakrishna mission I must join before 30 so twenty eight is enough whatever money I am having that I will get to my house they will be supported at that and then I like to so mostly the tendencies is this they don't like to grab the money and enjoy so this we find that was also there at the time of Sri Ramakrishna and these two brothers are coming master smiling so now I wish to like them so he is telling them don't see the heart is simply because your spiritual consciousness has been awakened a little if the spiritual consciousness has not awakened then they will never come to the spiritual people or try to follow the path it has awakened and ceramic Isner is recognizing it and he is telling but don't sit idly but just it is it is rising good but continue and he is telling go forward but this Priya not the junior brother smiling he say say our the excellent change we cannot go forward naturally we feel like that in the house of Duty what we should do this is Ramakrishna jagadguru is the master of the whole universe look at it he is telling what if the legs are chained that means they are householders they are married they have children they have the responsibilities and all those things are there and the God himself is giving this assurance what if the lake's a chain the important thing is the mind bondage ease of the mind and freedom also ease of the mind very clear it is not the physically very well it's not the food that you are taking it's not the dress that you are wearing it's not the people with whom you are leaving it is your own mind this is the very very special point that every spiritual seeker should understand and there I am completely free this is my own mind my thoughts are not controlled by others I control and I generate I follow my thoughts so I have abdun Salam o Krishna immediately you know this is the speciality he is immediately giving a story to explain listen to a story there were two frames one went to the house of prostitution and the other to year a recital of the bhagavata what is shame thought the first one who went to that bad place my friend is hearing spiritual discourse but just see what I have slipped down to look at me my friend is a holy place and I have come here in this hell the city sitting in the temple and listening to the bhagavata stinking shame on me my friend is having a good time there but how stupid I am he is sitting in the temple listening to the scripture but thinking in a completely different way now see Ramakrishna after death the soul of the forest was taken to by Kunta Michael - means the heaven by the messenger of Vishnu while that the second one who was in the temple earth supposed to listen to the bhagavatam the scripture was taken and the world of Yama Yama Luca that means it is not the body it is not the dress it is not the place this of the people is not the food it doesn't matter anything only your third your thought and your thought so Swami be wakened the same when you are in the vortex of the New York because he was visiting here he saw in the New Year duties and so this is very cold now you've just stopped it it's very difficult for the chilly air to touch others body enough anything so this this is the way we always routine is that cars is a cars with their thoughts but that's why they take the initiation they go on chanting the name of God wherever you are now sometimes the plane is canceled you see it and go on taking the name of God and looking at sometimes in the monitor when they are announcing what they're announcing and all these things are going on but you are taking the name of God now and then closing your eyes and try to see the God with the cocoon are you there okay then again so where you are in the company of God and sitting in the airport the swami vivekananda he say while in you are in the vortex of the New York fill the calmness of the Himalaya so all people are running helter-skelter and they are going for these and that you are also going but at the same time you are within your thoughts no one can control no one can stop no one can disturb so this is the wonderful teaching see Ramakrishna is it something very unique this Ramakrishna say no is a very ancient traditional way mano-a-mano Shana karana but the move she that means that when you are bound bunda and moksha liberation is according to your mind as for your mind the guru said that you were completely free no no no no I am a senior you know then who can give you liberation unless and until you think that you and yoga Vasishta it says each our Mottram a bit the tan Najib Mikati Avinashi moksha with chat ale what is that a idea Aveda means the conception that I am these body and mind complex the moment you were thinking I am this body and mind then ego is playing and obviously you are tied over there the moment you think no I am the son of God and the daughter of mother and the daughter of God I am pure only for some work I have come over here when my duty will be over I will be on the lap of my mother who can stop you so this is the liberation moksha would Chetty you are completely liberated how you were thinking that is the what the be done T in the same with unting always saying what what the Guru does ceramic is distilling the story a lion came to Fr that hunting and then he eating and he saw in the group of the the gorse another lion is roaming around yeah you know it is possible that lion the mother came his mother came she was pregnant when they she wanted to jeez she give the birth and then died immediately and naturally this little car was slowly growing up in that heart and in the truth of the goats and he was bleeding because he heard all that he was eating the grasses just like the blue goats now another lion came and foul my god such a huge strong lion while eating the grouses and while all the food all around his food then he came and he stood up found on those the the goals he got all that lion dragging to the river and showed his face and Tony were a lion look at your face just like me and Soham and he were also there that Tama see that the moment Alliance saw his face then he rode and the whole jungle vibrated so that is the duty of the Guru only to announce that you are pure you are God bondo he parson about the bundle under window you were bound you're bound you're wrong what is that bondage so clear over here again yoga vasishta the yoga of our sister he is telling bundu he vaasana' Aburto moksha Xia Bossin of Shia the moment you you are not having any desire you are free when you are having the desire you were bound so this is the thing the Saddam distance stories went we'll be reading here and there it is there that like it or not it's of gold there here and there it will be 10 the pages of the gospel you can see that through the stories is giving us on the highest truth Shankara also in his money ratnamala he is asking the same question what is this bondage more harm gosh just energy mana so he more after destroying word the mind become completely free more delusion I am this person associated with this name and for that is more cool art enough Tantra also it says 3 party but the book sure momenti nilva matey been different war I'm quoting from different scripture see all they're telling the same truth in different language Shankara in one way and the Tantra pool are the country in done differently yoga Vasishta a different way for the same thing why that is the truth that is the practice if we are falling there we are free three per day but the move Shia mama t mama et need 180 knit community means nama mom I am NOT mama et and near vomiting he had the need mama doesn't mean that is a very hard type of person in government naturally they say no no mama et need mama no no mama me or mine et it is not mine I don't belong to this it doesn't belong to me this thought is called near mama and this belongs to me you are thinking only vapor deep under moksha mom ET but that agent - they say the junta means the the living being particularly the human being gentle mama ET this is me and mine that is binding and it moment e be mature T that is the thing when we practice the spiritual life we leave it everyone but at the same time completely detached from each and everyone that this is the monastic life sometimes some people they like to come and stay and to learn the monastic way what is the monastic way this we are together we love each other we are associated each and every one concerned about others but at the same time completely detached it's not so easy very very difficult why the moment you feel those people are with me they're associated with me they like me they listen to me they obey me immediately you think they are mine that sometimes from a Vivekananda say go and leave in those places where people don't know you they don't like you they will never look at you at there only you feel that you were all alone and except God there is no one else instead of depending on others they will depend on God so in the Kulin of Tantra and Raghavan see Ramakrishna also said that say anything he said why this person he said the Mukherjee brothers the junior brother he said are we are in changed what if the legs are chained the important thing is the mind bondage ease of the mind and freedom also ease of mind this is the greatest truth one should understand in spiritual life in spiritual practice otherwise we think one plus one equal to two and if I take the name 108 times and then God is supposed to come someone is regularly asking me when I am going to realize God but I am taking the name of God so many thousand times when I am going to realize God now I am NOT the God how can I answer you so this is a completely different whether the God will appear or not we do not know why because it is very circle if you are having a little desire for the name fame and anything of this world no channels because this world God has created again this world is the bondage if you love this world anything of this world then you cannot love God so it says in this way and Raghavan cinema Krishna is telling but that gentleman is telling but the mind is not under my control another question and very good question we always say like that mine is not under my control what to do then Sadam Oh Krishna is telling how is that this is the uniqueness of the round Krishna he will never discourage and all the time he will encourage you how is that mind is not in your control there is such a thing as abhyasa yoga geometry using this world of biasa yoga you have to practice keep up the practice is it not a wonderful thing to learn from gospel these are the very very practical way when you go to a spiritual person when you go to a guru what we ask these are the questions and we listen from the mouth of the directly from Bergman's ramakrishna the source that means this is the Veda this is the truth this is the knowledge and this we should practice without giving up oh oh no I will never get liberation what we should do practice and what we should practice whatever the Guru has asked us to do that much that sometimes I always say though sometimes I can't follow but they always say forty hours in a day practice spirituality complete what is the spirituality the four hours you should read the holy books and take the holy name of God and when we are taking the name of God you should go on also remembering the wonderful qualities of our valence Adama Krishna Asli Rama Chandra our Shri Krishna our model car Kali whatever the Shiva whoever may be your chosen deity you must remember that quality of that and for the Raghavan see Ramakrishna see a broad-minded person so if ramakrishna mission are the followers of the ramakrishna mission talk about the narrowly narrowness below he couldn't understand serum additional though he is taking the name of God the same God but couldn't understand the quality of God nah guna griten surround his name is Bengal is telling Nam the holy name goon are the qualities and guilt Anand what is the quality ceramic richness quality this catholicity this broadness this acceptance of all paths and this wonderful faith God is there and one can seek God one can talk to God one can be with God just by following a few things what is that complete faith in the existence of God and like a child depending on God or God please come please come please come so this he is telling obviously Yoga keep up the practice you will find that your mind will flow and whatever direction you need it the great yogi that Ramakrishna was in one book I was reading but sometimes you know that the people who lived with ceramic isne so they have all the their memoirs are there when see Ramakrishna is to meditate sometimes people could see that Kula Kundalini that as risin and it has become so straight as if they could feel in the bear body is sitting they could see they could feel that something very strained it has gone up to his eight the Kula Kundalini stay the ceramic is not a yogi he is to forget his body he is to forget all the the surroundings ordinary people do not understand anything of it they never followed that they write one or two books and they become famous they go on selling on those books and somehow they'll be signing on that I am the writer you know I am the writer please purchase please purchase these people are assessing slum Krishna think about if see Ramakrishna wanted at the Sri Krishna wanted a Sri Rama wanted they could become the king of the whole world but instead of understanding those things they are going on taking some of the very ordinary things which he was telling hitch which he was practicing only to bring down his mind for the sake of the others but the development of the others with the help of the others they couldn't understand that why this is the mistake this is the mistake nama guna Keerthana is not only the guna guilt Donna that we should create joy and happiness and faith we must have to go on repeating my master will like this I should also become like that you know as the all is the child that young people their hero is their father whatever the father the way he does they will always try to follow that sometimes a young people and the father is having the saving and he is using the form though they are small not grown up no beer but still with the father is not there they will use that form and apply on their face and pretending that he is his father like that in a spiritual life also we should always try to follow the Amish now the kindness Ness the simplicity the faith and that openly he's crying for God Oh God another day has passed when I'm going to see you God another day has has been- from my life so that is the ceramic dish 'no of biasa yoga everyday every moment when we are going on praying praying praying and try to follow that blessedness is surely going to come having anything to ask surround each task in death gachami the gachami who was visiting a nasty no sir i am satisfied that have seen you and have been listening to the words go and visit the temple some tissue is asking him goswami very humbly won't you please sing something about Sri Chaitanya he's a Goswami Christian maybe is the follower of the Vaishnava path and he is asking about that the master immediately singer sang sang a song why has my body turned so golden about the chaitanya mahaprabhu see no ego at all when a person has come he is asking strongest 'no will you sing for me immediately the god himself okay he's singing that song so long he talked naturally we could feel that he was exhausted he was tired but still the bastami was thinking to this song if he can immediately he sang his song to satisfy his desire he sang that song and the bora gazes the Brindavan and tears stream it's a the beautiful song after singing the master rained on with the conversation the ceramic dish nahi knew that time is shot he wanted to give the message and he was trying to reach out to those people who were truly genuine but now the people who are coming to him was already having some color some wish neighbours some grandmas some chapters and all these people so to make they're minding in his own ship and form he prayed to the divine mother mother sent me someone whom I can give the ship otherwise these people are coming listening to me but they are not following the cinema Krishna is praying oh where you are please come I like to give my treasure to you just to stand on the rooftop looking at Calcutta I used to give that call come come I like to be able to do and what he gave the wonderful treasure of true spiritual life true spiritual teaching so he is think telling in this way here here means in the in the referring to himself people of all snakes come which naver's Schachter's then Carta Raja with aunties and also the members of the modern Brahmo Samaj he is telling all the sixes to come to see Ramakrishna one finds here all ideas and attitude it is by the will of God that different religions and opinions have come into existence this line we should remember one fine this is them it is by the will of God it is by the will of God that different religions and opinions have come into existence God gives to different people what they can digest so we cannot criticize anyone whoever in whatever way they are following all are leading to the God in their own way why we should have to criticize them the some of the people who are very good players when you see the young people trying to kick the football a football player the sometimes we see their the young boy trying to kick the ball and he is missing the ball there's a big ball but still he is missing again and again and sometimes falling down does it mean that you won't learn we don't criticize we appreciate him Gabriel so that is the wisdom business teaching those who like to follow the ramakrishna must have a heart like the sky because it is that ancient religion which is praying for each and every one it is accepting everyone and that is hinduism and cinema krishna is the embodiment a pure true hinduism thank you friends we will continue in our next lecture please repeat after me need and general media on the new bomb but Don come for dieter become brave ish of authorities but a me shemitah Tom Ramakrishna cheetah thought oh my Shanti Shanti Shanti honey he'll that's earth Sri Ramakrishna our eponymous too
