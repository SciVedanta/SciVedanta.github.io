[232: Panchama Veda 232 : Nature Of The Worldly Person](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAP43mY-a8c)

good evening dear devotees and friends now today let us begin with this sloka as usual today's ministry will be discussing about the pentium of veda the gospel of the ram krishna and let us begin with decent purse table Okutama rhythm topped ji venom kobe be rewritten Calma sharp 'him 7 among Ghulam srimad Artem booby green and de buri dodging aha now today the it was the October 11th October Saturday 1884 at Dakshin Isha master masha is recording sri ramakrishna lay on the small couch in his room at the shisha temple garden it was about 2:00 in the afternoon aim and Priya Mukherjee were sitting on the floor aim had left his school at 1 o'clock and had just arrived at X nature the master was telling anecdotes about the calculating nature of wealthy Judah Malik master once I went to Judah Malik house he asked the right away how much is the car garage higher he was a rich man but even then he was asking this how much he has to pay but usually the holy people the monks win the visit some devotees house householders players they are supposed to pay so Judah Malik was supposed to pay not much money if you for things but even then he was asking ceramic is not didn't like it and he noticed it and he mentioning it someone told him it was three rupees and to Ana's then he questioned me about it was because someone is telling he's not believing he's asking this question directly to see Ramakrishna is it true like that next one of his people secretly asked the coachman who said it was three rupees and foreigners all laughed at that he ran to us and said how much did you say the courage higher was so he's say Ramakrishna is describing the nature of Judah Mali was a landlord a rich person and he was so miserly even to pay that small little sum in ceramic Krishna criticizing user Malik now this is the question naturally people may ask they the holy person is not supposed to criticize others and that too before others in a person and before others but Saddam Christian is doing easy now let us continue and then we will answer this question a broker was present he said to Jerusalem Krishna describing a broker was present he said to Jeru there is a plot of land at badger for sale will you buy it jadoo rocks the price and the broker told him jadoo said won't he give it for less i said to jerusalem krishna immediately understood that he is not going to purchase is simply going on questioning and like that and i said to you do come come you are not going to buy the land you were only bargaining isn't that so he turned to me and laughed the character of a worldly person see ramakrishna is mentioning worldly person so this is really really very very interesting a person like ceramic is a man likes the Ramakrishna God himself now he's exposing Judah Malik whom we used to visit and he is exposing his behavior character though he was so rich but he was miserly way he was behaving and only to pay some three rupees or so he was asking three people to get to know the actual Fripp price how much how much was the fear is still Mukesh not going to get some little more money from him but still the person was like that why that is the nature of the worldly man's ramakrishna stealing giving this example of juda Malik he is telling that is the nature of the worldly man he wants people to come to him that spreads his name in the market that is the worldly man now the question shall a holy person criticize another man may be worldly before others no but see Ramakrishna here is given an example of the worldly person why because others will be cautious and same thing we find in the sixteenth chapter of the bhagavad-gita sixteen chapter of the bhagavad-gita only first three verses it goes on telling about the 26 good qualities 26 divine qualities but from the fourth onwards it goes on telling about the quality of the our Sarika are the worldly people now let me quote from here the very first verse the fourth verse why the God is mentioning about it and there he is mentioning to Arjuna you have heard much about the good people you should listen about the badly people that the a Surya Jana are Sadiq people why then you will know that these are the bad qualities and you should shun those those who are trying to develop the spirituality those who are trying to go towards God they should know both good and bad and bad thing they should shun they should not do and the good thing they should adopt and what are the bad things here in the fourth verse of the sixteenth chapter and the Lord Krishna is mentioning dumbo hypocrisy the very first hypocrisy now compared to Judah Malik Judah Malik is not going to purchase any plot of land but he is behaving in such a way that he may purchase salam o krishna knew very well that Judah Malik is not going to purchase but still he is having the conversation with the broker Judah manly having the conversation with the broker and he's asking is he going to list the price Sadam Krishna never liked it Shami Vivekananda also said I can stand everything but he poked Chrissy you are thinking in a sip or something in one way and he were expressing in a different way you are living a different life but showing the people in the different way that's called hypocrisy that that is called dumb oh the first word that the Lord Krishna in the bhagavad-gita is mentioning the this is the quality of the arsenic a person devilish different people first is hypocrisy second is darpa arrogance they will never listen to others we know the arrogance even they know that they are wrong they will never say sorry they never say oh yeah I'm made a mistake let me correct it no you do never arrogance the friends those who are trying to realize God those who are trying to develop the spiritual life we should shun these bad qualities that is why in the bhagavad-gita from the fourth verse 224 pearls 16 chapter we read that Krishna is going on telling and different way to impress Arjuna and through or Juna the prosperity all people that you should not behave like this Dumbo hypocrisy darpa arrogance or vimana self-importance we know the ego a vimana each and every moment they are thinking I am someone I am somebody and everywhere his body language will prove that he wants the attention he wants the appreciation to like this he or she both so all these days all the time will learn all the good qualities now here you see see Ramakrishna is also mentioning and Sri Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita very clearly mentioned about it growth her anger paru ksham harshness they can't see anything softly the wind they are saying something to some people they use some type of words so harsh so that that one he is addressing should Bihar that is the characteristics of a devilish person worldly person and salam krishna never could accept those people here he is mentioning about Judah Malik butchered them only had other good qualities ceramic is nice to visit him and he was trying to mold him that's why very frankly he said say you are not going to purchase come come you are not going to buy the land or you were only bargaining isn't that so you do only laughed and then the diamond league is behaving like that why because Judah Malik is the worldly type of person and majority of the people we come across they are like that let me tell you about these world people sometimes some people used to come to haka bands Ramakrishna they wherever they stood in that room at Dakshina sure when the lefts Ramakrishna stoop or Ganga water on that particular place why because the moment that person come he come with him bring with him all the bad ideas so that's why it is better to shun them to avoid their company we were reading about the holy company the other day we were discussing about the holy company in the bhagavatam Sri Krishna is telling the easiest way to realize God how to realize God trusting you should have the conception of God and you should have the desire to realize that particular principle and it is easy to have that in the good company holy company that we discussed in last Sunday and here he says bad company and that we should not do we should shun the dumbo darpa vimana cruda bah russia harshness and of jeonnam ignorance you don't know anything about God they don't like to believe about the spiritual life nothing they always smile about it and the krishna is about it and for them only the body we will come to that in the seventh verse of the sixteenth chapter I am NOT going on describing all the verses seventh verse it says these worldly persons do not know what to do and what not to do that the confused type of people now show Chum not which are charter now septum they should be dirty now so Chum neither the a priority what is the purity purity is unselfishness they don't air at all they're fully selfish people now show Chum now a pitcher are chera they don't have any good conduct they don't like to do anything without their interest even if they give some $10 to someone they want the result at the back of it in return they want the result I'm giving you this you must get give me this back the one person he told someone requested is a rich man that oh why don't you help the sharmaji in the vedanta society he told what in return what I am going to get I don't know whether the God's blessings will come or not until I am sure that I am going to get something against my donation I am NOT going to keep the donation then he donated he actually did something and went into jail afterwards but any that is a different issue they're different different story so this is the way the people dis called worldly people so we should have to avoid them neither purity nor good conduct nor truth are found in them the sometimes Ramakrishna says worldly people worldly people the householders they say oh we are all worldly people you are not you are coming to attain these classes you were reading the holy books you are doing as best as possible at you as per your capacity to help the others how can you be worldly people you are not and/or Jinnah was also having the same doubt the moment the Sri Krishna mentioned eight the Arjuna was having the doubt oh I am also a householder I did also something the Krishna said no you are not the worldly person listen to this worldly person and what do I do one Li people have only people don't have the faith in God they believe that this world created out of last comma he to come the God has created this world no they don't believe it the comma had to come because of the last through last last is the cause is in the eighth verse of the sixteenth chapter I just like to remind you friends evolutionist of 19th century Europe there also witnessed disturb a strong movement based on perpetuation of various species by natural and artificial selection for sexual conduct so that was the basis and that was a great movement and you will wonder in India at the time of Duryodhana when huge udon was ruling a similar philosophy it was there it is said that to dilute the ferocious people assurance the gods teacher British potty formed this philosophy and much later charvaka published it in bridges p'tee some eater that was almost at the time of Duryodhana or something syan Madhava mentioned a portion of it in his survey darshan Assam graha it begins with two lines I was just caught almost many people they know about it char Bob darshan this is known as it's called Jabba jibon tsuki jibon now Asti me guru Gocha raha Rashmi Bhuta shuddhi last year Panera hominem kuta etc it's a long way it goes on enjoy as long as you leave no one knows what happens after death when the body is burnt to ashes how the one can come back to that how the life can come back so that was the idea and some people used to follow that in the 12 verse of the 16 chapter the bhagavad-gita I will conclude by saying these are partially shattered but da who who can be called as a worldly person desire desire and desire desire asha partial schastye but I have seen some people there are almost one that there one can say they're almost in the grave but even they are going on thinking they can't moved a lot of things happen to there but still that thinking will survive and will do these and we'll do that a lot of money but can't share it can't think of donating it for the betterment of others there are many good people they aren't so much and they give also back to the society they are not worldly people they have the capacity to earn and they have the heart to give back to the society that is a different class and one must do that Raghavan see Ramakrishna appreciate that you must do that but these type of people they have the desires chattery bata bound by hundreds of hopes because of last and anger these are the two comma crew the last and anger Asha partially shattered but da gama crew the Parana the desire and clothed anger what is the desire I should be remembered by people they pay a lot of money you know and I know some people they pay a lot of money only to get a picture with some famous person sometimes a very famous cinema artist a movie hero they will go pay and then just stand by his side and take a photo they will hang it and they will boast about it can you imagine they'll pay for that Asha Asha Asha tales but sometimes to attain some of the functions programmes where all the so-called high and powerful are assembling to get a chance to go over there they will pay a lot of money but not the fur thing to help a poor never so they only want their desire should be satisfied I was in that I was in that Asha a partial shotty but karma crude piranha hunting camo Garthim on jnana in artisan jae-yong look at it Shri Krishna Bhagwan he is telling the whole day ardan the money by unjust way they go on accumulating the world why comma Bogart am on naina on naina and just to be utter the world money Sanchi on the collect that is the the call worldly people divine people worldly people or is the difference karma you have the desire to enjoy this world and that desire is so much so you don't feel even pain when the people are dying no they have lot but they don't like to share but they think that they will take that money are even after death that's why they are ignorant the Lord said they're ignorant Asha Asha Asha T beta gamma growth pariah na ha hunty gamma go Garthim on naina artisan Gian bound by hundreds of hooves because of last and anger destroyed to secure by unjust means as much money as possible for sensual enjoyment this is called or destroyed Raghavan see ramakrishna's eight worldly people this worldly people one should avoid otherwise it is very difficult to go towards the God because God is completely different just opposite Judy wing to others house now he's again he is telling how the behave as I was telling if a company of a person or some people that gives him benefit he's so eager to do that Jordan went to others house we know other those who are reading the biography of the Ramakrishna you know order he was a very famous person in those days in Calcutta good Judah was very happy and all there was a government official I told him it had made other very happy you do went to other ceramic Krishna was also there now ceramic now when he told other was happy that you do visited look at his that expression his feeling he said what what was he's really happy so this is that what we see also in our life also so many people they'll be behaving like that if order is happy means Jojo is thinking is a very high official magistrate so I can have some benefit from me that is the calculation not that the other was a because the other was the good person because other was a very close devotee of sri ramakrishna so I am going no not like that his main idea other is a powerful person he has the government power so naturally administer the power so I may get some benefit if I go to him and now when salam o krishna say other was happy he is also so he get to know what what was it really happy a certain malik came to jerusalem and deceitful look at it what the company of the bad people worldly people deceitful labour person i saw it in his eyes ramakrishna you observed it in his eyes i looked at him and said it isn't good to be clever the crow is very clever but it eats others filth I could tell he was badly off judas mother was amazed and said to me how do you know he hadn't a penny I saw it from his appearance so the people the company a man is known by his company does the English proverb a man is known by his company if the bad type of people are around know it for sure something wrong with you and if you feel later in the company of the bad people wrong with you so one must be very very careful in choosing the frames even among the relatives one must be very careful we know we always give from the the references and example from the Mahabharata the Mahabharata great character in Bhishma he was so holy you're so great but because he taught the whatever the promise that he has made you to stick to it even though other people are suffering for that ye I should not break my promise that was his wrong decision so he supported Duryodhana and when he was citing the Duryodhana he was not appreciating to jude honest decisions but still he was quietly supporting him and in the great war he was in the camp of Duryodhana and what Krishna say to Arjuna now he is ready to die Bhishma was protected by the divine power but because he was supporting the wrong cause of the Duryodhana but that way he lost all his merits and when the Arjuna started shooting the arrows they all straight went to his body so sometimes friends what I feel this is my personal feeling we are good people we are trying to realize God we're trying to do something good in or whatever way as best as possible or sometimes we make mistakes we know why the modern times whether you like it or not he will receive so many messages from so many directions unknown people sending you something and there you feel oh this is the truth this is happening so and then they will mention share it with others you share it without knowing whether it is really good or not whether it is false or truth we share it what happened you know if that is untruth if that is going to harm somebody's a character or that what is a suppose a person is very famous and against him something wrong is going on in the at the in the article whatsapp and all that and I am also sharing that to my friends I am committing scene do unknown I don't know but still I am committing scene so I feel it is better if we are trying to be holy religious is better to shun those things if it comes you read and say okay someone is thinking in this way it may be it may not be otherwise we are actually supporting some worldly people and seen that they're committing will also come to us that's why I was giving so much of importance when the only word that the worldliness the nature of the worldly people we should be aware about it and then we should not follow that in our own life and if we find the same type of thing in somebody's character we should try to avoid that is the main teaching narayan entered the room and sat on the floor master to priya not well your hoodie is a fine young man priya not what is so fine about him of course he's a childlike nature najran he that it goes master is very happy do you know what him said he said to Bob Arum God alone is real or all else is usually all laughed oh no he said it sincerely again he told me you take me to his house and saying kitten but he didn't do he didn't do it I understand that he said later on what will people say if I sing with drums and cymbals she was afraid that people might think he was crazy Sudama krishna was telling that luck ja sometimes it's called one of the austere parsha a type of features that binds a person one is larger the Lutcher means I feel hesitant to be exposed before others in the name of God this gentleman about Holmes Ramakrishna is mentioning he invited sri ramakrishna cyc la macchina is mentioning we should not misunderstand over here he's not criticising he's giving the example from his daily life from the people who are all around him so what type of mistakes they are doing and not only he is saying that so that that person will rectify himself about whom he said and when the people who are around they will also understand oh no we should not do like this that is the main idea and he's telling that Saddam Oh Krishna is telling that that gentleman invited him and he thought that he will go see Rama Krishna will go and as per the system in those days he will organise a kitten the people will come they will sing they will dance Ram Krishna stool like that but then afterwards he didn't do that he didn't organize that why afraid that what the people his friends his relatives will say we are afraid to do something good fearing what people will think about me this is not good the wind you are thinking that you are on the right track never ever bother about it what the other people are going to tell what the relatives will say what the friends will say no I know for myself that this is the best and I must do it so that way we should go what people will say if I sing with the drums and cymbals he's thinking in that way honey butter has fallen into the clutches of the ladies of the gauche Paris 8 he cannot get rid of her Salameh krishna mentioning about another young devotee they used to go to coach para that there's a Carta Bahji a group of people and that mostly that we dues where they will go this type of people is to ask them to go over there and one gentleman will be there he is the Carta the master it's supposed to be the God is the master but as a representative of God that person and these young widows it was a not good Fame people is to criticize they have the doubts about their activities that that was the situation hurry brother though huge to come to cinema Krishna instead of understanding the pure religion is to go over there he was attracted by a lady and ceramic richness said he won't be able to proceed in the spiritual life he's mentioning all the negative that the bhagavad-gita we just read in the sixteenth chapter Bhagwan Shree Krishna almost 24 verses he has dedicated to inform the devotees that these are the things one should be careful of very worldly things and he has ceramic richness mentioning about that you do Malik and you do only as a one character and secondly all this type of people are coming Harry Potter has fallen into the clutches of the oh man of the gosh para he cannot get rid of har he says that she takes him on her lap and feeds him a great minute act like this is going on you see you should keep far away from these then you may realize god this is very clear you should keep far away from these what are these th EAC not this these what at these that means their behavior like our Judah Malik and also the person the him who invited at the same time he felt shy the what the his relatives and friends will say so he cancelled that invitation and another Ori pada he is visiting in a wrong direction all these things so one must be careful see Ramakrishna is the teacher he is the master is the Guru the it is the duty of the Guru the preceptor to guide the devotees in the proper channel so he is mentioning you see you should keep far away from these then you may realize god it is extremely harmful to have much to do with this last and gold who and only by being extremely careful one can preserve one's love for God the love of God particularly he was addressing the male devotees so he was mentioning about opposite sex so be very very careful he was telling otherwise your mind will go and in legal different type of relations will develop you won't be able to come from there and your mind will be wasted into the force and the energy will be completely wasted in all the starts the one should be very careful only by being extremely careful about then one preserve one's love of God one day Baba not Rakhal and some other youngsters had cooked their own mill in the temple garden they were sitting at their mill when a bowel arrived bowel a type of people they go on singing and that is a very special group the bow I will bowel the beige these are they are also seeking God but they always go on singing about the body and then transcend from the body to the spirituality they say path of religion we can say I will bowel their Beach different small small clans the bowel arrived sat down with them and said he wanted to eat with them look at it that man is also otherwise the people don't don't know they will think he is also religious man he is also travelling here and there and singing the God's name like that but cinema Krishnan knew what is there in the mind of the people I said that there was not enough food if anything was left it would be kept for him he became angry and left on the bjo day a man allows anyone and everyone to feed him with his own hand it is not good so this page ceramic is not giving us the cautions the in different girls different type of so-called religious people they moving around but the true religious people should be careful about them too because they are in reality not what they are showing off so this apakah see one should avoid we have to understand this this is a very very slippery path if you say what that man is bad and I'm not going to eat with him or be so naturally people will think what is this but at the same time you have to be cautious that company of the worldly people will influence will come on you and once again I like to tell our devotees though they're householders they're really good people they're really good people many many of them our devotees means not only the followers of Saddam Oh Krishna philosophy but also many other people have seen so devoted to God and they are very clean minded but in the name of religion not only in Hinduism in all religions all sexes there will be people who are not only deceiving the others also they're inspiring others to follow the wrong path that's why see Ramakrishna said the young disciples of cinema Krishna they had cooked the food and then they offered it to the Lord the God and then they sat for the Prashad that environment the pure environment now this man who is coming and sitting eating with them his very presence will make the bad impact on these young minds that's why one person should be very careful he will wonder sometimes we may come across but many of you perhaps read see ramakrishna was inquiring from master Marche and master ma she was telling I visit that group I visit that society I visit these people after all listenings Ramakrishna said don't go to anyone X you only come to me the when we listen to these when you read these we think Oh a person likes Ramakrishna he is also so narrow-minded he is asking only to come to him another which is not the question to him He is God it doesn't matter but the person who is really sincere if he is going to different people different places different teachings he'll be confused his energy will be completely destroyed that's why see ramakrishna wanted to guide him in the pure path and path of sacrifice and love path of unselfishness so he told don't go to all those places come to only to me so this we should understand in a very positive way sadhana krishna is guiding you must be extremely careful and about the Gopala all this is mentioning there is a developed dispassion from early youth those who roam about yearning for God from boyhood those who diffuse all worldly life belong a different class that this three stages he is telling those who develop this passion for the early youth from the early youth dispassion from the early youth and second this is wrong about yearning for God from boyhood that means in the past life they have done a lot of tapas shop that's why in this life when they are very young the desire to realize God strong the desire to follow the path of religion sir it comes mr. Ramakrishna still in boyhood our early youth and those who refuse all worldly life all worldly life belong to a different class they belong to an unsullied aristocracy if they develop true renunciation they keep themselves at least fifty cubits away from the ladies list their spiritual mood should be destroyed he's talking to the boys and the mill so he is mentioning like that once filling into the clutches they they no longer remain in on the level of the aristocracy and so light aristocracy so that is the way one should see Ramakrishna when talking to the mill he will say like this talking to the women you would say like that because if you are in the household it is okay that is the another life if you like to become a monk celibacy is the first thing so obviously you have to avoid and that is the greatest difficulty because that emotion is so strong one have to have the power within himself and the blessings from God otherwise is very difficult how can a man conquer passion he should assume the attitude of a woman he is telling a man conquering the passion assumed the attitude of the oh man I spend many days as the handmaid of God I dressed myself in the women's clothes put on the jewelry's and covered the upper part of my body with a scarf just like a woman so one does a bollock Ramachari the that he was a great soul and there's a big followers of the balrog Ramachari he used to have that type of dresses it's very difficult is a very different type so we belongs to the pedantic monk ours is a different way but sure see Ramakrishna is telling for other people those who are already there they if they like to have this this thing it is better to impose this idea that I am a completely different personality so the desire will go a bit otherwise how could I have kept my wife with me for eight months both of us behaved as if we wear The Handmaid's of the Divine Mother I cannot speak of myself as a man one day I was in the static mood my wife asked me how do you regard me as the blissful mother I said he was referring about Marshall a domani day be the Marshall Adamo need a V then extra the ceramic isne do you think that I'm your wife that that was the question how do you regard me as Ramakrishna's answer was blissful mother do you know the significance of the Shiva emblem it is the worship of the symbols of the fatherhood and the motherhood the devotee worshipping the image pray O Lord please grant that I may not be born into this world again that I may not have to pass again through mother's womb so this is I don't like to be born once again I like to be get liberation the desire for enjoyment where from it comes from Maya what is Maya delusion where from the delusion comes from the God's power so obviously ultimately goes to God who is creating this delusion now again God is creating the holy people and through the holy people presenting the holy people before us he is inspiring us to follow that path it's a game we can say if you believe in the devil Leela this is just like that divine Leela here's a game it's a play whatever it may be now that we have come to this those who are reading and listening the gospel of ceramic Krishna every page almost every sentence it goes on giving us the guidance how to overcome what passion this is the passion that we have to overcome and what what is this passion enjoyment of this body and the mind and the worldly objects and how to overcome that understanding that these are all very very temporary and once you step into that it will be very difficult so it is better that when you are accepting the spiritual life you should be careful if you are already a householder you have the responsibility see ramakrishna says after one or two children you should leave like brother and sister not as a husband wife you should be completely a different you are liking each other supporting each other but at the same time no carnal desire so this is the way one should develop the spiritual life and in result what you will get joy a wonderful joy it is only the joy that people are doing all this only the happiness but this happiness it comes from the purity and the again the purity means associated with God and God is nothing but the embodiment of bliss joy happiness peace the our goal is to go to that and the path should be as indicated by Raghavan Serrano Krishna a tutor of the Tiggers entered the room with some boys of the family cinema Krishna continued talking a tutor of the teager's means Taku Parivaar the ribbond on article is the famous and they were a very well known family they were real rich educated very cultured people so a group of young boys FF on the family they have come along with a teacher to visit dictionary they entered into the Ramkrishna room salon krishnan is continuing his conversation with the devotees sri krishna has a peacock feather on his crest the feather beers the sign and that the significance of this is that krishna carries prakruti the prakruti at the female principal on his head when krishna joined the circle of the gopis to dance with them he appeared there as a oh man the Krishna he is mixing with the ladies the Gopi and other Krishna's life those who have read they know so that they were having and Krishna transform himself completely and Saddam Krishna is mentioning that that the both are same when we see a man and oh man the difference there is the mystic shiva and shakti the Sheba is auspiciousness and the shifty the power of the auspiciousness and in that power of the speciousness two things are there one the power to bind another to give the liberation the both are there and this power belongs to the God conception has been given in this way as the father and the mother a male and the female but in reality it is the same so that is the Gopi that is why you see him wearing women's a prayer in the company of the gopis it is quite different when one reaches perfection where I am reading from the another's as tangi another para after the realization of God there is not much for a man to fear he has become a great extent secure after the realization of God the he is taking a step by step first the characteristics of the worldly people and these worldly people they begin with the you know hypocrisy what they are not they like to behave in that way they like to project themselves in that way at the back of that characteristics behavior the eagerness to get the name and fame and if that is not they are getting the anger so all this dumbo that Bheema honest to grow the power of shimmy betcha so naturally when they are angry they speak harsh words hurting others this goes on goes on binding what at the back of that why he's being like that desire and what is the desire to enjoy this worldly life and what is this world is nothing but the power of God manifested in that way how to go beyond that now cinema Krishna is taking us to that he said there are two attractions the kernel pleasure and divine pleasure and the physical pleasure and spiritual pleasure some people from the beginning of their life they want to go to a spiritual pleasure and they should avoid the main object in the world that is the opposite attraction so that is the idea that's why he again and again mentioning and all male folks are sitting so here mentioning like that so if we go just opposite to that their mind become pure is it thin when you realize God there is no difference after the realization of God means you know the truth you know that there is no difference between a man and woman the the worldliness and the spirituality is all nothing but the God in different form it is quite different when one reaches perfection after the realization of God there is not much for a man to fear he has become to a great extent secure the important thing is for a man somehow to climb to the roof after that he can even dance there but he cannot dance on the steps when we are practicing spirituality the one should be very very careful and he should go straight to God should not look for name fame and physical comfort that's why the brahma cherien's the practice austerity they will be eating only once a day and they won't take the much garments lying on the hard bed on the floor mainly so like this why they do that because any time mind may go to the comfort to the enjoyment the physical thing so they are very very careful martial Adamo need a B of course she said if you go on repeating the holy name of God mantra japa as maximum as possible maybe 10,000 15,000 times dad mantra that pure name of God will purify your heart and the desire for the kernel joy pleasure won't be there will be free from that the easiest way to go on repeating the name of God the Chapa and that when you are doing it automatically your mind will be purified and when the mind is purified you're face to face with God and what is God unselfishness and love you feel for each
