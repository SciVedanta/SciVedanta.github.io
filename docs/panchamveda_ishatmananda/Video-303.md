[304. Panchama Veda (304) - “God Cannot Be Realized Unless The Mind Is Free From Lust And Gold.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GN6p9AhXhSU)

namaskar dear devotees and friends uh this wednesday evening we'll be reading from the gospel of bhagavatam krishna panchama veda and this will be our last discussion for this session 2021 and after two months january and february from march onwards again we will start reading now let us begin as usually kobe this is the that famous verse from the gopi gita and it says that the nectar of words katam amrit that is the nectar and katha that the words why it is amrit because after listening to this the human mind start thinking then what is truly good for them and slowly slowly they understand the futility of this exte the world that we see around us so let us begin from the page 738 of the gospel of krishna it was april 6 1885 sri ramakrishna was on his way in a carriage to debendra's house in nimu gosvami lane the younger norin aim and one or two other devotees were with him the master felt great yearning for purna he began to talk of the young disciples so those who know the biography of bhagavad-gita he passed away in 1886. and 1885 almost say not even one year he is thinking about the young people why that will come to know because he wanted to give that the spirituality to these minds he says to master to him the master masha a great soul he is referring about the purna how could he make me do japa for his welfare but puno doesn't know anything about it the last in the reading we mentioned about all this sudama krishna himself is praying to god the god is praying to god the god in the human form is praying to that divine now aim and the other devotees were amazed at these words the master it would have been nice if you had brought him here with you today why didn't you so the master mashay was explaining it would have been nice and seeing the young noreen laugh the master and the other devotees laughed too the master said to him laughing and pointing to naren look at him look how naive he looks when he laughs as if he knew nothing he never thinks of these three things now these are the very important words why he likes the young people these are the three things land wife and money in hindi they say jamin juru chadi chandi means the money of the gold now germain the land jeru the wife and the money these three things are the cause of all trouble and these not only the fighting and all other problem comes from these three this three binds the human mind to this worldly life so he is stilling so god cannot be realized until the mind is totally free from the last and cold so this is a statement complete and clear the god cannot be realized until the mind is totally free from lost and gold whoever claims that he has realized god and all this this we have to see whether these two things are there in his life last and the goal of the money and if these two things are there then it's for sure that he has not realized god maybe he has achieved something else but the realization of god is completely impossible it's not not many things that the bhagavatam krishna is mentioning is mentioning the two very important basic thing that we have to understand first is the carnal desire the last if it is there in the mind then there is no chance for god realization good life will be there one can live a very nice life but god realization is not possible why as again in hindi they very nicely put it jahakam means the god if you have the desire then you won't get the god calm desire tahani ram there is you cannot find the god jaharam tahani he come where there is god the one who has realized god there is no other desire because god is the complete fulfillment of the desire so this one thing we have to understand one gentleman wrote to me that more i am developing the spiritual life more i am becoming lonely because my relatives and their friends they are not liking so i am becoming lonely there is a good sign but at the same time you have to only you are becoming lonely you are segregating yourself but at the same time you have to develop love for god and the whole mind will be full with love and the worldly people those who are constantly thinking about this worldly prospect progress and all those things they can never think of god it is not possible that is like the light and the darkness but what we should do once we understand these and slowly slowly from that day onwards we should try to proceed towards god not that in one day we'll realize god but slowly slowly we should proceed in the vedanta they say the fast is the good desire what is the good desire i am going to realize myself i am going to realize god i am going to understand what is this true life so that is called shuba a pure holy icha desire so that is super each other the moment we take then bicharana do we go on discriminating the what is good and what is bad this world with all these things are they bad not apparent not apparently the people they have their different responsibilities nothing wrong in that but the god realization is completely different thing it has nothing to do with the success in the materialistic life nothing to do with that otherwise the great the million years and billion years they would have realized the god no there is nothing the god realization is the completely different thing and that gives a complete different type of satisfaction that you or we can never get from the worldly life so sirama krishna is mentioning why he likes the young people because their minds are still free from these two things lost and gold god cannot be realized until the mind is totally free from lost and gold the carriage proceed to the devendra's house once sri ramakrishna had said to devendra dakshinesha i have been thinking of visiting your house one day devendra had replied the same idea came to my mind today and i have come here to ask you that favor of you you must grace my house this sunday friends you may remember those who are following this the discussion regularly at the last week the last when we were reading on 22 december when you discussed the panchama veda we discussed on that the promise keeping the promise is religion i have given my word sirama krishna said and from there we discussed the bachan bada in hindi in indian language it says i have given the word i must have to keep it and we quote it from the ramayana from the upanishad and from the puranas the religion is to keep the world and who can keep the world very genuine person and that is religion and when we can do that that will give us the strength to restrain our control our saints organs and when we have the capacity to control our sense organs obviously we can be free from the two things the last and gold when we are living in this life we need food we need clothing we need a house we need everything but there is no attachment or hankering for those that is the main idea not that simply we have to go and kill ourselves because without those two the without money no one can survive this and without food we cannot and to get the food and other things we need the money that is not the question we should not misunderstand this wonderful teaching it is necessary but we should not anchor for that we should not think that is the only thing we need no that sirama krishna's idea then then he told bachchan here also we find he told devendra that i will visit he just expressed his wish and he is going to keep that he is going over there but he is concerned devendra was not a rich person when sudama krishna used to go to the rich people then naturally he used to invite others also to come over there knowing that they can afford it they're feeding the other people arranging for their uh seat and all those that is possible but the ordinary person but sudama krishna is also going to him because his mind was pure and he loved krishna the god but he's concerned when a person is going a holy person is going because he is not having his own income or money so naturally the person to whom he is visiting he is supposed to arrange his to and fro the money has to give and some people will accompany him so obviously you have to arrange for the food so salaam krishna is concerned and he said you have a small income don't invite many people the carriage higher will also run a big amount devendra had answered laughing now this is called devotee they love the master so obviously they don't bother about the money he said what if my income is small then he mentioned one can run into depth to eat barter he was mentioning that sometimes the people they quote this and to mention about the char baka philosophy that's a wonderful philosophy though it has been discarded by the philosophers and the followers of the spiritual life but that was a very popular philosophy still it is there the charabarka philosoph materialistic philosophy you know that when let us just to go about it a little about the charbakar philosophy the charu means the word charu means uh very attractive very beautiful that's called charu and beautiful because you need not to do anything just follow your mind all your passions all your desires all satisfy everything and then go away that's all the people they liked it and there was a philosopher and he uh there's a birdhuspati there's a name and the person in the mahabharata we find the name charabaka and there was another person whose name was charby maybe the same person and as because it is a knowledge the knowledge goes always credit to the brihaspati so brishpati is the guru of the gods so this people because it was a popular philosophy ordinary people they understand it just enjoy your life and then die you don't know whether again you will be born or not they don't believe in that some people are telling don't bother about that there is nothing as a heaven or hell this life is the main so enjoy and what should be the goal that in the char back of philosophy it says there was a teacher named charby and he developed this philosophy so it became the charabaka philosophy and if we break the word charobac or chaaru baka so it is a very attractive words so charu char back philosophy of course if you have to be a philosophy at darshan in india the darshan means you have to give the answer of the three things many of you know again and again i say those three things are who is the creator what is this creation and what is the relation between the creator and the creation here the char baka that you the the gentleman whose name was churby the philosopher he never believed in god and what he said there are four basic things are necessary to for the creation you know traditionally india the all the philosophy they accept the five basic thing that is shitty apotheoma these are the five things but the char back said no it is only four the shitty earth is okay then upper the water it is okay then the fire is also agni it is also an ear the bayou it is also okay but not the boma why bhuma because we don't know we don't have any idea about it we are just thinking about it the char baka accepted only the direct experience and neighbor other things you know the indian philosophy they say pramana pramana you have to prove whatever you say just you are telling no no that won't do you have to prove it and how we can prove so they say there are four types of proofs and some say the three so what are the four types prathaksha direct onumana inference upo mana the comparison and bach means those who have realized this when they say that we can accept that someone went to the himalaya and after that when he comes back and says imala is like these these this we can accept that someone went to the sea when he comes back from the sea and gives the description of the sea then we accept that that is called the one who has realized that word is called shabda that is also the proof but they said no only for that earth water fire and air then where from the consciousness came they give a wonderful example the when a tree is rotten you get the smell when the tree was surviving you never got the smell isn't it after it die and rotten then only you get the smell where from the smell came similarly when these four this earth water fire and air they get mixed up automatically consciousness is bought these four creates the consciousness and that consciousness also die when the body dies so this is called charvaka philosophy and it says from the when the body is dead and destroyed the consciousness also get destroyed what is the goal of the life and as we always say the goal of life is god realization or the atma-gyana understanding are realizing the consciousness of the brahman and different names but they said no only enjoyment the sugar when you are embracing each other you get a enjoyment of the feeling that is the goal when you are eating you get joy that is the goal that means the goal is nothing but the satisfaction of your body body and mind so dwihik sukha as they called the sukha the comfort or the enjoyment of the body that is the physical enjoyment is the goal of the charbaka char bhakta darshana they say it in this way and we will conclude na swargo the you know the many lines are there the slokas and by that way they are proving their philosophy it became one time it became very popular then slowly slowly people understood no it is not it cannot be accepted so they said no swagger there is no heaven no oppo burger no liberation why do you think about that or restraining your senses not eating this food not doing that thing controlling constant and doing the tapasha you know that austerity that you practice only to control why just enjoy whatever you like you do because there is no heaven you think of heaven it is only this life and there is no heaven at all no sargah no upper burger don't think about the liberation after the death finish there is no continuity after death there is no soul that it will travel to other places in the other region no there is no soul at all the soul the atma the consciousness it generates when these four are combined and when these four again they are separated you die and the consciousness that was there within you that also goes away so no parallelogy in the society there are four burners are there because according to the capacity they were allotted some of the work like the brahmana they are thinkers the shatria they are protectors and boys they are nourishers they will be developing the economy and sudras they are helpers so by this way these four they will be constantly that's the whole society will work in that way and asthma when you are a student from 6 to 16 years they were considered that their student life so that is different type of thing that you have to do your dharma your responsibility the different you only learn and that's all be humble you learn be attentive like that then after that whatever the knowledge you have acquired utilize that knowledge earn the money and enjoy your life that is called the the next the grahar stage the householder's life then afterwards retirement you go in a seclusion because your children are grown up they are also going out to earning and they're settling down you slowly slowly become lonely prepare yourself for the final thing because death is inevitable then don't go on crying or children are not coming so i used to look after them and now they are not coming to me don't cry of that prepare your mind and after the preparation that you know this is going to happen we have lost our parents and they lost their parents so it is going to happen this is a routine of the the life so accept that prepare your mind and detach yourself from all that judgment and then sannyasa when you detest your mind from all the attachments you are a sannyasi and that sannyasi that the samyak nyasa when you have given up there is no attachment that means there is no ego only thing remain is joy the peace the happiness the satisfaction so that is the four asrama for barna and poor astrama they say oh don't bother about all those you need not to bother because according to those things no result is coming out of that so that is called the charvak in brief they have a long big the philosophy and you know the philosophy means there will be attack on that and you have to refute so people will be there they will be asking questions you have to refute that you have to prove the why you are telling like that all those things are there so we are not going into details but here in brief this is the charabarka one the philosopher is cherby and he was promoted by one brashpati maybe the same person and the name is they are mentioned in the mahabharata that means it he was there it became a very popular and goal was only to enjoy the life in this life when the devindra mentioned about that sirama krishna became very amused and he became very happy and he started when devendra mentioned about that philosophy indicating bhagavan suramar krishna laughed and laughed for a long time because he enjoyed that but we know the sudama krishna he mentioned these that he is totally free from attachment of land wife and money and the three things that entangle one in worldliness the mind that dwells on these three cannot be fixed on god it is impossible so friends now that is the reason i always like to mention the gospel as the panchama veda that teaches us the spiritual knowledge gives us the spiritual knowledge and it is so simple way we get the complete idea if you want to realize god which god is nothing but love and unselfishness and god is eternal then one thing you must have to do that is withdrawing your attachment from this worldly life otherwise there is no way soon the carriage reached devendra's house srirama krishna said to him devendra don't make elaborate arrangements for my meal something very simple will do i am not very well today sirama krishna seated himself in the drawing room on the ground floor of devendra's house the devotee sat around him it was evening the room was well lighted the younger naren girish devendra akshay upendra and some other devotees were present so this was the the missionary work whenever bhagavan suramar krishna is going to some devotees house he is inviting other people also and or the devotee who is organizing that not that only sadama krishna will go and eat and then go away no not like that sometimes even today the devotees will be inviting the swamis the swami please come and have some food the swamis don't like to go for that the food is all right but along with the food they need to spread the philosophy the ideology so they want that the one who is inviting the swami also invite some of his friends and relatives and the neighbors so that they come together at least 15-20 people and then they will discuss but sometimes uh some of the devotees they think is a another social party social gathering they'll be coming all ladies will go to the kitchen and they will be talking over there as a hey why why that is not the purpose of inviting a swami bhagavan sirama krishna from there we have learned and that is the tradition of the ramakrishna mission whenever we go to somebody's house we always think that they there will be some sort of a religious discussions question answer so that the people get the benefit of the presence of the swami otherwise what the sudan krishna himself when he's going there not only for food he said arrange for the simple food and then he's meeting all these people and some of the names again and again coming and we know that regularly they are meeting like the master master and the girish ghosh why because they themselves were very much interested and every time they're listening the sadama krishna almost the same thing used to say but this to get the joy because doubts is very difficult to go away and all the attachments to the worldly things very very difficult to go away so the company of the holy person is the only remedy when a person is going and sitting near the com that holy person and listening to him again and again then pondering over those teachings and practicing those then slowly slowly it becomes the bondages become loosened otherwise is very difficult the he is mentioning as the master cast his glance on a young devotee his face beamed with joy pointing to the devotee sirama krishna said to the others young people they are not yet attached so the sudama krishna he knew that he is going to leave after one year he will give up his body his mission was to kindle the light of knowledge in the hearts of those who are truly free from these three things what are the three things these three he said land wife and money these three things when they are free from that these three things then they can dedicate or concentrate on the ideology and the philosophy or the goal of spiritual life so it is it becomes easy otherwise you know that in the beginning of the gospel of sirama krishna when the srama krishna made master maha srima he asked him are you married oh you are already married why then he explained i saw you and assalamu krishna could see the past life also so he saw him in the group of caitanya mahaprabhu already he was having the purity and he was thinking that he will be useful to spread the message now when he was married naturally as a married person you have your responsibility you have to maintain that and that is also as because you have given the world so that you have to maintain that too uh suramar krishna was talking about the younger people because they were not attracted to this he is totally when he saw a young boy sitting over there he is totally free from attachment of land wife and money these three things when they are not there then one can become completely free and dedicated and these three things that entangle one in worldly life the mind that dwells on these three cannot be fixed on god so this is very important he saw a vision too to the devotee tell us what did you see the devote devotee laughing i saw a heap of dung were seated on it and some sat at a distance master it was a vision of the plight of the worldly people who were forgetful of god way the he saw that the devotee the young boy he saw the dream there's someone sitting on the heap of a dong that means it is a worldly life so much of money so much of wealth so much of things but recently i was reading in the newspaper of the india one person i think some few millions of rupees are there he was hiding somewhere he is not utilizing that and he's himself for his own enjoyment no he cannot and then again he was not utilizing that for the betterment of others also then what is the use just he is thinking oh i have hidden so much of treasure look at it as i'm sitting on the dung and he's thinking i'm sitting on the gold heap of gold but only dung so that's when that young boy he saw that dream suramar krishna himself explaining he heard it before he wanted that the devotees also should hear it know it and when he explained because he was not understanding so he was laughing and saying i saw a heap of dung somewhere seated on it and some sat at a distance bhagavan himself is explaining it was a vision of the plight of the worldly people who are forgetful of god now so much of money i don't know how he earned whatever may be the way he earned if he had given it back to the society to the for the development of the poor section of the society or as a tax to the government because government needs the money to run the whole country so by that way he could be satisfied and also his honor could be intact and the society also would have said oh what a great personality he has but the rich people are so much attention to their properties to their wealth to their gold they will never share it and ultimately when they die they cannot take anything rather people would tell oh that person don't tell his name in the morning you are such a miserly man if you mention his name that the whole day will be bad for us look at it so by that way also we have to understand the attachment to the worldly things whatever is necessary for you keep it but excess it is of no use and it will bring the bad names and the permanently you will suffer the surama krishna is mentioning in that way and it shows that all these desires are disappearing from his mind when you see these worldly things like in that way it's a cow dung it has nothing in it i don't want the name fame physical comfort i don't want that that means you are giving away that and going towards god need one worry about anything if one's mind is detached from lost and gold how strange only after much meditation and japa could i get rid of these desires surama krishna himself is meant for himself he is mentioning that i had to practice lot of meditation and prayer and japa repeating the holy name of god that is called japa so he said that i had to do so much then only i could get rid of that because it is very natural and you have to go back you have to fight as swami vivekandar very nicely he mentioned how you have to fight with the nature the nature will try to pull you down to react but you have to control that no i am not going to do it i'm not going to listen to you i am the master i you should obey me the mind will always provoke go and react and say like this behave like this and naturally the other reaction will come again your mind is agitated by that way so much of time is unnecessarily lost so you have to control and calm your mind so this bhagava swami vivekananda also and yes ramakrishna is telling why this agitation comes from the desire and what is this desire these three things the land then the lady and the gold so these are the three things usually the human being are attracted he said why if it is opposite to the other sex so this is the way it goes one must be very very careful only after much meditation and japa could i get rid of these desires and how quickly he could banish them from his mind this is an is it an easy matter to get rid of lost i myself felt a queer sensation in my heart six months after i had begun my spiritual practice is really really very very difficult most of the people in the beginning of their spiritual journey they feel oh why it is happening so i think i won't be able to continue because i am so weak i'm always feeling like it is nothing like that is that is the only desire the last is the desire the terrible desire that is present eve even in an and and also in dinosaurs that is the main maya we have to overcome that the human mind should go on discussing within himself or herself and slowly slowly to overcome and in the beginning bhagavan sram krishna himself taught when that type of thought crosses your mind say loudly the name of god if necessary clap your hand and go and chanting the name of holy god then your mind will mind means thought that if you are forcing another thought then the thought that was tormenting your mind will go away and when it goes away again you are normal so that is the way again and again when you are refuting fighting against that thought which is dragging your mind down to the worldly things then slowly that thought will become weak and it will never be able to tempt your mind to disturb your mind so this is the way we have to understand mother if it comes to that i shall suddenly cut my throat with the knife srama krishna was saying to the divine mother if that is there in the mind of the sudama krishna that he himself is saying in that way then to control those things you can understand how difficult it is so only prayer prayer and prayer to the devotee if the mind is free from lost and gold then what else can obstruct a man realization of god is inevitable and that is the reason it is so difficult to go beyond this lost and gold that means desire and to fulfill the desired money it goes on increasing increasing and increasing this is the great problem and sometimes the we think that a time should come and we have to say enough not more than this and you have to pray to god otherwise oh i am helping the poor people we will be building the school we'll be building the hospital and we should do these and go on collecting fun even though the swamis and the they will be doing i have to start the astra here there everywhere of the world because i am going to save the humanity again another problem can we or anyone save the humanity no so as maximum possible for me that is sufficient why should i have to go to every corner of the world to start an asthma and then doing this or that when the god that's why swami vivekananda said i never plan i do my mother's work when the situation is like that okay do it and that's all and if it is successful that means god is with you if it is not that means god is and had different ideas so no problem so by that way one should be completely detached we can never ever do anything for this world because world will go in this way what we do by trying to do good to others we are actually helping our mind i am going to help the person know i am going to serve a living god who is before me as an uneducated person or alien person i must go and serve the living gods or goddesses i am thinking the karma yogi when the karma yogi is thinking in that way that means his mind is also becoming pure because he is not thinking that an worldly object oh if i go to those people serve them they will remember me they will keep my image over their photo over there publish about me discuss about me if the thoughts are like that then it is a bondage but the same market is a bondage but if you think no i am so blessed that i got the opportunity to serve the god when there is no work one will never feel frustrated you'll think okay the puja is over whatever i wanted to do i wanted to perform a ritualistic thing i have done it and with the living gods and goddesses it is over friends these are the things if we constantly think then only the detachment can come otherwise not so this is the main the topic that the ramakrishna today is teaching us to the devotee if the mind is free from lost and gold then what else can obstruct a man he enjoys then only the bliss of brahman he's not telling god he is telling the brahman the god is again the duality and if you go to god the vidantin they say there may be that you feel the god is loving narada so much and not to me in that way then god is showing his grace to so much to him and not to me again there will be pain in the mind whenever there is a duality always it will remain and when you feel that it is only one it is brahman the consciousness there is no two it is only me then there is no problem that's why he said it is brahman if we notice that bhagavan suramar krishna in the beginning of the gospel of sirama krishna he mentioned the goal of every human life is god ishar love manuscript in bengali he said god realization is the goal of every human life god realization then before he left this world on first january 1886 he said let you all be illumined that that consciousness should rise within you it's not god caitanya caitanya the consciousness the first january is coming after two three days and all over the world the followers of bhagavad-gita the devotees will be observing the kalpataru day that is a very famous kalpataru day we will also perform over here and you know that this time we cannot invite the people in person so there will be a small puja and meditation at the three o'clock uh that is the time when bhagavan sirama krishna came down and he blessed the devotees they say almost like 3 8 3 10 that was the time in the noon time we will observe that and then we have invited the three swamis to speak on three different aspects of bhagavad-gita krishna the practices that he did one from the vaisnava path that he followed and the shakhtar and the vedanta and there is a great swami who sings very well he'll be singing in between interspersed by that song so this is our program many of you have already received so we will celebrate that thinking about bhagavan si ramakrishna and will begin a new year that is 2022. so this is the way bhagavan's rama krishna is teaching us go to the brahman go to the consciousness become one with that try to understand that and there is only thing that will be there in your mind your feeling that is bliss friends those who are connected with the ramakrishna tradition and if you have read ma sharadamani devi again almost at the end of her life almost the last day and she told another lady if you want peace my daughter don't find fault with others rather rectify yourself if you want if that is the word she used jodi if shanti pitacha if you want peace so what is the goal of human life happiness joy peace satisfaction santosha containment so this is the goal of human life what is god realization please a blissful life she said if you want peace peace means this blissful life so that is the goal what is god realization this so we are having so many queer ideas about the god realization have you seen god have you realized god many of the people will be asking they don't have the idea what is god they'll be asking about that and even if you say in whatever way the answer how they will understand that because they don't have the idea so we should have to have a very clear idea about the realization of god means the ultimate source is the love l-o-v-e which is the contentment that is the joy that is the peace that is the bliss so there we have to read how by giving up these worldly attachments and what are the worldly attachments only three as bhagavan sinama krishna is mentioning the land and the wife and the gold when he was talking with the mainly the male devotee so you mentioned the wife so this this is the way we have to understand if the mind is free she had recently been visiting sri ramakrishna he was studying at the biddashagar college for his bachelor's degree the master began to talk about him master to the devotees that boy will think of money for some time look at it let's call the bhagavan bhagavan knows the past bhagavan knows the present bhagavan knows the future too for suramar krishna we always say bhagavan sirama krishna why not that we follow sirama krishna and we are adding this epithet and giving to honor not not like that if you read his biography you will understand all the quality that has been mentioned in the scripture about a god it was there and he said so simply in the beginning he will try to earn some money but his mind is not there but there are some who will never do so some of the youngsters will not marry the sudama krishna the boy about whom he mentioned over here the shashi he became a monastic disciple afterwards and his sannyasa name was swami ramakrishnan he was a the very fond of mathematics and he was a it taught also mathematics afterwards to the younger generation this shashi loved sudama krishna so much and he had another brother also sharath his cousin brother both of them they became the great swamis of the ramakrishna order direct disciples of bhagavan sirama krishna and swami vivekananda thought that he will take the name ramakrishna ananda then after seeing his devotion to sirama krishna said no it must be shashi that he get that name rama krishna ananda ananda is the joy in the darshan shampradai that all the shannashi is their name is like the swami that is the master of his own mind or the senses and therefore he is in great joy ananda the beginning and the end are the same swami and ananda in between the name ananda it is here ramakrishna ananda so his joy was rama krishna and tomorrow we'll be celebrating we'll be remembering the another great swami the direct disciple of sudama krishna and shivananda he is like a shiva the auspiciousness so his name was swami shivananda ananda the shiva the ramakrishnan he is the shashi the devotees listened silently to the master the master it is hard to recognize an incarnation of god unless the mind is totally free from lost and gold he was mentioning about himself he is giving the hints indicating if the mind is not completely free from attachment and desire you cannot understand a pure soul because they will always be judged from the point of view of your own and you always think that when i go somewhere the people should give me the respect should recognize me and then only i'll be talking to them or become friendly with them because your ego prompting you and whenever you go to some place you are not getting that because they were meditating or they were singing bhajan didn't pay much attention to you there was no one immediately go back and and he says to the friends and devotee other relatives oh i am not going to that temple because they don't give much attention to the devotees etc nothing like that it is your ego you are going to god you are not going to a particular person you are going to a temple a house of god how can we expect that they will be there all the time to attain you to give respect and attention to you you should go and do and whatever the humble way it is possible then only you are a devotee so this is ramakrishna is mentioning hard to recognize and incarnation of god in the bhagavad-gita also we find that lord krishna is mentioning in the the same way the people it is impossible you know that we now we recognize bhagavan sirama krishna as the god himself or if we could go and see him in person etc but there were so many people were there they were living with him saw him talk to him but couldn't recognize that he is god why because he never showed the miracles even sometimes the egoistic people even when the god is showing the miracle even that time also they won't be able to realize look at the life of the lord jesus look at the life of bhagavan sri krishna they showed the tremendous power miraculous power the divine power but even then there were many who could not recognize that they are god so it is only the pure heart when the hanumanji the mahavir hanuman he first saw the ramachandra he was in the human form immediately recognized oh in the human form it is that paramatma para brahma whom i am meditating i am praying immediately he could understand why he was completely free from lost and gold mohave hanuman so this is the way bhagavan's ramakrishna is mentioning is very hard to recognize an incarnation of god unless the mind is totally free from lost and gold a man asked a sailor now he's giving an example how the people will be the judging the holy people a man asked a sailor of eggplants that the value of a diamond he was selling a diamond and the eggplant sailor he told i can give you nine shades of eggplant in exchange not one more it was a diamond but this fellow the eggplant sailor how you will understand the diamond the cost of the diamond so he was thinking that i can at the best because it is bright so it is okay i can keep it and i may give it to my the children to play well in exchange i can give you this much of the eggplants not more than that so understand at these words all the devotees laughed and young naren laughed very loudly and sirama krishna noticed that and he had quickly understood the implication of these words sirama krishna gave the example of a eggplant sailor who could not understand the value of a diamond that means the ordinary people were constantly thinking about the the worldly uh objects how they can recognize a spiritual person he understood why this young boy his mind was pure the whenever sudama krishna mentioned that immediately understood the sirama krishna mentioned what a subtle mind he had nanta also could understand things that enacted means his own guru but still he is mentioning that about that in a flash the meaning of the gita and the bhagavata and other scriptures is really really very difficult thank you friends we'll stop over here the 740 page number and we will again start a reading from this in the from the month of march any questions sunita is asking a two-part question she's saying please tell us how to avoid bad neighbors deciding never near our house that is our first first question how to avoid bad neighbors deciding and the second question is how can [Music] if you develop the patience then you don't bother about the the bad neighbors or the people who are disturbing you so you know this is sometimes it is the challenges it's very difficult to say how but we as a spiritual people we can say please pray to god let their mind turn it is human mind only they are not having good relation with you or only thoughts and if you pray to god maybe the miracle will happen then they will start liking you their thoughts will be positive about
