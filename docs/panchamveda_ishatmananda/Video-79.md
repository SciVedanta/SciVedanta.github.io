tavo khatam rectum dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten calma shavon shavon among Kagame shrimad athim moving on da hora de ojinaga Saddam Krishna's words is a nectar it was an excellent thing that helps the human mind to go up up in the stage of almost as a divine level but only thing we have to understand it and we have to accept it appreciate it otherwise not so today we are going to discuss about listen to the words of the master Raja Ram Krishna who is discussing with the brahma samaj the master with the brahma devotees you know that in that time particularly those from India maim or they will know that the Brahmas is a card from the Hindus only difference is they believe that God is without fault or otherwise everything is same so they were having a program as a function and serum Krishna had the habit of going to each and every place talk to the people different type of groups and they are discussing about religion talking about God thinking about God used to go over there sometimes out of his own sometimes on invitation and then used to talk to them why to give a direction of their spiritual mind majority of the people they want to practice religion and they do practice religion but not very clearly understanding what actually religion is today certainly there was a phone interview from Utah Salt Lake City the one lady she wanted to know how the Hindus are giving the traditional teaching to the younger generation particularly adolescent period this group so I was answering so and she was appreciating the views of the Hindus why because the broadness the broad-mindedness and that is exactly what we will learn from bhagavan sri ramakrishna it was April 22nd 1883 ceramic ashina paid a visit to be me mother Paul's garden house at shitty near calcutta there's a group of people particularly one young lady and she is a devotee of the ramakrishna mission Ramakrishna to logic I told the can you help our devotees who are visiting the Calcutta to take them round and show all the places associated with ceramic ich nur Ramakrishna mission is there but there is no one to take you to all these places where didn't you start it and by that way you can help some young people let them learn this thing like a guide they will go they will tell about the incidents that happen on that particular the place like the beanie mother pals garden house it is in shitty is a huge area and this in those days the Bengal is rich Bengalis just to keep their houses little away from the CT and used to go over there to spend some quiet time and particularly in another group they wanted to practice religion in those places so he was a landlord he was having a big garden house there they have assembled and to discuss about the Brahma ideology see Ramakrishna went to their the festival many devotees of the sahaja are present and SAT around the master now and then some of them asked him questions Master Marsha who is to note down all the conversation you also followed see Ramakrishna and minutely used to listen what the conversation is going on and used to not down the Brahma devotee said what is the way see this is a unique way of asking question to it monk whenever a monk is going even to be in the northern India I have seen if you go to any household ask for the arms and immediately the lady will come and before giving the arms she requests said what is the way Swamiji mark but I a in Hindi days to say summit amarga whataya what is the way what type of wait here they are asking for actually how to reach God here see Ramakrishna he is giving a very simple reply attachment to God that means detachment to the worldly things implied but he is not mentioning that attachment to God or in other words love for him and secondly prayer the only two things that you have to go and these days there is nothing very simple love for God and prayer apparently it is so easy but to create love for God you need sadhu sanga satsanga again and again you have to go and listen to the descriptions about God or you have to read about God you have to discuss it with your friends and then only he will develop a concept about God and that is a most important thing unless and until you have that conception maybe that we are visiting the temple and just going around the temple without knowing actually what God is all through a life so here see Ramakrishna he goes to those people though they are not following their own philosophy but at the same time he was interested to tell them and the moment and opportunity any question used to tell them here he says attachment to God that means love for him and secondly prayer now the Brahmo devotee is asking to be specific which one is the way love or prayer then see Ramakrishna sleeping first love second prayer and listen until you know how can you pray how can you converse with a person whom you don't know so fast is the introduction first you develop a an idea about that person dane you prayer then you can talk to him what is the prayer actually prayer means opening up the mind God not that the prayer doesn't mean that constantly we have to go on chanting some slokas all the that we have to seem some buttons not like that opening up the mind to God God today this happened that happened just like a frame and you cannot open up the mind unless and until you know the person so the sea Ramakrishna is fostering first is the lab then is the prayer they immediately he sang the song cry to your mother shamma with a real cry oh my mind and how can she hold herself from you how can shamma sterry this is a bengali song dark the c'mon doc our motto c'mon shame attack thievery you have to call but you have to call really so then the mother will listen to it cry to your mother Shama with a real cry this is important mashallah the money Debbie she has also promised we were will call me as mother I will never say no to him are hard so many people are calling mother mother are they all getting the blessings know why because there is no earning there is no real love when we are calling to the mother so real cry and continuing the master say and one must always chant the name now slowly he is increasing the list first he said only love and prayer then he is telling you must always chant the name and glories of God and pray to him see these are the words he has already said now why again you must have to understand we must know that he is meeting different type of people different group in different occasion different dates so naturally this group is listening for the first time it's not that once only he said somewhere and then in fact but this is a totally new group that's why sometimes some of the people who traveling with the Swami's and they will afterwards saying what's wrong she was telling same what to whom is it that's not the same words actually it is different words to those people he when we are going and meeting a group of people is a totally different when I went to Houston I talked about swami vivekananda and then i will be going to vancouver a totally different group and i will be talking on the same subject if a person is constantly moving around along at me are the same words you're telling it's not the same that so happened with the person who is to constantly go along with ceramic ich nur and he said wants to master why you say same word every time and the master review team I must do that what is that to you if you don't like to listen don't listen that we have to understand and different pages when you are reading this gospel same type of words are coming because the people are different but the one good thing is again and again you are listening otherwise we forget Salameh krishna once said how to realize God but again he is repeating a little different changes we have already forgotten so this will help us and here he says first love then prayer then he said chant the name of God along with the glory of God this glory of God he never forgets to repeat even never forgets to say the moment he will say the name of God glory of God because most of the time almost all the Hindu community and the other communities they have the mantra deeksha the Muslim the Christians the booties the Hindus all they'll be chanting Allahu Allah who like that they will be chanting constant but if you don't know he is Allah if you don't have any idea about the glory of Allah the qualities of allah' qualities of God qualities of Jesus then it is of no use it is just a name is it noun it's the name that you are doing on pronouncing going on repeating it has no value that's why I ramakrishna every time repeating these words and to bring back to our mind that you have to repeat the name of God and also the glory of God and pray to him then he said and old metal part must be crumbled every day you have to clean it every day otherwise it won't be so clean similarly our mind every day we have to take the name of God we have every day we have to pray otherwise we will forget Oh yesterday we took the name of God ok next week will now this whole week I'm busy that don't do every day every moment if possible you have to take the name of God one must practice discrimination and renunciation see how many things came first he said love then prayer then repeating the name of God along with his glories and then he said discrimination and renunciation why renunciation why discrimination because if we think that the moment we have taken the name of God and nothing wrong is going to happen to me wrong so in the Mahabharata there is a story that Bhishma he was lying down on the bed of arrows Shara sharjah and then Arjuna came and saw that he is actually crying tears are rolling down he is a Kshatriya veer is so much powerful person he is crying he is afraid of death now he went and asked Krishna look at this grandfather he is afraid to die then three Krishna said why don't you go and ask him why he's crying then when he went and knocks the grandfather why you are crying then he said I couldn't solve this problem that is coming again and again to my mind the riddle that is when the God Himself the Krishna himself is with you Pandavas why you people are suffering so much when the God is with you even then so much of suffering from the Pandavas I couldn't understand these mystery so I am wondering and crying I am praying to God to tell me what is the truth so discrimination constantly I know you are there sometimes you are hurting me that is for my good and sometimes you are giving me so many things that is also for my good but I am always with you and here he says Brahma devotees in asking is it good to renounce the world with the Brahmas they are not having any conception of sannyasa the some of the people are there some of the groups are there they don't have their conception like the sheiks community they don't have the conception of the sannyasa the Muslims no conception of sannyasa and among the Christians only the Catholics have that conception Buddhist tablet conception so naturally the brownie brahmanas Brahmas they are asking this question is it good to renounce the world why he asking is it good the one person he was asking if everybody renounce the world then what will happen toward I told you need not worry about that because no one is going to renounce the world rather he will inspire others to renounce so that he gets a more space so this unit not worry about there will be people always there the renounce the Agha is not such a easy thing there is it good to denounce then see Ramakrishna's very practical immediately said not for all those who have not yet come to the end of their enjoyments should not renounce the world can and that is the main thing he is dealing unless and until one has satisfied himself otherwise what will happen if the desires are there then after announcement secretly he will try to enjoy all those things and that is very wrong and that happened in there if we read the history of the Buddhism as a majority of the people they were thinking they started thinking that living in the world is a scene and they started announcing thousands and thousands of Buddhist monks and nuns but in fact many of them they are not ready to renounce in reality so that's why the whole thing came down so he is not all those who have not yet come to the end of their enjoyments Brahma then should the lead a worldly life master yes so these are the very practical question and answer worldly life means now he is explaining yes they should try to perform their duties in a detached way before you break the jackfruit open rub your hands with oil so that the sticky milk will not smear them so these he is telling because in the this life is so much a pain I just heard one of our very good devotee known person at this age at the end of his life suddenly he lost his son as a 30 33 years young man died now what will happen to those parents this is the question the wayne we are young when we are not in the world so we do not understand but the life is like this is not always the path of roses so naturally we have to understand that these are the things that going to happen in our life there may be happy things there may be also many many things which will give us tormenters so that is the whole total is the life now if I am prepared for this thing from the beginning whatever is going to happen there is a will of god i am not going to affect it that is the person is who will be enjoying otherwise not so it says like this and then you should renounce the world only in mind about the people those people who are living in the samsara in the household life that for dames Ramakrishna is telling you should renounce the world only in mind but for the sannyasi it should renounce the world both inwardly and outwardly so only a group of people who are ready themselves eager to do that for them this is good and then he said what is the meaning of the end of enjoyment the Brahma devotee is asking what do you say you just mentioned the end of enjoyment what does it mean then he said I mean the enjoyment of lost and gold most people don't feel any longing for God unless they have once passed through the experience of wealth name fame creature comforts and the like that is to say unless they have seen through these enjoyments so this is the experiences when we have passed through that we know this is the life only so not that the all the time that will be there is constantly passing those who were in a big position in the big post the moment there in that selected or elected in that post they forget that this is also temporary and naturally they forget and then they try to behave in that fashion and after few years when they return then a back end comes so what I am going to do he was such a high position now people are not ready to accept him in that position is very difficult to accept so that is the reason it says like this and see Ramakrishna very clearly mentioning these most people don't feel any longing for God unless they had once passed through the experience brahma devotees who is really bad man and woman and the master so the questions are so practical type of questions in the society there are bad people and good people also now how I will know who is actually bad and master as there are women endowed with with dr shakti so also there are women with a beat dr shakti now he is using two very important words bhatia shakti orbit dr shakti a woman endowed with spiritual attributes leads a man to god but a woman who is the embodiment of delusion makes him forget God and drowns him in the ocean of worldliness those who are living in this house all night they know it better why because it depends on the wives if they are good ladies they will support the husband whatever you are earning i am happy i will maintain in our household with that but i am not going to accept anything which you will earn with the wrong way and you will see the ones they say like that immediately the corruptions that all everything installed particularly men they are behaving in that way only to make their family happy if the family says the father the mother the wife they say we are not going to accept that money why that man unnecessarily will go and earn the money in a wrong way of course there will be exceptions some people are so greedy they cannot stop they do it only for the fun of it just for the sake of the name and all this this time i went to a gathering that you all people they came one person i saw in a very peculiar dress and he was sitting on the front row i I could understand that he is a must be a big man at least big donor otherwise how could he get that front row then afterwards I saw his picture and he was dressing in a very peculiar way and he was thinking the P we'll know who will know only few people who is connected with that person may be knowing who easy for us is a funny person dressing and very peculiar way so he was sitting and in a such a way he was thinking everybody will appreciate unnecessarily roving gonna take her in one of his famous poem he is mentioning you are trying to give you all respect and making you a laughingstock for everyone knew Jerry quarry Teague Ramadan me Jerry cavalli curry of Oman so that means one must discriminate if you leave in a humble way simple way then people will wonder oh my god the / gentleman who was sitting by my side he was talking he was so down to earth person he's so and so heightened I am so blessed that I could talk to him isn't that the most acceptable thing so that is the way that calls discrimination and otherwise simply you were dressing in a way with such a way that very costly dress she was wearing and putting his leg on another leg and you he was thinking people will we were of course many people they are looking at him but wondering why in such a funny Tracy is sitting there not accepting him or appreciating so one must understand these this humbleness and see Rama Krishna is telling this is possible if you have less desire so I was those who have already studied our it says over here BTR shakti and a BTR shakti bali Mickey in his Ramayana he said bisogna de vida propia should Dodger Molina Tata busana desired a two types should Archer and Molina data Molina a 2 shoulda genmab in a this is very important for a Hindu birth and rebirth going beyond the circle of birth and rebirth the moment we are taking the human body and we are doing something the actions and its result and then we are we once again going to the circle maybe as a human being maybe not taking different forms they come different names and taking birth in different species and suffering so they are very much careful about that and they like to go beyond that circle so here in the ball Mickey he is telling if you have the desire that one desire which will make you free another desire which will make you bound and suffer so barsana dibby da prata should archer Molina data should the means the pure melida means impure and this impure means a BTR Shakti Molina jaan mohit ooh who is the cause of a gain bird and Shaddaa is a mukthi and we have the desire being even being a smog we have the desire desire to construct a temple or to help this person ought to make these and that it is also desired but not a selfish desire not for my personal enjoyment not for my personal name and fame that skull suit are the moment it goes beyond that is a shuttle the same desire I will construct temples of the people in remember that I constructed this temple assudem so that it is the bar sonnet is a desire the result of the I am doing it for the benefit of others then same barsana same disease I is a cause of Mukti freedom and that thing if it is directed towards the self only for me for my ego for my ego satisfaction then is the bound the boss on our desire said to be the to the impure and the pure impure is the cause of birth and pure destroys those causes what is the impure tendencies again in the question and that to answer that Valmiki is telling a guiana Sudan dakara donna ahankara shalini ignorance is full of ego um cara Cellini is completely the full of ego that's why raghavan see Ramakrishna sale if the ego can be reallocated then you are free that's all what is the goal of a spiritual life only this point only this one thing eradicate in the ego if we remove the ego what remains self-confidence and what is that self that is the ultimate goal I am confident the self-confidence of course the English is a different meaning but the self means the Earthman and on that only I depend I believe that's called and the naturally ego windy moved the Ghana Sudan dakara Donna ahankara shalini and what is the result if I am egoistic poonam Jen McCurry propa Molina bossun Abu de the learned people they are telling that these type of bar cenas Molina VAR sana Molina bosna means that Dawson and the desire for satisfaction of the ego will bring you back to the circle of birth and death so that is C Ramakrishna knowing this fully well he is trying to help the devotees and he said this then the Brahma devotee is asking and see Ramakrishna again he said this universe is created by the Mahamaya of God mahamaya contains both big desmaya the illusion of knowledge and a bit desmaya the illusion of ignorance see the Maya means illusion one is illusion of knowledge that is exactly it is not the knowledge illusion of knowledge and ignorance illusion of ignorance a big desmaya the evita Maya illusion of ignorance we know what is ignorance aveda asmita raga disha of innovation all these five things are the glacier punch equation in our why we should meditate in that class we are constantly describing and discussing about that ignorance is the abbot dia then asmita is the ego ego means i but few years before before my birth I was not knowing where my but now as I have grown up I am thinking I am this forgetting that few years before before my birth where I was who I was I was not knowing so this is khaliq Norns because of the ego then comes desire the moment ego the I so I want these I want to be like that so the desire start coming and when the desire is not fulfilled disha a version and then ultimately comes fear of depth of innovation and these are called five puncher glacier afflictions why we suffer because of only five things these are the five things and see Ramakrishna said it came from the god he created the good and the bad the illusion of ignorance through the help of the beat da Maia one cultivates such virtues as the taste of only company that is true and very true the taste of holy company we sometimes go to different places and people are discussing about so many things and we like it and you sit for hours together but the moment you ask them to go to a good place they will never go there is a enable Parizeau there there one bar is there when Shami be weaken and the visit at that place he stayed over there on the first floor he stayed that because they're the station is very near it is the same building same way I entered into that in America you know they don't bother who you are so naturally they never turned their faces to see me but the person who is in charge of that he welcomed us and when we are asking this question he explained it it was very interesting but these people they are gossiping talking laughing drinking smoking the whole area that atmosphere I a cool it is very difficult to stand there even for 10-15 minutes but they are spending hours together and if you ask them to go to a good place where the people will be meditating where the people will be singing and what the people are discussing about God all the good things and that will be a place of suffocation for them after 10-15 minutes is impossible so that is the test am I really taking are proceeding towards God this is the test so he says like these here through the help of bed Amaya one cultivates such virtues at the test for Allah company then knowledge then devotion and love renunciation see what is the spiritual life people talk about spiritual life and he said all this Swami has come one gentleman who was telling this Swami has come from Himalaya and he practiced sod on our spiritual life for 10 years 12 years what is the spiritual life actually what is this practice of spiritual life these and this is the speciality of the gospel of ceramic ISNA no ambiguity and nothing hidden I am very clear even if we don't understand it is a wet lab for us and he is telling to cultivate some of the good qualities the first and foremost the taste for the holy company it doesn't mean that you have to come to a person but reading the Good Book so I was really appreciating 11 young lady she told that when I was in my house I could hardly read 10 minutes or 15 minutes from the pages of a holy book and when I am sitting over here in the asana I could complete nearly 25 pages that means the atmosphere that helps and the whole mind gets concentrated but in the house maybe it is not so that's why that we construct temple we considered churches because of that so that that place people go only with one intention only pray to God to think about God so that bought a verrin as recalled that atmosphere researchers with that and we never we are going and sitting that devotion the knowledge the love the renunciation it is increasing and that skull bhatia abbott desmaya consists of five elements and the objects of five senses that is the rupa russia sabda sparsha and ganda the form the flavor the smell the touch and the sound these makes forgiving forget God the Brahma devotee if the power of a bit there is the cause of ignorance then why has God created it look at this even today many people will be asking the same question and at the time of see Ramakrishna they also asked the same question why the God has created ignorance name master reply in one line very simple it is his play how to know if you don't understand what is God how he will know why he is doing all these things it is his play so that is the wonderful thing the father he was asking his son he gave adjusted in a toy and then broke the toy and told can you please fix the toy again then naturally that boy may the child may say why you in the first place broke the child I broke the toy and you broke the tie and then asking me to again to fix it what is the cause because the father wants that a child should learn is that doll so where will be the eighth where will be the hands where will be the legs where will be the chest and the back and all those things so that the chai this learning many things from that is a game is an engagement at the same time it is a learning why the father is giving this difficulty to that child because by that he will learn many things here also see Ramakrishna said the glory of light cannot be appreciated without darkness happiness cannot be understood without misery knowledge of good is possible because of knowledge of evil sir Swami Vivekananda he is telling I bless my failures I bless my mistakes so when we are making the mistakes when we are failure in difficult different things we must learn from that so these happens when we are not careful and in this says further the mango grows and writes on account of the covering scheme see Ramakrishna is giving the example that scheme is not necessary no one is going to eat the scheme but the skin is necessary for the mango flesh to right so it says you throw a with a skin when the manga is fully ripe and ready to be eaten it is possible for a man to attain gradually to the knowledge of Brahman because of the covering skin of Maya Maya in its aspects of bithia an OB DIA may be likened to the skein of the mango both are necessary the good and bad that we see in the even the bad is also teaching us what is the teaching we should not behave like that and when you see something good what is the teaching we must behave like that we must learn that we must follow that the one is teaching us not to another is I can remember long when were very small kids used to go in in our country p children are walking at least a mile to reach to the school so we friends used to go and we saw a very strong man used to see it at the side of the road in Calcutta and other places that they call it beranda used to sit over there many other muscle men's this to be there and he was a that in that all players people is to be afraid of him and we used to think oh look at this such a muscle and good so we used to go and sometimes looking at him sometimes touching his muscles sometimes he'll flex his muscle and we will touch and appreciate then one day he said you children you come over here instead of going to the classes don't do it then he said I made this mistake and now I am sitting over here on the street actually and I have nothing only I create some fear in the minds of people to leave to get some money I keep this sword I keep this this thing and that thing only to create fear in the minds of people and they give money and along with the money they give silent cursing not with happiness no will give me money with the and because I am this muscle man sitting over here you must learn seeing me that you should not be like this go and study concentrate your mind on the study become a big person a doctor engineer and we get mins twitter and leave highway and people like me will be always at your feet should see the same teaching so that is a wonderful way these is are the teachings even the bad are also giving the teaching salam o Keesh knees telling we have to learn from that God is giving both good and bad and he has given us the discriminative mind we have to learn from that what I am going to accept and if we make the mistake we are to suffer so that is what he says when the two brothers went to God and they asked please teachers then he said that Thomas E so the story goes you are that and the brothers were returning back they were thirsty they went to a pawn to take the water bring the water and the young brother saw and the moment he saw the reflection in that water he shouted brother I have understood I got the answer but that God said I am he that means this body and the other one said how can that be because body is changing one day we'll be all old people and then die the body cannot be the God the permanent he said no no whatever you think you think I am satisfied he became a surah and the other one becames David ah so that is the story and through that he says the same teaching if you are misunderstanding you are becoming this so that is why the God cannot be blamed because both the things he has given at the same time he is asking you to apply the discriminative Faculty and he said this the mango that cover it helps to grow the similarly the bad things helps you to grow properly the brahma devotee said is it good to worship God with form and image of the day tea made of clay that was a buzzword in those days these two all the time discuss about this the if God is all-pervading how the God can be in the image the ceramic ISNA say you do not accept God with form that is all right so this is called in reason the broadness the moment you close and say this is the only way then you are no more hindu the special it is this you do not accept God wit form that is all right the image is not meant for you for you it is good to depend your feeling toward your own ideal from from the worshippers of the personal God you should learn the yearning for instance Shri Krishna's attraction for rather you should learn from the worshippers a personal God their love for their chosen ideal when the believers in the personal God worship the images of cali and durga with their feeling they cry from the depths of their souls mother Oh mother how much they love their dating you should accept that feeling you don't have to accept the image see he is telling from name you learn this you don't want to accept the image okay but take that attention that they put the love at the food in the worship of the images Brahma how does one cultivate the spirit of dispassion why don't all attain it this is the wonderful questions how one can attain dispassion and hear the master is telling dispassion is not possible unless there is satisfaction through the enjoyment see he's talking with the brahma devotees and that is why he is talking like this when he was talking with the Derek disciples afterwards they became the monks he was telling if you go on enjoying this world as many time is not going to quench your thirst like the Yeti he went on enjoying this but his thirst for desire never quenched they never stopped but he knew that these people don't understand that that is why he is talking with them in their own terms instilling them so that they will understand at least something they will do and they won't be afraid of practicing religion dispassion is not possible unless there is satisfaction through enjoyment you can easily casual a child with candies or toys but after eating the candies and finishing its play it cries I want to go to my mother unless you take the child to its mother it will throw away the toy and scream at the top of his voice so this is called dispassion as long as I want those things okay go for it but the time will come when you will feel that I don't want all these things and then automatically the cry will come I want to go to my mother moon chalo Nijo nikita me oh my mind now let me go to my own abode so that is say master is telling and this is the system of Orthodox Hinduism therefore the Brahma devotees arcs the master about another question which we will read and discuss in our next class the question is very important is spiritual knowledge impossible without a guru the Guru Poornima is coming so the answer to these is very important and in the next time we will listen to the master a little spree offering our pranaam needin genomic them on hunter who pom
