[242: Panchama Veda 242 : Goal is God , Not His Power](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tt50BvBioPI)

good evening dear devotees friends let us begin with our the sutra that we always chant it is from the gopi gita tava katham srabana mangalam now friends we were studying from the gospel of krishna the english book the gospel that is from the 6 2 1 today we will study to read here we find the same the day october 11 1884 october 11 1884 sirama krishna whatever he said master masha noted that and he is writing now here he suddenly the at the end of these today almost we are the end of that account master masha giving a very interesting incident that happened over there he's writing suddenly he that means ramakrishna went into samadhi the devotees stood around with their eyes fixed on him so that we talk about the samadhi samadhi is so difficult but for suramar krishna it was almost nothing any moment he is going into samadhi and coming down and that is called that bhabha those who have read the biography of bhagavatam krishna you know the unique incident that happened the sudama krishna got a message so when he was thinking that his purpose of the body is done complete because he realized the brahman he realized the god and what he is going to do with this body when he was thinking and sitting on a floor which is still there in dakshinesha and where the the masters this to come the owners of the dakshinesha this to come the landlords it's a the name of that particular building called kuti body and there in a room where surrounding us to stay he was sitting on the floor and thinking what to do suddenly a white a smoke came out from that floor and he saw a face of a rishi how could you know the rishi because the long beard long matted hair and the rishi was telling him you should stay in bhabha muka bhabha muka baba muka three times he repeated it is recorded in the great master the authentic biography of bhagavatam krishna and after that sudama krishna remained in that way for the benefit of the humanity is the god that manifests in the human form to guide those human who somehow through their karma fella has developed little more sattva gunas good qualities the god is for them he guides them and he is directing them but we have seen there are many who came but not like siram krishna the sudama krishna was almost any moment he was passing into that unique realm of spirituality and then the next moment is coming down and then talking with the ordinary people in the ordinary way this is almost like this that type of moment that master masha is recording he went into samadhi the devotee stood around with their eyes fixed on him it's not secretly or in a secluded place and not before eyes of anyone not like that just he was standing suddenly he went to that samadhi samadhi means cross that into the spiritual realm the master's left food was advanced a little really it is appreciating how the master mashay at that very moment he was looking at the body the how he was standing and every little details he recorded he remembered and then he recorded it the masters left food was advanced a little the shoulder was slightly inclined to one side his arm rested on baburam's neck near the ear after a while he came down from the static state as he stood there he put one hand to his cheek and appeared to be brooding over something then smiling he addressed the devotees master i saw everything how far the devotees had advanced i saw rakhal him pointing to the master masha surendra baburam and many others what he saw we will read from here he saw the inner growth of spirituality can you say that ordinary people can do that any ordinary person can do it it's impossible it's only that supreme power that manifested through him and at ease he is giving the record why he is telling this that he inspires us if a person is listening the directions instructions the guidances of bhagavan's ramakrishna and practicing developing a spiritual life in that way he will also develop these qualities and he will also advance he is telling that i have seen this hajira was there as because salaam krishna didn't mention his name naturally why hajra any one of us would have asked that has lifted me have you not seen me then the master said yes hajra many more obstacles must know then hazra immediately comparing with narendra what about narendra that india afterwards swami vivekananda master i didn't see him so this is a very important statement i didn't see him he saw so many including rakhal maharaj we became afterwards the first president of the order we say first president but swami vivekananda for a few days and then he gave it to so this is the first president of the order and he was a highly exalted the spiritual giant we can say and he was young that time about him he's telling i didn't see him what about narendra i didn't see him but i can tell about him he is a little entangled why he said like that he was entangled because that is the time that uh narendra nada and their family was in great trouble perhaps it is the 84 the account of the 1884. after that his father passed away and they will be in trouble all ramakrishna saw but didn't disclose what is going to happen about him and in the first time when narendra 18 modi old they entered into his room those who have read the that biography you can imagine krishna stood up to welcome him and he said how can a swathik as a pure swathi can be in the city of calcutta and in the city all people they are so eager to enjoy all these sense objects as a pure boy no touch no connections with this his mind was full of purity the surama krishna appreciated suramar krishna said about him that he is one of the shapta rishis so we can understand but here he said i didn't see him but i can tell he is a little entanglement but i saw that everyone will succeed that is a the sent word of hope you know everyone will succeed and to him he turned to the master master i saw that all are in hiding he is mentioning about the master master the your power spiritual power spiritual success all are there ready hiding it will manifest the devotees listen to these words with great wonder it seemed to them that they were hearing an oracle master but i got into that mood by touching babura he wanted to give the credit to baburam bhavaram that young boy afterwards swami premaranda shirama krishna used to say that he was the incarnation of the radha even his bones were so pure just to stress that he was a pure soul he said like that and he was the incarnation of radha radha is a symbol of purity and love and dedication and devotion so babura maharaja was like that suramar krishna could see everything so he picked up like this and from there he is telling and the devotees listen to him hajra who is fast no hazrah is very interesting personality all these that suramar krishna said that everyone is going to be successful in spiritual life but zahasra said who is fast of all sadama krishna was quiet for a time he didn't give the reply that way it's not fast or second all are going to be successful means all are going to manifest the spirituality and going to realize god and going to understand what is the truth that is the thing so who is reaching over there fast and who is the second it is of no use everybody will be successful if they follow the teachings of bhagavan sriram krishna that is the idea saddam krishna listening to hazrat he was quiet for some time then he said i wish i had a few like nit to gopal nithya gopal another young boy but he couldn't become the monk he was a very advanced soul the sudama krishna is telling i wish that i could get some like him again he appeared thoughtful he remained standing he said i wish other shane's duties would become fewer eli used to love adarshen adarshin was a very educated person and he was holding a big post over there at that time when india was ruled by the british and other shin was the magistrate at that time so obviously his duties were much more and british were very intelligent they used to keep the indians to rule the indians so the we can say the front desk was all indians and the british used to rule from the back so the indians used to think of these people sitting over here and creating problem for me so they used to be angry against the indians so they developed in that way the other shin was one of the magistrate he is in the administration and their responsibilities was too much master suramar krishna he liked other because he was having a very pure heart very simple person but because of his duty it was impossible for him to practice the spirituality a little another in a very deeper way so he was thinking oh if his workload was little less but i am afraid the english officer will scold him he may say what is all these nonsenses because if he is meditating taking the name of god or practicing austerity spiritual austerities the master may not be british the master may not be happy then all smiled sudama krishna sat on the small couch and the devotees on the floor baburam and kishori came quickly to the master and began to stroke his feet gently mastered to kishari he knew baburama but kishori today suddenly came to serve the master why because if he does that he will also get the liberation god realization like that so sinama krishna jokingly what is the matter why so much service today the other days you don't do today only while you are doing so i i was a brahmacari at that time and a young monk i just was initiated into sannyasa i went to jairambati the birthplace of mahasarathamani devi many of you know and there was a the sannyasi very senior monk he was the disciple of mother and he was loved by mother when he was very young used to come to mother there's so many stories are there it was the time of lunch so from the guest house i came out and i saw the swami he was a very good lover of the roses he used to grow the roses and so many varieties of flowers he had that wonderful capacity he was doing something the uh the lunch time was another two three minutes was there still so he was doing something in the rose garden it was a scorching sun so i went and there was an umbrella i that took that umbrella and was holding on his head the having the shade he turned and looked at me and said the who is going to do it tomorrow why you are doing it today so like that the servicing suddenly you are doing the why then of course are you told this so this is the way it was master ramakrishna is also telling the kishori what's the matter ramallah entered the room and saluted sirama krishna touching the ground with his forehead this is the way one is supposed to show the respect to the holy people touching the forehead on the floor then with great respect he touched the master's feet he was ready to worship the divine mother in the temple see ramallah though he was a priest he was related to rama krishna but he had great respect for siram krishna so when he is going to worship the goddess kali in the shrine in the temple of dakshinesha he came and he took the blessings of sirama krishna master i said he's telling please permit me to go to the shrine the master twice uttered the words perform the worship carefully he said that so when we are performing the puja that we invite the god and goddess and sometimes some people they don't believe in that that is a different thing those who are worshiping that means they must be believing that god is coming and what i am doing is that god and the divine personality as if he or she is coming and taking the seat before me and taking my offerings the one must be very very careful and it should feel the whole environment is changing when i am calling the god and he is coming out from my own heart and then he is sitting before me ready to take the puja the worship that i am going to offer the one must transform and that is the joy of puja in the sometimes when the people that without knowing this or without practicing this perform puja after some time if it becomes just another boring time going on altering the mantra and not understanding the meaning there is no feeling just going mechanically no that's why suramar krishna said seriously you should do it and it happens it doesn't happen then why you are doing the worship if you don't have the faith you are not supposed to do that when you are doing it those who are doing it you need not to see whether others believe it or not it doesn't matter it is my faith so when i am performing that i should feel like this when we are crossing through that the the shrine or entering into the shrine one must feel that supreme god sitting over there you cannot just go without paying respect to him you must be always careful without making any sound one should do that respect so the presence of god it is in your mind and you should think this ramakrishna's blessing is this be careful to worship the several devotees remain in the temple till two o'clock in the morning the puja was going on and slowly slowly everyone left now friends today i gave the a topic like this the goal is god not his powers and when we were reading the sudama krishna could see and tell that what is going to happen to those people we never see this in the life of martial devi very few she was hiding all these things it was not necessary but she assured salaam krishna of course i assured she assured don't worry at all my children the thakuri is there suramar krishna is there i am there your mother and if you have dedicated your life your thought your actions for us we are responsible and we will surely come that is the faith that is the belief we are not going to be lost the ramakrishna the gods supreme will come and our that swami british he is to teach you must everyday pray to god the last day when i am departing from this world oh god you should not forget me you should not because at that time i will forget i do not know in what condition i am going to die but you should not forget me go on reminding him pray to him that very moment you must come and hold my hand and take me to your realm so that is the spirituality is the complete faith and dedication the god is there i am dedicating myself to him and what is this myself my ego what is this ego so obviously i belong to him friends don't mix it up with the advaithic point of view it's the dwaytic point of view we are explaining from the completely advaita point of view this is different but the dwita god is there suramar krishna is there maha sharada is there swami vivekande is there goddess kali is there durga is there whomever i love i must dedicate myself and if one can do it in his spiritual practices he is going to get different type of he or she will get different type of spiritual powers those who are following my classes the bhagavatam i think few weeks before i usually give the bhagavata on every sunday and few weeks before it is in the youtube must be there the powers of the yogi that they get supernatural power the i will quote from the bhagavata here also in the the book the skanda 11 and the chapter 15 verse 1 in the bhagavata [Music] usually in sanskrit say the siddilab siddhaya this is the power supernatural power yogi when becomes successful to control his senses by focusing his mind at the supreme lord gets various supernatural powers there's a bhagavata it says over here why i am telling bhagavata is the scripture and in the scripture always the truth is there bhagavan sri krishna he mentioned these it cannot be just a few words telling like that it is truth and so many references are there so many people they really achieve that here it says like this the yogi that means the one who is practicing the concentration when he can become completely successful to control his senses he acquires this power how many supernatural powers are there it again i think third verse of the same chapter siddha yo ashtar dasha that means all this supernatural power 18 in numbers there are 18. what are those it says out of 18 powers 10 powers god directly came it is in the capacity of the god that he will give and these ten powers we are very sorry eight powers they are very very powerful we know it so after of the 18 eight powers god is giving ten powers automatically automatically coming to the yogis what are the eight powers anima the power to become small mahima the power to become big laghima the power to become light prathi power to attain any object prakhamya power to enjoy any object ishitwa the power to control anything bashitwa power to control the self kama vasata power to satisfy any desire so these are the famous eight powers and the other ten powers that comes to the yogi they develop those powers in the process of their spiritual practices in the if you read our swami vivekananda's raja yoga he explained all this over there all these powers are there the yoga became very popular when swamiji talked about this and people thought if we practice we'll be able to see things from the far distances dura sabana and darshanam now i don't think it is not necessary to practice the spirituality for that why because the mobile phone is there all the time you can talk you can listen to any in the whole world from any place or you can see also if you are having those machines it is becoming so easy of course some are there like the the body physically you are transported like the mind if that capacity is there some people they can have they're like these and that so other than capacities if you are interested you can read the swami vivekananda's raja yoga i have also spoken about these discussed about this in my talk in the bhagavata that is in the youtube again and some of the others are there the five powers they say automatically it comes when one is practicing it comes automatically the one is that is knowing the past present and future and in the list they say this is byproduct when one is practicing the austerity and if he can truly control the senses it automatically come the trikal against the past present and future that there's a swami i met him but he became very old he was the vice president of our ramakrishna mission ramakrishna order and he is very famous as shuji maharaj his uh the pre-monastic name was the shuriya suji people used to call him and because he was the direct disciple of the swami brahmananda ji and this he served him and people say that brahmananda jimar has told that i will give you brahma-gyana ultimately he truly became like that he used to say very casually one day one of his uh the swami sometimes young swamis or the brahmacharyans they'll be there to take care of the old swami to to serve him so one day he called we call it shaybach the shaybach was there the monastic one who was attending the swami he called him and said you see that swami going over there after the lunch all the swamis they will go in different groups he showed to one so he's a very good monk he's going to be a great monk in future i am not naming now but truly he became afterwards he also became the president of the order at that time that swami from the from his room he are showing it that it is possible they can understand the past present and future so this is the way there are so many stories at the era of our swamis and it is so easy as if to achieve not that that is not there many of the swamis they are having but they never want to use this power why and that is the thing the that is why the goal is god not his powers anyone going to utilize these or get these and practicing the whole spiritual the practices in his life only to achieve this power will end up in having these powers and not god so that is not the ultimate thing the bhagavatam krishna never liked it money and swami bibeka and then others never eva so among the ramakrishna mission swamis there are people are there but they will never ever say that or utilize it and never why the goal is the god not his power the power comes from god and it belongs to the worldly things where desire is there but i don't want i don't have any desire i don't want this world so why should i have the power and what i am going to do with that power it is not necessary the people will start coming and then what is going to happen to me in the future what is this what is that i am not nobody to do that and my spiritual life is not for that why should i do that but this is the last hurdle you know in the spiritual life when the power comes the people cannot control it so naturally they start showing and they start saying that they are spatial there are other swamis were also there who had that power but as because the naturalist the political people the kings the rulers they will immediately cut hold of them and then what tell me what is the future and by that way they lose all those things and they don't achieve anything so that is why bhagavan sirama krishna again and again said one should not go for these powers friends though we got this we saw that ramakrishna could see as he mentioned i can read i can see the minds of the people as if it is there in the glass cases and the things that we can see the kept in the glass cases we can see through the glasses like that he could read he could see the mind of the people their past present and future let that be with him but for us it is a hymn we don't want anything friends we'll go to the next chapter chapter 32 before that i like to remember the wonderful example the bhagavatam krishna gave to remind us to make us remember we need only god not his power and in his beautiful way he told one person he was making all the clothes in whatever color people wanted them to so the people went with the cloth and said they make this color red so he dipped in in a bucket and said this is your red cloth the same bucket another person told i want it black i want it white i have so many all the seven colors he was only dipping into that and taking it out another person was there for a long time observing all this when everything was over all left then the person who was doing it turned to the man and said hey you are here for a long time do you need something you are not asking anything here is the moral of the story that that man told i want you i don't want those things and he's the most clever person if you want all those things all those powers and we must get that person who is having that so god is having all these 18 powers and if we realize god and if we want he will give us all those 18 powers but we don't want that so that is the moral of the story we don't want the miracles that is happening but the god who is love who is unselfish and who is all pervading friends let us start another chapter today time is there visit to the sithi brahma samaj the brahma samaj you know about the brahmas there was a movement spiritual movement religious movement they wanted to save the hindus because in great numbers hindus were converted into christianity at that time and the main objection was about against the hinduism that image worships why you are worshiping the images can god with all pervading so big entered into the images in those that time that our the so-called spiritual leaders couldn't reply to that they could not give the convincing reply so naturally people got confused and the education in the hands of those people who are teaching in this way and converting so through education also they were changing the temperament mentality thoughts and the tradition from there breaking the tradition of the hindus and they were converting them there were many many big people they were also getting converted so a group of people they become very rigid and they wanted to keep the hinduism so they close all their doors and windows no conversation nothing like that we are not going to visit you you should not also entered into our at the uh temples like that way a very rigid hinduism also started the obviously they wanted to protect their the faiths so they behave like that another group they understood that we cannot remain like that closing all our dwells on windows rather they make an in-between path that we are not going to worship the god in image rather we will worship in the theories that is the veda do we follow veda we will chant veda we will remain hindu but not the hindu as such when they started like this majority of that educated the then educated people they started becoming members of that group and they became very famous as a brahma samaj we started with ramon ray they say but the afterwards the ship changed the movement changed the ramon rai started then the father of the rabindranath tega they also continued they were influential family rich people so they continued and others also started joining because it became a social status educated people they should go into that and that was the situation sirama krishna in that scenario he was from the village but he very boldly started worshiping the ma kali and the main of objection was goddess kali but sudama krishna started worshiping goddess kali very near to calcutta on the other bank of the ganga in the dakshinesha and not only that he started visiting the calcutta people also and suramar krishna started visiting these groups also why they were good people educated people they wanted to practice spirituality but you know what the whenever you want to start something if you don't have the spirituality in that you become narrow why you you are afraid i am going to lose my followers i am going to lose my other friends so they started you should not marry with the orthodox hindus you should not do this you should turn so should not a big list of should not always it comes that is the sign of weakness any religion whenever they say don't mix with others don't go to others don't take they're offered food that means they're weak they think if they do it they will be immediately going so if i am strong if my philosophy is strong why should i behave like that that is exactly what suramar krishna slowly slowly was introducing and he was reforming the traditional hinduism in a very wonderful way so he is visiting a samaj samaj means a group of people and they were celebrating it was october 19 1884. on this day siram krishna again visited siti brahmo samaj when master mashay mentioned the again that means before also he went it was the occasion of the autumn festival of the samaj which was being celebrated at beni madhubspaal's garden house the mini mother pal was a rich man and in those days and now also the rich mans are having lot many properties their main building will be in the city and their garden house will be in the little outcards so they in the outcourse all people it's a big place so all they went over there krishna also went the hall was decorated with flowers and greens flags and festoons and various colors outside the blue autumn sky with his fleechy clouds was reflected in the water of the lake so almost every garden house will be having a big water body so master mashay as he was very very particular so he observed everything and he recorded that so we can see as if the movie if you close our eyes and go with these words you can transport yourself in that time you can see the reflection of the sky on that the water of the pond and also the people colored flower flags all this decoration was there because it's a celebration srama krishna arrived at half past four in the afternoon entering the hall he bowed down before the altar and mostly this to keep a lamp and they used to read the upanishads the sudama krishna went and bowed down before the altar this is the beauty as a real spiritual people wherever there is a holy thing it may be a christian cross it may be there's something else but there's a holy thing and thousands and millions of people they are respecting that believing that is the symbol of god so i can always respect that what is the harm but the majority of the people will say no that is not my thing what is my thing god manifest in everything so this is the difference friends we have to understand this much swami bilajanandaji has composed a beautiful and the poem in sanskrit if you read that the sampradaya bharjita the sampradaya the when the people become narrow-minded that's called sampradaya and this is only my philosophy and i am not going to accept anything else what swami vivekananda when he came to chicago and the first lecture if you read the very famous lecture the 11th september 1892 when he delivered that lecture what he said the story of the frog in the well that means the narrowness so that narrowness should not be there when we are reading the gospel of sirama krishna we sometimes miss these points the sudama krishna he is the embodiment of all paths and faiths so he went over there he bowed down before that and the brahmana devotees among whom could be noticed bijoy and triloky this brijay afterwards he left that particular path of the brahmas and he became a bush number because traditionally they were vaishnavas and sudama krishna also noticed that and told so your thought it flows to the devotion and if you try to practice this brahma samaj which is a mixture of devotion and knowledge and not very clear you won't be able to develop in spirituality so follow your own uh the tendency that will be good the bijay and they were the leaders of the brahma-samaj sat around him a sub-judge who was a member of the brahma-samaj was with them look at it a sub-judge in those days judge means only british could be a judge and then indians could be the sub-judges and maybe in the villages or in the district and in the small court were subject as indians but that was a great post in those days very respected post and as because he was educated he was also a member of the brahma samaj triloka was entertaining the devotees with his melodious music master tutorial that song of yours oh mother make me mad with thy love i enjoy very much once you sing it then troy looker sang that song again the srama krishna is a great master and how he is guiding the people he is asking to sing the song of mother kali and what is the meaning of that let me forget this whole world this name fame property wealth everything let me completely dedicate myself for the realization of the divinity divine and that is oh mother make me mad mad me the mad a person the lunatic they will be only thinking brooding over one thought again and again so they go on brooding on that so they forget other things also where they are sitting there all around people similarly a spiritual person should also put their mind and soul to that spirituality the consciousness for getting everything including his body so the word mad goes very well with this expression was singing as he listened to the song master's mind underwent a transformation and presently we went into deep samadhi friends if you read the gospel of krishna almost every alternate page you will find he goes into samadhi from these we can understand how he was and who he was and that is the reason when someone asked swami vivekananda his beloved disciple who understood sirama krishna the best when they asked him to write a biography on him he said are you mad it is not possible the suramar krishna was the god supreme he was having so many varieties in the way of expressions who is going to fathom that so whatever is there sometimes some devotees they will be asking the surama krishna said that after 100 years of his the sudama krishna life again he will come and take the human body has he come 100 years have passed have you seen are you looking after that what suramar krishna has given it will continue for 1500 years his ideas and ideologies is so strong so beautiful and so apt for the percentage it will continue that as swami vivekananda said for 1500 years that means for a long long time the strong current will go now after the jesus it is 2 000 years after the buddha it is 2500 years like that you have to give time it is it is the idea it is the philosophy it is a transformation of the human mind with the ideas so we don't want another sadama krishna like that if he has come god it is his god will anywhere anytime in any form he can manifest but we have god sudama krishna he is life he is ideologies we are satisfied and we should try to imbibe all those things because life span is very short we do not know what is going to happen when to whom where so we must concentrate our mind and as maximum as possible coming down a little to the plane of the saints world he gave instruction to the devotees so why his mind so so high went into samadhi just the thought oh mother made me mad in thy love then this line only and that is igniting this is the special the thought waves what is spirituality remaining into that the moment there is any opportunity immediately it goes into that thought and it can like a flashback it goes to that ultimate which is consciousness and it is so joyful so we don't like to come back but without experiencing that at least a little in this life what is the worth of spiritual life then so this sudama krishna again and again showing his mind was still charged with the divine experience his words were spoken as if in a state of intoxication gradually he became again fully conscious of the world master oh mother i don't want the bleach of divine inability i shall eat siddhi in a very the different way he is telling i shall eat that means i like to enjoy don't take my mind so srama krishna he's begging to the divine mother to allow him to mix with the people and we are begging to the divine mother to collect our mind from scattered on all objects and to make it concentrated and to take it to her to the devotees by siddhi i mean the attainment of the spiritual goal and not one of the eight occurred powers this is very important today the goal is god not his powers so cerama krishna is telling by siddhi i mean the god not the occult powers the supernatural powers as in in the today's discussion in the beginning i just read from the bhagavata and gave the names of all those powers it's just for the knowledge but here he says this is very very important and after this we will conclude by siddhi i mean siddhi one type of a thing that if you drink or take it becomes you become intoxicated the majority of the people the sometimes those who are working very hard the physical labor the poor people they sometimes take this and if you take with the milk and then you forget the physical pain and in the olden days the doctors used to use it to relieve the pain some people are suffering so that is very famous and siddhi at the same time success if you translate the sanskrit word siddhi it is success the surama krishna that's why he is explaining very clearly by siddhi i mean the attainment of the spiritual goal and not one of the eight occult powers he didn't mention 18 occurred powers he mentioned eight occurred powers why because the eight are given by god and they are very important about the occult powers shri krishna said to arjuna friend if you find anyone who has acquired even one of the eight powers then know for certain he will not realize me m capital me this god for powers surely we get pride that is the main reason spirituality means you have to go beyond your ego and after practicing spirituality when you get the occult powers the supernatural powers you go back to ego that is the reason those who are very sincere to realize god should not go for the occult power but some people doesn't want to get the name fame they may try that is their own thing but those who are really really a good devotee should not go for that the powers surely be get pride and god cannot be realized if there is the slightest slightest trace of pride thank you friends today after this and in the next wednesday we will again read any question one one question maurice are you able to hear srima biswas she's saying shimo bishwas is saying is fasting necessary before worship srimad you are asking is fasting necessary before worship you know why sometimes you can eat and do or some some people because of the physical problem they must have to eat something but if you eat full stomach you may feel drowsy a concentration may not be possible that's why they say better if your body is fit if your body can permit you can or to worship without any food but if not don't hesitate to take some food some light food you can take and then you can see it so it will be good there's no problem a group of ladies came to suramar krishna and as natural if you are going to a holy person and to temple you are supposed to fast and they came from calcutta mostly walking so they get tired when they entered into suramar krsna's room they were seating to listen to sudama krsna's talk but salaam krishna noticed that many of them are drowsing so naturally salama krishna asked are you fasting they said yes sir don't do that suramar krishna said when you are coming to me you must come with a fresh mind and so that whatever i am telling you can listen you can understand so this is suramar ramakrishna but traditionally it is better to fast before worship and that makes the body good sometimes in durga puja they'll be fasting for the whole day the food will be only in the evening like that and that also very simple food the controlling the senses and without food that is that the traditional way they always do so if your body is not that fit you can eat but if your body can permit don't eat thank you let us conclude with this mantra niranjanam is namaste peace peace peace unto all
