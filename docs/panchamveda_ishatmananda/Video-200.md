I'm dr. G venom could be very rhythm calm Asha seven among columns three medalta tony biglan and de who lead our Jenna half today we are going to discuss about cough and Tov what is the way now government Saddam additional she was talking with the devotees and he was telling Mukerji brothers we already read about them conversation is going on for a long time and he is telling here you are we love never rich people so the Mishnah is mentioning you are we love if a man sleeps from the path of the yoga then he is reborn in a prosperous family and starts again his spiritual practices for the realization of God this statement we find same thing in the bhagavad-gita say Krishna also in clearing the doubts of the Arjuna he's mentioning in the sixth chapter ketta 41 Percy said Krishna see proper conduct on Oh God sushi - Oh shush chatty Samana Shuchi now Shri Madame de Luca brush turd of a JIT now hidden the two words refined one is shitty that is pure and sorry madam prosperous the pure and prosperous now some people are prosperous but not feel the meaning of the people they are accumulating wealth by different wrong means so they are not considered in this the children who are born but there in the family now we cannot consider them in this the standard is it should be pure so the pillar people holy people but at the same time they'll wake up people why because if a person immediately after birth is going on thinking the how to get some money for the survival you won't be able to put his mind for the God realization so this is aid the problem knock it down - oh come here we find that the pitcher is mentioning about the past life if you have done something good nothing is going to be wasted that's for sure nothing is going to be wasted that's why sir Krishna in one place he mentioned now equal Kalyana Kritika still to come dr. Shetty Durga team do protein particle chili Kalyana you are doing something good righteous no wrong can harm to them it is not possible now some people are really very good some people are always trying to help others they bring for others but still they suffer the way that is that sometimes the people will be asking quite them these people are so good so righteous but right then they are suffering again there is some particle - why all those little bit of things that if they did they are suffering for that having attained to the words of the righteous and living there for a long time Bravo God the righteous people that means those who are doing something good praying for the betterment of others helping others constantly thinking positively for the others they will go to that place after the death where they have that company it was here no doubt about it now if you ask me to prove we will be able to prove in that way but inference through inference we can understand most of the people who we find spiritually enlightened they are lying just like that and nothing can can come suddenly so obviously we must have done something good in ever previously so in this birth moves the person to some extent we loved and at the same time our families with parents so this is proof that we are having those really fortunate things now we should try to strive to attain we were the Yogi's you is means we were trying to realize God we were trying to be united with God so the you came and that time in that last life we could not fulfill so we have come down once again but in a better situation and now again we are trying to reach over there 18 we could think something else we could go somewhere else and so many people elderly people eight years 86 years old people have seen their going to different places and just further spending some time enjoyment what in German but still the think that this is the world and lifespan is closing down we must ask maximum possible to link you to this way they were thinking the world this way to this we find in the Puna that in the swagger after spending a long time one Falls from the yoga and reconvene in the homes of the pure and righteous pure and prosperous so this is exactly what Saddam Tichenor mentioned about the Mukerji brothers the McCarty brothers they regularly come to work instead of distant oh they are very well of people rich people they could go somewhere else and the time that we are studying at the time of our ones Ramakrishna Calcutta the capital of the undivided India and you know after the the Islamic rule and then the British rule that was continuing and ceramic Krishna 1836 and Riza our 1884 you can understand that was the situation and here we find most of the people who have corrupted as because he had no opportunity to express their freedom and they were not allowed to do anything political so little perverted type of mentalities so they could not express any way anything so sometimes they'll be doing very peculiar things we are not going to discuss all of those but history and the social and we can find that in the different type of books how the minds of those people we're in that situation some of the people again and again coming to the ramp is not listening to him talking to him spending time with him that proves though they had the money they could do many other things as other rich people used to do still these people are coming and sitting at the feet of a Carranza Ram Krishna and driving philosophy but still they're liking it that's why see Ramakrishna pointed not to all people some rich people also came to cinema Tichenor but he never mentioned about that theater is ok but sometimes we find some people who are coming to universe so sensitive another his mind is so pure even the person who is newspaper most of the time the newspaper speaking and publishing wrong things so he was not ready to accept those papers also that sensitivity was there so much so and this person's in amo Krishna he is telling the Mukherjee brothers that you are we love if a man sleeps from the back of yoga thing he is reborn in a prosperous family and starts aching with spiritual practices for the realization of God when this is tentative ot the Mahindra he is asking why does one sleep from the battery fighters one sleep from the path of yoga the meaning of the times we have seen in our own life the friends and they were practicing austerity so hard but after some time they go away on the path they saw the Saudis after practicing law suddenly something happened to go away serve their us is asking this question the province around is not answering is a while thinking of God the Spirent may feel a craving for material enjoyment that two things are their spiritual work a material material world is temporary but material for temporary enjoyment but mixed with suffering mixed with sorrow mixed with miseries and that is the reason after understanding this good we won we trust the mind and puts the mind towards God and they apparently it's very difficult why because my on the pull-up Tamiya is so strong somehow or rather it'll try to drag you down to that level something ego comes I'm a spiritual man I don't go anywhere I don't see movies I am only taking the name of God and I should not mix it ego comes that is also the gauntlet that is also very peculiar bondage and sometimes they think now I have to help people without me you is good they go so much so they forget to take the name of God our meditation and all those there's a another thing and the different type of girls this Maya comes and drags the mind down then inside slowly slowly comes the desire to be popular then am i popular are people talking about me are the reading my book are they those who writes the book this is the main problem they always will be going on in reading how many copies of the books they have sold or how many number again reprinted and I'll be posting you know my book this is the flipped frame to this going on like this like that so many varieties of their desire for the material world material world doesn't mean that I to that place I eat these aren't participating not like that subtle very subtle the desires aren't there so cinema business today while they were trying to realize God and craving it is this craving that makes him sleepy from the bath this gravy makes him sleepy from the bath in the bhagavad-gita again when we find that being the satish night stealing comma each root Alicia Raju goodness someone only two and it is also related calm Asia Groot Alicia Raju una semana Shannon maja Bhavna we didn't already know now these two are the real enemy of spiritual life one is desired another means when the desire is not fulfilled and when the desire is not fulfilled then the anger is coming so common initial Croatia and where from it comes Raju now this is Raju guna that is also where from the rajo-guna because when there is a shock to a guna they won't find would do like this tamo-guna again is not interested only in rajo-guna this is a mixture so roger una semana cinema history is also telling we the desire to get the name fame and establishment and all those things in this world till he slipped from the path and in his next life with the spiritual tendencies not that everything is lost in his next life he'll be again once again he will come then the Mahindra once again he is asking this question then what is the way is a very very important question but those who are striving so they must be very very careful so they must be careful that are we continuing to towards the spiritual development and you know sometimes some people are practicing a little going and sitting in them and then suddenly they will go on seeing different type of things strong imagination helps them to see different type of things personation sometimes ah that sub hypnotized way of seeing it wants to see these and their hope this is the thing that I have seen I am making the progress progress okay you are satisfied that's good but the thing is you must have to observe your own characteristics behavior thinking pattern till only you can understand yes these are the things which I saw that is actually the indication that are going proceeding towards the goal yes we see some of the people who are practicing 280z the DC car got a different form and nothing wrong is good sometimes they see in the dreams also good but that is not to find a goal we have to completely transform ourself how it is possible so Mahindra he's dancing in asking then what is the way long long back DeLuna the fine brothers buncha bondable when they were roaming around they were thirsty there was no water Porter and he wanted to drink you know mr. butanol the story then a demigod Yaksha he came and say hey this is my porn you got a drink in this way I will allow you to drink the water if you give me the answer of my questions that manual so thirsty and we never care for that demigod and he's waiting to drink the word the moment a sip a little he was painted the second brother 3rd brother 4th brother one after another a great hero like bhima arjuna they all fainted finally king yudhisthira steerer you table stealer even the great difficulties in the problem is calm and composed stealer he never loses his mental balance so he came and when he saw his brothers are all lying down here and there unconscious he understood something happened see him my icy heart same demigod he yep sure appeared before him and he said I have killed your brother's with the air you will also die unless you answer my questions and then he was going on asking the questions one question was tough Banta what is the way now what is the way means it is not how to reach Delhi or how to reach this and that so what is the way means how to reach God then yudhisthira gave an excellent answer very famous answer again and again in different way different people they have quoted and one kali presenting a single he has translated mahabharata mahadji is very famous you know all over india almost all the languages regional languages translated the mahabharata original Sanskrit and here the calibration assume in the Bonaparte wha is mentioning Turco a Protista Tagum is the debate of Protista the Tveit cannot take the decision it cannot ultimately the debate cannot take us to the ultimate decision all as a typical media pros and cons pros and cons goes on at this time in our first spiritual retreat in Ganges the first time a tree in diversity students they came they represented to five tree like that they came and the first time not for country to get the student of that level is very difficult and they're all research scholars and starting very high and are busy two three girls they told that they will come at a bad moment they could not so there are research guides they told not this is the time you have to submit the she could not another got an opportunity to present hard paper in London said great opportunity so he flew to London anyway those who came they had a wonderful Tibet we could not give him much time of course and they could not come into conclusion those who were in the pro in favor of the motion can religion bring peace progress they told we could not get the full time sufficient time to prove ourselves having many arguments and opposition's also told no no we were also having some admin server targa debate cannot take us to any decision so the darker our Protista studio between Naruto mr. Luthi means the beta P we know a different way still expressing almost all the telling the same truth but different ways and they are very very adamant the Nana this is the whatever I have expressed this is the path it should fall if you like to realize god this is the bad so sooner you will be witness scriptures are also different now eagerly she yes the bottom brahmana now eagerly she there is no one Rishi Rishi means those who are thinkers those who can see the future so even then if you talk to them differently she's different morning's different thinkers they're thinking will be different opinions will be different and very confusing side-by-side two great names a whole country acharya Shankara and archery and our manager our post from the same place but if you place their ideas side by side completely different and pages of the pages thousands of pages have been printed on the divot is God without for our wheat for our we belong to God or even in reality real God Brahman the part of that debate is playing on till now the Shankara and Ramana they have passed away long long back but their followers still going on so that's where it says eat not equally she'd non-geek early she hits the bottom Ramana is certificate this is the only thing you should know our freedom is there so you can explicitly Tim he is telling never a dish today third master Tom mijita McGuire is hidden very savvy by all means in the hidden concealed players actually he pain free subtle Thomas septum is very very subtle what is Dharma some people are slaughtering the cows and eating the meat and for some people that is the hideous scene but really those who are slaughtering the cows and eating the need the beef for tames the food only there are three images that seem but some other people cannot think of it naturally thalma different type of opinions are also there but is that if I am doing these that it is only thing there sometimes the confusions are also there so that was septum militant who I am it is so very survey to understand then what is the we are afraid lost line is a Mahayana the serpent serpent carpenter what is the way serpent that is the fact that is the way that by that really you can go Mahayana in a Goethe the weed great so they have lived their life he followed them lived like them so that is how he says and what is the goal goal has been fixed by the Shaitaan Shaitaan punishes those who don't know that shifter Shahrukh initially mentioned we heard Ari she said Nana Ponte be today Dayanara no other path cetera except knowledge now on the Pantanal means negative no under Ponte any other path except built the existing what is that big today Ryan I build the day are you now I am what is that big to deny the big tear the knowledge what is the knowledge knowledge of Brahman where is that Brahman all-pervading consciousness the all-pervading consciousness who is the creator sustainer and disorder and that exactly to the power of the institute rebel power of that he has created this universe which is the same material same thing and we a little bit confused we have to go back to that that is the knowledge and that knowledge is the ultimate now under Penta there is no other bad bill today i annoy him except to be double so we had to we have to go in there and Haryana gotta how the Mariana now in this reply we find very peculiarly instead of telling these than that Salam o Krishna started telling what he did when he was practicing spirituality in the pages 534 35 if you read you will find that it is not good to change desires and hankerings for that reason I used to fulfill whatever desires came to my Martin the scenes in our Krishna why I was explaining the whole the question was what is the fact how to realize God in reply cinema Krishna didn't say meditate take the name of God go to solitude is not telling them rather he started telling what evil deed morinaga sapanta the 5,000 years before what the judiciously the answer the same thing we find in the behavior in the teachings of salaam additional so those who are reading the gospel of Salaam if they don't have the background of the Mahabharata won't be able to understand why suddenly he started telling about haunting oh I did this in when I was a young man then I did that the very interesting we have to follow the great personality because that is the only the way but there is no other path our goal is knowledge but perhaps to follow a clean soul and who will find greater than him so here in fact this is telling no salvation is possible for a man as long as he has desired as long as he anchors for worldly things this is very clear if you have that anchoring of the worldly things nothing can achieve therefore so friends I have to tell you hankering for the worldly things now all of you are living in the world you have responsibilities now suddenly after listening these if you think why didn't we are going to the office some people do and they create create not only problem for themselves most of us Indian we have a create quality we read we listen then we forget we never follow so that is a great quality so there is no problem for it but sometimes some people are there they take it so seriously and not understanding his swadharma remember it anyone who is coming to understand the teachings of advanced Ramakrishna leaving other things I feel 100% that they where the Yogi's in their past lives otherwise these words will be earth Falls it cannot be anything that is not Spinney single award business after turned truth and truth so obviously we have to understand masala TT TV once saved someone said mother we have come over here but not finding the path and the mother answer why are you thinking this way you are not going to lose the path you have come here to find the belt what traffic and I think that he will lost the party we will lose the path know what arabic and what baba do need take initiative he have come over here to find the path then she said tacos ramakrishna Arjun Arjun Arjun Raghavan cinema which lives there there the three time she returned and wisdom and Salaam o Krishna the involvement of the whole religion and what he did that is reaching us now and he finds the Mukesh reinstating therefore fulfill all your desires regarding food clothings and others what do you say about that he is talking with the devotees sometimes some people they like to eat there's no problem they like to put on some good dresses so it is this small small thing if you like to enjoy we do visit this place like to go over there you know the ramakrishna mission the Swami's and development of course of the time of brahmacharya the some restrictions yeah so that you can build up the mind 13 12 13 14 years they will be very very restricted life then how the real afterwards to free the sometimes you can go to your friends you can go to different places you can eat if you like something no restriction in that race well these are the things one must do no not like that so these are the why the little bit of desires if you have is okay no problem mean two things that is gamma the gold last gold you cannot that is not allowed so if you observe not I belong to the Ramakrishna mission and I'm doing unfreezing because this word for United by Marshall Domini daily the God is our sir and surely be vacant and the worst none other than Saddam additional and all the hosts of the spiritual Giants so they have even this freedom means this is and no rest above hardens for the spiritual growth now it is not a hearty distance telling this this way it is not good to change desire and hankerings the slowly earlier to keep up and then for that reason i used to fulfill whatever desire came to my mind the great soul is giving his own once i saw some colored sweets and aperture and wanted to eat the colored sweets so he saw the showcases are there so naturally they brought me the sweets and I eat a great meaning then the result was I fell ill so he said that if you have that type of desire and if you eat too much when you are going to suffer in my boyhood days while bathing in the Ganges I saw a boy with a gold ornament jewelry around his waist during my state of divine intoxication I fail to desire to have a similar jewelry myself Salam o peace never said his father was not that region it was a little bit of person but not that which to give the golden jewelry is for his son he saw them and when he was in that spiritual mood he felt that desire I was given one because Freddie rich man they were supporting Salama busines whatever the wishes were they all that would really but I fail to decide to have a cinder and I must even one bird I couldn't keep it on on me for very long when I put it on I felt it in my body the painful love search of the current of the air I I was it was because I had touched the ball to my scheme look at it Salam occasionally little looking desire is better to fulfil and he see in that way he was a young boy he had the desire so that and they afterwards he wanted to fulfill that when he grew up and he was practicing spirituality in that intense moon and he it was given to him but the moment he touched it with a steam on to the skin the gold gold and the desire they got together God wins the world and the desire Paradiso then he will go for the gold gold of the world and then the game you spend that a game desire again army and for the army you have to do many other things the slowly you are going into that bondage of desire so he said no it was so painful I order treilery a few moments and then had to put it aside otherwise I should have had to tear it off friends we are following a great soul and he said the small desires should be fulfilled and then he from his own experience he is stealing when I was feeling to eat something I hate but I became sick because of that so even the smooth design if we are going to fulfill in that way there is a possibility to suffer physically then there was a desire to put on a golden chain he got it and the moment he put it on his person his body with the moment the whole touched his skin he started feeling pain way to remember this HOSA ramakrishna was putting on the golden jewelry's so we can also do that the next line I could not long time the moment did dust I started feeling pain I have to tear it off I gave give it up so the little desire also the moment it comes you can understand the futility of it you have to give up I once felt a desire to eat the famous sweet means of different cities all started laughing listen to this I had a desire to hear shambo's musical rhythm recital of the charity desire the shank Obama was the very famous he used to recite the journey in a very motherly way the cinema Tichenor that's not so desired sometimes we go to see these we go to see that so it's better to fulfill all the desires among the ones I saw that but iseman and every time I pass through that I saw the human being can float in the air so any Kristoff's of Peleus can he go and have that how to do it today so he can also do I don't let me see inside they went and found my god they're sending the year so for Sweden man can float on that I don't know the submission and those who are coming down the I don't know whether they enjoyed it or not but they were totally confused the way they're coming out of that so it is that is ok now when I pass through the head there are two buildings I have seen advertising that you can fly of the sky that means the forcefully air will flow help you to float it is over no desire at all and this way opera you novena is a very famous team the two devotees they purchased a costly ticket and when I went and I heard they are sinking they must be a very good singer no doubt about because the whole the Opera House of full in each every single seat was full but after the they stopped for him for a small gap that I was posing the devotee can cooperate is it family it is little a costly ticket but anyway we came out over so I do that how this seeing the small thing little curiosity little thing to enjoy but no more does enough is enough so little bit to think that we find in our life once you go nothing nohow but not that you should be due to that attached to that every time you should go over there never even - this is the teaching at that time many Alamein used to visit the temple garden a desire arose in my mind see how the desire it desire arose in my mind there should be a separate storeroom to supply them with their provisions slam vishna he was used to get a salary from the temple and naturally he had no authority to say the decision should be done about that but he had a desire so many people are coming there in the same line with the others another Biggers and the homeless they all are there and the holy people are also in the same line if they had a separate storeroom they could go take the food go to their rooms Arkham eat their own things so he had a desire so he is doing that Mathura would arranged for one the motor Babu determined that immediately did that the Sodom's were given foodstuff thrilled and the life from the stove some business very happy but these are other desires he is not riding and he's telling this I was happy once the idea came to my mind to put on a very expensive roll embroidered with the gold and the smoke is a wearable bubble the silver happened on that time the kings and the landlord's they still smoke from that so he did that Motoko who sent me the Negro and the Hubble bubble I put on the road I also smoke from the Hubble bubble in various fashions sometimes I smoked it reclining this way and sometimes that way sometimes with the 8ha and sometimes we had done some lying on the book on his chest lying on his back and like that he was going on smoking and trying to find out what is there the rich people the behaved like this what is there then I said to myself oh mine this is what they called smoking a simple Hubble bubble immediately I renounced it I kept the roof on my body a few minutes longer than I took it off I began to trample it underfoot and spit on it there's a costly rule I should not have that so the desirelessness came in that way the people they appreciate the costly interest and Saddam is neutered I put it on for a moment and then I fell no my mind should not with you now not only that to make the mind completely separated from that he was trampling on that speaking on that great hatred no I don't need this immediately denounced it I began to tell so this is an expensive road but it only increases man's Rogers raha and then he goes to another incident when not in the first came here he was dressed in dirty clothes but he is a eyes and face betokened some inner stuff at that time he did not know many songs he sang one or two let us go back once more oh my mind to our own aboard manager immediately Kotani that was the song and all our must all my days passed by to utter in pain ja vpat no ha ha beep allegedly that was the song so salon listener again is going to give the disposition of the best of the best disciple devotee and how he was not that good clothings he is coming but he looked at his eyes he saw his face he saw that everything is inside nothingness astronomy weakened his eyes were two very big beautiful but he was not looking outside this world is constantly looking inside surround is not noticed it and he is appreciating that I became mad at the sight of even waved for him in human lives garden ours why it is a holy soul it has come to me and another holy soul wants to talk to the Slava Tichenor realized that this young man is not ordinary person he has a priority so sometime even a very very ordinary person like us you will see there if someone is coming to you you feel like talking to him not that all the time you are talking with the religious matter or there about the God or any any scripture no I mean ordinary discussion but in feel talking with that person and sometimes some people will come the moment they come their very presence will irritate you and now not not I don't like to talk to them not to this person up to that person why it happens because the mental we now think about them mentally paparazzi ramakrishna the purest of the pure now that cinema Krishnaveni saw a young man coming from within Calcutta and Calcutta people particularly not in this father was a very each man and very respected person in the whole society so obviously when he came he could come on a fetal car or with proper good traces and in those days the bee colonies were very much concerned about those things but now this young man though he was a student of the Calcutta University very intelligent very good looking very attractive personality but he was not caring about his dress he was not caring about his ears because he was not liking these external world whether the people would appreciate me a mother never knew moderation about that and that means he was having something else the moment you give up the external world let the mind will go to the spiritual world to eat mind went into the spiritual world and cinema is to the master of the spiritual world immediately recognized it and he liked it so much so he liked and liked so much so history I became mad for the sight of him and whipped for him previous this has a indication integration of love love goes in two ways the devotees love for God God's not that the God's love for the devotees known as Grace and devotees now put the God known as bhakti devotion this young boy that very moment he was not having the devotion for this particular personality who is known as Sri Ramakrishna but the grace the God's love for the devotee that was already there so he said I came and between so much of love for the devotee why he's such a nice soul there is not that only Narendra his love is going to us to only thing we have to prepare use the light Narendra and what was the speciality narrator he was successful in everything the successful in study in game in music and also in meditation so he was successful in the worldly things at the same time he was completely drawn within inside and giving away the worldly things attachment now these are the hymns if we can develop those qualities like the quality of meditation redrawing our minds and then our concentration on the work with the Karma Yoga that we do whatever little work that we are doing whatever it may be we must do it very very perfectly and if we can do that what will happen same God will come to was rushing towards us and that is called that grace grace of God so this clean up to this today we will read and again you study got one sadhana business today we learn that as Salama business daily if we have little small desire is better to fulfill but not that the repetition should go on and on and on oh I like to eat the don't stop and every the doors are not doing that so that when do so we have to understand these now some people they're still food is dosa not for them some people they're having we will go to that restore our it like this and they would only visiting not like that we have to have developed the detachment it is possible or not we can go but no attachment to that this is the teaching we learn from the ones around Krishna and that is the only way that is the fact what is the table parties to follow the great soul and what is the greatest soul of this presenting poor province around Krishna did he never shun whatever the desert him he wanted to fulfill that but the moment the fulfillment in the former fulfillment it king he immediately recognized and realized the futility of that and to Italy and never again never again so that is the teaching and secondly just be concluded with that the God's love for the devotees constantly flowing in a mad way I became mad for that boy why you so pure who we have to the purity and what is the purity for giving up this worldly desires that is the purity giving up the whole worldly desires but not giving up the duties duties and responsibilities that we have accepted we must follow it follow it 100% without attachment so we will read and understand those things and these are slowly in this way we understand we practice and practice makes a man perfect every day we have to practice and that is exactly the teaching we have received from Shri Krishna opr sada to go there of the ass of the ass of Piazza that is practice practice today we can meditate for five minutes and after five years it will be five hours so that is the way we have to practice slowly and here we need grow and look at ourselves we are not ordinary people we have blessed ones because but once Ramakrishna and Gita the scripture it says we must have done something good in our past life so this opportunity and we have understood it we are not going to lose it let the whole world go in its own way we the handful of people must try to realize God and once we can do the heavy dunya the whole family will be blessed was Society will be blessed not only myself not only the individual whole human society thank you thanks let us offer our renowned to once in our Krishna need and genomic [Music] drinker be gone baby shower bottom part
