[169: Panchama Veda 169 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XxWOK2CXjgc)

about where does God leaves so they're interesting topic but before we go over there we'll be discussing the last class and that we left about the top of shares three different the pastures bar chick monastic let us begin with the soul double katana written topped achieve annum go BPD rhythm calm Asha Ravana Mangalam Sri Madhavi Tom boobie geun-tae Buddha Guardian are in our last class we read and discussed about the proof of serve one gentleman was asking Marwan Salam kishna what is the proof that the self is separated from the body what is question because self is consciousness body is inert how this two can come together but our life is showing that it is together that consciousness and also the unconsciousness they living together so that gentleman he was asking he was an actor and he was asking the where is the proof are the separate or the same because when you say that we die our body is burned body gets separated from the Sun so he was asking is this really true or it is just one body and the serve and when he died but a date so one birth only we are born we live we die complete but the Hindus and the Buddhists they say no it is continuing so why that he was asking and then in reply to the another question that Raghavan C Ramakrishna said you have to believe in the words of the Guru or the scripture why otherwise there is no other option you have to feel yourself you have to understand yourselves objective knowledge is not objective that it can be proved in the laboratory their self and the body are different different you to feel how can you feel have failed in the words of the Scriptures the scriptures those experiences of the afters APTA after Optimus realized Souls are reaching over there realizing that knowledge then they say it is true the self is completely different and it goes away from one individual and it goes and carries all the impressions of the mind and goes to another body it's going on travelling like this so naturally this is the answer you have to believe and then they say it in question to another the self-realization how it is possible now how to realize I am believing in the words of guru they respected the venerable people and also in the scripture the realized Souls the experience of the realized Souls but how I can realize it then see Ramakrishna he is telling in his own way the age-old instructions of tapasya austerity and this was recorded in the bhagavad-gita in the 17th chapter and three slokas 14 15 16 she said longing for the realization of the self the four things he said first longing for the realisation of the sub that is the fasting otherwise it is impossible if there is no longing of desire how can you think that he will achieve it then second strike to it in God you have to those who are trying with whole body then the whole with whole mind and then he said with your words also sergeich then monastic and barchi guide physical monastic mental bar chicken this is also tapasya just words I was hearing from some of the devotees then in apartment the ladies they are they are the free [Music] so they are free so obviously they are doing away so all of their husbands are going a bit with our offices then what they will do they gossip and I mean the time of gossiping they're almost torturing at the another lady some of them were very gentle courteous and so happened every day they will be talking in such a way because you know sometimes a soft target this fun for them as a pastime but that lady lost his mental balance have to go back to his country to our country so is a scene those ladies they have committed that they don't understand this so that is the way they say you have to be very very careful in the 17th chapter we find the the bhagavad-gita it says 14 15 and 16 first is the eva divita guru procure Fujinon shogen arjavam Brahm Acharya are in such a char enum topical chatty friends if we read any scripture all the time they say what is God what is Brahman what is Allah what is Jehovah qualities mist qualities very good qualities and what are those qualities can you have achieved a tekwar that in the body physical body no it comes in Internet in the mind in our consciousness if only we can understand these the whole scenario will change in the name of religion so many things are going on happening for thousands and thousands of years why misunderstanding the human being cannot survive without religion this is a relation like a water and the fish but at the same time the human being do not develop the self discriminative faculty which is already there in vain so what are the qualities that the bhagavad-gita is telling the Hindus are so fond of now almost all the literal world they are appreciating the bhagavad-gita in so many languages it has been translated why because the human being particularly those who are sensitive they understood that these are the teachings that I must have to understand and develop what first is you have to worship puja know why they have used the word puja llem respect didn't say war still in installation they said worship because showing not only respect but love to the love and respect combined together becomes Fujinon puja I not only respect you but I worship you when they say that I worship you what does it mean respect + love these puja none whom of course God means those beings which are doing something good these are gods and then the twice-born that means the most of the people the board were once and second those who have developed their culture that twice-born the human being is born but afterwards they give the training and when they are getting the training slowly slowly they're becoming culture and the best type of training they you must love all you must try to help others feel for others pray for others they are going on and then it's not the birth first birth as the pork is not that completely changed de jure the second s way so much of respect in the human society those who are cultured and educated and their contribution to the society human society give them all respect but the awards for all these awards only to encourages that so this really see the twice-born and then recedes guru that means the venerable persons those were removing your darkness so fast father and the mother second the teachers third the spiritual teacher removing all the dirt nurses wise person these are the we are going and learning from them the wise person then also you have to develop purity and we can understand the purity as love without boundary and unselfishness pure unselfishness so these two things is called purity that also you have to straightforwardness very simple very straightforward and speaks very straight way no roundabout and say seeing saying something meaning something not like that straightforwardness behavior and then celebration non-injury at the physical austerity so that is what salaam Tichenor mentioned the kite the visage tribe within God with all his body this CAI que pasa this is a physical what are the physically because you are going out to learn and Serve and then you're developing acquiring some of the good qualities like the purity straightforward VA beard celebration and injury then wanted to be a car embarked um the second comes bond Maya tapa so much importance has been given in in using the words what type of words we use and sometimes when you listen to the Hindi English cinema they're using all the time filthy filthy filthy world constantly each and every one without all is nothing very wrong very wrong if we are doing like that on a bigger car embarking would be God with Vietnamese the causes pain when you are speaking in such a way that creates that would be the pain in the mind of a person tezcan could be wanted to be a car embarking not only that certain which is true agreeable and verily beneficial Priam and hitam Priam agreeable they like it and also heater beneficial when you speak in that way beneficial certain Priam heat on junior SWAT hire a PR sanam je veux seeing a beautiful serene Empress austerity and all these practices there are two we can see the difference is that there one that you were doing a learning and doing that at the same time developing your own characteristics also the quality is also how swap hire a PR sanam Java though we are speaking in such a way that people are liking it Plus becoming helpful to them and we are telling the truth in a very nice way so it is beneficial to them but how you can do that you can just go off cannot make in such a way so that people will simply go on some people they will talk in such a way people will laugh and the result recreation for them no notice that is not the beneficial thing that you have to speak in such a way that the people that will be beneficial how you will know that will practice that how you have to study the Scriptures swarthy the suave the higher with the reverence with the respect with the love with longing to learn you have to study the scripture there are so many different type of books are there all are not scriptures infirmity books are there majority of them scriptures are those which will give you upliftment in your spiritual life so the general life is there even life that we see all over at the same time there is a spiritual life and in that spiritual life we always feel that we do not understand and he is real great since we are afraid because of the unknown thing is going to happen to me immediately we try to get the help of others so we go to those people who can tell the fortunes are those people who would be telling these and that what about them we didn't understand one King say he was believing in all the words that the people's to come and tell and the in the form of it and the fortune teller they will come some old king if this will happen there too that so a fortune teller came and he was telling King you were going to be killed in the war so don't do that and King to listen my god what will happen now in those days it was almost a regular thing for the small kingdoms the other Kings are coming enter so this king he lost almost 50% confidence there is a very intelligent Minister the Kings are successful because of the good ministers if the field to choose the good ministers they cannot be successful and this Minister told what happened to you he said that I am going to die within a day or two if I go to the world what will happen this is it move toward the this gentleman told then can you see the future oh yes I can can you say when you were going to die you are going to die ah I can I think it is many many years I will leave he took out the shore and cut his head and said see he doesn't know his own I was going to kill him right this moment he was not knowing his future how can you say his future don't worry about the future what will happen happen and our duty we should do that is called Scripture and this way soif hire a PR sanam Jai the more you read about the scripture more you understand it properly and more ever pondering over it all the truth the revelation will come the swipe of answer on Krishna say you should go and listen to the holy people then return and be alone go on pondering over there then take the decision meditation Ravana monana with it the Arjuna these are the three steps of the Vedanta surah now you have to listen and not that the immediately you listen and then react known don't react majority of the people whatever they will learn the hotel but they will hear immediately they are reacting that's why the presenting world is full of false thing somebody will write in such a way and then he will send it to entertain people think people 200 people hundred people 2,000 and everybody is so excited when you go to the route there is nothing and what is all these people they were going on in a click and going reaching out to the thousand people fools not only there not only that they are sinners because they are not only making the mistake they are also encouraging others to make the mistake no the one should be immediately the one lady sent me this is the information sharmaji very exciting at all is very encouraging very enlightening but what is the source she has not come back again I am waiting for next she will never be able to so that somebody just thought of and they wrote this is very wrong so another Baker carambar come we should not speak the frames not that I don't bother about the guard you need not to bother about God but bother about yourself because if you are doing like this in the next life you have to suffer don't blame others because of the work that you were doing the actions that you were taking for that you have to suffer and through the words honored to be your guru Markham you should not not only that what type of bhakti what type of war difference a certain which is true and how he will present the truth Priam and he turned in such a way that he will like you will appreciate and those words are going to help that person and how it is possible to constantly control your senses swag higher that's why they always say people going to be please read one or two pages of gospel of Salama krishna and then go to bed so that will be good so if you are reading the book and then going to be that will be near some subconscious mind that you can and they can go deep and deep you will understand all this is this is the way and finally says mana Prashad the somnium Mona atma beniker pavo's ensue te te de tahoe mana some would Chetty physical mental and to the speech the moment we think about the physical Takashi not eating walking barefoot walking on fire and carrying the load for a long time and then putting little water to the girl so many things basically we do but we don't read bhagavad-gita what are the physical and then we are going to do the tapasya we're in a secluded place where I don't like to see the face it's okay but what about these tranquility of the mind that is the monastic the Purcell monastic Ursa tranquility of the mind constantly whatever is happening this is going to pass the joy and happiness okay is good but is also temporary is also go away and some people sometime very successful in the games now it is the world football games of it some players are very successful in the next then World Cup will be out another group of people will come and they will be in jealousy the one who in our time okay whatever my time I have showed was okay next thing and other people are coming okay good singers good actors the players and successful the politicians that should be like this in my time whatever my capacity judgment I've tried to do good and yet I take my hands off from those next generation comes if they are good very good if they can't I have what to do it will be like this only the girl always go like that tranquility before my god this God was there when after my death this world will be there who has given all the responsible to the whole world on your a why should I have to suffer the one lady she was talking with me I cannot sleep from eg I am thinking what will happen to my father he has become so elderly the mother almost all the time seek what will happen to me then going on and suppose you were thinking and not sleeping in the night at the becoming alright no then what is happening I am I am becoming weak and then she's becoming weak and she cannot now get up in the morning and come and good even she is doing for the job that they're also she is dozing off and all that also that you think can say to yourself I am sincere and I will try to help my elderly parents as best as possible but that much I can do no one can tell no one can say all things we go in this overweight tranquility of the mind then the gentleness all the time controlling the anger the passion that all those things are constantly negating us coming irritating us constantly but you have to control otherwise it cannot be successful the gentleness this is also wonderful then comes silence while silence because when you can stop your tongue we're going on talking talking talking and each and every one particularly Indians in everything they have their own opinions ask for anything right from the food up to the world the management's everything they have the experiences and the words the people will come and tell so many things but if you ask them are you successful anywhere in your life majority of them are not the if you are not then how come that you were thinking that the your advices will be helpful for others can you not stop the count so that way it is terrible so then gentleness and silence is necessary but I am doing is it correct is it good and go for the penance they say the goddess Kali is biting our tongue that shows you have to control your tongue not not only food but also the words you just comment in such a way and that creates a lot of problem and two families the break only just for one comment and they say oh I was just telling it where jokingly but how I will know that you were telling it jokingly so that's why the silence this is very essential then complete control of the mind Atma be Nikola not only Nikola be the complete control of the mind and absence of trickery while dealing with others and that is called power some city the great world is a great world and spiritual life means bothersome suti bhava means your thought that must be pure and no nothing wrong is there I am telling something but I am thinking completely another way who is going to suffer I so that's why friends we have come over here we are all the time reading the books and taking initiation trying to be spiritual and what are all these these are the qualities we have to the sadhana Krishna said for the realization of the self these are the three things you must have to understand and practice then you find that another master mascha the recorder he is describing in serum is not rested paid only a few minutes 430 page when hurry Nara nor Indra Danner and other devotees arrived from Calcutta master MA she mentioned for a few minutes just before that he was talking the pastoral duties used to do but the Shaunie's will do but the holy people who do whoever comes they naturally guide them try to inspire them for good life holy life spiritual life how following these good qualities and after that naturally the human body even the God becomes tired so ceramic isne he was resting only for a little and immediately all this people came and you know in our country there is nothing like that or no this is in a separate apartment and people have to wait and they according to time will come it was not like that they all came into is only one room was there whether you call it bedroom and whatever only one room still it is there in vaccination so this to come straight inside the room and wait when he's sleeping how can he sleep so he got up and he started talking with the people and Saddam Oh Krishna was telling Nara and was a schoolboy 16 17 years old he often visited the master who was very fond of him why the young people must surround kissed is to like all of us we like why because the spiritual life if you start from the beginning before your mind is scattered then only it will be beneficial for you but when the people come and the kid is good nothing wrong there's a wrong conception the after people's a long life they expect after 80 go to the children home indeed before that did not mean nerves wrong that time is of no use you can go as a practice of course is is at least good but when you go in the young age inquiries there and you are opened so you can understand things try to understand things try to practice you need the body and the mind together were strong so that some kiss needs to like hurry leaped with his brother at the buzzer and that way some the explanation a explained with this master Masha is writing and now let us read from here master to the devotees I have heard a great deal about Buddha ceramic isne they say he was completely illiterate he never attended any school forget about getting any certificate but he learned many things because there is the wiseness and that Wiseman he said I heard a great deal about Buddha he is one of the ten incarnations of God and I Hindus that traditional incarnations Buddha is their Brahman is immovable immutable inanity and of the nature of consciousness what is Brahman consciousness when a man marches his booty now this is ceramic krishna he is talking about lord buddha the he realized what after that became he was a Gautama the Gautama became Buddha and what is this Buddha he is telling that actually this brahman which is immutable he never moved but he's the nature of consciousness when a man marches his own consciousness which is known as booty his intelligence in both up that consciousness then he attains the knowledge of Brahman and he becomes Buddha in two three lines the wonderful explanation about the Buddha who is Buddha who actually could put his his own intellect March with the total intellect that is called consciousness and individual intellect booty that is merging called Buddha the aspirin does not attain the knowledge of Brahman as long as he is conscious about his ego what is the gig of I as long as the eye is there we can never understand this the ego comes under one's control after one has obtained the knowledge of Brahman and seen God and look at it as long as the ego is there you cannot see understand Brahman and when you understand Brahma then only ego will go so we are in such a track with the we realize the Brahman there is no ego and why we try to from one if you don't have the ego because we there is no ego here automatically naturally realizing the Brahman so then the beautiful slope I'd says when we have realized the God why should you search for God and if you have not realized God what is the use of searching him so this way they always say but he is telling that that that means we have to strive and then we reach to that then complete ego will go otherwise never the latent wave certainly the ego leaves and that is the greatest hindrance for spiritual life the great some Swami's the great moms the spiritual parents they go up up and up and suddenly when they are going on practicing naturally the many good things started happening and people are attracted and they pull they started surrounding him and some people will be there now this is our master you should not go near you should not touch him you should not do this and that person he was not wanting in the beginning then slowly slowly he becomes accustomed with that and the people will be there a new mover the holy person is coming and these and there and then they will go on talking about him he has so many miracles power and that man start thinking yes I am having the minute less power no the Swami we need looked at me I was tormenting just in loot and that calmness come into my mind you know he will tell his friends the frames will also go nothing happened but something you could tell so he goes back he also have triggered some stories and he says and in the meantime this man is floating and ultimately he only floats without anything and that is the main hindrance the Schreiber once Ramakrishna when people used to come to him and praising just like that he would get up and say you better go out from here she won't listen to that don't say like that what is the air in this body nothing talk about God but the original people the seekers would come you will like them some people unnecessarily they will come and they will go on talking like that and afterwards or nothing so this type of people the spiritual aspirants should should avoid so this that is why I said I'm Vishnu stilling otherwise the ego cannot be controlled it is difficult to catch one's own shadow the ego is just like our shadow you cannot just say no go away but when the Sun is over it the shadow is within a few inches of the body look at this the how the example when the Sun is there over a that shadow means ego becomes very little so the more and more and more consciously you're going towards God and consciously controlling your own ego then ultimately when you go to that near to God what happens the very less ego little shadow only and then when you realize as you become the son yourself there is no shadow that is exactly what he says a devotee what is the vision of God like the very interesting question what is the vision of God now sometimes we feel like God will be like this cinema occasionally immediately stilling haven't you seen a theatrical performance the people are engaged in conversation when suddenly the curtain goes up then the entire mind the audience is directed toward the plane the people don't look at other things any longer Samadhi is to go within oneself like that when the curtain is run down people look around again just so when the curtain of Maya Falls the mind again becomes externalized how best one can understand this way thing the wing we realized that God what happens in one go whole mind is concentrated and we forget all around ours we forget ourselves whole mind goes to God and that is God realization and when the curtain comes down once again you can remain like that all the time so obviously it is coming down and when it comes down again the Maya he is slowly slowly launching on you again separating you and again you try again the curtain will go up that is the way one goes and when this happen ceramic is not those who have read the biography of Sri Ramakrishna you know she was going on crying to mother mother I have seen you that's true but I want to see you all the time you should not leave me even for a moment he was going on on on on brain the given child constantly crying - mother I'd like to be with you like to be with you like that then the mother came and told you V in power mu for the Pavo mukha you are in this world but at the same time any moment you like you can cross and come to the spiritual realm and that is why see Ramakrishna about whom Shami we become the same avatar every style he is the greatest among these why because this is a very special feature in the libraries around Asia so they dare to define the master is telling to not in the Banerjee he told that immediately the people cannot go on listening to very high thought and speech continuously this around Krishna mmediately he saw the gentleman sir you have traveled a great deal tell us something about casados in those days people is to go technology is also what many people they will be going to the different classes but the Indian people the mostly they go to the places where sanctified by something so that tourism is based always on the pilgrim centers some good places are there natural places but fill them center should be there then only you get the crowd the Tuda stay will go indian tourists wanted to see the heels are the DS and that little bit but they go so this gentleman went out and then he came back he was telling not in the told a story of two gnocchi in Bhutan who used to drink daily a pound of bitter juice of neem leaves did something not very normal so the he remembered that he was reporting to them then the master is telling one should give the pictures of holy men in one's room that constantly quickens the divine ideas this is a great suggestions the devotees should remember the if you are keeping the holy people's picture in different places suppose you are going out is see that the gods then you pray and going out bless bless bless means of the day so I am successful you are going now you can immediately see in that another world another picture I mean now I have come back from my work then we as even the company of God all the time so one should do that when the master is it is true that one spiritual feelings are awakened by looking at the picture of shadow it is like being reminded of the custard apple by looking at the imagination imitation one therefore I tell you that you should constantly live in the company of holy men how it is possible when you have to hire some holy mean and take him to your office and your prison a separate noun is not like that in the company of holy men means what after there are lot many elements are there to give you company nor office - if you give them good pranaam es there's no problem but that won't help why should round each dimension like this carry a book that's all carry a hand go small booklet and then whenever you are free just go through the few pages what will happen your mind will immediately come back and go to that conversation so that is the reason that is the way you are constantly getting the holy companion it doesn't mean the physical but intellectual and those thoughts will completely be in your mind one fine piece of mind in the company of holy men then the actor the gentleman is telling God is Kalpataru the wish-fulfilling tree a man eats whatever he asked of God suppose it comes to his mind God is Kalpataru wish-fulfilling tree well let me see if a tiger will appear before me now it so really happened that because in things of the tiger it really appears the man so that's where the Lord is very good but one should be careful what you are praying you know in English stories there one person was very prayerful he was going on praying to God the God then appeared but well I'm very happy with you what do you want I want that whatever I will touch you immediately becomes goal to God to be careful what you are asking I'll sure about it this is yes whatever I will touch that should be gold what happened you know all of us we know that whatever he is touching becoming gold even his food is becoming gold you cannot read the board and very pathetic way the story ends when his beloved daughter came running and he forgot it is not a bonus the curse that he was having in both the hands he touched up his own daughter immediately she became gold and that is a pathetic end of the story so we must be very careful what we are praying to God so Salaam occasion is telling yes you must remember that the tiger comes but more shall I tell you now this is a wonderful way is teaching keep your mind on God don't forget him God will certainly reveal himself to you if you pray to Him with all sincerity another team see the name of God at the end of each performance he's a performer so he was telling after that in with a beautiful song the people who have come the wind they are going bad they will carry within ear their heart a very good term so the the movie makers and the storytellers or the writers they should remember what they are actually contributing whether all those things that crashes if they are giving and becoming the best-selling and they get the interview what my uncle did this to me when I was over very young and these and their people are jumping on that they are purchasing that book and then purchasing and gifting to the frames what do they read what idea comes on nasty things and the head we think we're great writers just because some the power in the language I can express myself in that language worse than like their why so that is why we one should understand God has given me the intellect God has given me the power to express that I should do that in such a way that will be beneficial to the people whatever the things that he like to express express but Dean conclude in such a way represented in such a way that is becoming beneficial to the people otherwise you are contributing into all the bad things without knowing the cinema business telling like that and in the two ladies game and cinema Krishna told worship Shiva that will help you then afterwards it was five o'clock in the afternoon and some people came master was sitting if you have visited the Dutch nation there are twelve Shiva temples are there he was sitting on the stairs of that shiva temple the one such six another side six usually used to see very near to his room he was sitting this people came very close people and the other then dr. aneta aim is master marsha very close the sediment is Numa stilling I want to tell you something you're my clothes nowadays I don't see the spirit form of God spirit form of God means God in form he is revealed to me in human form now it is I see that he's in human form you have assumed a body therefore enjoy God through his human form so the spirit form game and don'ts Krishna now your human body you must show the god that is God no doubt wells in all but he manifests himself more through man than through other beings is man and insignificant thing she can think of God he can think of the infinite while other living beings cannot God exists in other living beings animal plans in all beings but he manifests himself more true man than through all these fire exists in all beings in all things but in presence is felt more in wood Rama Sita Lakshmana look at the a different brother he is such a big animal but he cannot think of God so how this is the beauty of the Hinduism so we are the being we are the people who are so lucky that we have got this human form human being the life as a human and we are destroying just like animals food drinks and maybe making no other things just a few lines reading in the poetry and singing that bill the Gita that's all so we have to understand these we have to develop develop a devil a group of @et players came today to visit the elderly people but previously they were all TT players now of their own age group another different countries they go and they play so they came here thing somewhere and then they were visiting today here they're from Pune so I was talking with him about the God and I was telling what is our work over here because they know ramakrishna mission whether you have the school of the college of diffusion having so many school colleges hospitals and dispensaries I don't know here ever mean the work is to go to people to invite people and talk to them or we reach out go to people tell them that that divine we like to manifest the divinity within us at the same time we go and tell them that this is where does God leave now the Bible that John it says abide in me and I in youth where does godly crisis godly within me abide in me and that I in you and in the bhagavad-gita you one question sir Bertram serve on JV varsity - Siham pronounciating cetera the he who is seeing God in every being that's what's damaged is telling I used to see God in spirit form now I see God in human form as a great Rivlin and then the way that says amrutasya Putra you're the descendants of the amaranth eternal being and we are forgetting that and Sufi that same also says Yahoo Jay so to me and in Islam in that the traditional Islam it says he's everywhere he's in your heart God is where goodness exists look at it only we understand this only if we read it and then realize it where is God everywhere but God is where goodnesses Salam mr. said God is everywhere at the same time it is within the heart of the human being the conditions to have God within what is that it says first failed the God is there second holding the truth because God is the truth and third practicing love the practicing love means whoever I see whatever I sink here about if suppose I'm a mother when I see that my son is doing something wrong I've been bad and similarly I see that other young people are doing wrong things oh they don't belong to us let them die go to else not like that I feel for them I pray for them so practicing love wherever there is some shortfalls we pray for that doing the Vedanta of course they say Brahman when you look to Maya is God Yeshua did it is a different philosophy and when he is leaving it is no circumstances that the God there is some we become the same it is no circus circumference but the same tear everywhere he cannot limit God but he is everywhere and what is the Jeeva according to Vivekananda he says is a there is a circumference but there is no circumference part for the Jeeva is a saint in one point that is the particular soul so no circumference but the same that everywhere is God and no circumference unlimited but it has a center that is just now these mean that is God Hinduism they think the part of the whole theory universe is the whole and human being is the part you know that then they are giving the nicely is they sail in our body in the human body 1 billion cells are there now suppose we like to explain each cell belongs to the whole body and now whole body means 1 billion cells so this part and the whole the human being is part of that God and the combination of all is that God again say it goes like that and in the Rig Veda we find from jeonnam drama there is a maha vaakya sprung dionan brahma the consciousness the wisdom is Brahman in the usual way that says a hombro marché mean I am there Brahman the part and the whole and then finally the sama Veda sees talk to a machine you also are that you are also God and after the way the sees I am art ma Brahma this self which is individual self is also that infinite self God lives in me and I live in God so when God does leave you mean and I won't leave in God so when the people are asking where can I see God and there's a funny story they say the God created this universe and then he created all the beings he created the human being also then he became every human being is so intelligent you surely find it where I am hiding so he will come and train then he was talking with other people what to do where can I hide myself otherwise they will surely come and find me then someone tore it is better that you hide inside the heart of the human being they will never search about the air they will go to search everywhere not within the earth his own heart so Joe which has a - here whatever we see is nothing but that God and I was searching you here and there outside in
