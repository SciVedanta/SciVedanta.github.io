[135. Panchama Veda 135- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mW5si3WKrZY)

good evening let us begin this famous reading and discussion on the Pancham of Aida the gospel of sri ramakrishna after repeating this mantra the book khatam rhythm dr. G venom Kaviri rhythm Calma sharm surah gana Mangalam Sri Madhavi thumb boobie grinning da Gauri dodging aha Saddam Krishna was discussing with the three more and other devotees and master Masha he developed a wonderful attitude as because he was a devotee and at the same time he was very sincere to realize God so slowly slowly every word that C Ramakrishna said over that he was meditating and slowly as if when you go through the pages we can understand how his thinking is changing in the beginning he came and he was thinking in one way and now he's thinking freedom o Krishna suddenly the best of men he could not say he is God himself but whatever the memory made of those people he is very much satisfied as the best guru always teaches his disciples and the followers by which they should be free from all things I should be by which they are free from all mistakes we find it over here Seymour is giving the description of the Friday December 14 1883 this is the three hundred thirty fourth page of the gospel of the agostina at nine o'clock in the morning see ramakrishna was standing on the southeast bar on des near the door of his room with Rakhal by his side the way he gives the description by words only as a picture picture drifting with the words so Rakhal and law two were moving about in arrived and prostrating himself before the master see Ramakrishna said to him affectionately you have come that's very good today is an auspicious day in a good day if a devotee is coming out you see how God is happy why because he has come on that particular day which is when the God is also very happy the he the devotee the person who comes over there gets the blessings the benefit of that particular environment the mind is ready suppose someone goes to somebody's house normal but any function when they are in a joyful mood in the best mood if you go you also get that so that is the idea and Serano krishna the god himself is so happy seeing a devotee coming on auspicious day it was the last day of the bengali month and the day of the full moon m-master ma shui was going to spend a few days with the master practicing spiritual discipline see here the indication that the devotee who lives in Calcutta can visit any time but still he is coming and staying there with the master in the Dutchie nature itself and practicing spirituality master going to spend a few days with the master practicing spiritual discipline some of the people they come of course this is nothing wrong they come and they stay over here we have developed some guest rooms so that they can come they can stay and practice spirituality but people who are coming from distance places this the first time perhaps they have come to the Chicago they want to go to city they come with the family so other members are also there so they go out and visit that is a different thing they're staying keeping the bag over here but going out right from morning till evening and coming and spending the night that is a different thing but with a purpose to spend at a time what are we to have the develop the discipline that is also wonderful some people they come and they all the time come and sit before the Swami's but the Swami's has all of them are having their work because they stay over here so obviously whole day they have different type of discipline theater breaker work is their feud maybe one or two hours is okay but all the time if you like to Spain that is also not good you have to practice make a routine that I will get up I will go I will meditate that is exactly what see Ramakrishna is teaching and master practicing spiritual discipline master has said to him master means the sasame krishna said to e if an aspiring practices a little spiritual discipline then someone comes forward to help him if someone means the God himself someone means the designated people of God they will be helping you maybe they will say something mmediately will understand too that way you will get the help now I have underlined those lines see Ramakrishna is telling the master had say to him you should not eat everyday at the guesthouse of the Kali temple the guesthouse is intended to supply free food to monks and the destitutes are the people who are coming over there bring your own cook with you and arrange your food in those days bengali aristocrats they were not knowing how to cook bring the cook because cheap labor so we could provide that so bring your own cook don't it you have noticed that on the basis of this advice I feel that people who are coming on Sundays particularly from distance places then we talked and then some of the people they go and they choose the day uh try that try to purchase books that's also necessary for us all this and then when dear living is almost one o'clock and nearly there is no good restoral so they had to go somewhere else so I arranged here food but I have charged $5 very minimum like because of this the tacos advises this so he said you should not eat everyday at the distance when there is a function Kali Puja Durga Puja some ceramic is Namara the TT puja people should come and take Prashad but in the regular days when you are coming you should give something because if you can provide is okay or are not otherwise suppose you are a monk and you cannot provide or a person who doesn't he is not having any money but them it is all right so this he is telling bring your own cook with you in accordingly done so the master arranged the place for the man to cook and asked Rambla to speak to the milkman about milk ceramic is not arranging so this is the place where you can cook and he is asking Ram to arrange all these other provisions so this is a picture we get and that is how we learnt what is spirituality it is not only the big ideas and this is art man this is Brahman whether Brahman is they are not in the all that is alright but how to practice some of the people they always think oh this we should always talk about the Brahman but what about the practices see if you are reading the gospel almost in every line it is something very very special and if you notice it and follow it then immediately you will be benefited in your spiritual life or otherwise you'll be just like a prophecy understanding the philosophy understanding the Brahman ask man all the device that they are doing over there good but what about the spiritual life this is the practice so I feel in that way so I am giving the stress of this small small thing and the Masters the little later Ramlal began to read from the adhyatma Ramayana look at it when all these things are over Ramlal the person who is to live with ramakrishna they are reading the abdi Hartnell ramayana a group of people they stayed over here only I am here sometimes were than the joins me that's all or otherwise when a group of people are here I told in the before the night food you should read some pages that is the way we always do after the food another book three pages we should read together and that is called spiritual retreat is not only the food and the stain but at the same time the Ram Dass he brought the odd jasmine Ramayana high adroit acknowledged here he is reading from that Rama had married Sita after breaking the great the bow of Sheba on the way to a ADA with his bride Rama was confronted by the warrior stage pursue Rama so it goes then afterwards parasha Rama understood that is not not meant he goes away Serrano Krishna listen to the parsha Rama and then he went to a spiritual mode and now and then chanted the name of Rama in his melodious voice then the ceramic is knocks Tamla to read about GU Hakka and Laurel read from the earth is that again about the guaca guaca one person is meeting Ramachandra who is that polish rama he is also considered as an avatar and another person he is also meeting the same Brahma is a GU Hakka the locust man used to live in a far away place on the city but his devotion for Sri Ramachandra that is exactly what the Ramakrishna wanted his devotees to learn and he said about the guaca this barrier king waited patiently I am reading from the middle but when the fourteenth year had run out when he heard that the Rama is going inside the forest for fourteen years and he is wearing very simple dress he also started wearing the same type of dress you also started eating food as simple as possible as he was thinking the Rama will also have and the bed and all those things exactly he was practicing as a Rama deed so that is the way of a devotee and this GU Hara chana dolla he is having that he was on the point of entering into the fire why the last line it says the guaca waited for fourteen years when the date was passed then he thought then the Rama is not coming back drama is not coming back Rama is not living what's the point of my living over here so he thought that he will sacrifice his life and he entered into the fire that very moment an Amana arrived with Rama's message in a celestial chariot Rama Sita soon appeared and the Gurkhas joy was unbounded the God is coming in the form of human but how many people they can understand this is how he is meant then after the midday meal Sri Ramakrishna lay down on his bed to rest aim was seated on the floor this is exactly what we always practice of course after the lunch we always go to bed as Tucker is to do but then we find see Ramakrishna presently dr. Shama and a few devotees arrived master set up no rest at all the the ministerial job we were coming and then they are talking with see Ramakrishna trying to get some guidance about the spiritual life he they were ready and ceramic is not got up sat on the bed and began to converse with them master it is by no means necessary for a man always to be engaged in his duties without a job most of the Bengali instigates the neighbor is to work even today I knew few of them as because they are having lot of money they don't work at all I used to wonder how they are spending their time all day 24 hours just by making fun and these and there and nothing else cinema Krishna is 21 must do some duty some response responsibility he must perform I have seen the elderly Swami's in the ramakrishna mission they are retired they need not to really work but we will always attain the spiritual discourses that is a shot of a duty not that they don't know that but still knowing that someone is reading the gospel there's a class of other people are also coming this elder - hobbies they will also come they'll also sit at the back they'll also reason that's also joining in - that is also a shot of work a duty and holy duty nothing wrong in just listening that so they go again I have seen them whatever the menial work a little work is possible for them they always - when there is some something is there left they will pick it up and clean that place or dressing the vegetable you know the tacos at the puja time so so many people are coming so when it thousands have almost every day and most of the people will complain when you go at 11 o'clock 11:30 they are closed and they never gave us the Prashad how they can be just the common sense if you have not informed at least one hour before how they will know how many people will come they calculate that this many people may come so basically they organized but you have to arrange that all the vegetables then you have to cool then you have to offer to God then only Prashad will come there's not a photo anytime you can go and pick up things ready immediately they will warm it and give it not like that all fresh food so early morning all the Brahma chains young monks elderly Swami's they all will seat and do the dressing of the vegetable as much as they can then other people are also bare they are also cooking they are also doing the same thing but because it's not possible for all the monks to do that so other people are also there but they do why ceramic isness eight someone should not spend time in that atmosphere they should do I have seen shown is they after the breakfast they will bathe in and then go in sit in the temple they will do the Japeth that's also what they're doing that way their own benefit and for the prayer will be for the benefit of all others and he is telling that one should not is by no means for a man always to be engaged in these duties actions then he says action drop every when one realizes God as the flower drops of itself when the fruit appears this is I have seen the environment and the situation in America most of the devotees they're always ready to do some work and they are highly placed highly educated but doing some very ordinary work they'd never hesitate that is really excellent very very appreciative this is the humbleness I am doing this work what is there they will come and they will clean this floor and they are cut fruit cleaning the carpet they're doing these doing that so many things they will do even sometimes when there was no no one to clean the toilets and the guests are coming our volunteers they did it in their own hands unthinkable why if the people are coming staying over here they will give some donation awesomobile are earned some money they are not getting anything but they are if this is not spiritual work then what is the spiritual work not that they are telling anything that I have done yet I have doing it this thing never no credit so this is quietly they are doing this spiritual work and see Ramakrishna says that one should do some engagement some duties he who has realized God no longer perform religious duties here say Ramakrishna says about spiritual duties morning should get up and feed for medication and during the job and all that but those who have realized God for David is not though by cioth practice and for the benefit of others they do those who have realized God no longer perform religious duties such as Sandia you know the Sandia Vandana early morning and in the evening that is very very important the life of the Hindus they always do muslims they do it for five times the namaz they will do what he did ritualistic early that it is all their hindus at least rice morning and evening just called Sandia in his case the Sun he emerges in the Gayatri when that happens it is enough for a person to repeat just a Gayatri mantra Segawa Krishna is giving the steps first is the Sun Dias Anthony's elaborate he has to spread the asana then he should bathe and then where you wash clothes then you see it then with all this peripherally all those things he should do discuss and abandon ah then when he is mercy that that only anywhere it is just repeating that Gayatri mantra Gayatri is a very famous Vedic mantra so he is mentioning about that mantra the name of God the holy name of God if he is repeating sufficient and then he says Gayatri mantra then the Gayatri Marge's in all that means is becoming just one of the first was the elaborate thing then only the mantra that only own car and then after that one no longer chance even the Gayatri it is enough then to chant simply home how long should a man should a man practice such devotions as the Sangha ceramic Isha himself asking this question and giving the answer in this way as long as he does not feel a thrill in his body and shake tears of joy while repeating the name of Rama or of hurry people worship God to win money or a lawsuit that is not good they do this they can do it but that is not good in that sense for the God realization the highest spiritual goal is the God realization for the God realization if you are doing that you should not care for all this that I should be successful in a larger than all but only the joy in taking the name of God and when they are repeating the name of God a thrill is coming in the body filling tremendous joy within that shows that we are proceeding in a right track I find over here in the Bhagavata when see ramakrishna is telling as long and he does not feel a thrill in his body and tears of joy bhagavata series Javed car monocle reader now this bit data yah baka but guitar-driven aduba strata yeah but not jaya t when they listen to my world Matata what means the God Himself when they are just by listening my name all about me they are developing faith complete faith the ones this discussion was going on among the direct disciples of the one C Ramakrishna they were telling see some people they say you are lucky that you make serum kidneys sauces am Krishna stayed with him you were guided by him the idea is that way we are lucky but look at these people now they have not seen see Ramakrishna they were not able in the company of the Ramakrishna just they listen from us and the belief and they are developing faith developing devotion for cinema Krishna meditating on Salaam o Krishna do you think they're less much much higher than us and then people will come in future when we also will not be here the direct disciples even then the people will come they will read about ceramic Asia and they will develop the faith in him they are far more blessed people because just after hearing or listening or knowing about in a book about the God they're developing the faith in that God is not ordinary people they must be having something within and that is why it is possible so long one should practice work as spiritual discipline till one become completely free from desire as long as it does not feel it thrilled in his body and shed tears of joy by hearing the holy name of God and develop create in him market r7r dough must the gods guitar about the story about god or his instruction sir bernardo hearing sertão urban majority as long as the faith in the words of God is coming that is so that is the beauty of the God whenever you hear about that if you develop the faith it must be there in the bhagavad-gita also we find in the third chapter seventeen and eighteen slokas it also says the same way as other want Ramakrishna is mentioning you know that the famous dialogue conversation between Xiaomi Jian other guru wise Saddam o Krishna told Saamy she told just a utterance of ceramic ich 'no and we can write a lot of philosophy on that then someone tool is it how it is possible is so simple whatever see Ramakrishna said as just very simple words how you think that we can develop philosophy on that then Swamiji talk just there any code any ceramic richness sentence and I will show you and they quoted at Xiaomi ji the well-versed and his memory was so sure immediately started quoting from different scriptures and giving the support when I give the class on this gospel of ceramic is not I try to follow that quoting from different scripture not just to support the ceramic resna but also to make people aware that what is the sadhana Krishna said at the báb you are behind of that there are so many scriptural references are there like the bhagavata in the Bhagavad Gita it says bhagavata is a life of Krishna and Swami we become the saved is a very pure book unless and until you become pure is better not to read their book the descriptions that are there in the raga water and stories of the stories the the people without with impure mind they will go in somewhere they will misunderstand Shri Krishna they won't understand the Krishna that is the reason Samedi said and here in the Bhagavad Gita his teachings and here third chapter 17 and 18 slow cases yes taught Marathi rivers yard art mitrik custom honorable Artman may purchase on to stir the steel karyam nabhi deity cinema Krishna was mentioning mentioning for him there is no duty who who has realized God and here also we find the three Krishna in the bhagavad-gita he says whoever delights in the self alone feels satisfied in the self for such a person there is no obligatory duty to discharge yes start Marathi reverse at Atma ratty that means there is enjoying itself itself art matrix' is satisfied with that Artman that knowledge that mana bar that human being art money which assam to stir he's so happy with that realization of the self because a full of joy what is the self what is the God the Bliss he is the embodiment of bliss joy all under the religion that's why when Swami Vivekananda one to these people in America saw monarchs you're the religious man how is it that you are all the time laughing and having fun why not with the children of immortal bliss so when we are the children of immortal Glee so I should have to have a long face oh the world is burning everyone is suffering with that they will go to hell am NOT that calculation is going on so all the time in a grave face that is not the sign of spirituality spirituality is the sign of joy architecture art money--which a son to stir he's so satisfied the seer karyam no big beauty for him there is no duty he can do whatever he likes he can we find he has no object to gain here in this world by action when we do always we think that by doing these we are having this even the spiritual work that we do we think by doing that type of work spiritual work selfless work my mind will be purified something behind the mind is there and we want to get that result but someone cuz no inverter circuit in artha nach attorney a questioner he has no object to gain here in this world by action not does he lose anything by abstaining from action action action being the duties abstaining from that action he is not losing anything for him there is no dependence on any created being for any object of ease completely satisfied the when it was asked to Yudhisthira who is a satisfied person Yudhisthira also told in this way son to stir son to stir satatam yogi some toast amines containment this is to desire at all so always satisfied so that is the ultimate way of spirituality and one should understand spirituality means complete satisfaction and knowingly though there are some problems are there but at the same time overcoming those problems with that complete satisfied mind with the people of praising or criticizing or the success or the failures every time everywhere every situation he is them all the time enjoy and that is called God realization see Ramakrishna is mentioning about it after hearing see Ramakrishna one devotee is telling ceramic is not mentioned that for that purpose to get the satisfaction that joy the spiritual benefit one should try spirituality or work first or equality but some people they worship God to win money order shoe that is not good he was mentioning a devotee immediately mentioned we find that everyone's drive after money even cash up shane married his daughter to a prince you know the many of you that keshavjee under shane they were actually trying to give a good shape in the hindu society in the society they were in a dilemma what to do and what not to do because of the other rulers the Sukanya came and all that so the early age girl should be married and this way to save them they were thinking that way now this brahma samajis came with little modern ideologies and mixing with the european thoughts they thought that girls should be educated before completing the education they should not get married so that was their idea - of gender Shane was a leader of the Brahmo Samaj but in the meantime in his family a proposal came from the king of a particular place that is also in the northern bengal and he said that we are ready - because she was very beautiful that ketchups daughter now he shoves family and the relatives they started giving pressurizing cassia why not this is an opportunity this is a very good the prince it will be very good for our daughter so Keisha was pressurized and he said yes his daughter was married to the prince and people started criticizing particularly those wearing that so another group they broke out from that groove again so one after another the Brahmo Samaj started breaking ketchups group broke because of that here the gentleman he is talking with Ramakrishna he is mentioning that in the crash of also wanted to get the money and all that though he said something he did something else that way but the see Ramakrishna immediately his clingy shops case is quite different look at it he could criticize Keshav and said look at it no this is God Keisha was not his devotee but Keisha was another group that he formed that his Brahmo Samaj and he was the leader of the Brahmo Samaj even then Ramakrishna never hesitated to appreciate him because he saw him completely in a different point of view he said - ups case is quite different what is the difference God provides everything for a genuine devotee even without his making any effort Keisha he was a father he had the responsibility and when the daughter was married he was free so he could give all his time for the spiritual practices and also for the propagation of that spirituality religion so God provided that and case I've got that only opportunity and nothing else cinema business point of view is a positive way and Keisha was not having in his mind cinema Krishna could see the mind he could see that pressure was not having any other ideas so that is the reasons Ramakrishna Asia the rules were formed Keisha was into that but Keisha breaking in this case is young Krishna always denounces once you have promised you must have to keep cinema Krishna now he is not telling that means we have to understand there was genuine thing it was the way that God it wasn't us because Kesha wanted to completely devote his time for the spirituality that responsibility was over and that was the arrangement of God ketchups case is quite different God provides everything for a genuine devotee even without his making any effort the son of a real king gets his monthly alliance's the prince will get the Alliance from his father that's sure there's a story that king of the country he saw that the one sannyasi a constantly meditating existed then King was inspired he wanted to become that Queen was very practical it was King you can always practice this way why not you can go and stay with it but that man is habituated to leave under just open sky Jordan would leave like that but you are not within a day or two he will break your health and everything would be very bad for you rather we will construct the heart over there you couldn't live in there used to the going out for begging here and there I will send you some food from here you take that food Queen started doing that King agreed so he went he started practicing meditation there Queen used to say in the food like the Kings choices she used to sing their food on a golden plate and everything and the poverty as because it is going to king and by the side of the king that man is also and for him also she constructed a heart he was living in that in comfort Queen is to same two plates one in ordinary plate and some ordinary food for the king good food he noticed when he complained to Queen I am a senior mom I have taken sannyasa before him seeing me only he got inspired now you're sending the ordinary food in the ordinary plate and why for the king then the Queen sent out that world tell that man if you were outside you were only a cultivator your life was very hard as because you are taking the name of God I am giving you the respect and also sending the food from king's palace maybe on an ordinary great comparing with the king but you are getting the food from the hand of the Queen remember it and he was the king himself and whatever food that he is getting is nothing now compare with as the king he is supposed to get very ordinary food in that way with the ordinary treatment in that way so whatever he is getting because of his karma whatever you are getting because of his karma be satisfied or otherwise this will also be stopped so that way it goes see Ramakrishna is failing you cannot compare on Swamiji he told that when he joined in the Bangladesh small Osama was there he was tall and he was from various family and complexion was very good very good-looking but he smile very handsome now the Xiaomi in charge over there he was not very happy because all people used to talk to him and his way of talking was very courteous people's like him that Swami is - maybe this is too jealous one day he said a on so insulted village we will go over there and pooja is there I will go for the pooja you will help me I will go by the boat by paying one are not in those days but I am NOT going to pay for you so you will start walking three days before one by the side of that there is a road was there but very difficult you have to stay in the night in the market and somehow and then you can reach over there three days before he is allowed him to start walking he was walking after some time when he reached to that marketplace he went for washing he went down to the river luckily for him there was a boat where that village germander was going and he noticed that brahmacari he is washing his feet and hand she stirred the vermicelli three years go and pick him up I am going to my village and he is also coming to my village in the same boat we'll go so naturally small boat came the big board that is to sell small board the came and told that our jamming that is asking you to go naturally when he went to the German de with any comfortable way Germans are told you are coming to my home so lucky that I can stayed with you in one day here East when they risk those who have the idea how even today in the if you go by both there's no proper place to get down so maybe if the water is full then you can go and reach to that Shore or you may have to get down into the Mount when they risk over there it was the low tide during the palanquin people the king younger to take the barometer Avast so if they he went without touching that mod then afterwards Windsor came in the same palanquin he came he started staying over there you were supposed to walk for three days but he reached in one day and two days he was in great comfort and reading out the gospel before other devotees this Swami he started he came by market Boardman public public transferred as they call market both and he had to pay one rupee and two days sailing because they will be stopping in different places no food powerful somehow he reached over there there was no one to receive him he had to get down in to get Ahmad somehow he climbed over there washed his feet in the pond being here is to the gem in the house he saw the Ramachari is reading out the gospel and people are sitting and listening to him and the German that is also the landlord is also sitting he became very angry hey how come you are here how could you come over here I told not to spend the money I didn't spend any money then how could you come before me you were supposed to come after me I was walking but the gist German that met me and us so this stage this thing happened then he said the sharmaji don't be angry with me because it is my luck and that is my life that giving me all comfort and it is your luck or problem for you so what to do but that is ceramic reason s Bailey received home this taper don't compare the Keisha Keisha Wiesel a blessed person God is arranging everything for him I am speaking of real Prem's a true devotee has no desire he does not care for money money comes to him of itself the Gita describes such a devotee s contained with what comes to him without any effort then one devotee is asking and that is the main subject we are discussing said how should one live in the world how should one live in the world this is very very important religion is all right visual it is all right instructions is all right and we know that some of the one gentle lady came and she was doing nowadays I am studying the Buddhism I feel good not what is there in the Buddhism there is all everything is nothing but me full of misery and they has the cause for misery and there is a way to go beyond misery is all we know but how to go beyond that that is the main thing and that is exactly what the Ramakrishna is teaching every page of the gospel so you read that at the same time read gospel - that will help you here you see the when the gentleman is asking how should on leaving the world see Ramakrishna leaving the world as the mudfish leaves in the mod one develops love of God by going away from the world into solitude now and then and meditating on God after that one can live in the world unattached the bodies their fish has to live in it but his body is not steamed by the bond such a man can lead the life of a householder in a spirit of detachment that is the idol detachment I should be in everything I should do everything but at the same time I am NOT attached to this when I am doing hundred-person mind in that complete attention will be given if all did we give but at the same time when it is done it is done and I'm totally free the next moment if they ask me to go away from here I go away from there no problem for me so that is the way one should leave otherwise is very difficult then he was immediately directing to master Masha the master mashes mind was getting ready so the Guru was talking to him one can realize God if one feels intense dis passion for worldly things jaha ROM Tommy he come jaha come Danny ROM where there is desire there cannot be God and when the God that cannot be to decide the two different things for authority operability so that in the Bhagavad Gita Krishna says everything is mine but if you choose these he don't get direct one of the direct disciple he was very fond of drinking Dean he was doing Santa Porsche and there he was not getting tea in the junk so one day he was complaining to surround Krishna you had motor Babu you got so many things every day whatever you wanted Mateusz barber used to supply now I am practicing spirituality there is no one even to supply a cup of tea how could I appear before him and said do you want rich people to serve you I can send rich people but you won't get me then he jumped and said no no no no I want you only whether T 1 or T no problem but I want only you and not all those people so that he says one can realize God if one feels intense this passion for the worldly things it is Sami Subedar Nanda you are very fond of drinking tea a man with such dispassion feels that the world is like a forest and fire and if he really feels that kind of dispersion he renounces home and family it is not enough for him to live in the world in the spirit of detachment it is not enough for him so the mental attitudes conditions standards we can say that we have to understand some people suddenly becoming a very good monk not all are very good and art comes and with emotion they go out and then they cannot cope with that life they in the leave that life but unnecessarily bringing down the ideology and he is also not getting anything as the hypocritic life that he lives is because they cannot come out of that that is not monks life Shami Ranganathan and the G told us when I asked him I was a next morning we were supposed to go for the sannyasa and you know the before sannyas or 7 days before you have to go and spend a dare in the village mark will be teaching you what are some nails are the mantras and these and their so that was a great thing for also raghunathan ji was bearing Abdul Acosta three of the Ramachari so you were there getting ready to go to the little mud to get sannyasa then he told sharmaji please tailors after the food we do written reading and after the reading usually the senior Swami's they teach something when you asked he said very good very wonderfully he said those who were in girls in their past life can become great sannyas in this life that means all the robots are over if you have any desire then you cannot realize God in this life so that is the main thing so the dispassion why you become a monk the question it is depending on the mental attitudes and of course the Karma's so he is telling in this way that last and gold alone is Maya a man put on a tiger skin and tried to frighten other man but the latter said ah I have recognized you you were our real at that the man did dressed in the skin went away smiling to frighten someone else and that was the entertainment in the villages in those days nothing was there so boohoo rupee and the different ever forms these two bears and some people they were very good in that just to come and do some performances and getting them money see Ramakrishna is giving that example telling Maya if you want to realize the Maya the Maya goes away and if you don't realize that immediately it captures the man came with the tiger scream to frighten mostly people will be frightened but if you can understand oh this is an hour early from so-and-so village he has come to entertainers then the man say okay you have realized that thing go to somebody else otherwise there is no fun I am now a tiger acting as a tiger if you are not afraid then there is some fun so this way Maya also goes away then immediately he said all women are the embodiments of Shakti it is the primal power that has become women and appears to us in the form of women it is said in the adult Marah my honor ceramic is know was very fond of a dad marijuana that narada and others praised Dhamma seeing Oh Rama thou alone are all that we see as nil and Sheeta all that we see as female then he continued to the devotees one cannot render near renounce when mere wish one cannot renounce my mayor wish the Buddhism it was plated in such a way this world is a full of misery hundreds and thousands of people started renouncing and if you do the work what is the reason of suffering work the moment you do the work the result and result is suffering so the million thousands of people is to follow Buddha and afterwards they started taking the get work and they then they were not mentally ready they were actually they were not ready so that is the reason the whole thing came down ideology came down see Ramakrishna selling one cannot renounce by the mere wish there are proper karma inherited tendencies and the like you know the three Karma's shan cheat Haga me and the product sanchita means was already stored up egami which will be coming and product which has started giving fruits now whatever we are because of them are up there but the stitching is also same I have caught it already that if you like to know the past look at your present whatever you are is the result of the past if you like to know your future look at your present because whatever you will do that thing will happen afterwards you will have to enjoy the result of this karma so son cheat agony and product but if you have this type of mind that everything is burning then only you are really capable to renounce the world otherwise it is very difficult to renounce the world and Shankar Acharya in his very famous Luca he said guru bara samsara da GOG meet Optum those who Oman introduced got a beat on the Putnam prepare him with two Sharan mnemonic yamuna Johnny so wherever I see I see the everything is burning it's just like the wildfire chasing me and the man is running out of it name famed physical comfort he is running out of that his feeling that is going to kill me if that temperament mentality is not there you can never become a bomb you are not supposed to renounce the world so this is the Karma pala it goes on in this way the see ramakrishna is reminding us that one should leave a life in the world detached way must be performing all the duties that comes in hand with great attention and dedication but at the same time completely withdrawn how that is possible you have to go on taking the name of God constantly that is the only lubrication that you can apply so that nothing is going to stick to your mind thank you very much there is chann TSP our mantra and conclude need Ingenium on antelope um passed on gumpa Drita become boy ye shall
