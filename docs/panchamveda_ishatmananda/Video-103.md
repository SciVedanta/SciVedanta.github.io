[104: Panchama Veda 104: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mINlqIKObuw)

let us chant this mantra double guitar rhythm dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten Calma sharp ahom shravana mangalam srimad atum booby grinning ta buried aryana the last time we were reading the gospel of the ramakrishna which we know as the Pancham aveda and we were hearing the ceramic ISNA he's talking with the devotees and giving in wonderful guidelines for the spiritual development in different times in different way and according to the person he is talking with and the situation he is giving the guidance and here we find at dusk the evening service began in the different temples in the docks in asia the sri ma is describing there's a main temple is a kali temple and also the bhava tyranny the name of the goddess Kali Babu tyranny and also the krishna and 12 shiva linga different names of the shivers on the bank of the ganges and there every evening Aarti is going on that he is describing when Saddam o Krishna was there in the evening the RT is going on the master was sitting on the small couch in his room that those who have visited they know their two beds at their one is little small and this little higher that's all side by side I of course do not know and I don't remember maybe that from afar schwa me is the research on that what is the position of the bay it's and all that how it was but now they have kept it side by side but it is small and a little bigger and he was sitting on the small couch and that was his main place from where used to talk at the devotees and there is a special thing that we never saw that he is lying down and talking with the devotees though the bed was just by the side and not that he's sitting on the bed most of the time he used that small couch maybe that that is the position that is the asana we can say from where used to give that spiritual instructions and he's sitting on that absorbed in contemplation of the Divine Mother as because in the evening Aarti you know that Hindu temples till we bill is ringing and bhajans are going on and are at the time also the the priest 12 priests in 12 different temples of the Shiva and in the this another puja is going on in the krishna temple and also Avatara knee so almost 14 temples they are going on pooja sir that is wonderful atmosphere and Saddam Krishna sitting in his own room on his own couch meditating contemplating several devotees also where they're sitting near see Ramakrishna a little later cinema Krishna began to talk to a devotee privately sometimes he is to talk with the devotees privately are sometimes used to give just for everyone he is to talk and something for this motion is special so he took him outside on the veranda north of his room he said it is good to meditate in the small hours of the morning and at dawn now in the evening time evening means sometimes the day is going out and the night is approaching that is the time and also in the morning hour early morning when the night is passing away and day is approaching that is the best time for remembering God and meditation because the nature remains very calm and quiet and that time automatically as because we are within the nature our mind is also become very tranquil quite naturally so it becomes easy for us but that is a practice he is telling that the Ramakrishna began it is good to meditate in the small hours of the morning and dawn one should also meditate daily after dusk he instructed the devotee about meditation on the personal God and on the impersonal reality this devotee is this three more the he sometimes mention himself as a devotee as three more as master Masha in different names and after a time he sat on the semi-circular porch waste of his room if you go you will find there's a long verandah and another the small semi-circular facing the Ganga he is to seat over there and it was about nine o'clock those who come here this is very very important those who are really devoted to see Ramakrishna philosophy and ideology those who come to see Ramakrishna philosophy for them those who come over here will certainly have all their doubts removed what do you say he is asking the master Masha Shamsheer raksha nasza maja strim so this is the specialty of the ramakrishna mission a thermos and here in the europe and america we are known as the vedanta society here we find this sham Shia Rasha Rasha ask them when see ramakrishna is talking he is giving the two different people instructing we can't we listen not much of ritualism he never also inspired people to go and attend all the poojas all the rituals in the temples rather he used to inspire them ask them to come and sit before him and listen to him have the conversation if they have any doubts and the questions so that is very very important that's why most of our moms we always try to tell people and if you go to all the activities particularly in India Bangladesh Nepal and in that area we do lot of philanthropic work but that is necessary but in the European America is all the only preaching reaching out to people telling them going to the power of the people talking with them and in different type of occasions also constantly we are trying to tell the people what is the truth of life the spirituality and that is why it's Ramakrishna is telling this is an institution when the people are coming over here again and again listening and then pondering meditating on that slowly the doubts are revolt is there any God is there really people can realize God what happens after realization what is there if we are I am not believing in God so all these things again and again that is necessary today a group of devotees they came and they were telling that and different temples they visit we are so happy so wonderful programs are going on this is good this is necessary to go and attain the programs but when we go and attend the program what we see some of the performances from of the activities and we are very happy because our mind is always active so obviously when we find some activity we find it oh this is good but when we have to sit quietly listening and then pondering over that that's a totally different type of temperaments is necessary that is why the last big function that you organized and the 150th birthday anniversary of swami ji we give the name Chicago calling and in that huge Hall almost 700 people right from the morning ten o'clock and then up to the four five in the evening afternoon they were going on listening to the dialogues and lectures of the Swami's and different people even the hotel authority they were wondering how so many people right from the morning till evening sitting in one place and going on listening there is no music there is no dance there is no other amusement how it is possible so that is the training of the mind go see it listen and then go down with him and slowly slowly developed spirituality ceramic ISNA he is giving the indication those who come here will certainly have all their doubts removed and in the open ashari it says that all the doubts are removed and that is the blessett condition of the mind when all the doubts are be removed and who is removing the doubts and it says that only when our mind is ready can accept the advice of the realized Souls then the doubts are removed otherwise not both are necessary that vices of the realized Souls some people will come they have that memorized all the slow curls and the different quotations and they're very good speaker because as they are having the control over the language how thousands of people will be listening they'll be mesmerizing them with the words that is a different thing but when he realized soul speaks like LA to mirage he was not at all educated but whatever he saved if a person ready to accept that they were pleasant so that is the speciality the when you listen properly so many people came to surround krishna sony so many people listened one lady she is writing I really feel joy when I read and come to know about so she has come to know about the gospel of Sri Ramakrishna recently educated lady now after reading she is telling I don't find time when I go to office I always think when I will go back to read that book before going to office when I am reading I am thinking when I am going to it is not possible for me to stop and go as he like that why this mind has become ready not all these years but suddenly his mind is open and this happiness is entering attractions are developing and that is the sign of spiritual progress we know in the yoga when the mind is coming up to the heart and then to the throat they say shut the booming in one place we always like to listen to these holy words and I like it love it we cherish it and don't like to leave it that is the good situation condition of our mind and we should be very very careful not to lose it because again the situation all around will try to cover it but that is called Maya whoever is trying to break the Maya trying to go towards God trying to know or realize these own self then all around the nature comes and tried suppress that fight is always going on debashree it diba an asura what they were my good mind my good thoughts my good actions and Asherah exactly opposed it in the mine in the same person so whenever I find that David oz the good things are coming I must be open to that so here see Ramakrishna's telling & M he is telling that is true sir a boat was moving in the Ganges now that's three more the master Masha depicting a picture through the words he is painting a picture as if of the words a boat was moving in the Ganges far away from the bank the boat man began to sing the sound of his voice floating over the river reached the Masters years and he went into spiritual mode so the mind when it is ready the moment some little hints are coming through the song a boat man he is not a singer is just a boat man but when he was singing and that those words are coming and touching the heart of the ceramic ISNA immediately he is going into the samadhi he is here on the bond his body stood on end he said to aim just fill my body when the aim he was touching perhaps the the person of ceramic ish nahin felt all the hair standing on end yet because joy neat tooth sabaha birthday shaam knit three knit the mangalam there is a wonderful quotation from the bhagavata it says an it would saba booth server means the celebration when there is a celebration the people are all happy so many different things going on goes on why because people are happy need to route suburb of a station where tea shop where in the mind neat toots our need to Sri that is we never that person his mind is full of tranquility happiness joy purity so obviously his presence his talk is always bless it for the others that's why the people they like to take the holy person to their home yesterday one lady was crying because something is happening in a family the son is in trouble and all that drama g can you please come she isn't believing that if i go everything will be solved I told you better pray to God the presence of God I too will pray for you so this they are trying to have this everything is there in America can you imagine all the way from India they have come the subtle over here everything was so nice comparing with the atmosphere and condition of our society there but still we are suffering why because this little thing we have forgotten that is God that his self that is self-realization the spiritual life that is why this benjamin be the gospel is so important nothing wrong in reading it it will help so he's and then he was upanishad described brahman is permeating the universe and the eater has that Brahman as sound touch the Masters body the master Masha is thinking after a time ceramic ISNA began to converse again those who come here must have been born with good tendencies this is a special word he is mentioning those who come here must have been born with good tendencies isn't that true he is asking master ma che because he is recording he should be convinced if he is not convinced if he is not realizing himself then his writing or give that the force even without understanding i am writing something we don't be that good but after understanding if you write you know with conviction this is true those who come here here means ideology of Saddam additional the ideology of ceramic ich nur when he is coming what is that ideology that you are God each and every wing within that that supreme joy the sickness is there only we do not know that's all and we have to as if we have to awake from that slumber that's all so here's Saddam o Krishna is telling whoever is coming they must have done something good in their previous life this is an indication of the past lives sometimes people will argue is there any past life is it really true mostly they will just say oh no it is we don't believe it unscientific what is scientific just if we can go and find it out in the laboratory that is only true and nothing else there are many many other things which we cannot prove in the laboratories but you can feel so that is one thing the master mache is telling I was just going through about that incarnation incarnation means taking the embodied in flesh so again and again we are taking the bird maybe sometimes in the lower birth as you call the bars animals insects and all that and sometimes the human body and I saw that in the Christianity they are accepting this incarnation and it says the second person of trinity the God the Son of God and the Holy the soul is a trinity the three the God is communing is giving order talking with the Sun but not directly through someone that is that is called Trinity so this Trinity also Nona known as the god the son of the logos the son of god and the logos the word became flesh by being conceived in the womb of Mary it's not the God directly as he so they are thinking in that way so this is the Christian theology they believe in the Incarnation the incarnation of God and but the not directly the all-pervading God but in between the logo the word the power of God it is taking the shape the human form they believe in incarnation is a fundamental theological teaching of the Orthodox Christianity and the Protestants also accepted what extent protested against many things but they accept this theory that God incarnated as Jesus the Gospel of John mentioned word was made flesh and from there it has come why this incarnation of God and that has been answered by we find the West sigh react churches the different sects are their churches to a poem composed by st. c virus is e ve r us is almost 500 years of Jesus birth says i exalt the Lord and King only begotten Son and word of the heavenly father immortal by nature thou came down by grace for salvation and life for all human race salvation and life for all human race who is coming Jesus now we know and he is the word and he is the son of God so that is the conception idea of the Christian saints during the Reformation period one he said he is michael servetus rejected the biblical monotheism and refused to accept the conception of eternal son of god jesus is is the only begotten Son of God the eternal son of God that he was not ready to accept he said no it should be the son of the eternal God that was the difference he was having and they're very sad thing that Michael servitors was burnt at the stake for hearsay in 1553 by the Roman Catholics as because the people who are like that they never had that a little patience to listen to other what is there suppose he is telling but anyway that is the history and this is a find that they accept incarnation the Catholic the protest urn and others also but that incarnation only the son of god that is jesus because their conception all others are sinners so obviously they cannot be the incarnation so that is only God and he has taken form as the eternal son of god and he is Jesus he incarnated for the benefit of the human being Buddhism this that it says sentient being incarnate due to the physical factors of ignorance craving and clinching or cleansing means attachment now Buddhism said all these that we see they are living beings they are incarnated that means taking birth again and again why that is ignorance what is the ignorance the real idea about themselves craving their desire and cleansing that is attachment the same idea of Hindus also why we are taking birth because of this then when I went to that I you are there after the talk the question answer he was asking why we are taking birth this is the answer because of our ignorance because of our desire because of our attachment so these things are there in our mind and to fulfill those desires we are coming back again and again and that is why we should be very very careful about praying to God the most of the prayers are answered if we if you notice that whatever you thought you prayed certainly some time you see that has been achieved but if forget that we prayed when we achieve that when you get that you forget that once we desire we prayed for that so that prayer most of the time it is answered but the prayer should be very very careful if you are thinking in this way and that way because of that desire we have to come down that is the Buddhist idea to be born as human is considered a great privilege we also you know that Hinduism is great privilege liberation in Buddhism is achieved when the stock of accumulated samskaara impressions have been dissolved through the practice of the Noble Eightfold Path in Buddhism that Eightfold Path is there SAT there and all that if you are practicing that then slowly all your impressions will be eradicated cleaned then there will be no desire and you will be liberated that is called Buddhism is Islam we find the Orthodox Islam completely rejects the doctrine of incarnation of God in any form but Islamism there is another idea Islamism agha khan perhaps you have heard the name agha khan he belongs to this idea is a view that hazrat mohammed son-in-law and azeroth maman's daughter's husband daughter was fatima az-zahra that her husband that is Imam Ali was God incarnate the Cote saying of the hazard Muhammad let's call khatri's hard eat they call it hadith Dakota hadith the saying of Azad Muhammad Ali and I are from the same nude in the nude the word means the light alli and I are from the same nude we are from the same light you know then India is no zahan that is ha Jahan the neurons are means this word nor means the light light of this world let's call doors on that this early and I are from the same node accepting that they say no is an acceptance of the Islamic belief the concept of God's incarnation of course this is the basis of separation between the two group Shias and Sunnis agha khan is the Imam Imam means spiritual leader and Imam means the truthful the believer and truthful imam of the Islam IDEs who believe that he possesses the nude the light of God within him let us call Islam now comes Hinduism we believe in the sabotage and that is very difficult to explain the Sabbath are you know that all the ten the mostly it begins with the what there are bow and there are taught wise and all fish all these avatara's enough to another they're coming and slowly taking the human life and that is becoming one that is half God and half-human that narsimha and then the small human being perfect human being but small there's a bomb on ax then comes parasurama then the rama rama the perfect human being so as if slowly slowly it is coming to that perfect being the God same God taking the hip form and according to the situation that is the in the Hindu way of belief and then see Rama Krishna is talking about the divinity that is present in every human being and not only human being almost all being it but the human being the manifestation is perfect is more so that is why a virgin on tamam aura in the bhagavad-gita it's the Sri Krishna say a virgin auntie mam mudha menuchim to nuuma satyam when the god has taken the human form but some people who are not having that sharp idea brain or the clear vision they cannot understand him and that is the saddest part when the God is living with us we cannot understand abidjan ontem amudha Manu seem to namaz item param baba ajanta mama butta maheshwaram the fools this disregard me and that is the saddest part on aware of my high estate as the Great Lord of the beings dwelling in the human form but once I Ramakrishna he never disclosed his divinity but in different occasions we find in his life it is sufficient indications were there some people only understood and that is very very special very interesting the first person who could understand him as a illiterate villager he is to sell some ordinary things and he once said to the small boy gadhada you are God I know and someday world will know then please remember that I the first one recognized you that is cheenu sakaki this some of the this biographies that has been written that she knew his name was chino a shikari because that was his business so there's chinos Akari he recognized him that day when he was a very young boy and another lady also he was from he was also from a very low birth she understood Saddam o Krishna so they understood because of the simplicity and God's grace but many of the people who came to visit see Rama Krishna who talked with him they found nothing specially name they claim they saw and then they ok ok tis all right there are many people are there were thinking about God and meditating on God the Percy's okay is one of the other  so here ceramic is knees telling only those who understand and have failed and already made some progress this worse proves that karma when we are thinking and acting in a good way slowly slowly our mind is getting ready to understand this very very subtle truth it's very subtle truth because our mind is totally a test with the fight things that is the rupa rasa gun the sub dispersed these are the five things we cannot go beyond this five we see we hear we smell we test we touch only these five things that is giving us the our idea if we cannot touch if you cannot see if we cannot smell we don't believe that we are not ready to believe it but there are things are there beyond all these ideas that is why it is necessary a special training and the training when the mind is totally open we can understand and see Rama Krishna is talking about the Incarnation because the birth again and again and one was very very careful always in the subconscious mind this idea should be strongly implemented imprinted i am going to achieve something in my next life next life next life whatever it may be but i am going to realize god the two things are necessary one the faith in the words of the great masters the god is there and one can realize God and second faith in our oneself I can realize God and I'm surely one day realize so that way it goes those who come here must have been born with good tendencies the aim said it is true sir then he is mentioning about one person who has a government officer in those days in the it was the British rule other saying he was a deputy is a great poster the very high post at the time of the British rule other scene must have a good tendency isn't it though he was having that the social status still he was having very simplicity and devotion other used to come and he used to lie down in that room and a wonderful breeze and this to sleep nicely people used to say look at this man he has come to the temple he has come to see Ramakrishna without listening anything he simply sleeping master used to say don't disturb him let him sleep you have so many other things to handle but when he comes over here his mind becomes calm and quiet so he is sleeping let him sleep one day I was just going through this from my office to my room I saw one young gentleman is lying down keeping his leg towards God he's lying down like this three two is all right only I failed that he is putting his leg towards God so I came and told sad we looped his turn and then lie down there's no problem in lying down only if you change the posture then he said why I told this better to have the blessings directly on the head instead on the lake so so I am lying down to get the blessings of God and is good but if the blessings comes on the head because you're thinking your thoughts will improve but if it comes on the lake then what will happen but he is understood yes then he turned again he lied down for some time and he went away so this is the way people have the faith if we come in a holy place and we do like this either lying down or sitting and praying meditating some people they will come and read books over here why they can book anywhere particularly library and book sell all these places are there but they think that if I am reading before the holy person God that will give me more the idea clear idea about the diss teachings so these thoughts are already there and ceramic ISNA is giving the guidances and when he said the other is also having this start ceramic ISNA was very happy and he said other also think that you are a good man sir about the master then see Ramakrishna arrived in others house in Calcutta with the Rock Hall aim and other devotees other had arranged to have a famous singer and in his party and they were reciting Chandi I have surrendered my soul at the fearless feet of the mother am I afraid update anymore that was the way they were singing as the master listen he became filled with divine power and joined the musicians now and then he improvised an appropriate line suddenly he went into Samadhi and stood still but this is the that is the culture we can say in the Asia that sometimes the singer when they are singing they are improvising some of the words adding to it the when you went to the China we found the two ladies they are thinking of the microphone and all that it was so quiet then suddenly we found that they are singing what they are singing the language we never can could understand but exactly like our traditional caveats this to call them caveats this to go to village to village not that it is something composed they themselves wish to compose over there and give it giving the tune music and there's to decide so both of them were doing like that and people sometimes they are clapping and encouraging one and the other was trying to again reply it is going on so when the things are like that here also when they are singing master improvising some words and adding that it was about four o'clock in the afternoon when see Ramakrishna with racal and one or two devotees started from the finisher for Calcutta in a carriage all details description the master measure is recording as the carriage passed the gate of the Kali temple they met him this is the master he was coming from Calcutta coming on foot with for mangoes in his hands it was the summer time so he was whenever these two come to see Ramakrishna to a holy man this to bring something then a particularly fruits and to offer I go to a place where I just give the discourse and bhagavad-gita always a lady comes with some fruits one or two maybe sometime apple or something and before offering pranaam he will give them those fruits and offered the pronoun why the fruits because they need spiritual fruit and I give you this fruit and in exchange please bless me so I can get spiritual fruits so that is the idea he was coming with the for mangoes the carriage stopped and the aim saluted the master Serrano Krishna was going to visit some of his devotee in Calcutta master so this ceramic ISNA to aim with a smile come with us we are going to others house again ceramic ich nur and that is the speciality used to go to different people's houses and where others can come not the small house others houses the big one so naturally people many other people could come over there other was a very high official government official but these ordinary people also used to come that way these two become United because their devotees this to become United cause in an ideology one same ideas so that way he was slowly slowly just we find this Jesus he is going to different places and he is giving the discourses talking with the people same way the Avatara he is going to different places and giving these discourses talk and particularly in the modern age this ceramic esna he mentioned he who was Rama he who was Krishna in this body as Ramakrishna is that the same God as an incarnation but in this incarnation the fighting is not necessary bow and arrow is not necessary Sudarshan chakra is not necessary Warfield is not necessary what is necessary transformation of the minds of the people so he used to go to the cities particularly Calcutta he was induction Asia very near to Calcutta now the dictionnaire has come under the bigger Calcutta I think now he used to go to different houses and he used to call people were there here he is asking him to come with us him got joyfully into the carriage that is also shall I go because they have not invited me he never thought in that way immediately joyfully he got into the carriage having received an English education now the discussion that aim had previous day he is thinking did not believe in the tendencies inherited from previous births as salam o Krishna talked about the tendencies as you call in sanskrit the samskaara when if some small children will come they will come and automatically developer pranaam all they will sing quietly like this we say the summer skaara is there that means the good impressions from the previous birth I saw that one lady she was a I think the one tea garden managers wife in Assam and she was pacing up and down waiting for the flight to come and she'll chart the last airfield in the india and our DD in president schwalm EG of the ramakrishna mission very sure on the G he was then sitting inside and many devotees came and he was very fond of the children to he used to give the candies to the children so naturally the mothers they were asking their children to go and have the candies as his basing he was blind he couldn't see but whoever came used to touch their head as to give the chocolate now all the mothers they were almost forcing the children to go and many they were protesting they're crying screaming they won't go but the mothers were thinking that is the blessings to get that chocolate and the candy from the hands of a holy man the child who was the son of that lady the little I think five or six years he was also working with the mother suddenly he saw a group of people surrounded there he came I was noticing him and as a small boy he went through almost there everybody's aware he entered into that group he found that this gentleman is sitting over there not doing at all who is he he went straight to the schwa me G and he kept his head on his lap and asked his blessings and naturally all that love and emotion and blessings came from the great Swami be very sure on and the G he patted his back and then he gave so many candies in her two small little hands and then put his hand on his head and then that boy came straight and he went to his mother if this is not some scar than what is samskara it forced him as if guided him to go over there we can say just nothing like that is the children that child's my you're thinking but without that samskara it cannot be so we believe in samskaara and ceramic is not talked about that those who are having good samskaara will come over here aim that time said it is true but he could not accept it as because he is constantly thing is there any life after death and how people in their mind will go on carrying these ideas whatever we are thinking now whatever we are doing now that the impressions that is going on our mind that is why the morality why should we be modeled the question swami vivekananda asking why should he be model because the impressions coming on our mind will guide us from life after life the happiness the joy and the misery that comes in our life because of those things so be careful if you don't bother never bother you suffer and go in that wave of happiness and joy and misery but if you are careful about this because these holy people they have said and from their experiences it will help you so minimize their minimize our lives miseries so that it says and don't believe in the previous birth but he had admitted a few days before that it was on account of the others good tendencies from the past but that he showed such great devotion to the master later on he had thought about this subject and had discovered that he was not yet completely convinced about inherited tendencies he had come to the action Asia that day to discuss the matter with see Ramakrishna this is the speciality of the ROM ok our Hinduism the devotees the disciples are encouraged to ask questions and in in the scripture it says poori pristina se veia if you can ask good questions about the spiritual life then the gurus preceptors the Holy main they are satisfied as if it is a service that you were rendering to the Guru not to insult the Guru not to insult the pudding in such a question to make him embarrassed not like that but to understand which sincere heart if you are asking the question is short of a service to him poori Prasanna Prasanna means the question se vaya it's a service so here he is thinking he has come no i am not convinced i must get completely free from all these doubts she has come to discuss now the master took him in the carriage he is asking well what do you think of other master understood his mind the other day they discussed about the other that person to whom they are going now and here again the master raised that point what do you think of other him he has great yearning for God master other two speaks very highly of you must remain silent awhile and then began to speak of past Indian sees him I haven't much faith in rebirth I haven't much faith in rebirth and inherited tendencies will that in any way injure my devotion to God is getting clearer now the reply of the grant see Ramakrishna it is enough to believe that all is possible in God's creation never allow the thought to cross your mind that your ideas are the only true ones and that those of others are false this is the speciality of the Ramakrishna the cinema krishna always combining those who do not believe it is okay if you don't believe now okay but don't think that since you do not believe others who are believing they're all in the wrong I don't think in that way that will do one day all your doubts will be removed and you will surely understand what is true so that is what can you man understand God's activities this is the question so next time in the next day we will again discuss on these now let us chant this mantra if you have any question about this we can try to answer if you do not have then we left the preneur mantra doctor do you have any christian loubo Connie that is the challenge of the nature that is the challenge the sometimes you know when we came as an officious to this idea we used to read books all the time was to go to the library any opportunity you know that does a brahmacari the novices we have lot of work all are engaged with so many different type of responsibilities duties any little time wish to read books even those that great personality like Xiaomi ranganathan energy was a cook in the summer in those days ramakrishna mission they could not provide the salary of the cook so the bra mature is theirs to cook he was a cook and even then when he is cooking is to keep the book over there and while his cooking is to read that book then slowly slowly when you grow up slowly it goes down and that is the time we must be very conscious again and again we have to ask our mind no we must go we must listen again and again the same thing now we cannot create the new thing when a person is asking a question how can I be successful in controlling the mind answer is that age-old condition what's rakesh nuh said to Arjuna again and again you repeat and then only it is possible Oh brca2 county by regina chariot a bill AB de means you have to note down what are the things distracting me and you have to renounce those things by tia and repetition of the same thing then it is possible so obvious abhyasa means practices practices practices you see in our life we are practicing more and more and we are getting more and more the what's called adept in that our knowledge is becoming perfect after practice so that is the thing but these in the minds thinking in this way these are the challenges all of us will find because of the prakruti and province in Ramakrishna said in one point this is like a game it's nothing that all purities within our mind within our heart we can get the purity anytime but we cannot get it because there is something that's called Maya there's ego and all the time sending our mind outside when it finds the person is coming near to it keep coming near to the knowledge as if it becomes very you know that the thinking oh the game will be over if it comes and know about the originality the game will be over so again it turns them so this is the time when one must be very very prayerful to God good question anything else or let us chant this over pranaam mantra and we close and friends the one thing I like to tell you the tomorrow the schwa me in charge from the Southern California Hollywood vedanta society will be coming as because you all know that he will go to the ganges for giving the retreat and Brahmaputra as well he is coming on the known time at in 334 he will have two hours two and half an hour's rest if you
