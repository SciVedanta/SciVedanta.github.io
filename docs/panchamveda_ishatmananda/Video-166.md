[167: Panchama Veda 167 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PeVRrkEAIlQ)

we start with this monthly written even Kobe video Masha stubborn among Vallum sri maha bua Coonan da Buddha dodging ah this is about the gospel of cinema Tichenor but the quotation is from the Gopi Gita and this in the Bhagavad are all set has been mentioned and we put it because this gospel of sri ramakrishna every page is full of knowledge that is the main reason a knowledge of spirituality and at the same time he is talking about the mundane knowledge also the worldly thoughts also about what that you should keep good relation with your brother's with your neighbors must serve with great respect your parents so the human equality's unless and until those human qualities are developed one cannot develop the spiritual life search Salam Krishna in page 428 he is mentioning a man cannot see God unless he gives his whole mind to him age capital that means to God unless he gives his whole mind to God and mine means what mine is a flow of thoughts different avatars now I have to leave when when I am surviving leaving I have many responsibilities the duties I have to arm I have to take care of my family I had to do many other things how one can put his whole mind to God now white Saddam is distilling like this is it possible for anyone of course Ramakrishna himself deep with whole mind to God he would not think of anything else how now if we read the biography of cinema Krishna we get their clues the heenes the ideas wherever he is going wherever is visiting everywhere is constantly thinking the presence of God he went to Joe Gordon he saw a lion and immediately he thought of Goddess Durga it is a cat here of Goddess Durga is a liar and instead of seeing the only the lion the Beast he was thinking about the goddess Durga so that is the way one should think believer whatever we see is nothing but the manifestation of the God that is called the whole mind and how to practice it swami vivekananda in his Karma Yoga is giving that theory that whatever you do think that I'm doing it for God whomever you are serving talking think that I am doing it for God so that is the way one can constantly put his mind into God we the ramakrishna mission Swami's yesterday only a group of people came I was talking with them the Sonia since we have left our heart and home we don't have any other things but we have the organization an organization means the rules and regulations you have to you are bound by the rules and regulations so whatever the the organization is asking me I am bound to do that and in exchange I am getting the security of food and dress and the house and all those things devotees are there taking care but that is the greatest sadhana in America you won't understand if you go to India particularly we are doing lot of philanthropic work and naturally we are maintaining the college university schools big big schools and so many varieties of things and one of our swami is in church and people are coming and asking for different about health to admit his son or these and dad when sitting in the position of the administration so naturally that thought comes I am the person when I am signing so many people get the job when I sign that they may lose the job that hum card of the ego being calm so the ramakrishna mission shown is tapasya is more different than many others constantly you have to think that I am the servant of God I am sitting over here in this position I don't have any qualities because the God wanted me to be here and I am we were coming before me I am suffering them and we are giving the service according here to give different type of people are coming here to handle them differently so that is the greatest sadhana and you are having lot of money because the government grants are coming in India the all the Social Work mostly they do through the NGOs that they are giving lot of money but you are very very careful not a single first thing should be here they should not go to this place of that because that is the main thing so this is the Nam recently we are organizing a meeting to celebrate at 125th a year of Swami Vivekananda's lecture in the Fullerton Hall now suddenly what happened the Swami who was to represent the balloon Maud is a trustee and the governing body member suddenly he passed away at the last Friday night and obviously they had a meeting and called me and told you were to cancel the program once the picked of the phone and told start making program with their energy and then another call came cancel the program but canceling means so many other things at the end what was 200 people they have already registered of course $25 acceptable now 200 people I have to all this money I have to go on liking to them will you please take that the money or do you think that you'll keep it as a donation so I cannot keep that money maybe the $25.00 individual nothing but at the same time unless the same islami you keep that money I cannot keep because the money was taken only for that particular purpose so this is called the constant awareness about the god that is work in the samsara also when you're working the same thing we have to keep in mind one line only is a and that straighten our whole life may man cannot see God unless he gives his whole mind to him as long as there is a Agha there will be less of yoga that bogum is desired to enjoy enjoy this the physical thing then there is no Yoga Yoga means union with the God so that we constantly we have to understand we have to think and then he gives a beautiful story an Avatara that Avadhuta he chose a and either as one of his 24 gurus this is a very unique story that the very famous spiritual personality about alta and he chose 24 gurus who were the gurus the be the end that the he girl like that like that from them is to learn and the eagle and he caught a fish and he thought that he will go anyplace and inside and eat and the Eagle had a fish in his brain so it was surrounded by thousands of goals which even read through with the fish the crows pursued in crime cocoa when all of a sudden the fish drop the crows flew away after the fish leaving the eager bloom the fish is the object of enjoyment and the crows are the worries and anxieties what is more money itself becomes a source of trouble brothers may live happily but they get into trouble when the property is divided so this is the problem and so practical we have seen the brothers even sometimes some people from America they go and the Indian that brother say why you are in America why you want to share my here in India then the joke but and I'm a son of my father and I need this they'll be a lot of problem almost in different families why because the property so that is the reason and there are so many stories at there the four brothers were they and they constantly used to fight with among them so the father was a very intelligent person and he told CSUN the babe that I am lying on below this in the art I had killed lot many things and particularly the field that you see you have to dig in different places I have hidden lot of wealth and the four brothers the moment the father died instead of attending the funeral they all went to the field and started digging in different corner and the whole field was dug and the thing was in the envy they were wondering why the father said like that a wise man of the village came and told anyway you didn't get the wealth over here but that field is ready for sowing the seeds what did you throw the some seeds you will get the crops and by that he will give some money so the father worked at them to walk and to get the money so that was the teaching different stories that always say the party is really very difficult and that is the come here now and then he's talking to the gentleman was an actor see he came he visits Ram petitioner and Saddam Krishna told him come here now and then he remains in the company of the holding people and what is the holy people the holy Qataris we are discussing about this we are reading listening and that way slowly slowly all our doubts are cleared prophet is what is the problem problem is only the mind about leaving the world but keep the mind firmly on God if the master is telling am not reading all those lines and skipping and then the master is telling to that gentleman he said legally in the world but give the mine for only one God this is the price of ever once around - not living the world when were all your duties can you remember the wonderful teaching Raghavan Sri Krishna a virgin ma a new smaller unit a job mom a nurse mother constantly you think about me and you touch a fight the moment I was asking her this Gita sloka I look to that chair wherever visibility is to see and she memorized all the seven unders locus of the bhagavad-gita so so that we and she tried to leave that life also working constantly and with the whole thing intended mom honest mother mombi's is not Krishna assalamu Schnur mr. God all-pervading and what is God God bhagavata Swami Vivekananda unselfishness is God and any one place he said in OBE love that is God so unselfishness when I am free from the selfishness that I only should clean I only should enjoy that makes my mind very narrow and when it is not there a wonderful love comes I do a mix with all different type of people and I love them I like them too that way your enjoyment your joy is expanded so God is two qualities unselfishness and pure love without any boundary and that is personal life Shami g SE expansion is life contraption is depth now income are poker he is giving an example that is the beauty of saddam additional the winner he said anything immediately give an example you see deeper here and nowadays of course you won't find this type of things happening even in the villages because all the machines have come in the older days this - husk in a different way I have seen the woman women of carpenter families making flattened rice with a husky machine one woman keeps the deed of the wooden beam and the under woman while the nursing her baby turns the body in the mortar dog in the mountain the second woman is always alert list the pestle of the machine should fall on her and I have seen that machine it was coming constantly down and those ladies are constantly changing and that particular thing which is getting first with the mother and she fries the soaked patty in a band besides he is talking with the customers and she says you are so much money please paid before you go likewise do your different duties in the world fixing your mind and God practice is necessary one should also be alert only in this way can one sip curd both God and the world now cinema Mishnah is unique while he's not asking anyone to leave the world he is asking to be dear in the world but if you feel really very strong arts to give away the world and all those things okay or otherwise be deal and whatever the duties that who are performing do it in such a way so that you can have both God and the world the word means the duties and not thinks responsibilities that you are having then the actor is asking him wonderful question he's asking say what is the proof that the soul is separate from the body now this is the question is asking he's an actor but in the bhagavad-gita you know in the second chapter in the beginning of the Gita we can see again and again in so many verses the Lord say Krishna see the soul and the body are separated friends let us concentrate on this particular part and we discuss afterwards other things Nikita second chapter xxii sloka but I am not reading the whole words just giving the hint bassam see Jade Nani yeah-ha-ha Navona cklenotic naru karani Tata Shari Ronnie the Hajis Narni and me Ani seniority nominee the heal those who know nothing about the Sanskrit is very simple very simple very easy language but it is a reader other punishes little bit DVD but bhagavad-gita very simple Sanskrit Bassam see jigna demand gives us the whole gardens all gardeners the wonderful example that has been given and the body at the same when the garments and the body are equal and the government went become old what we do we just discard it similarly when the body is old what we were supposed to do discard it and you should not be unhappy for that because they will get another body and that proves the soul it is travelling again and again in different new bodies and of course it both are there I am going to born again that hope is there but how are you God Kareena it depends according to my work if I had thought or did something wrong then I'm going to suffer and according to dad something I will give my body I mean born in that particular way so boss arms is not that is a different part of Carnival ah but here it says when the body becomes old the soul the serve abundance that body at an salaam additionally giving the example the coconut when it becomes very try that the coconut shell and the kernel inside it becomes separated and if you do like this you can immediately hear that sound inside it has been separated but when it is not right that way you won't get that so like that when the body is completely old the self also becomes like that and it will leave in the Gita 23rd 24th 25th second chapter of the verses it gives on the example Nina Shastra Ginga Nam chicken dishes Rani nom de teba vaca exit exit The Wiggles cannot cut it the water cannot beat it the fire cannot burn it otherwise how they will explain how they will say that this is what achieved om or that um the same thing telling in us another language you cannot divide you cannot burn and this is one unit and completely circle and it is completely separate from the body a billion a Chilean object means it is completely unmanifested vector manifested abdomen manifested it is there very much near the soul without soul you cannot survive but it is completely unmanifested and that so you do not have any idea about the soul do without soon we are did a completely Dale but we are not aware of that particular thing which is so valuable so that they say of death to him unmanifested or gene too young even unconceivable one cannot have that idea why because it is beyond time space and causation without the time space and causation how can he understand that the soul is beyond time space and causation and it says in the yoga bar sister yoga vasishta is a unique book of Vedanta the sloka the ultimate being has no name but for practical use Rishi's had called that that ultimate being as the Rita Sathya Atma Brahma all these names that has been given to that ultimate dream which in reality has no need know for but we know the name without an form we cannot conceive that is the problem the human being that is the problem we have to go beyond that how that sadhana is a completely different so see Ramakrishna said with this line you cannot see God you can comprehend God you have to have a different spiritual mind we goes with all this name and for the region of name and form and that is possible so many great souls they have seen God freedom Atma Paramatma serfdom in Ithaca Budda Budda Budda means intellectual people Buddha means knowledge Buddha would the means that knowledge a person who has got that knowledge knowledge of one so Buddha he those who are who have realized that they have given this lead only to express the idea that eyes how they would see and what are the names written then Atma Barham Brahma and sucked em the next language says Cal PETA Babel Haram the sea Sangha Mahatma nama salamis definition Calcutta they have fabricated the fabrication is necessary otherwise we won't be able to understand suppose in the mathematics always the first beginning is suppose suppose y equal to this much and it's equal to this much and why we are taking the white going to these and executed this suppose without that you cannot proceed into that iron mathematics this is very peculiar and the supposing that we are also proceeding why we accept that suppose because teacher is table and teacher is going to prove us the whole mathematics with that that this is the way you have to understand and when we see God is there God has no name got a snowfall but thinking as written by one straight and the certain truth it never changes then arc ma then Brahma it is in the religion this to all is done art ma Brahma and Colin so this small as they say this is the Sangha who punishes despite that Brahmin as having two aspects now the question is why this man asks this question the moment you see the Hartman and the gorilla are separate then you are putting yourself in difficulty philosophical answer with a philosophically you cannot say it is different from God why because everything has come from one God all the religions are telling the same thing God has created this world some they could not express or analyse or give the answers where from the God created these the material whether the material came anything that you are creating material cause an intellectual cost we know the God is intellectual cause what is the material cause to Adam the God could create that is a vital question the moment you say God has created out of those those those those things that means those things like the wood the steel or these are that that was separated from God that was already existing that it is there God is not one there were many other things and the momentary conception of many others of viously to reserve this destruction the moment you think of two there will be curved coalition and destructions so the conception of one LA in LA in LA in the Islam the same there is only one and not two of course the explanation are different with unti we say it is only one then the question comes where from this world came where from this body came the body cannot be the soul bodies we can touch we can feel a body is also changing that doesn't mean the God is also changing if the body has been created by God out of God is it mean that God is also changing the very very subtle questions of the velocity will gone the moment you say it is separate so the heart ma the soul and the body are it separate so that many ask you this question and very intelligent question and surround isne before giving that about how he is giving the answer and quoting from the different beta first I was quoting from this now you have our sister and it says there only the concept of name has been given to that and position describing from one I am not putting different finishes but they are describing Brahman at two different Thrones one near appreciation the Sanskrit word nearly she Asia without any characteristics Nikki means negative me she is your speciality what is that negative no qualities if we don't have any quality that cannot be used at all that not be taken as seriously if the water cannot quit your ah the water is not as the waters qualities we all call that as water if the fire is looking like a fire but it cannot burn we won't say that as a fire or I should have the burning capacity so like that the qualities if the qualities are not there then we are not going to tell that the Brahman is not having any such qualities so at the same time from the brahmana all these things have come so the second we see saw be she's a Swami sweet means negative without so positive with the problem itself is having some qualities and at the same time it is not having the qualities it is the problem man that is the supreme Brahman opera Brahman there is a ingredient Brahman again it says the Oracle and varam article param article means transcendental and varaha Rika means empirical brand money so in the Vedanta this bhava horican param arctica one must be very very careful otherwise it will be very difficult to for the be daunting to survive so I told him that again many times I think the when I was travelling in a train I was sitting on a chair and squirting because it is morning I was doing some little chopper and South the university students they turned into that particular compartment and they wanted to share that those chairs and they were requesting other people to squeeze and make the rooms but them and they were sitting they saw I am almost covering two seats sitting like this but they were little hesitant to say something to the Xiaomi a lot of respect in India then one by a smart boy came and said Swamiji you have left everything given up everything in this world or in your discharge then I - and this is the only thing I am holding up - how the station whether you get down so after the heart of the harder you can take but this is the only thing I'm happy so the sparrow hurry current para Martita the paramour think I know that I am NOT attached to anything but the bamboo horican must have to otherwise TV now one gentleman came was a very strong person and he was carrying the heck tower the donation goes very heavy he liberated and he was taking him it was good that another American our person he came and he say what is it why you are carrying it now I was thinking what is inside and you need not to bother about what is inside keep it back over the survey he left it over there so now that time we cannot say let it go let it be there what do you know you have to be very very particular so par America and Peru these are the two things and that is called the empirical Grubman and transcendental Brahman when you are thinking about the transcendental drama resulting all we have to do the empirical Adi Shankaracharya in his commentary of the brahma shuttle it is one one to the brahma sutra he describes the Brahman is apprehending on the two forms Shankar Acharya is giving the example why because the confusion if this body is Brahman and also the soul is Brahman the body is changing that is does it mean the Brahman is also changing so to answer that again and again all the philosophers they are telling like this that two forms of the same drama in the first place as qualified by limiting conditions going to the multi formative of the evolutions of names and forms the same Brahman he's becoming odd he'll come and one bahu Shama we have to be meaning there is the concept of creation me alone one but I like to Remini immediately everything has come and the Christian it we find there is no light it was all dirt let there be light immediately there was light so how just thinking the Brahman thought to be meaning it became meaning who became any Brahma result so that we will come to other part we had today we are not going to discuss that if it is real me the same Roman becoming really transform that means it is exhausted as one milk was there one litre milk out of the one determine if I have make him the yogurts that means milk is not their milk is exhausted instant transfer into yogurt does it mean the Brahman we just created this universe this word a multi-link multiplicity is no more is only surviving in this form now that is not so there is another chapter so the philosophy is very very certain the more and more and more is study the philosophy this subtle it becomes that's why the same Ramachari Ramachari means complete attention to that otherwise you won't be able to understand it just going on written in the books while travelling in a flight and he complete the return of furniture petronella so you know the how many slokas of their Exeter Exeter good idea but understanding the Venetian means you have to the big point over there and here it says Shankar Acharya the name and in the second place as being free from all limiting condition whatsoever first place name and form and second place free from all limited conditions what are the limited condition name and form this is an immediate condition so Bruton is happy the supreme ultimate without form and again Herman is having the fall it has been wonderfully directed by the Tantra as a Connie and Sheba at the same time we find that when you do the puja the Hindus when they're performing the puja they will keep an image before the image will be there but at the same time a part from the water and after the puja is over the usually the multi puja the puja in with the images then they will push that water and if they go now why brahmana Rupa Kalpana the Brahman which is formless but I cannot conceive I cannot have any idea I cannot concentrate on that so I am imagining that Rahman will be like this it is like a fish now it is like the third God it isn't like that Kali means like the Ganesha this is like the Shiva this is this this many many many many varieties are showing in tourism complete freedom is there to think about the God in whatever form fashion you like that is the God a Hindu must know that the death form is not the God only helping us to concentrate but the water wine water because the water has no form and that's why we use the coconut in the puja you will see the green coconut is always there not only that in the opening of some the new place new sharp or anything they will keep that water bought and one a green coconut water not knowing why they are killed it has become a tradition but the symbol means the God is not having them for so that is the main idea there's a beautiful sloka is there and in that slow curve it gives in a simple way it says the changin near the consciousness are having five different parts the Chaitanya the consciousness is having five different sections were there a sea party pre-owned then Groupon Nam Shi Tong Japan Chaka Khan Chaka means by Chetan is the consciousness consciousness which the drama hardman it is having the five different parts first three Artyom tryam Brahma Luba are demons the fast trail mystery Brahma Rupa they are the definitions of the brahman what are their OC party and beer I see means existence bhava means the knowledge and briam means the police the icy body prior existence knowledge and breeze you cannot express the brahman in any other term so as immaterial I am so I can understand I am that particular consciousness us see I don't like to die rather on this thought came know being like to die we're from the thought came something must be there otherwise we're from it it's not just it is coming so obviously some source is there from where it is coming a steel rusted means existence then party knowledge we like to know that must be having his source and Priya Priya means the priests this tree is the definition of the brahman and the last two ruben and namah namah and drew purnama his name rupa means form name and form name and form the old world is nothing but this to name and form when you see one a small animal going with a cat for me being wrecked are the big dog party with these and dead why we have given the name we are given this name two different animals according to the size and the forms have given the names and we are now identifying those in this way the nama and rupa that particular form is having listening now seeing and cat if you say this a dog people will laugh at you so you'll know what is dog and what is cat so - why because one should not mix up this has been fixed in this way now if you are - what is there somebody he was thinking that is a cat I like to change it you can change if the whole the people all over the world they decide from now he will change the name the dog should be called as a guide and a tribute to call that a dog it'll change all the books and everywhere we change we will then the next generation will come and without hesitation they will call that so nama and Rupa these are the tools and name and for other identity of the upper arm month and Brahman and Hartman are the same there's four different names now whether one Saddam who is giving the answer friends in this direction I'd like to show you this one that this is our magazine electronic magazine is in the name is Chicago calling every three month we publish one issue and on the yesterday I thing and one day publish this one and it is containing a beautiful article describing this front page cover page and this is an anarchist American artist hearing the conception of the upper part and the lower part he drew this and it is here in the our Ganges retreat if you go the first you can see this the beautiful you must read this particular article from here you can download and can read until pick up our this printed form also this is giving the complete idea of the lower self and the higher self and there are two different self now we the individual people we are separate from the higher self why because we are intact under the name and walk now all these speeches all these books all this meditation all this pooja pooja why because we want to get rid of this name and form and to reach to the higher so then is when you story light and the phoenicians it has been described so this you can because the three dollar running the cost the little revealing and those who are going to visit the ganges afterwards he can remember why this picture the hopper bird and the lower berth cinema Tichenor now he is giving the answer the past person artist it is page 429 said what is the proof that the soul is separate from the body he is asking what is the proof Saddam obesity is giving the answer proven God can be seen how to give the proof because it is all parasha or no booty it is not that I will take you to a laboratory and prove you or on the boat I will go on giving you the example and calculate and prove it is not like that you have to understand it yourself and if your mind is not ready if your mind is not pure if your mind is not unattached to it all this worldly things you never be able to understand this and if you so know it is not because I could not understand you are not ready to understand the meaning of the scientific things if they come and tell majority of the people who are utilizing that benefit they won't be able to understand how things are happening like this so this say prove some business asking in surprising God can be seen by practicing spiritual discipline one sees God through his this we have understand just practicing spirituality doesn't mean that God will reveal his grace is also necessary in the one of the punishes also exceeds yummy Bishop renew the the inner love them the some people they explain in a different way but very simple meaning is whom that particular Brahmin chooses yummy Vasia bring with it the inner love bill he can understand so that is the God can be seen but you have to practice the Rishi's directly realized the self that's what offer optional booty not true anything dyed it now we have only five things to understand I say go and touch I can understand something if I can taste I can understand if I smell like I understand if I see I can understand like this five senses are there but something which is beyond this how you'll understand and if you dis before there was a peculiar sound was coming some machineries many other people are volunteers do when they could hear the sound but another person who went along and then we could not because of the defect in hearing that man is having the years but at the same time because of the high pitch of that sound he is not capable to hear when others are getting it he would simply say no to the lives of all as I was there I don't hear that that sound new people are not doing truth there is no Sun why his here is not corrected defective years so even the machine is not perfect now I look at things suppose my eyes am not perfect I'm see things in a different way and sometimes in the night when you're feeling little dozy and of course not on the wheel the when you are driving but in the other seat you were sitting dozing and sometimes you're looking you see a big truck is coming but actually it is a just a car why you see the truck because it was on the upper level of the road so it is the road uneven Road upper level it is coming many times it happened I see with my own eyes and I don't understand when it comes near then only I can those tubes are there and it says even when we go and touch when you see when we taste when you feel no I we make mistakes meaning many many times so that Swiss Ramakrishna stream directly courtesy and in sanskrit it says of erection we're not taking any help of anything of corruption or booty otherwise there is no proof in the Vedanta there are different type of proof sometimes it's a tree sometimes Isis Sikhs all these measurements are there but I did it when you see when the young man nor in the not that the who became after were Swami we began the way to Salaam Krishna and ask this question sir have you seen God he asked the same question to many other religious leaders they could not give the answer an immediately strong dish now he said I have seen God more clearly this is the very important world I have seen God more clearly than I see you now because now I am seeing you to my eyes but when I saw the goddess saw in realization and there was no forest so that is the Amish nestling that and he says science gives us information only about things perceived by the senses many people talk about science and religion science and religion the science only discussing about the external things and they are all measurement they are all missionaries only to use for the external objects what about the internal object what about the mind they're having some questionnaires and if you go if you be able to do different way immediately they will say go and consult with this particular expert doctor and doctor the mind and he will give you twenty one question do you think this way do you feel that way and then afterwards you will declare is a matter but maybe you are totally different time and this man this doctor is not having any idea about the spiritual growth that is the reason and ceramic richness stirring science gives us information only about the things perceived by the senses as for the instance this material mixed with that material gives such and such a result but the science cannot see how other things are happening the same time same moment to Seoul was born as a human being one in a very poor family and right from the birth suffering another in the same locality in a rich family right from the birth enjoy is an accident you know there was we caused an effect the Sun causes that there sometime somewhere which is unseen but the dad was there and that is the reason it is happening otherwise why it will happen and cause an epicly chosen for this reason a man cannot comprehend spiritual things which is ordinary and intelligence to understand him he must leave in the company of holy persons and he gives again you learned real the bowels by living with a physician and if you olden days this to hold the pulse like this and they'll be counting how many bills are going on and then accordingly they could say what is happening in your party that were now it is all machineries but they could feel and in those days they used to call them kaviraja and if you like to learn those medical science happily with them even today the doctors that could be doctors after passing the graduation and they will go and leave with in the company of the senior doctors and slowly slowly they will learn similarly you have to leave with the holy people and then only you can and now the tacticid said now I understand what about you thank you let us complete over here and we will again breed in the next day friends I think I've already announced and you know it is in our website because of the the Xiaomi who passed away we have cancelled that
