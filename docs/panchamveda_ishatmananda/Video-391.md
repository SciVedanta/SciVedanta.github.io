[392. Panchama Veda - “Stages of Sadhana”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqVeaoLAAms)

namaskar dear devotees and Friends at this Wednesday we will again study the Pancham of Veda the gospel of bhagavansi Rama Krishna last Wednesday I couldn't keep the class I couldn't read because I was traveling to Europe went to London and other places the wonderful people are there the so devoted the one of our swamijis are passed in he was in London in his memory they arranged a meeting so some of us we went over there the one Swami from France and then xiaomi from the other places they all came we together remembered him and prayed for him and also we went to Ireland we have a new center over there and visited some other places so I couldn't give this talk now let us begin today's talk with as usual the the stotra that we always recite double katham rhytham angalam srimada foreign house and some devotees are there he is conversing with them It's a Wonderful subjects wonderful topics are the discussions are going on the we have already discussed how he is advising us the greatest hurdle to reach back to the source to reach back to the guard is the ego though ego has no that basis we do not know what is this ego no one can explain this ego but ego is there and we know that very much so if we say that the body when we say I I I that is the ego I me and mine what is this I what is this me what is this mine no one can explain because this body is constantly changing mind is constantly changing what is this I then but still it is there that is the very unique conception that if we can overcome that if we can remove that what will come before us so that is called sadhana that is called spiritual austerity only this much that's why bhagavan si ramakrishna in his own language in Bengali he said Ami mole Gucci many of you know and many times there's sadhus they'll be coating this unique statement if I can kill myself in the yoga vashishta the guru vashishta is asking SRI ramachandra they kill your mind this mind is the ego that ego you have to remove and then what will remain that is the source that is Brahman that is God that is bhagavan that much only but it is not so easy to remove the ego we need lot of effort and for that first is understanding that is the first step of the vedanta icha the good desire what is the good desire I like to know myself I like to see God face to face that is the subha icha that is the main desire should be there for each and every one but it you know that the world is made of God's Maya it is so powerful it always deludes so this is the way we are he was then he suggested why don't you keep it as your servant servant of God you don't go the ego won't go killing the Mind means what killing the ego means what removing the ego means what is it possible that I am removing myself then where I will be so obviously it is better to begin that let this be the servant of God the Son of God like that the servant means it won't become humble and I am not any success it is not my success God give me all power all possibilities all help so everything became easy normal for me and I became successful it is not me it is God so that way the servant attitude all the time I am giving all the credit to God and if there is any mistake any failure failure so I should say it is because of me because I was not that way sincere but this is the way what is sadhana as mother saradamani Devi says tomorrow Tomorrow Will is the mother's actual Titi Puja so the mother the martial Damani Devi she told that what is sadhana is a great question because through sadhana through the practices it's called spiritual austerity in anything if we like to be successful I like to be a sports person I like to be a singer I like to be a writer a poet whatever it may be whatever that needs some practices special practice someone wants to be a dancer so he should or she should go and practice the dancing so that is the way the special type of practices and spiritual practice that she that person should try to keep the Mind always at the feet of God that's all every time everything should be remembered God is there God is there God is there so that needs a tremendous effort we forget all the time but again we have to bring back the mind and keep it at the feet of God so that is called sadhana bhagavan Cinema Krishna suggested you be better utilize the ego as the servant it is a tremendous Force and with that force that is trying to bind us we are utilizing that Force to take us you know when are the people they sell and in the the boat if the the wind is coming from the front side it is very difficult to row but if it is coming from the back the same with the aircraft also if the trail wind is powerful then it becomes easy for to fly or easy to sell now ego if it is coming from the front it is very difficult to go forward in our spiritual life so keep it at the back how to keep it the back it is a force and I am utilizing that Force to reach to God and this particular Force which is called ego is the main the hurdle the main the wall that is standing before between me and God so I keep that particular Force the ego at my back how becoming humble that I am the servant of God whatever I am doing if it is successful I am not going to take the credit rather I always say because of God so that I am utilizing that tremendous power to proceed towards God that is the sadhana now it goes on like this in the and afterwards he said is God it is God who does everything is mentioning it is God who does everything we are only instruments so this is the attitude one should have otherwise the ego will bind and binding means you'll have to come back again and again in this world you have to take birth and maybe in different names different forms in different places in different situation and you have to go through that sequence sometimes suffering sometimes these sometimes that so obviously one should be very very careful so those who are those who are interested those who have understood the Foley the temporariness of this world they should one after another the elderly people whom you we knew are passing away those faces we are all missing them but this is obvious one day we also will go away it is obvious so keeping this in mind that those people they were there they were so powerful so influential and and now where they are so these are the every everyday experience every day experience of this world teaches us that this world is so temporary and if we think that we will be permanent in this completely temporary thing that is called Maya that is called delusion so obviously if one can understand this and immediately his or her thought will be then what shall I do from here the Journey Begins a spiritual journey is beginning now bhagavansirama Krishna in this page 791 and the gospel of sirama Krishna he mentioned that utilize the power that is trying to bind you to get the Liberation how by becoming humble the ego that binds utilize that ego saying constantly I am the servant of God so that ego cannot bind you if you are becoming humble first second attitude towards God now he is mentioning the some people came and they were telling the God Is So compassionate the cinema Krishna said why why do we have to say like that because God has created us see the attitude I believe that I am the Son of God God has created me shall I have to be all the time grateful to my father oh Father give me this pain father gave me this father father is supposed to give who is going to help the son obviously I am the son and I have every right to get all these things from my parents from my father from my mother for everything why shall I have to say oh I am so grateful my father is so gracious do we say that no why the relation I am the son so I have every right to demand from my father from my parents so that is the attitude I am not afraid of God in English they say God fearing person why should one should fear God is my father he is my Creator why should I be afraid of him if I make mistake well then that time I may be a little bit afraid because father may be angry and again if I say that I am sorry I made that mistake the the father will naturally say okay so don't repeat it that much so this the activity if we have the basic thing is we have to have the great faith in the existence of God and we must believe that God has created me we must think that I and the god are related the God is somewhere he is the ruler he is the Punisher why should we think in that way there's a unique the attitude towards God God is the creator and he has created me so I have every right to demand to God to give everything to me why not why should I have to go all the time with folded hands this is sirama krishna's attitude sometimes people they think what is the special contribution of sirama Krishna you see that is the reason I gave the name Pancham of Veda Veda means knowledge is the fifth book that is giving the Book of Knowledge and very clearly explaining everything and it makes us so easy to approach God to pray to God to go towards God first is the faith the God is there second the belief that I am the created being of God that means I am the son of the daughter we are the children of God and the third if we are truly children of God then we need not to be afraid of God or that we should love God the instead of saying that God-fearing person we should say God lover so we love God because he is our own then he is mentioning then the captain said oh you are right they don't regard God as their own immediately bhagavansi ramakrishna is rectifying correcting the captain he said of course the God is compassionate of course he is but when the of course we should as long as we practice sadhana so do you not then address God as compassionate of course we should as long as we are practicing sadhana after realizing God one rightly feels that God is our father or mother so just by saying it on do it is a sadhana you should feel truly the God is my father God is my mother God is so close to me and there is nothing but God before that you have to say God is compassionate God is all powerful God is all pervading all those attributes the gunas we have to give to God so that we can put our mind we can realize him so these are the conceptions so clearly so sometimes we are very much afraid of religion and we we are very much afraid and a little curious about the spiritual people oh what is there just normal people but very good people why because of this attitude because of this idea that God has created this universe so how can I discriminate how can I judge how can I the complain about others all God's thing he wants to put that man in that way he wants to put that person in that way it is all his I am all right with him that's all so my path my relation with God that is my completely personal so religion is a very very subjective why because it is clear understanding all those performances that we do in the beginning it is all right but if we think those practices are the goal no that is the mistake the practice makes us perfect as they say and what are the practices first extreme faith that God is there something or someone is there though I cannot see I cannot touch I cannot have any experience of God through these five sense organs because my understanding my knowledge is limited why because I am only having five instruments I am not having sixth one only five instruments what are those my eyes my ears my touch my smell and these are the five ways I can understand things when I test all this is good very tasty very sweet or I touch or I smell I by all these five ways I can understand beyond that I'm sorry I don't have anything but the God is beyond this five so what I will do how can I reach that so that is a special practice and when we can develop that special power if you can say it is a power or the understanding then you see it is me only it is within me it's not outside I need not to go search anywhere is all within me all through so in as I often quote the eunuch the Hindi couplet though my friend where you are searching me I am just so close to you if you truly searching me just in a blinking of an eye you can see me so you have to search properly then only it is possible in a blinking of an eye we can realize so that is the inspiration in the sadhana it is possible at this moment we are thinking oh how can I see God has no name God has no form God has I cannot touch God then then how it is possible I am that so moment I can understand that that's all because sometimes because of some disease the people they forget who they are and after the treatment when they become all right once again the same person understand oh this is me has he gone somewhere to find him no only at one point of time he or she forgot because of some disease then because of the medic medications because of the medicine treatment once again come back he is there she is there only for God that's all I am God but I have forgotten and what will happen if I am becoming God so that bhagavan's ramakrishna says then he the God for him it is all equal and nothing to desire because there is nothing else but God the king he is the Supreme King of the whole country each and every thing of that country belongs to him the river the heel that trees the people the animals the birds whichever is there within that geographical boundary it belongs to him why should I he he should say oh I need that I should keep it there it is he is only as a sort of that type of a Feeling that everything belongs to me so I don't need anything so what happens there remains no desire for the worldly things because the world became all all after the realization of God it becomes just like the children's or the the games all the small dolls all these things become unnecessary things so completely detached he becomes bhagwan's ramakrishna is mentioning which if we say God is compassionate God is all powerful we are making God in a distance but at the same time in the beginning of the spiritual life we must say that why because we are developing so in 792 page in the first para he is mentioning during the stage of sadhana one should describe God by all his attributes friends this is very important statement sometimes particularly we have noticed that in the Europe and America most of the swamis most of the spiritual people and so-called intellectual people they are discussing about the vedanta it has become a household name vedanta but what is that and by that way people are losing the devotion that is dangerous because oh I am not the body not the mind I am the self I am all pervading we are just hearing and thinking but at the same time I am running to his office to maintaining these maintaining that this is hypocrisy so if you practice The Path of Knowledge you have to give away everything because except you there is no existence at all not the God not the guru not the scripture nothing is there only once you have heard that you are that that's all is it possible for each and everyone to practice that even in the bhagavad-gita Shri Krishna has mentioned this path is a valid path but it is very very difficult so when we cannot practice it but at the same time we are trying to impose on ours it becomes hypocritic and there is no good result so bhagavan Cinema Krishna in this page 792 of the Gospel he mentioned during the stage of sadhana one should describe God by all his attributes God g capital he's the only reality but we are trying to reach trying to understand through attributes why because we can understand that without the gunas without the qualities without the name without the form it is impossible right this moment to have any conception but our mind is trained in that way utilize that so when we are utilizing the mind oh God also is having some names God is also having some qualities then we can formulate an idea about God and we can start our journey from there so he is mentioning one day hazrat said to Narendra Narendra afterwards Swami Vivekananda here 17 18 years young person it was very intelligent very well read but he used to sing before God thinking that God is listening to his prayer which he is mentioning through songs but the this person the hazra who read some of the scriptures and he is saying to the Narendra God is infinity infinity is he is splendor do you think he will accept your offering of sweets and bananas or listen to your music this is a mistaken notion of yours he said to Narendra who was devoted to God and who was thinking that God is listening and accepting his offering but when he heard from this person an elderly person and apparently a man of knowledge what happened to him Narendra at once sank obtained fathoms at once he thought oh my God then what will happen to me if there is no God at all so without that tribute without the name without the quality if the God is Not There then where we will go I am singing before God I am thinking God is listening my prayer is reaching to him that's a wonderful soulless is coming a peace is coming within the mind I am preparing the food with all care after bathing in the morning and then putting on the wash clothes I am preparing the food for God offering to God and I am thinking that God is eating that I am getting his blessings that Joy that relation with God will be immediately destroyed if somebody says oh there is no God or all those things are nonsense then where I go I'm going to go I am not that intelligent or in that labor the God is all pervading Consciousness I just think in that way I have not developed that and at the same time somebody has taken out whatever I was having so where I am now Krishna so nicely he mentioned even a person so intelligent well-versed well-read will that having the knowledge he himself the Narendra he himself sank 10 fathoms so I say to hajra now the God himself bhagwan's ramakrishna he is the God himself he came in that form to teach us what he said to hajra he said you villain where will these youngsters be if you talk to them like that so one should be careful the teachers must be very careful if you're just giving a class in the University it is a of course a philosophy and we were discussing this is this this is that the ultimate vedanta advaitha vedanta there is okay but when the question of practice of spirituality comes then the teacher must be very careful he must judge whether the student is ready for this type of practices or not and then he should say the practice in this way if a person who is teaching the mathematics in the University goes to the primary level students and say Hey you fools why you are doing like that it should be like this calculus and all that what he's actually teaching nothing rather if say oh you still so good you can under you can make one plus one two that is so good so intelligent of you is encouraging the person to grow towards that ultimate goal so these are the responsibilities of the teachers those who are teaching the spiritual knowledge and by that sudama Krishna is unique he always gives people that type of knowledges that type of teachings that type of advices which will really benefit and with that they will slowly grow up so when the hazra who read the vedanta and advaitha vidanta and he spoke in that way sudama Krishna never liked him so he scolded hajra no doubt God has no doubt sudama Krishna is mentioning no doubt God has infinite Splendor yet he is under the control of his devotees brahmana Rupa kalpana the kalpana means imagining that we imagine God and that is why in the if you go to the Hindu temples you will find so many varieties of gods are there some are 10 hands some are six and some are four hands some are with two and different type of there same Hindu in the northern part of India they worship Krishna in one form in the southern part in another form the color of the images or the statues are different it doesn't matter at all I am concentrating through that particular image and that is the main idea concentration I mean we drawing the Mind from the worldly objects and there are five objects are there in the world the Rupa Russia and Ganda it is the form it is the sound it is the smell it is the Taste all these five things are there I am withdrawing my mind and concentrating and to concentrate I take the help of image what wrong so this is the idea of dualistic way and that is so simple and so effective applicable for everyone we do not say that this is the only path srama Krishna is mentioning it is the God has truly so many Splinter and beyond all this it is true but at this moment when a person is not prepared one should not say him that so this is the way he says and at sadhana different type of sadhanas are there and those who are the students of the com the gospel of sirama Krishna you know the sirama Krishna himself mentioned there are four stages the person who is trying to reach God sadhaka means the student who is trying to understand or realize God first is called prabhataka in Sanskrit Papa means the beginner and he is just beginning and willing to begin the sadhana that is called pravarthaka second is sadhaka he has already started the practice some are prabharthaka they are thinking to do that so they go to this person they go to that person they read this book they did that book they are all they're thinking where to go and how to do this have not yet started the journey sometimes you will find the after the completion of the Class 12 and particularly in this country we have seen the students and their parents they will be visiting different universities and trying to understand which university will be good for that particular student and what type of subject he or she should take they are called prabharthaka so one person is going to this Temple and oh Krishna then another is going to Oak this Kali is also good then tomorrow Durga the Shiva the different type of things he is doing and trying to understand this is called prabharthika and then comes sadaka then he decided these are the subjects I am going to start study and he will enroll or she will enroll in a university but this is my University this is my college and I am going to attend this school and the teachers and the subjects are good for me so my mind is set and he started or she started studying that is called sadhaka when is sadaka he or she should not dwindle from these or that why because the energy is flittering by that way a little bit of or the Buddhism a little bit of Christianity little bit of Hinduism a little bit of other religions philosophy now you are wasting your time whatever the guru has said we should follow that because I have accepted it nobody forced me that that is called sadhaka the spiritual sadaka is very very attentive do the goal and my goal is to realize God and to realize God the basic thing I have to forget this world and in this world there are name Fame so many things are going all around like you are going to attend a fear so many things in one place Merry-Go-Round is going on the circle and all that now I don't need all those I don't need I am concentrated to God I have to withdraw the Mind anything that distract my attention I should shun that that is called sadaka the pravartaka the beginner and sadaka the one who has already started the journey then they go to a place where they are sit there they become confident now God is there not that they have realized God fully but they have the realization that God is there and they are not much attracted by the worldly name Fame and Comforts that's called siddya the siddya they had achieved the success that success is there so they are happy people that is called siddya siddir siddya that is the ramakrishna's word he is the matured one completely he has become or she has become the god himself that particular person whose Journey began as a prabharthaka when he becomes sick day siddha the God himself and for him there is nothing but God because he feel or she feels I am that that is the unique situation he mentions in a beautiful way he is mentioning that is the mukti it is not achieving or going to the heaven No Heaven means a very good place but temporary again and after reaching over there all my good work that I have done and for that I go to heaven and I enjoy the heaven and then I slowly slowly all my the stock of good work the result goes away again you have to come back to this world again you have to take birth again you have to start the journey that is not the final the heaven is a temporary but good place they say but the Hindus and the Buddhists and the jains they say no it is mukti they use the buddhis they use the word Nirvana and the Hindu they use the word mukti they're all same and what is that the going beyond the circle of birth and death how understanding that desire is the main bondage and giving up the desire complete desire they become mukta they become free there is no desire so no coming back desires the the strings so many varieties of desires so these are the it goes and what happens at the time of the prabharthaka the beginner is called anuraga that's some understanding about God and the love for God is so slowly developing that's called anuraga so this other wonderful Sanskrit words it carries the the meaning the anuraga Raga means attachment Raga means desire and of course the Raga when you say there are many different meanings are there and that's why it is so difficult the Indian language they will use the word Raga in the music is completely different meaning and when they use Radha in Bengali It is anger when they use Raga for the Sanskrit it is the attachment is the desire but unuraga when they are using anuraga it's a love and attachment for God of course sometimes the worldly attachment worldly love ah slowly developing so we can say to give the example a young boy and a young girl they're coming to know each other and if when they come to each other they talk it to each other they think about each other it's called anuraga so they love the company so I am loving the company of God I am going to the temple I am cleaning the photo or the image of God I am giving the offering the flower so that I am liking that is called anuraga and then sadaka in the second stage when he has already taken up this is my path it's called bhalobasha the bhalawasha that means he started loving so this is my goal this is my god or goddess so I am not going to look at anything but this is my I'm not going to criticize also I am not going to say that others are not good of course I have the respect but my spatial attraction is to this particular God this is called Eastern ishta means the chosen goal and nishta is complete attention to achieve that so this second third is baculata deeper love I cannot remain without that so in the sleep in the waking stage in every time my mind is constantly think of thinking of God bhagavan siddam Krishna has a simple way he used to give the example he said it is like the the toothache the wind the pain in the the tooth is there every time the pain I can feel that pain it is terrible pain those who have suffered but the pain but at the same time I am talking to people because I don't I know I cannot be completely free from this pain so but at the same time I cannot just lie down so I have to attain all my duties so he is attending the duties but a portion of his mind is constantly with that pain is a unique example that he gave the same way I am talking to people I am visiting other places I am doing these I am doing that but at the same time I am constantly remembering God each and every moment in the bhagavad-gita the Lord Krishna is asking Sometimes some people they blame because of the religion in Hinduism and they give up all actions of course that that was the wrong interpretation and wrong wrong practices for some time for some people but it is not true because our God SRI Krishna he mentioned you go on remembering me and fight forget about other responsibilities other duties it is in the war failed if you are little at the on the your attention is not there you will be killed by your enemy the arrows are coming and the other things are coming you have to be very careful at the same time you have to fight your way in that battle the Arjuna was inspired by the words of Krishna my duty as a warrior is to punish all those bad peoples because they are creating problems for the Ordinary People ordinary masses I am the hero I have to one punish them so he is fighting with them killing them but at the same time constantly remembering God that is the heroic going sitting in corner of a room not talking to anyone not no sound nothing oh peace or peace anyone can do that and what type of Peace you get you also don't know the wind there is no challenges how you will know that your mind is ready for that so you have to of course in the beginning it is better to be lonely but and if we are talking about the third stage that is called byakulata and in that Bakula his mind is completely merged with God but at the same time not forgetting his own duties or responsibilities so and in the society in whatever position he or she may be they should perform a father or a mother a judge a police officer an army or the administrator doctor engineer wherever they are performing their duties very nicely perfectly but at the same time their mind is constantly thinking of God so that is the third stage called siddha siddha Basta mom go on remembering me or Arjuna and perform your duties and the final is called Ikat Mata Mata with the god being one with God in the bhagavad-gita sixth chapter 22nd verse I'm mentioning only the one line it says achieving that position what happens beyond that or something else I know the mind will never go into that I don't need anything if someone has realized the God and if the offer comes to him you become the prime minister of this country or the president of that country or the king of that particular country you will simply say no I don't want that because I have already achieved much more than that that is called the one who is already is purely perfectly successful what is better than that so I have realized God is okay but the position of the president of America oh let me go for that are the king I will become a king of a country let me have that that means he has not realized God any desire any name and form any any Fame no that means he has not achieved that so that is the teaching of bhagavan sirama Krishna and bhagavan Shri Krishna they always give so clear ideas and it's called tapasya and that when we talk about the tapasya we think that eating less or wearing very less clothings that is good in the beginning is truly necessary but that is only one part of the tapasya and if they say there are three stages three tapusha at a time together you have to practice one is physically then through words and also through thoughts mental these are the three ways the actions that we do Karma that we do we think that we are quietly sitting so we am I am not doing any Karma so no Karma follow will come wrong when you are thinking the wrong things Bad Karma follow will come to you or you are seeing sayings the words in such a way that that is harming others that the Bad Karma Pala you do not know what type of word should be good for that particular person but pronouncing yourself as a teacher of the spiritual world if you are misdirecting the Ordinary People for which they are not ready that is also the Bad Karma follow like a doctor not very much aware or sure about the patient what type of medicine will bring good to him or her if they prescribe that medicine is a Bad Karma a bad result the one should be capable to understand what type of medicine will be effective for this particular patient same medicine same type of disease but the doctor must be intelligent enough to understand whether he is having other ailments or not side effects will be there or not and judging all those things when they are prescribing the medicine that is a good doctor a spirituality also understanding that they are not mentally ready one should be very careful suggest what type of path the simplest and the best way bhagavan SRI ramakrishna suggested that is the mixture of Guyana Karma and bhakti Narada he mentioned for this particular age it is the Narada bhakti what is the Narada bhakti is a mixture of knowledge action and of course devotion and that is why when we are practicing sadhana physically we are trying to be separated from all these but mentally and through words we are attest so he they say in the bhagavad-gita it mentioned in the 17th chapter 14 15 and 16 these three verses categorically mentioned about the three tapasya this is the uniqueness of Hinduism for everything in the scripture you will find everything has been very clearly explained so what is the tapasya as Sanskrit word tapasya means spiritual austerity what is the spiritual austerity physical and what is the physical deba Guru pragya pujanam shocham arjabam brahmacharyaimsacha shariram the worship of the Gods Deva twice born that means very cultured person Guru Guru is the preceptor and pragya a learned person a wise person am you have to give respect to them so how I am becoming humble fast the my ego am I some the disordinary person why should I have to go and touch his feet why should I have to listen to him that is the ego they cannot develop in spirituality so the physically if you go to the Builder mode you will see the this discipline that the belur mod brahmacharins in the training center they are practicing and this is all first you have to go and serve the elderly swamis they are of different temperaments different way they will behave but you have to be calm and all the time very Cooperative smiling face and never take those in your mind mind should be very clear so these are Deva Guru pragya pujanam means you are worshiping them very humble a person he is a very knowledgeable person he's a very cultured person I must be humble before him because he has achieved those wonderful qualities first thing then shocham he must be very clean mentally and also physically and the dirty clothes and dirty way of leaving and never removed the no it is not very neat and clean straightforward the labor think in a crooked way and the different very straightforward very simple and brahmacharya continents is a mind is one pointed so naturally is not going to enjoy physically anything and ahimsa non-violence your own in the neighbor criticize others think bad about others nothing like that that is called saridanta his physical tapasya then comes bangmaya the speech austerity of the speech am that speech will call no neighbor cause anxiety to others the person practicing spirituality will never uses the words or sentences that will cause tension in others it should be truthful the words that I'm using it should be truth this sometimes whenever we are talking we add something or deduct something so real picture is not coming but because my mind is not trained so satyam priyam it should be very pleasant and Hita muchacha the hitam Cha Cha means and satyam priyam hitam the priyam the when you are talking people like to listen to that nicely is putting it and hitam and that will be beneficial and if it is to criticize no that is not the way the one the practicing spirituality should follow and he must must practice the read the scripture every day then comes the austerity of the Mind the physically then the bachika as the words speech and the mind Inside the Mind the thoughts manaprasada the Mind should be Serene mind should be calm and composed all the time is very kindliness is a practices silence is a self-control means the thoughts and the motive some sudhi pure whenever he or she is going to do something it is for the betterment of others oh let me tell like this Inspire like that so that I in future I will get this benefit the then that person is not a spiritual person friendship is very very difficult to find the spiritual person so that is why the shankaracharya mentioned that it is really really we need God's grace to find three things with human birth having the desire to become free from the bondage of worldliness and third is a great guide true spiritual guide we doubt the grace of God is impossible to get majority of the people Being Human Being desired to get Liberation or God realization but unfortunately they go to the bad places wrong places and they don't get the proper guidances for spiritual life why majority of the people in the name of religion they try to do business or mind profit my organization and my asthma my these my dad again it is a bondage the whole world is nothing but Maya then why should he be don't go to other people don't eat their food don't do this these are all wrong things so we have to pray to God to get a good guide and following this tapasa one become completely free from all bondages and what is the achievement is a pure joy happiness called Bliss thank you friends we will close over here and then afterwards will be continuing in the next a class from this page number seven nine two thank you one person has asked some eight questions but the gist of it is when he does meditation he's getting some experiences and one of the experiences is body shaking he then after that he becomes stable but the feeling does not stay long he is asking how to keep that experience forever so what is the name I I would suggest that if you have the guru if you have taken initiation or instruction you should ask this question to him this is very very personal because the experience that you are having the in meditation you should only disclose to your Guru and he will be the right person to guide you but in general we can say that these are the normal experiences when we are practicing the meditation so when we are we drawing the mind be careful with drawing the Mind from the Saints objects what are the Saints objects the Rupa Russia shabda Ganda Etc so from there then where the mind will go the mind was busy playing with the five objects now you have stopped the mind to go where it will go it will go to the real power so obviously it starts moving so this type of experiences come but it is better you talk to your Guru thank you so let us say this pranam mantra and we conclude
