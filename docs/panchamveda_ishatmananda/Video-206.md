[207. Panchama Veda 207: The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna - Topic : An Egotistic Person Cannot Realize God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUXi1jFCfWU)

the Quran written dr. jeevan KO be rewritten calm asha struggle among golem three magatha Tom Boonen da Buddha dodging AMA province Ram Krishna he was having the conversation at the devotees as usual which have been recorded by master mahashiv Mahan Dennard gupta it was the Sunday September 21st 1884 so it is continuing ceramic dish dimension independent conversation go suddenly he says something which is very important for the spiritual people those who are interested today those who are very sincere to realize God for them he mentioned an egoistic person cannot realize God with a statement of fact as if he is mentioning an egoistic person cannot realize God do you know what egotism is like it is like a high mound where rainwater cannot collect the water runs off water collects in lowland their seed sprout and grow into trees did the trees be true so this way he is giving an example but the thing is what is egoism the egotism now when I am associated with this body and mind when I'm thinking this particular world and my area that is very permanent and I'm very much serious to get some name fame appreciation from the local people so that is the cause of ego so I am having money I am a good singer I am a good tease and that I am beyond many so many people have below me that is egoism and what is the realization of God exactly positive so that is the reason the when seriousness a egotistic person cannot realize God did not that simply stating like this it is a reason and what is the reason reason is this ego and the cut realization exactly opposite ego is associated with the body and mind and God realization this association of the body mind and also the connected things so he said in this way therefore I say to Hara he said to her so that he is referring never think that you alone have true understanding and that others are fools this we see always in the world in the society and it is very much rampant in this type of thought in the spiritual world also so wherever you go into oh you belong to that group that isn't nothing like this they will always say there is wrong how do you know that he is not going to realize God through that path if you feel that that is not appealing to you that is different but you cannot denounce that particular path why moaning do you think that your path is the best that means your ego is working once again so that is the main reason now question may come then what about the Shankar Acharya refuting the others point Shankar Acharya is trying to place his own philosophy his own argument that's where he is refuting the others point it doesn't mean he's denouncing completely not like that he's a philosopher and all his philosophical points arguments and logic that he is placing before you that much now what is the difference that we always find in the philosophy particularly Indian to the zombies they always argue on the creator who is the creator second the creation and the relation between the creation and the creation creator and who is the creator is of these and what is this creation these how the creation came like these what is the relation these so here some people they say God has created us out of what his free will and then God he is outside this so he has created and giving you this thing now you have to pursue to reach to him that is one Shankar Acharya he's very excellent in explaining Darth Vader it cannot be where the God is creating creating out of himself if it is so then we are also the same and how he has created through his wish and if it is a wish and he is not connected with that naturally it is like our dream and it's not true so in the dream you see everything and you believe that is very true and that's why sometimes you are happy sometimes you are in miserable condition in the dream if you could at that moment in the dream think oh I am dreaming then it is not a dream so when it is a dream then that is that particular time the moment it is very much real similarly this world also is a dream as a long dream that is the idea of the show so the Bell antic way of approaches when he correct otherwise you cannot explain me anything so that that way he is putting his own idea but he is not he is only refuting not denouncing you like that idea and a problem continuing to sing with others but the afterwards the followers defined he was reading whatever the path that I am following his acoustic thinking it says this is the only path right path others are bad so Serrano Krishna is giving the caution he says never think that you alone have true understanding and the others are fools one must love all so here also it needs a little explanation in this way we must love all does it mean that I should not have any religion I should not have any particular practices no this my choice this my way I like it I follow it but at the same time I believe that that other path that other people are following there is also true that brought nurse that catholicity that understanding it should be why because if I believe that everything has come out of God the course also it has come out of God so that different thoughts also because of the God's will they are thinking in a different way Who am I to criticize that so that I become humble the moment they become humble I am one-pointed I am focused on my own path my philosophy my hydrology my practices I'm focused on their but at the same time I am not criticizing others thinking those are also the will of God so this is a beautiful way ceramic dish dimensioning nothing exists without him and nothing exists without him this is called faith this is called understanding this is called the knowledge nothing exists without him the Lord three to prelada now he's giving an example and that is especially to anybody will say something immediately he will give an example to make the point very clear he is telling Lots say to Pearl Harbor provides is a wonderful character of the bhagavata and he is a devotee Lord is asking us kaboom of me then the Prahlada is inclined I have seen you replied for louder that is enough I don't need anything else but the loading system now thereupon the Prahlada see see no desire at all but the only desire is to see God now that is good for you I don't need anything else except God what else this world and what is this world creation of the God and why should I go for the creation of God when I get the call himself the pritilata is by that a very clear but when the God is insisting then look at it then prelada is free but the Lord insisted thereupon prelada said if you must give me a boon let it be that those who have tortured me main artist may not have to suffer punishment so this is called God realization do we accept Jesus as an avocado we accept Jesus as an Avatara why he also could bring the same passion same manner o God forgive those what they do not know what they do that we find in the Bible why is they to God for they not of the compassion because he knows there is nothing but God now Sadam occasion is explaining when he said will not say if you must give me a boon let it be there those who have tortured me may not have to suffer punishment Nostromo krishna is explaining the meaning of those word is dead it was God who tortured for nada in the form of his persecutors in the form of his persecutors who tortured pelada God himself so that is called the realization that is called the knowledge and there is no chance of misunderstanding those who were torturing me they are separate no not like that this should be and if this suffer punishment it would really be God who is up so this is the clear knowledge we say art waiting Vedanta where we only see one and this Vedanta here also we find that only one what is that one doing them in the dualistic what is this God only exist and nothing else and the belong think we'll say Brahman the consciousness is only dwelling and nothing else and the dualist the devotee will say God only if it is God only that how can i - Desai's others because it's God only and nothing else how can I pray to God who keep their punishment because they tormented me how can I do that this is the highest realization but it's God realization this is called God realization the feeling of one whether we approach it is through the 12 stick path or not well stick path and whatever it may be but ultimately this is the God so when the Jesus is telling love thy neighbor as thyself people know these great words then the same Jesus sailed in other place that is anyone can do loving neighbor I would ask you to love your precious your persecutors that is called spirituality love your neighbor is morality but when you can pray for your persecutors that is spirituality why now you know underst you that there is no one except God and those who are actually creating problem for me is God only in that form creating problem so there I become more attached to God more playful to God the God is helping me in that way and that is called God realization most of the people that we are skin the have you realized card what is that God realization etcetera etcetera this is God realization God realization means understanding very clearly there is nothing but God and whatever is happening that is because of the God and can you imagine that I am living in the in that thought constantly whoever around me is nothing but God so this what he say establishments continuing Radha was bandwidth prema a static love of God but there is also the madness of bhakti this party the madness he's using the word madness and what is this madness why we use the word man because the person is not behaving as other people are behaving so that is the man whenever there is someone behaving in different way oh man now some people they are wearing two different color of socks in two feet so previously you say have you lost your senses why you are wearing this is the fashion now everybody's accepting no no problem so all depends on our acceptance now in person that a child is born he grew up get education start earning and then family and grew up with the family keep touch with the neighbors and family members and all that they'll normal then one day he dies that's not and sometimes some people are not mixing with others that also there just is okay but if he goes for God and he says he says that I don't need anything except God then his feelings will say well he has gone mad crazy they will take him to doctor that is the very peculiar because we believe in God we go to cover we go to the temple and churches and all the holy places but the moment we someone we see they're mad for God then is it meant so this is the problem Radha was mad with prema the prema means only one way the prema is not two ways high now whether God loves me or not that doesn't matter I know God is there I know except God nothing is there and my existence is only because of the God and dear I am keeping little separation because I like that I am I should go for God I should make Garland for God I should cry for God I should hanker for the company of God everything all the emotions I am directing towards God the that is called prema the poverty is much lower but with the prema bhakti that is the highest because there is no other thought than God and how that can be because I feel the presence of God in front of me all the time and it is so joyful the moment I'm disassociated with that joy it becomes that I'm going to die so that his mother is like that Sheeta also entering into the fire worse because now the Sita that he is giving them Hanuman ji who was so devoted to see how much anger he went to fight with Rama when he saw the schita is entering into the fire even because of the love wife Sita because if the schita is not their money God Rama Chandra will suffer on his concern is for Rama so he wanted to save Sita and he became angry with round because he wanted Rama to say no to seek the stop you need not to accept that all things come because of the love see Rama Krishna is telling the death also came that Gandhi he want me to I used to roam like a mad person then the Narayan Shastri as a scholar not on his collar he was practicing spirituality also the most of the people the study scripture their scholars they know anything but as because they do not practice spirituality practice meditation practice controlling his senses they do not understand the subtlest point of spirituality they understand all of the things if you go and talk with some people the philosophers immediately particularly the Shankara and Ramanuja the debate they have memorized and they will immediately they will say Ramanuja is giving this punch and Carre's giving this part and all the terminologies they will you but what about understanding the point and when you understand the point you have really being accordingly otherwise you have not understood it you are behaving accordingly we have understood that if I put my finger into fire it is going to burn I will never put my finger into the fire my behavior will show that I have understood it now a child who is not Drona maybe four years five years the mother told see this is electric point it should not put your finger into it the moment the mother turns out bad the child will go and put his finger in it now let me see what is there so knowledge was but realization was not there so we go to that difficulty the moment she is putting the finger the Sharks and all that afterwards maybe after surviving that suffering that he will realize it then soon so what is realization understanding of the point understanding means he knew personal life you are exactly behaving according otherwise not so when the people say the god realization has civilized God you need a task these are our behavior will show whether they have realized God or not and what is God only one which existing and all the creation is nothing but his dream his creation he is leash so what we should demand what would you want try to realize God why is creation so this way we have to understand and this is called very simple what is religion some practices why don't we do those practices to realize the spirituality what is the spirituality isn't true and what is that truth God is only existing and nothing else I'm using the word I can many other words also can be used in the modern times there are many words have been used to express that truth supreme truth only one is existing and how I realized God and I will feel my behavior in my thought in my whole personality there is only one there cannot be two so whenever I see that - it is only the Falls I must have to see the one that is exactly what's ramakrishna is daily and he is stealing i touched my ate and lips with the leaf plate from which the beggars ate their food in the guest house of the kali temple he is explaining his condition this is the highest condition he was a prominent he was a priest at the same time over there before everyone he was to go and touch those plates that has been used by different people people any know the caste system in our country a priest a Brahmin is not supposed to touch those and Saddam official not only touchy he's touching with the lead and also touch even the hail giving the idea that I am one of those now what happened thereupon al-abadi said to me hello Daria is one of the relatives however what have you done you have taken the foot lift with Biggers how are you in many of your children he's asking Saddam additional these words aroused my anger Hello Dolly was my cousin older than myself you know in our country even the one year older we always give the respect but Saddam Krishna is telling though he was older but I could not restrain my serve I say to him new rage isn't it you would take pride in the study of the Eitan the Vedanta it is you who teach people that Brahmin alone is real and the world illusory and yet you imagine that I shall be good to me like that is the his very act so this is the difference and when you study something and we say something we do not believe in that another person so in our behavior it is not manifested so this is the difference sadhana Krishna didn't read those things but he realized that that's where the truth of oneness was always present in his behavior holida equals the great scholar he studied he saved Brahman alone existed nothing else and this world is illusion just like the Shankar Acharya but at the same time even the Shankar Acharya also had this type of experience you know that in the life of Shankar Acharya one day he was going to take bath in the Ganga in Carty and that then he found a local person is coming with saw the dogs street dogs and that person is to burn the dead bodies and you know in the lower caste in our society when he was coming with the dogs and Shankar Acharya though he was the propounded of the are doing the Vedanta and there is only brahmana nothing else everything is only Artman he said hey go away I am going to take the or maybe after bathing in the Ganga he was coming back so he never wanted to touch that then he started our green what is going to touch you this body and your body made of same thing my body and your body made of same thing that bone the marrow of the blood and the flesh what else and what is going to touch you myself and yourself same thing so what you are thinking that if I touch you you have to go and bathe once again to purify yourself Shankara immediately understood he is not an ordinary person he was the Shiva himself that gave the Shankara not done realize a not the knowledge realization knowledge Shankar was added but this is the realization so sodanope is none is a realized soul and that is the reason in his behavior always his mentioning like that the master continued with the description of his divine madness then the devotee is asking how can a householder keep on with his worldly duties if he is over Earth by such bhakti madness or love madness or knowledge madness is a very practical Christian see how nicely he's asking you asked him are talking about the be mad be mad man be mad for the God but I'm a householder I have some responsibilities I have to take care of my family how can I be like that I cannot be like you densitometry sneeze giving the answer looking at him there are two kinds of Yogi's one revealed and the hidden the householder maybe a hiddenly yogi non recognises him the householder should renounce mentally not outwardly but this is a very clear instruction for the householder he didn't yogi he's practicing renunciation he knows the God alone is there but at the same thing is behaving in such a way as if he is a father he is taking care and his Dean DS is doing everything he is doing at the same time every moment he is telling to himself this is completely temporary as long as I'm in this body and mind I have to practice this I am going on doing this like a person doing you know in the theater then some the actor is acting in this way and that way that has been given to him he has to do that tilda the play is over he will continue in that way we will do very great friends very close friends but in that act they have to behave like the enemies they'll be constantly fighting and criticizing they'll behave like that as long as the play will continue but inside the know his main frame rather sometimes we have seen if the opponent has forgotten the tiler he will respect to sister your talent so he inspired him and also helped him to tell the dialogue properly so this is the way they understand so this is called he may become the he is telling that a devotee may be a hidden Julie the devotee the householder now the master is looking and RAM is telling you talk as if there was consoling the children the ROM the doctor you are concerning the children because householder may be a gang but never a beginning all these words Rama's learned from slum resna now he is applying that why you were consoling us we like to be journey and house older may be again in any means having the knowledge have began in practicing that knowledge into his life so he said that Gani and became master he may become a beginning in the end look at it he may become a beginning in the end when all the duties are over you become the beginning recently one couple came one is 84 and the wife is 82 so the mature but in this country they keep the good health that and they were telling there we are visiting different holy places elastomers only and then I stay one or two days and pray to God and these dead they're going on spending days like that so I when I was talking to them I was telling them and slowly slowly all the lectures that you have hard all the monks that you have made you must have learned something isn't it now you have to manifest those teaching into your life that must be the goal because the time is very short we do not know so now many has those teachings into your own life completely transformed into a spiritual that Islamic history is daily they can also become big journey began amines the knowledge that they occurred now I am manifesting through my thoughts through my behaviors and that should be my character constantly thinking and practicing that becomes a character so he is telling he may become a beacon in the game but it is not good to force oneself into renunciation renunciation is a completely different thing one should not force them sometimes are some of our songs out of the Great Seal of them inspired the young people he announces renounce and maybe sometimes you know in our country there meet a good person okay if the Xiaomi is telling it's ok but afterwards the Sun because that is not in his character that is not in his thought that is not natural he was adapting something which is not normal for him so he cannot become a good mom he cannot go back there's life no yo-yo not stato nothing in between he comes is a very pathetic life so that's why one must be cinema Krishna is that very practical and his the renunciation means you have completely understood this world is wholly the world is completely a dream I am NOT going to get anything out of this world they only and they do not come right in this way from the past birth it comes so that he says and he master is staining do these as soon as that I see two people do these as well as dead do your worldly duties and call on God as well I don't ask them to renounce everything so this is very practical gospel of ramakrishna it's a very clear idea in one group of monks they came and one of them he was telling he was quoting from the gospel and he was telling how could say it's none of distance a this there's no say there so if we redirect they are not the set of Ramakrishna mission monks but they read Ramakrishna sadhana business book and they're getting the inspirations the guidance and this is so broad for everyone a householder and the Mong both can be benefited and he said I say to people do these as well as that now he's clearing doing warning duties and : God and what is collar god when either you are finding time just praying to god remember god take the holy name God and have faith in the words of the great master surround Tichenor and when you are taking the name of God your mind is surely getting purified whether you understand it or not is getting purified then sometimes we take the medicine and when you take the medicine we do not understand how it is working but having faith in the words of the doctor doctor doctor has prescribed he has asked me to take the medicine in this just going on taking and that is keeping you healthy all right though you don't understand similarly when the Guru keeps the Holy Name of God just repeat that then most of the time in the end modern world as I explained the mantra to me first then I will accept the mantra see if I say the mantra - you know what initiation then it will be you have to take the mantra they may be I can explain that to you but the in an indirect way we always explained that the how the mantra is working except now this mantra means accepting an ideology and when you are understanding the technology the moment you are uttering that only name immediately that I told ology here oh my god is to practice this so this is the thing this is the thing that ideology slowly slowly it will transform your character and naturally it will take you for the better side so this is the way people are the Salama person is going on daily one day Kashyap was delivering a lecture and he saved Oh Lord grant us we may dive into the river of divine love and go straight to the ocean of satchitananda the ladies were seated behind the screen I said to cache up then and there so now cannot stop immediately the case of you know the emotional way is stealing but what he said he never meant the most of the time we do that what do we say we don't mean it but Salon original is not like that whatever he will say that he will mean so he immediately rectified Keshava the ladies were seated behind screen I said to Keisha how can you all type once for all pointing to the ladies I say then what should happen to them every now and then you must return to dry land you must die and rise alternatively Keisha and the others started laughing so this is how cinema kristin is teaching don't think in the way that you cannot practice unnecessarily is a wastage of time sometimes in our country the parents are very eager to make their children a doctor or an engineer so they will force them but they were better in other subjects but the peelings will force them no you must study these and these and ultimately what happened hi effectively they will study and after three years it's a five years course after three years or four years they say no I give up wastage of so much of money and the time they could be successful in something else so this is wrong Joy's understanding in the religious life also if we can understand that the path of knowledge we're constantly you have to think that I am NOT the body I am NOT the mind I am only search Eden and the Brahma then it is okay if you can do that but you cannot is better to accept that Brahma in the form of God same problem but in the form of God then the practice will be I belong to my god and the son of God and the daughter of God we are the children of God and naturally God will be always with me always with us when I am driving I start the driving with the prayer God be with me and now and then I am remembering so that is the way what is happening same thing so this is we have to understand in this condition we should behave like this the monks ways particularly those who are pedantic monks they're completely different type so if you hear they neither work the only go on thinking there is no meditation there is only thinking yesterday those monks came here discussing I told you you have to go on thinking I am NOT this body I am NOT this mind that is called Brahm no personal Brahma Vyasa constantly you have to go on telling and if you read the biography of this one or two the great sage who practice even the hands are cutting them they are looking at their body and thinking and not the body and cannot disturb me I am NOT disturbed that dance do their duty the body and the mind doesn't belong to me and completely different how many of us would be able to do the ramen or she he can practice that can I have to go to office I have to attend Spoony duties I have to practice this and Dad how can I be like Robert Morrissey so if I choose that all know she has my argue I have to leave everything and practice in his own way if I cannot it is better to choose some path which other great Souls they have realized in that path and let me change so that to Aslam pitch nun is very very practical we is teaching and he's talking with the devotees so obviously he is telling in this way now I say to people I don't ask them to renounce one day and other hustler says to me you love moved those endowed with Rajas those who have great wealth and name and fame if that is so then why do I love people like Aisha and no to the nota means the lot to sometimes not to Mirage surround is to pronounce lot to there's no tone sometimes the whyatt there is no to the lot to mother was not having anything so why a Nabi so much I'd take care of him every moment because I see goodness in them because I see that they are the potentiality is there to become the great manifested propaganda to see Ramakrishna selling some people they misunderstood so that is support systems Ramakrishna his room and went towards the pine globe about 5 o'clock afternoon Saddam hawkish nur was on his way to Calcutta in minor McCarthy and a few other devotees accompanying him to the mindless carriage thinking of God the master soon went into an ecstatic mood after a long time he regained consciousness of the world and he observed that fellow Astra he's thinking about the has restored he should not accept because other people they listen to us well the cinema Krishna is telling those devotees don't tell us those words seriously then he said I shall drink some water marketing machine noon that that is the way used to their bringing back his mind to the novel he often makes such a demands in order to bring his mind down to the Saints plane then milder to him may I get some refreshments for him the aim no he won't eat anything now master immediately master instill in that no no I should leave now sir he's smooth it is very difficult to understand there is no routine routine this moment I won't either be stood no not like that so they my handler too master to his mill located in the happy bobbin area there's a locality neighborhood after a little rest Ramakrishna was to go to the theatre so this is the very unique scenery of the master marche is writing down noting down and giving him very vivid description what happened in that theater now this is salam o krishna oniy a religious man going to all this but even after going over there he is as eve in the temple so he goes to every place I have realized that Brahmin and Shakti are identical sama business daily like water and his wetness like fire and his power power to burn Brahmin dwells in all beings as the bee boo be boo means all-pervading all pervasive consciousness though his manifestation is greater in some places than in others has receives the inner one who realizes God must also act where God's supernatural powers the other argument is this that he possesses these power to him in art and meaning may not use them not God realization but hustla his idea is different he was thinking if you have realized God he must have acquired the God's power the supernatural power marci Ramakrishna is not liking it Ramakrishna in the disciple who you say yes one must have control over the super powers mastered smiling yes one must have had them in one's glass how mean then is didn't he who has never enjoyed power and reaches become impatient for them but a true devotee never prays to God for them now here the game is very clear now if you put put the hands like this is like one is going up another is bringing him down so obviously the downside is the world and upper side is towards God there's two things one is God and there is this world the God is real ever present and the world is unreal temporary now the choice is yours if you go to God then you become permanent and if you go down towards the heart that's why they say always going towards the manifestation this is nothing but imagination so you go as long as your dream in a individual life in a dream you go and find these and that you are so happy the similarly in this life also one up to another success is coming you are so happy but suddenly the bubble burst and you will know if nothing is the air then what happens so that is the one main thing so the moment you think that supernatural power should come that means in the in your mind you are thinking this world is otherwise what we were going to do with the supernatural power something he liked to do in this world which is temporary you have already lived that to realize God he had already lived there to the other his God and after realization of the God what you are going to do with that and that's why in the cut off initially fine when the new chiquita is going to that king of death Yama Yama is offering him this thing EEMA Rama Rao storage' nahin Trisha uncle Yamanashi to look at these all great things you can enjoy them and I will give you the long life and also healthy life so you can enjoy them but this young boy he understood that all these things are false he said no I want to know about the art man so please tell me about the heart man accept that knowledge I don't want anything all these things let it belong to you I don't want here's Ramakrishna giving us the hint after half past eight in the evening the carriage is the master and the devotees drew up in front of the stock theatre in baton street he was accompanied by Iain Babu reminder to other two or three devotees and business to go all the devotees and some history is very happy dear is gender and the majors of the theatre accompanied by several officials came out to the carrot greeted the master talking to the and this party upstairs did it Girish heart the master and he was very glad to see him at the theater the master was giddy she was not that time introduced with the Masters is the first time his meeting and the master was conducted to one of the boxes so naturally the costly so that VIP thing they were there inside next to him Babu Ram and other devotees behind the hall was brilliantly lighted the master looked down at the beach and saw that there are so much of crowd and the boxes were also full for every box there was a man to fan those who occupied it that was all VIP boxes so these two one person is to draw the fan so like that see that wonderful description is going on cinema TV was filled with joy and said to him with his childlike smile is very nice here and glad to come to have come I feel inspired when I see so many people together then I clearly perceived that God himself has become everything look at it after going to the theatre seeing all that he is not thinking about the theatre he is thinking about the God God in so many people and all of them in the best actors and they are all eager to enjoy so their joy touching the art of cinema Tichenor and he is very happy aim is to say how much even the charges here and then see how much the same guy so because the he understood that is a VIP box in they won't take anything they are very happy that you have come to the theater monster it is all due to the grace of the Divine Mother so this is called humbleness and this is spontaneous and because I am someone they are respecting me known because of the god mother wanted so they respecting so this all going on and master much is giving the description in the first scene this there's a constant of the Shiva and Shakti is and all those things going on and the ceramic is not went into Samadhi in vain with this this is a on the life of chaitanya mahaprabhu when all people they were hearing that before before the chaitanya mahaprabhu the world is suffering shiva brahma vishnu they are thinking how to solve so the god is taking the human birth in the form object in the mahaprabhu and all those things ceramic dish they went into Samadhi he remained in that state a long time the orchestra played on gradually his mind came down to the rejecting plane now the last scene where he is speaking to his mother she she she was the name of the mother objected he's big into the mother please bless me so that I can take the sannyasa the moment I baked and the she fell down unconscious all people they all started crying because so much emotional thing was going on at this point many in the audience burst into tears but sadawa Krishna remained still and looked intently at the stage he didn't cry at the time he was crying because seeing the devotion but this time he understood renunciation is the very normal thing in the life of a human either today or tomorrow we have to renounce we have to give up but this particular moment that's why he's not crying but master machine noticed way and noticed and recorded he said a single tear appeared in the corner of his eye the performance was over then someone asked how did you enjoy the play cinema Krishna he remarked I found the representation the same as the real the drama and the real became one to Slama teach them why he never saw the actor and actresses he saw that God only so we go to enjoy the movie we go to enjoy the theatre but we see the man different and actor and actors but a person like cinema business even in the theatre he sees God only acting in that so that is spiritual life spiritualization of every moment of our life that is the teaching of salaam occasional media [Music] but Don come far greater become way he sharp our pollination medium Tom Ramakrishna she does on D D Hardy that said sweet Amish not venomous
