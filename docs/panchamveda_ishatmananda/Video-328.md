[329. “Through Vidyamaya one can Realize God.” - Panchama Veda (329)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zyRRZZdueho)

namaskar dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening we'll be studying the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavan sirama krishna and as usual we will begin with this [Music] [Music] friends the last wednesday we were discussing the qualities of holy person in answering to a question what is the way for worldly people bhagavan sirama krishna said holy company and also mentioned one needs sadhana we found in the bhagavata the qualities a person must have to be considered as a holy person we studied that in our previous discussion at the last wednesday and about the sadhana we find that in the bhagavad-gita there's a wonderfully is explained the three types of sadhana kaaika bachika manasika sadhana so let us know what are these three types of sadhanas then we will continue and we will be reading from the english book the gospel of sirama krishna the seven eight one page number seven eight one and the bengali or conditions current that is eight three six now the bhagavad-gita chapter 17 14 15 and 16 these three mantras these verses it says there are three types of sadhana one is physical sadhana and second is through the torque barchika through the tongue and finally monasika through thought mentally so whatever the work we do we think that physically whenever we are doing that is the work known whatever the words the sentences that we are using that is also work and sometimes we use very harsh words and that creates the bad karma for us otherwise we are very good people doing always careful not harming physically but through words we are going on criticizing people telling lies about people and without knowing harming so many people just through words or maybe through thought that is also very bad so what are the tapasha we have to purify these three different type of works so if we know this it becomes easy for us those who are very sincere those who like to be spiritually uplifted for them this is very important so first they have to go to a holy person but there are so many varieties of people claiming that they are holy people and it's very difficult to understand who is a holy person who is not so the bhagavata it gave the whole list at least few qualities we must find in those people who are propagated maybe directly by themselves or some people supporting them that they are holy people those qualities the last in our last class we have discussed that is a big list from the bhagavata these are the qualities one must have now the tapasya the spiritual austerity now whenever we think about the spiritual austerity we think that we should not eat these we should not drink that we should not wear this type of dress we should not wear the shoe all this but physical austerity what is the physical austerity it says deva pujanam we must have to give respect proper respect to these people the god in the early morning when you get up or whenever we are getting up first bhagavatam krishna said in so many times he himself used to practice that the first you get up and see at least a photo of god whatever the god that you like god or goddess whatever you like at least first you see and then bow down and pray god you have given me this day let please see that i do all good works so that i can realize you that is the first prayer that you begin the day with by looking at the photo of god and then through the prayer preacher the holy people the second birth they say divi means birth dwe means second second birth who was the second birth usually the human being the first time they are born and second time that means they are developed to that culture there they have practiced the restraint they have practiced all that to how to control the emotions how to control the senses so that is the way that's called vision they take some oaths promises so that is called dwigia second birth but everyone same then there is a beautiful sloka the at the birth each and every one of the same they don't know how to behave properly they are not very an as do no aesthetic scenes and also the cleanliness is not there that is the that's culture should be there so that is called januar if you look at the human children even they have just started crawling and they'll be going and beating the ants or putting the whatever they find because the children they always understand the external world through the test so they'll everything they will put in the mouth so that is the way they understand and their expression so the mothers and the aunties they will go and all the time telling oh my son you should do like this you should not be able like this you are human being you should behave like these these these this then then slowly janma nath is not that cast but the culture and then slowly through the culture they become the second birth samus what is this this type of training even you like to eat you should not you should restrain yourself you should take the permission you should not do this you should not do that the kittens the the puppies you cannot control them that through instinct only they behave but the human child when you they are trained so they will be so that's why the human has to go to the school the kittens and the puppies do not go to school to become a puppy or a kitten just natural way they behave they grew up a little bit of training is given by the masters so that is different but the human child has to go to the school and they are they are learning slowly slowly manifesting is a knowledgeable one then they study and they learn so many things and they are a knowledgeable person that is called bhipra brahma-janati brahmana who is a brahmana brahmana is one who has realized the truth it is the one that is pervading everything so this is the way that brija doesn't mean just taking a in in hinduism those who are brahmin and shatrias they have the tradition of having the the cigarette trait that is the ceremony they do they take and then they take the some oaths the samaskhara the dweva means the god and who is god love and unselfishness that is the god love and unselfishness that doesn't mean that having four hands or flowing uh in the in the air or walking on the water it may be any power they are having but the main thing is full of love and unselfishness then guru the teacher who is the guru shankaracharya in his bible he dedicates so many verses to explain the guru and he says he himself has crossed the ocean of this samsara and this temporariness then he knows the brahman the eternal existence the knowledge the source of joy he knows that and then he gives that knowledge to others and in exchange expect nothing not even the respect so in the spring all the trees are flowering and when you are moving you see the beautiful the scenery all over in the himalayas there is a valley miles after miles all flowers wild flowers it's a beauty and what is that for whom anyone who ever will go the only this country people are that religious no nothing like that that's why like in the nature it's not discriminating no discrimination in the nature give it to everyone why do they do that only for the betterment of the people so that is called the guru and the pragya is the wise so wise means not that all the time they should have the knowledge they are having the knowledge but experience when when a person is fully experienced the seeing something he can understand or this going to be this because they have experience they have seen in their lives they're called pragma the deva godly vijay those who are culturally very advanced guru the teacher and pragma very wise people one must worship them pujanam not only respect is worshipping so i become humble before them a person should become humble before them and then that is called worshipping the respective okay i am not disturbing them that is maybe the respect but the pujuna means very humble way you have to preserve them guru pragya the cleanliness and uprightness the cleanliness is next to godliness in english they always say that cleanliness is very very essential to become spiritual one must be very clean sometimes some people i don't know particularly some of the people they're coming the the dress that they were wearing at the night they were asleep with the dress only somehow they wash their face and then come to the shrine and they are talking they are mixing it is very bad one must be proper no what is there i am clean not like that one should be the proper dress you should wear and then come where you are going that way the proper way you should be when you are going for a sunbath or going for a swimming that is a the dress you can wear but the same type of dress you cannot wear when you are going to a party or to especially when you are coming to a holy place so that is also called the cleanliness not only that the bathing and using the soap and the perfume not that all at the same time in a cultured way in a proper manner one should and argivam upright whatever he is thinking or saying in a very polite gentle way but the truth brahmacharyam what is the brahmacharya concentration whatever i am doing whatever the work i am performing i should do it in a constant full mind so somehow i am just finishing and going no i when i am sitting i draw the chair and sat and when i am leaving i must keep the chair back where it was sometimes some people they'll be picking up the uh a pain from the table they have come to visit the official officer use the pain and put the pain in the pocket and go or using the the hope just they are removing their shoes particularly in the hindu temple they'll be removing the shoes anywhere and no so that is called brahmajari brahmacharya of course continents but at the same time the mind should be alert what i am doing very few people after sitting on the chair they keep back the chair in a proper manner they will simply leave that and go away somebody else has to do that but why the alertness if you read the gospel of sirama krishna biography of sirama krishna swamiji mother they are so alert for each and everything brahmacharya alertness apramatya and i am not taking so whatever i am doing whatever i am listening whatever i am performing very alert him such a non-violence non-violence means i am not angry with anyone and that is called non-violence doesn't mean that i am not killing but the thing is that i am not angry with anyone that non-violence that we should have to practice sharing friends that is called the austerity of the body when physically we are practicing spiritual austerities these are the things we should practice mostly physical austerity we think not eating keeping the fast that is good if you can but these are the things and who said lord 3 krishna himself in the bhagavad-gita 17th chapter 14 verse and the next verse 15th what he says that is also controlling the tongue that is also very important some of the other scholars they explain why the mother kali is biting her own tongue there's a story that she just by mistake touched the body of her own husband the lord shiva the outer shy she is showing that sometimes the indian ladies they do like that and i didn't notice the others so i am mentioning about the indian ladies so just biting the tongue to show and they are shy and they are sorry no these are controlling the tongue the mother of the universe the law the goddess kali the mother of the universe and she's teaching us controlling the tongue that means you should not use any abusive language against anyone you should not use the words in such a way so people they lose their confidence one should not that sometimes the teachers unknowingly or knowingly they'll be hearting damaging the self-respect and the self-confidence of the students very bad parents by mistake they do oh you cannot do anything you are worthless you are these you are that the other day i was listening a hindi discourse a lady she is very popular very sweetly she was telling that someone met another person and then that he was in a meeting all people were there suddenly the second one told the first one hey it's so nice that you are here you were failure every time for all these years now it is good that you have got a job so see how i really i felt sometimes some people they use that second person he was welcoming the first one but when he was introducing him with the others he mentioned that he was a failure in many places somehow he has got a job oh i welcome you you got a job though you were failure many times before it was not necessary to tell that but why do they do that because they don't have control over the tongue and they have the jealousy the anger and they are sahim sir maybe they are eating the vegetarian food but they are actually non-veg people they are himastra hinastra means they are not very violent type of people in the thought in the words they are using so anud bega karambakim not using offensive words against anyone and one must practice to tell the truth sattim and what type of truth priyam that must be pleasant and beneficial the most of the time when the people they are reporting particularly the reporters when they are reporting they must be truthful what has happened because the people they should know the truth but when they are reporting in such a way the headline will on the newspaper in such a way the people most of the time they are carried away by the headlines of the newspaper they don't go through the all details just and what they're doing oh we have to sell the paper so popular way this is not popular it is a sin is a scene that they are doing all people are depending on them they are bringing the news then giving it to all people nowadays in the tv in the radio and the print media one must be very very careful satya the truth must be and very pleasant way it must be presented if you are interested in developing spiritual life and if you want to practice the austerity that is called the in the bhagavad-gita 17-15 then the truth must be presented the anything that you say must be the truth that sometimes when we are describing we describe giving our own views also in that and that creates the confusion for the person who is listening maybe he is the boss he has to get the information from you and then take action and if you who is carrying the message do not tell in a proper manner what is exactly what you have seen and heard then unfortunately you will get the bad result of the work so hitan then swat thai how it is possible to control the mind constantly every day at least one or two pages one should read the holy books what are the holy books not the psalm one is a very intelligent and published something and very popular not that type of book those who have really really realize god their words only that is called swaddhaya obyasanam and that swaddhai objazan that means the spiritual study regularly a few pages one must at least listen and read bang mayan [Music] that is the austerity of the tongue then the third one mana prasadam [Music] [Music] now if we practice these three types of spiritual austerities then we ourselves will become full of joy and steady satisfied spiritual person mana of the mind when i know that i am not harming anyone disturb anyone doing any wrong thing to anyone and whatever is possible for me i am performing then your mind is completely tranquil not constantly most of the people we are afraid you know why because the comments of the others of course in the society that is a great thing they call it gradation they will be giving the grades the students are giving the grades for the teachers teachers may be very good and they are very steady and teaching properly but the students they think oh this man is not allowing us to practice the wrong things so we will in the gradation time we will give wrong gradation that is their karma follower bad karma of allah but the teacher should go on in his own way and one thing that is the faith in the existence of god when one is going on in his own way without harming anything anyone the surely the god will protect him or her that is sure the manaprasada how the mind should be calm and composed i have not done anything wrong so by that way the serenity of the mind somyatam gentleness the gentleness the courtesy and that is the great thing as a human that is the great thing so when you are gentle what do you do you know how bad words but you don't use that maybe you are strong you can fight with other but you don't do that maybe you know that that's person where he cheated you even then when he is coming again and begging for some help then okay take it but there to be it's called somyat the gentleness courteous and monum silence why because he knows that how much i can do or i should speak that way and then afterwards they will be quiet only because they are contended you know some people can't contain so they go on talking nobody wants to listen but they will go on talking friends we are discussing the spiritual practices the spiritual practice doesn't mean that the bare body we have to be in the cold or without food or matted here or these are that that those who like they can but these are the special practices that purify our all mind and the senses my eyes like to go and see the bad things my ear like to hear all the wrong things because that is in the nature like to drag me down to the world the physical level but i should not allow my senses to go down so always that is called there are two brothers surah asura from the same parentage from same father the surah are the very good type of people asura ah means negative bad people surah that is expression illumination knowledge and exactly opposite asura so they always draw the surahs they are all fair color and asura is a dark color so that is the way it has nothing to do with the physical color that is because of the nature so it is uh intellectually they have mentioned in this way surah means enlightened one so that is lighted one that is why the fair color and the opposite so surah asura atma my mind my senses chakshu karna nashika juvatak and this they all the five they like to go and enjoy this physical thing and restrain no i'm not going to do that then bhabha samsodi purity of heart that is very very important what is the purity of the heart i am thinking something and telling something else of behaving in a different way no one should not do that maybe sometimes the politicians maybe business and all they may do that but in the spiritual path friends i'm talking about the spiritual path so that in the spirituality when someone is trying to develop the spirituality they must be following this heart should be purified it's not the food it's not any other thing but your thought that is called so this is how we have to practice the mental austerity now the bhagavatam krishna said that you have to go to a holy person and have his company the last wednesday we discussed that also he said that you have to do some sadhana one needs sadhana now the sadhana this sanskrit word the people they know about it sadhana if we translate into english the spiritual practice spiritual austerity because this sadhana means these three the what are the three kay kaaika physical baachika through the world and manasika through thought so not only kaika but this three if you can practice now again we find over here bhagavan sirama krishna talking with his devotees he's saying samadhai remarked that god was dry samadhi he was one of the leaders of the that is brahma brahma-samaj the brahma-samaji is the where the intellectual people educated people they wanted to save the so hinduism but again they were adjusting so how to make it modern etc but that way but sadhana is necessary spiritual realization is necessary to make people follow a path that will lead them to god realization particularly leaders those who are introducing that path must get the spiritual knowledge otherwise who is going to accept their words the intellectual words only that sometimes the philosophers sometimes the great poets sometimes other people also they give wonderful advice but that doesn't carry the anything the people will be quoting them but they don't follow them why because there was it was not added with the practice so that's why bhagavan is telling the samadhi remarked that god was dry and look at it and in the upanishad it says that that is the source of joy ananda anand the god is the source of the joy and this samadhi one of the leaders of the then the the that practical but that their practice the brahma-samaji he said that god is dry and we have to make through our own love at the soft the wrong thing that means he has not the bhagavatam krishna giving a very wonderful the way he is thinking it sounds like the remark my uncle's cow shade is full of horses the person doesn't know what is the cow shade and where the horses are the stable and all that it doesn't know so he's telling my uncle's cow shade is full of horses like that by this he meant that if you are not realized soul you sometimes tell wrong things about god yes a worldly person is the state of intoxication he always says to himself it is i who am doing everything all these the house the family are mine and he will be going on telling what will happen to my wife what will happen to my children if i am not there so before him this world was there after him the world will also continue just because his ego he is thinking oh if i am not there then what will happen to this world so the master now they were talking about the rakhal maharaja and afterwards shami brahmananda he was a very favorite uh the disciple of bhagavan sirama krishna so he was he who got married though he never wanted but the parents then afterwards what happened he remarked then what will happen if i am not there too much wife of course because you are taking a responsibility so you have to be thinking in that way too the surama krishna knew it and salaam krishna knew how to handle this particularly the who afterwards became very famous as swami brahman under the first president of the ramakrishna martin mission so he was a spiritual joint some krishna knew it but apparently he is showing like that why because even that type of people apparently married and apparently entangled but internally they were completely free so sudama krishna as being a god he knew it others were not so haramahan he is did rakhal say that there is a relative so he was trying to what else could he do this bhagavatam krishna mentioned he who has knowledge as ignorance how amazing now he is immediately taking the mind to another level lakshmana said to rama even a sage like bashishta is stricken with the grief because of the death of his sons that guru bashist very famous he was a brahmarshi he was the noah brahman as because he was a rishi in those days there is no conception of the sannyasi as now that now the nami sampradaya the 10 different categories of the sannyasins that shankaracharya introduces much afterwards a series of lecture that is that is going on in our home of harmony there that lecture is the organization of gods the first part we introduced and second part will be discussing on this so this is the way we have to understand so it goes beyond the both knowledge and ignorance is the knowledge and ignorance you have to go beyond that the lakshmana hini mentioned that the bashista is also the suffering because of the death of his son was a brahmagani he knew very well that cannot be the son of the daughter or the wife or the father or the mother because that is all the imaginations the bashistan was advaita gyani but even then when you are having the human body those emotions those attachments are very natural so bhagavan sirama krishna quoting the conversation between sri lakshmana and sri rama he mentioned brother rama is telling replied rama he who has knowledge has ignorance also therefore go beyond both knowledge and ignorance the knowledge means there is only one the moment you are having that conception what happens opposite is also there obviously and he continued bhagavatam krishna continues suppose a thorn has pierced a man's foot he picks another thorn to pull out the first one we have seen in the villages where is health center and all that in a very advanced country or anything that happens immediately you go to the hospital and in a there are so many hospitals that their health centers are there arrangements are there there are villages in the third world where is all this so people they help themselves and they know very practical way though when a thorn is pierced immediately they will take another thorn to take it out suramar krishna he's from the village background and he has seen it and he is explaining in that way using that suppose a thorn has pierced a man's foot he picks another thorn to pull out the first one after extracting the fast thorn with the help of the second one he throws both away one should use the thorn of knowledge to pull out the thorn of ignorance turn up knowledge about the knowledge of god so then you can take out the knowledge of this world that there are two things god and this world god is the creator and world is created things god is the existence and the world is the temporary so these are the way that we take the god's conception and slowly slowly we give away the worldly things because it is temporary it is created anything that is created going to be destroyed someday then we go to the god but then we have to go beyond that god also why because god is also temporary for temporary from the viewpoint of the pure advaita the supreme lord he as he creates another image and that with three qualities satya rajya tama and it's called ishwara and the ishwara is creating the hidden and all this so this is the way we have to understand one should use the thorn of knowledge to pull out the thorn of ignorance then one throws away both the thorns knowledge and ignorance and attain bigana the beginning of the world bhagavatam krishna used in many places and he always insisted that one should be a big gyani gyani vigyani so three stages ogyani all means negative he doesn't know as or the false knowledge whatever he knows is the wrong why because they're temporary that means the worldly knowledge the science and these and that temporary knowledge constantly changing in the science you see every time someone is discovering or inventing something and then after few days another one comes oh no that was a very another thing another theory comes it goes on but in the spiritual there's only one discovery that they had thousands of years before that was the brahman all-pervading consciousness which they consider is a source of creation and how it was created there a different views are there sometimes they say the creation is permanent and sometimes they say no the creation is temporary because is only we create we think as we create in our dream but that is a different discussion the this is the way when we think the ignorance and the knowledge so we have to go beyond that sadama krishna is mentioning and what is big anna he himself is asking and giving the reply it is to know god distinctly by realizing his existence through an intuitive experience through an intuitive experience but not only conception when we read the scripture we develop a conception about god and then in the upanishads and many other places particularly in the purana they give the description of god and we think that these are the this is god but it is beyond that you have to go beyond that inequality any thing that you can conceive we can conceive we can have the idea limited satyam gyanam anantam brahma different way they are trying to give idea of the truth but only that much no it is beyond that that's why bhagavan si ramakrishna said that's because he was that supreme god that is why he could say it in this way he said that that beyond that you have to go and then you cannot express anything because you are that how can you express that you are that you become that so he is mentioning here that you have to have the beginning what is that beginner knowing god intuitive experience becoming god and to speak to him intimately then you are there so you know everything through and through then you know this is the beginning and he gave example in many other places that some people have heard the name the word milk but they have not seen what is that milk you don't have any idea the rate oh milk is a liquid white thing and if you drink it is having this this this this material in it and that will help you to digest and the strong body et cetera et cetera but only the heart rate some people have seen that this is second grade but the best people they're not only hard they not only saw they really utilized the milk drank it and not only tested they were benefited by drinking the pure milk so this is called bikyana those who have drank and got the benefit now they themselves know what is that milk through and through that is the way sri ramakrishna is mentioning that is why shri krishna said to arjuna go beyond the three gunas bhagavan sri krishna and he is mentioning even the vedas the source of hinduism that is the greatness of hinduism never narrow we even the vedas on the basis of which the whole hindu structure is there the edifice of the hinduism based on the veda veda arjuna our god sri krishna is mentioning o arjuna even these vedas they belong within these three qualities bishop means an object even that knowledge is also temporary and you have to go beyond that that is hinduism sometimes even the hindus they are confused they don't understand so if something happened oh why they have taken the one page of our veda they don't know what is veda but still they will go and fight with others they're all tim very just some ordinary people they don't know anything about the true philosophy true philosophy is this what are the three qualities with the three qualities only all this creation sattva raja tama very good very bad a mixture of good and bad raja the sattva good tama bad mixture is the raja these three qualities are there even in the veda so you have to imbibe that understand that and go beyond that and become the truth again and again that is the the last the blessings that the bhagavatam krishna gave to the human society i bless that you all become aware about your consciousness so what is this brahman it is pure consciousness and when it comes with the contact of the three goonas you start creating so that is the way he is mentioning in order to attain bigyana one has to accept the help of the bidder maya there is a wonderful word bhagavan sirama krishna is using maya we are aware of this word shankaracharya used this word and what is this maya shankara in his that book the vivek churamani he mentioned that it is impossible to explain samna samna bayat it may be for some people it is there for some people it is not there and actually it is not there and also it is there both so these are the way he tried to say because when the people are imagining this world is truth for them it is truth that those who have understood that this world is temporary the rishis the great sages the holy people through their lifelong spiritual practices when they see they understand they realize though apparently everything is so genuine so much there but in reality it is not there it is not there so maya it is very difficult to explain and because it is why we see things because of the maya and what is this maya the power of god the creation that we see it is the power of god that is maya that has created now bhagavan siddha krishna he is mentioning that you have to utilize here biddamaya he is now here is giving the differences two types of maya one is bitter maya another is abhidhyamaya in sanskrit always if you put all then it becomes negative means the true knowledge and abhidhya a false knowledge knowledge but false knowledge wrong knowledge knee science and what is this vida maya may be that some other day we'll discuss yet the bhagavad krishna is mentioning vidtamaya includes discrimination that is the bichara the fast and basic step to realize god what is the bichara that also he explains that is to say god is real and the world illusory god is real he's using the word god because it will be easy for people to understand if they say brahman most of the people don't understand what is this brahman or the atman so he said god god we know ishwara bhagavan so this god is real he said but from the point of view that we are understanding god as the real it is of course real because it is existing as long as the creation is existing next time it is so here it is easy for the people to understand the god is real and we are not going deeper into the philosophy where it is again temporary because after this creation when the new creation will come this will go another will come it is not necessary so god is real and what else this world is illusory why every day everything is changing the sun is changing every day our body is changing every day our mind is changing every day so grows the subtle and the huge huge the object like the sun that is also changing decaying and we will that will also die someday as our body decaying every moment the doctors they know very well every moment it is decaying so that is why it says that that is that knowledge is a vidamaya it is also maya it also binds but you have to take the help of the bidder maya to go beyond what is the biddamaya he said first discrimination the discrimination means bichara then god is real world is illusory dispassion so when we know this world is temporary why should we use our all energy time money for the temporary thing we should withdraw whatever is necessary for a good living that much sufficient in every country 109 countries are there in the world suppose and in every 193 countries i must have a huge palace what is the use of it i must have this many cars some people when we read in the newspapers the rich people they're having a huge garage so many cars do they use it no maybe using for their friends or their relatives for these and that but still they are going on accumulating ignorance whatever is necessary for you very comfortable well we can say luxurious life okay you are earning a lot leave in a luxurious way but why all these sometimes some rich people they do not know how much property is there they don't know how much money is there in the bank property is there nothing they don't but goes on accumulating that is called ignorance and when they die suddenly they die what happens to that another problem who is going to take that so this is the way when we are discriminating discrimination means understanding the truth and taking the right step taking the right decision and then come after the discrimination dispassion i don't need it and you are free so no fear i don't need it so no question of losing it so what is the fear any object that i am having the fear i may lose this so when i'm not having that no question of losing it so this is the way dispassion also chanting names god's name also chanting god's name and glories meditation company of the holy person prayer so these are the wonderful spiritual practices and the thoughts that is called bidda maya they are also maya they also will bind but at the same time this will help you to go beyond the ignorance of the maya what is abhidharma me and mine that is abitamaya in this world i is very important i am and whatever is associated with me my family my relatives my nation and my religion my culture every that way they are bound so sometimes jokingly i was telling that supposed a is a in in one religion and in one country b and another religion another culture in another country they're always in the loggerhead they're always fighting and for that they are doing wrong things and suppose that he dies by doing wrong things and take birth in the bee's country be doing something good according to the result of the karmapala karma the b comes to the a's countries goes to the bees country what will happen next birth again they will fight how long how many times so this if we realize then we can stop bitter maya maybe like to the last few steps before the room the bitter maya means these are the practices having the company of the holy people and then discrimination then dispassion then prayer meditation spiritual practices that is the last step bhagavan sinama krishna is mentioning that is the last step and then you go on the roof what is the roof he said the realization of god what is the goal of human life realization of god and how i will know that i am close to god realization when i am intensely practicing the discrimination dispassion having the company of the holy and praying to the god taking the holy name of god meditating in in a silently within my heart i am very close to god thank you friends this is the way bhagavan si rama krishna is teaching us and we must understand again i say those who are those who sincere just casually thinking about the religion for they know they can understand they they may not whatever just casually reading what is there in the book for them it is okay but those of us truly sincerely want to realize god want to go beyond the circle of birth and death and then they have realized that this life is nothing but suffering most of the time there are all these nine months we are inside the belly of the mother oh terrible leaving we can't even the the the picture that they give how the baby is shaped oh my god by that we're nine months and then from the right from the day one day zero struggle struggle struggle and everything is changing that's why shankaracharya he said in his mohamud gar bhaja govindam govindam baja mood thank you
