[215: Panchama Veda 215 : What Is Our Duty?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Se3tureVWr8)

Tom Britain dr. Chiba now go be calm aha Shravan among three and our bottom to be green and the hula dodging ah it was October 1st 1884 so we were reading that particular portion but the devotees they were expressing their views about the God wheat form or without form the different type of opinion they were expressing yoga indra who was the editor of a famous bengali news people in a sarcastically way he was mentioning that Brahmo Samaj even a little boy is also telling God is formless he is not having any conception idea anything about God but just by hearing he said God is formless and then others also the other he was also mentioning the ship not bamboo does not believe in God's call the ship Nasri is a very famous person he wrote many books also gave lot of lectures and sharper ones long distance to love him very much but sometimes used to say sheep that didn't keep the words he saying that he will come but he didn't come the ceramic dish Nesbitt learn about that the ship not was also like this and some conceptions of times he should not mention that if you are constantly thinking about God you may become mad thus Ramakrishna then said how it can be because when we are thinking about God we are thinking about the consciousness and we are constantly thinking about the consciousness how I can become unconscious rather those constantly thinking about this world then worldly things which are all unconscious they have seen people how they can be Salameh Krishna but still used to love here water was a deputy magistrate he mentioned about that then Vijay Krishna Goswami he was a very deep-rooted spiritual person Vijaya Krishna and cinema business was helping him to develop that the pediatrician is telling that is his mistake about that because the author mentioned that she's not Shastri that they are actually quoting all these people because they were the leaders of them did in society and the business the disease is mistake and he pointed to the master as he says he wins the nomination the chameleon has used different colors now this color now that only the man who lives under the tree knows the animals don't color the ceramic dish then you must have read that in remember that the story that the chameleon changes its color so one person came and told the very peculiar animal I saw that is a okay yellow color another told no it cannot be because I just saw blue and they were calling the third one said I live under the tree and I always watched that animal and it goes on changing the color it through the story means God may be in for not maybe in maybe without form he may be in anything so that is that he is mentioning while meditating now the Vijay Krishna Bhushan is telling he is giving his own experience while meditating I saw images of gods and cinema Tichenor immediately recognized them you saw correctly he mentioned while meditating I saw the images of God painted on a canvas how many guards how many different things they say I said to myself I shall go to the master he will explain it all to me tell the cinema Krishna is mentioning you saw correctly sometimes people the see but it is the strong imaginations if you keep stone drop time also this the hallucination happens those who were reading some holy books listening to the holy talks they in their mind subconscious mind thoughts on God and all so they will be seeing the images of God but that is not true but true yet when it becomes in the images it is not in dream in and in meditation when the mind is completely separated from this world then it goes to another sphere and there we see this celestial beings the god and goddesses say Ramakrishna he is mentioning a use of correctly kita now he's telling God as useful for the sake of his devotees these people are educated people they read scripture but when they are conversing they know what they are telling the hawk Tana Innokin partum brahmana Rupa Kalpana Rupa Kalpana the Hindus they always know all these things that we are making now the Ganesh Chaturthi and if you go to the Maharashtra you with images of Ganesha and that will be they'll be collecting for making those images what she will go on dances and feeding all these things will go on people exchanging gift and then afterwards we will all go and throw the images huge you will images into the sea why so that sometimes some people particularly from the Europe and America when they go they think that is a completely wasted of money and sometimes they think why did they make that image and then they give the emulsion they threw it in the water why this immersion so this is actually the Hindu they know that God is in reality without form but for my sake I want to see God in this form that this developed this Ganesha puja the nation which unified the Hindus that is also true a social appeal was also there because of the British they were ruling that time the one of the patriotic leader he wanted to unify the whole people it was their small small in every household people individually used to worship now he made it public and then the whole people came together respect but the question is why these images because we can concentrate on that we develop attachment to God we develop attachment to God that this way he said God as uniforms for the sake of his devotees as uniforms not that they are in form but they are huge ones why because God is all powerful he can take any form anytime anywhere before anyone so that he says now it says Ramakrishna's thing one must accept everything one must accept everything so those who are really really interested in developing the spiritual life for the use Ramakrishna's instruction is this everything god wait for God without fall so this is the contribution of ceramic in this modern society and that exactly were the followers of sadhana Krishna they should try to imbibe and also try to propagate otherwise most of the people everywhere people in the name of religion they are constantly fighting with others so this that best eg then which I is telling God has infinite power can he not reveal himself in any form he chooses man is a speck of dust and he dares come to a conclusion about God how amazing Vijay Krishna gosh I mean he is mentioning Saddam additional supporting him stating it man reads the duties of the Gita at the bhagavata or the vedanta and things he has understood everything so this is the problem the intellectual understanding and realization and to create different things interest entry to understanding a completely different and new realization is completely different unless until you realize and feel yourselves become marched with that conception you cannot and can even understand the truth of it a man brings a little to Geeta bhagavata Vedanta and things he has understood everything then he gives it that is the speciality of sadhana business immediately he'll be telling a story small stony so that you can understand how it is we have read a little bit of it and immediately we start giving that courses talking with people convincing people what happens once an ant Winkley hill of sugar and one green of sugar field is dark and heat was returning home with another green in his mouth on the way it said to itself next time I go I shall bring home the whole Hill and and how can we bring the whole hill so it cannot understand the greatness the vastness it just like us we are reading a little understanding a little and then we are thinking this is God and I have understood everything now why should carrying it can you carry God it is not possible there is another metaphor that the Ravana uses a great devotee of Shiva and he told Shiva that you must come and stay with me in Lanka and Kakui so he carried the Shiva but she was slowly slowly started developing the weight and it was so much so that I wanna have to keep it over there but the condition was you cannot leave me anywhere you have to carry me continuously to your place so from the pre larger to Lanka she or didn't reach so we think that we can bring God we understand God everything of God that is the mistake and we I think that I can understand everything of God or I have understood everything of God that shows my ego and if you are having ego which is the main cause of separation from God I couldn't think that he had God realized oh we have truly understood God it cannot be now we will read the another day's description it is the Thursday October 2nd 1884 and Saddam Krishna was sitting in his room at - nation and many devotees came over there and among the devotees there were promised ahmadies also so you know that in that situation in the particularly the god the brother samajis they were mainly educated people all educated people they started going to the promised Ahmad because it became a social status because they they had the charismatic leadership like the Coshocton regime and Reuben gonna take us about the ship not Shastri this the leaders of the society with the air so I belong to that group it was something the people is to feel happy about but this is the way it is to go but till to go as because there is educated people this to try to understand religion so wherever people are exploiting religion is to visit that - so many of them they just come to selamat agenda the some of them had come the master Michelle he noticed a person as a brahma devotee but master why she never knew his name so he is describing he we heard a drum more devotee from Schiphol the ship who is the place from the air a person who is having the beard he came and is connected with each other so like this the marwari devotees from Calcutta they also kill master to Manila and the other it is wise to salute a person mentally different a complete people so when they have come so not that you have to touch so sometimes you can find in the banal religious particularly in ashram I have seen the ladies they'll be going on touching the feet of each and every one and creating problem you are giving the discourse and she will come out maybe a few of them they will come and then we go on touching the feet of each and everyone showing their humbleness that's the question of a benign the humbleness first they will come to the Shawnee then they will go to all devotees not now what happens when they are dream like that all the Buddha's attention goes to them so the flow of dog that internet that stopped you have to wait when they will conclude and when they are settled another good came so it goes on it is difficult so I told if you are late when I used to go and to them at will if you are late so you see that the back and then will this program will be over meeting is over people will go out from there and go on doing the prana to a chair every month no problem but that they don't do they won't do this is only to get the attention that I am doing I am so humble I am a questionable like this so all these things has I mean to see Ramakrishna was also having this type of problem so he is mentioning it is waited to salute a person mentally what need is there to their of touching his feet so mental salutation doesn't embarrass anybody so how at once who was around Krishna this is the main thing now sometimes in vedanta societies also we try to introduce that thing you will notice that I will stand over there i previous steps to sit over here then people came started going down it takes time I thought okay I will stand over there like the sister system where the people will come then we create and they we go quickly people in Ganges also trying to do but the Indians cannot talk like that sir else they will bow that's the feed and that is the devotion and that is a very genuine way they do but again the same thing so the purpose that quickly you finish that is not possible this is the attitude that my religion alone is right now aching in the salon business friends do you know I am trying my best my personally personally am trying to have a property in a very proper place where we will introduce try to introduce in a bigger way these attitudes around these teachings of sri ramakrishna so he said that attitude that my legion alone is right and all other religions are false is not good so if you read the gospel of almost feel pure feel paper almost in every pages you will find this type of expression so he is the embodiment of the unity in diversity he is the Parliament of Religions personified so if we are not unfolding these ideas to this modern world and particularly in Chicago a Swami Vivekananda he came and he broke all that because we now know nurse then everybody do that this is what Ramakrishna said the attitude that my religion is right and other religions are false is not good my religion is right everyone can say but next line other religions are false that is not good I see that God himself has become all these Serrano Krishna's realization from where he is giving this statements his teachings his saga after the realizations and what is the real realization just if we carefully read these lines I see that God himself has become all these men images hologram shall Adama is very very holy for the Hindus particularly the questionable the Shara and me same and this is an occasion when his speaking is a 19th century the beginning of the 19th century and you can understand the society the condition of the society mentality of the society under the subjugation of seven hundred eight hundred years for a long long time so now cinema fishness slowly bringing the true light of Hinduism all saying that is padartha so he is sitting in this way I see one alone in all things I do not see do I see only one many people think that their opinion alone is right and others opinions are wrong that they alone have one and others are lost to see even today we always everyone we think ours is the character for me of course I love my religion I love my philosophy love my god practice this thing is my choice but that doesn't mean as they always say over here either you accept my way about I will you go to other no that cannot be your way maybe separate mind we may be separate but still we can be friends why because we both are going to the same goal and the goal is nothing but purity love unselfishness service so naturally it should not hurt others I love my god it doesn't mean I have to hate others know that this is ceramic dish nur trunk but defeat is in the hands of God we cannot understand his ways you must have noticed that the clean coconut again he is giving the example and he gives the example from the very very ordinary a village life the green coconut the means high in the tree and is exposed to the Sun but still its milk is cool at the coconut on the other hand the bunny fall Rani felices aquatic fruit many of you know maybe is different game which says the head remains in the water but remains in the water but when eaten it hits the body that particular fruit it is growing in the water means in the water but when you eat that it hits the body when some people have the villages when they have this type of and the physical problem they need to heat up their body so they eat that type of roots so that warm the body but they have taken roots is there in the water remaining the water the synonymously sitting that cards way it is so difficult to understand a fruit which is always there on the top of the tree and then exposed to Sun is cool and another fruit which is there inside the water is a different so that is the way the God works then he said this we must be very very careful now he's bringing the root of Hindu philosophy he said look at the body of the man the head is the root and it is at the top suddenly he said like that the coconut it remains on the top of the tree no it is not he is not mentioning that a completely different way he's giving the gist of the Hindu philosophy what is that a man the head of the man which is the root of that it is underdog and other leaves are a death below so here I will have to quote from different scriptures it needs to be explained otherwise we may understand completely in a different way ceramic is not with the simple words he is bringing these Hindu philosophy me that the gist of that what is this this samsara this manifested world is like a tree well whose root is Alaba and infinite above and the infinite of branches spread it downwards the 15 chapter of the bhagavad-gita why I am smiling smiling because that is the question that the gentleman asked me the when he gave me the American visa and the interviewee asked me you are going to America to spread Hinduism as we yes what is the first verse of the 15 chapter of the bhagavad-gita in managing it with even thought that he asks this question I was thinking in last who was the first president of America why there are 50 stars in American plan I memorized the whole purpose and he has 15 chapters the first verse and in this 15 chapter first verse would the moola at a shark on a ship temprano p.m. this is the Rue de the whole Indies would the moolah moolah means that would now this body and this samsara this the world if you take as a tree the tree root goes where to get to suck the main from the soil it must take its life but here the tree is just opposite this other day one of the devotees were stealing she was going on pouring water but that tree was dying why then afterwards if she found that animals they came they ate all the bulbs and the roots if the root is not there obviously the tree cannot survive now what is the root root is the Brahman the God the fifteen chapters of our data secretion I mentioned that the moon Chaka Chaka means branches are shortened this a sweater means completely temporary a shelter is a dream but assured that the word sanskrit word means completely temporary this world is completely temporary a shuttle Bravo of beyond profit is saved and then it goes on of an acceptor we find the original of this idea it comes from a terrible battle you know whatever bitterly find that same expression in this way Asad Chaka Protestant een paar amoeba Janabi to the lower abdomen Jana we do the pedo means the nor the Nora Brahmin knows that the origin of this world is samsara tree is in supreme Brahman and these branches this world are assert temporary assert Siham so assert means temporary shahe all this expression but now the root is very small but branches so meaning the branches are going spreading out then there believes then we tweaks so many things but the root is in that so human that this world the root is the brahman and the else so it gives the creation where from it has come and we after the Veda we find open even the distant acknowledge in evolutionary fine Kotoko Nisha the same metaphor has been used it says Ultimo a black Chaka Asia our shuttle sanandana again a shelter the same name has been the term has been used our shuttle is temporary in the world the moon above Chaka is a shelter cenar dinara the diva should come that Brahma Deva amrita machete that is Brahman and that is the unwritten that will it has been expressed this mean low caste our survey to do not the question now o t ET not ad what he means you cannot cross that question a giver what you cannot cross Brahman a Baba there cannot be anything and what is Brahman in one word we can have some idea so you know that in Brahman all the time in different scripture and the realized soul they always see different words many words because they cannot spread go and say this is Brahman so we have discussed that the one son came to his father he was studying the scripture and father was the teacher he came and told his father every time I asked the question about Brahman you say in many different ways can't you say that like you say this is a cover this is hours and this is this this is that and like that theses Brahma can't you say like that tell me like that right the Brahman is all-pervading Brahman is the way like that tell me exactly what this Brahman what was dance his father giveth more confusing he said you were prominent you are grandma nothing of it now what is that Brahman consciousness the I always associate me as my body and my name so name and far but that is a mistake before my birth I was not having any named after my death I won't have the body so this is temporary so her from the originally I came that is the question has been answered who the who love about chakra Egypt sanandana and this is should come that is right that is Brahman and that is immortal Amrita and that we they are expression we find in the Puranas and purana says a delta moola probable so I am putting all the scriptures Gita then the Parana then beta the Upanishad because cinema Tichenor say this word look at this man his root which is the hail is a duck dog and all the branches means limbs are coming down so obviously we have to understand Saddam history is indicating this this thing it means it is not only human state it is the road and what is the route where from we have come the human being the source is called the gunman the consciousness we have forgotten that that he saved and a pepti mullah raga objective is unmanifested manifested unmanifested what is manifested so they keep the name here on the garba brahma the first ball like that manifested unmanifested the one little does a blame only the one little child was asking his mother when it is the famous the poem of Ravi do not a girl is a long time that the child is asking the mother well from you got me pregnant corrected me and where I was that you picked up from there so he was asking this question wanted to know the route and mother gave the answer in a beautiful way she told you where in my imagination in my dream he went in my personality so from there one here I have collected you so like this so the religion art is expressing that this is the way what is the route route is the Brahman then why this manifestation imagined that consciousness is also contained as if his thought I like to be meaning the moment in thought immediately the manifested the unmanifested of built our means- the Artemis manifestation appeared means unmanifested what is that consciousness and what is reactor this jagged and in the gel at all things are there the human being is so curious after knowing everything of this world on the top of the Himalaya and the bottom of the Pacific everything everywhere we have visited but still we are not satisfied now we are going to the moon all we are going and getting down and trying to find out everything right this weight goes on we are curious we like to know but wherever we go what we are searching we are searching permanent thing something permanent and we are not getting so we have to go back to our own root what is the route from where everything has come the source is this Brahman the vagabonds down busines compared the human is a tree but our shelter very temporary if we pour on the water and the branches you don't survive we're going on taking care of the body taking care of the mind taking care of all this comfort but it don't survive it will suffer I am going to Toronto this Saturday Saturday breach Saturday there is a talk will be panel different people who speak their the topic is peace within peace without survive is the happiness the joy because each and every one the children cannot express actually what they want they cry for the ice-cream they cry for the candies they cry for the toys but that is not the thing that they want they want joy ultimately they want happiness with that I sing with the candy with the toy they get the joy the happiness so ultimately what is the thing that we are going to get happiness but how we can get the happiness permanent happiness depending on others it cannot be suppose one person is very get joy and happy become happy by eating Pisa and he stole a lot of visas in the freezer and he brings one and then warm up and he tell me he forgot to take the stock then what does a believe he opened the fries and found no stock then what will happen to him that day that evening he cannot go out something happen so all the shops are closed the only Dunkin Donuts they opened for the all night that is all sincerity cannot really read so if you were here to keep the information where where we can go in the titles No so that means if you are depending on the external thing for your happiness so you're going to suffer we could join when the child are my own child I care I keep the name I do so many things then slowly skating one day comes the child also goes away in his own way you are alone again so who is going to give me the joy how I'm going to get the joy happiness to Saddam Oh Krishna he's mentioning like this it's very temporary and immediately one devotee is asking what thing is our duty what we should do business around business answer very important answer is giving he is the gentleman asking what is our duty Salaam Krishna said to remain somehow United with God that is our duty to remain somehow that is mentioned somehow sometimes we are listening the Virgin and my mind goes to that if he can understand the lyrics we can understand the words of the song the meaning of those words immediately your mind takes that form and think you can really understand you feel the whole thing and suppose dr. Tunde mahakal I am surya koti some of you are going on chanting but you do not know the meaning if you know the meaning maka I am all-pervading Surya what is some Bravo Suja booty Sun the million songs like that the power like take the brilliance and how they affect how the things will come with you clear mind the feeling of your mind when you are worshiping the carnation and chanting this mantra without knowing when you are doing that we don't understand the meaning you you'd be happy but blessings will also come I think Ganesha is a very good God but the thing is you won't feel that way but if you know the meaning immediately that effect will come the millions of Suns and that brilliance is the God everywhere Surya Buddhism up brother so this is the wisdom of distance to me somehow you have to be united with God with the songs the pageant's reading the books when you are reading the book just going on page after page or not like that trying to understand Swami to rely on the geologists to say you must read one verse of the Bhagavad Gita one day and already you must meditate on that while understanding these who the Moller artists chaga Asheton para para Chandan see a Supernanny dad if he can understand then he is the be the meat he is the knower of knowledge who can understand this much now really dad the book and many tale what does mean the whole Tallulah this is God what type of God everything that I see it is all cheating in God also changes know that it cannot be if it is changes then it cannot produce it must be permanent must be permanent now someone is making the chapati someone making the braid the doubt that they are making that every day it goes on exhausted because from there slowlyslowly different variety different type shape the Lopes will come the braids will come it goes out but the man who is making is there the next year game rikku production is going on next take a next iggly somebody must be permanent thing the the creation will go and we stayed permanent to impart on it must be God who never can change so we have to understand who the mullah mother's welcome so this this Dhamma businesses be United somehow with God then he said there are two ways maybe that we have to explain that always and another thing there are two ways karma yoga mono yoga there's a two ways one is karma another is karma means physically through action another main teri manolio God the Karma Yoga oh no yoga how to respect is yoga through Karma the performance of duty there are four stages of life brahmacarya grhastha vanaprastha sannyasa sannyasin must renounce those Karma's which are performed with spatial aims in view which are those Karma's with a special ending view there sometimes the household they also go to the temple and perform the jung-hyun but marriage ceremony what is the manage then we worshipping god or goddess then he will light the fire the young guy then they will go around seven times and keeping the agony as a shark shield and you are the witness that we are banning man and woman becoming husband and wife all these things when you should not do that but this is allowed for the householders so the difference is mentality temperament some people they like to become house or some loose onions but port can reach god because the householders they are performing those things with a small end and at the same time they are remembering God that's why the marriage ceremony is a very pure ceremony now it is people are getting it so they are doing and assigning in that registration and then the party only know so these are the things the householders if they are performing they'll remember it and particularly before or medium depth they are afterwards if someone is explaining these things to think what are the mantras that we are using for this marriage and very clearly they think they will understand this the Salam distance sitting submissions must renounce those corners which are performed with spatial aims in pure but he should perform the daily obligatory Karma's giving up all desire for reserves regularly you have to do the perform your karma or take up karma the sentences have nipped the heart and home now they are because we are organized so we are having an Astra ma we are having the supply of food we are having all this our karma is fast in the morning and evening another time also whenever to read the holy books meditation taking the name of God and not only leaving the life but also to inspire people to live the life so why we have organized this type of classes the Tuesday Friday Sunday and going out here and there only for picturing no it's not the like they're professors they go and attend their talk and they published the paper not like that this is a sannyasins karma the Karma of those who have renounced if you notice the life of Jesus if you'll notice the life of Pavan Buddha if you notice the life of a Shankar Acharya notice the life of Sri Ramakrishna Vivekananda after the realization they are all going out to help the people and how they're helping them reminding them of their morality don't tell lies so you will be happy that if you remember remind me next class so ceramic is not again and again and almost all the spiritual leaders they are telling tell the truth or gone to truth there's a beautiful story time so we will tell the story next time so this way the Karma what is this Karma the Sunday since karma the same thing they are doing so when we sell the book not for profit if somebody is coming and picking up some books they are fools giving the money because with that money again we can publish the book so that way it goes but actually we won our idea is the book will reach to somebody's house and then he will go through the pages maybe after him someone from the neighborhood his friends relatives maybe someone will be inspired by the teachings of this book that is the main reason the Christian missionaries they printed the Bible that was the first book was printed in India and the wing to house to house and distributed the Bible why because the tardis book will help others also I saw many of the devout Christians that you always carrying the Bible in their hand and all the pages they have marked and there is also attached some paper there also their nerves are there so many things even someone who was travelling with me sitting by the side of mine he first thing he was carrying that Bible and then after sitting over there he opened that book started reading constantly reading he is getting solace he is getting a happiness he is getting a touch with God by reading that and there are some people devoted people when there is any problem they will open them some holy book sometimes on Gospel of Saddam business sometimes the gospel of Jesus Christ something about Gita bhagavata they to open a page they will read and many of them to get the solutions of their problems so this way saddam additional advises remain somehow united with god and there is anna karma the sundance is a united with god by such commas as the acceptance of the staff receiving the arms going on pilgrimage and performing worship and japa going to the pilgrimages also is the word for the sannyasins why when the devotees they are going to get blessings from the holy places the pilgrimage means what if you go to a holy place why the devotees are going to keep the blessings of God but atmosphere of holiness to be created by the presence of the holy people sannyasins what a sanyasins go over there many of those Anessa doesn't know there are the green and plain but they should go what the end the high levels enhancing the gwen contribute so when they are meditating they're thinking the descents of god within their heart not only within their heart god is present in that atmosphere many and many of the people they are coming over here now nightmare 18 2008 we came over here in this property and it is 2018 a 19 so 10 years passed we were comes yesterday human couple came there from the middle east bitter wind I thought it would be so peaceful and so happy she came and she was sitting over here she was praying attending the prayer so the moment they entered not only that that mas was green and not like that many many parts are there or everywhere and everywhere in America beautifully there Kevin we are trying our best our volunteers our Brahma jury they go on cutting the glasses try to keep it nicely but still they come they enter him to destroy and they feel happiness while atmosphere has been created how by meditation by Java by study and by exchanging the further spiritual views when you people come you sit over here for 5-10 minutes half an hour taking the name of God is giving you to benefit at the same time you are also helping to development of the atmosphere so this is how the amo Christians telling the Samuelson's karma at ease this karma means the issue all the time every time whatever they do they should go on praying for the betterment of others and what is the Maha Maha yoga will read in the our next class this gender to me need angelonia another part on gumpa three to become baby shower but a Misha meet young Tom Ramakrishna [Music] [Music] the gist of today's discussion what is our duty to be attached with God somehow anyway every moment and see Ramakrishna he is giving us the two wonderful bad karma and mana cargo we have discussed and will be discussing again and Manavi undisturbed rivers so but just to be a trusted God every time you
