[189: Panchama Veda 189: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna: Sapta Gyan Bhoomikas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Js9LW6ApeTo)

it is start with this mantra travel got farm written dr. Chiba Nam go be rewritten Calma sharp Shravana Mangalam three maggot Atum to be grinning da Buddha dodging our friends you may remember that we started reading this gospel and April 2013 and every Tuesday we are going on reading this and so many chapters we have covered but still the interest in reading and listening is there why because it is amaranth is the nectar the nectar it has a capacity to attract people but those people was sincere who liked to be enlightened in the spiritual life but those who are not 14 what is impossible with a single page if it near reading they - oh my god what - our dream for them it is a wastage of time but those who are sincere to develop in the spiritual life every word every page full of the nectar the wonderful blessings the joy that comes through this the before the winter vacation in our last class we discussed on the topic what kind of yearning necessary to realize the police of Brahman is so important the what kind of arches are necessary to realize the Bliss of Brahmans those who are attending the Ostrava kasam data that I have started in the Hindu temple amount you know the story that we began with that a great king janaka he wanted to know because he heard he reads somewhere in the scripture that if a person is putting one leg in the stirrup and taking a jump on the back up the hearts to sit on the saddle of the horse that much time it takes to realize God to realize brother so naturally he became very much curious and he wanted to know from the Brahmins but many of them could not so they were put into jail he became angry then ultimately the young boy of twelve years old Ostrava Kragh came to the court of the Jonica and there he told Janaka i can teach you but you have to follow me Jenica waned and with the horse we can imagine and he was ready and he placed his left leg on that so that he can jump on the back of the heart and he was eager I'm going to realize Brahman right this moment Astaroth little wait wait you are going to listen learn the Brahma piana from me that means you accept me as your guru and before accepting a guru you have to give the Guru prana me the respect to the Guru and what you are going to give Jenner who was not having anything with him so he said my body my mind my whole wealth and this kingdom everything I give it to you but keep me that knowledge friends look at the eagerness we read that on the December 2019 petit portion how much yearning is necessary to realize God someone was asking and ceramic is not a reply but this story of Janaka also went from there we get this how eager the King Yannick was and he was necessitated to give the whole kingdom immediately and along with the body and the mind and you know the the story how dost Ibaka keep the blessings to Janaka taught him he himself realized and he rose the ceramic ish nurse eight the Raghavan Ramakrishna giving the answer to this question as long as one needs a year under the water the story he was telling putting that he down inside the water the Guru was telling the Jesus also said the same parable a person he came to know there how I should pray to God Jesus put his head under the water and forced him over there for some time then released him and he came out and he was gasping for the year and then Jesus said how you failed about the year and that the water oh my I was going to die at that type of earning his they say I'm going to die without the realization of God so that is the way we must have to been he was telling about talking about three different viewpoints of the Hindus one is devotional to love God is the essence and nothing else but the alone is the essence and nothing else one is going on crying I don't want anything God please give me devotion except the devotion to you I don't need anything that is the yearning now look at us are you ready for that we need so many other things along with that the little blessings of God we need the blessings of God it put a little bit of protection from the God and so that we are not suffering they're successful all over Rangers are successful yes sufficient that's ok so God has blessed us with all these things the people the householders they always say like that but here it is not like that for the realization of God nothing nothing the devotion to God I did I don't need anything else and naturally the people apparently think oh man they'll be crying constantly god I don't need anything while you are giving me so many things I don't need it so this way win-win we're going on that is called the cup tea the yogic that the withdrawing the senses that means separating the sense organs of knowledge since often acknowledge separating from the objects the eye the ear the nose and all the five organs constantly should be separated from the objects but ever I see I must seek God in it the beauty that has God has given in it I am NOT going to analyze anything but I see the God manifested over there each and everything should be the God and that it goes in this way and smell that also only I feel the beautiful fragrance that has God has given so I will turn off from the worldly things only for the God I go inside the sound also only the name of God at the Omkara and when I am touching and closing my eyes yesterday when we were performing the shiva rathri that's why i was requesting the devotees transport your mind to that holy temple of Kashi and there the Lord Shiva and we are pouring the water we are going to the Ganges and bringing the water pouring the water on the Shiva and touching the Shiva and they milk you are not spending anything but only mentally but the way you are there that is the puja when we are awake whatever you are doing in whatever temple you're doing and what is that the same thing if we do completely we trying our mind from other places and that is called meditation and that way also only God and nothing else Atman and para Markman we are marching and nothing else and there are paths of the knowledge the soft of chemicals and you know that in the Vedanta they are also having the soft of Omega as the seven planes dances am Krishna is mentioning about a very few people don't know though what do we know about the seven that is a scepter the yoga they say about this thus after yoga booming that is mooladhara shortest on money booze we will read that but once in our business describing that in great details but the gyani is also in the path of knowledge there a softer booming is their place what the first and foremost is the should wager a specious decision that's called chuva in charge of HR the auspicious decision what is that and we read that one young boy he went to Shankar Acharya and he said said I don't want anything but I want to realize the Brahma and he was asking some question in the inner that hole bb2 harmony is the answer of the seven questions that they decide the last the young person acts to the Guru and those seven questions the Shankaracharya going on giving the answer and in details that it became a big book the Peabody to Romani and when he said that I have decided to realize Brahman and I don't need anything else then the Guru Shankar Acharya is explaining some criteria himself is so full of joy and he is narrating in this way the noisy critical Tosi Parvati coulombs Parbat auntie Kate entire yes a big turban the muta Brahmi bitumen chassis of India Banda muta from the bondage of the ignorance that is to have understood that this is all ignorance that realization has come the in this world whatever decayed it is nothing someday I am going to die I was observing a movie and there I saw that one lady the grandmother she has a lot of property but her sons and the daughters and all their living in different places they won't visit even when she calls them over phone they say I'm busy I will talk to you but till going on talking on some phone at the movies like that the lady is constantly thinking when they will come back my son my daughter my grandchildren and that is samsara and then finally someone told you see it announced that you are going to distribute your property then the children will come that Dede and all the children then reached over there Lama or you and etc etc when you are going to distribute the property this is world there is no love all goes in this way as long as the children are small they know that I have need the support and he'll be holding the hand then afterwards they grow up slowly it is their own world and the world is like this again a negative experience experience it in our own life but at the same time we don't realize it why because Maya Maya covers it in such a way that you always feel after the whole year maybe once or twice if the children are talking then we forget all that is good that they are also busy it's okay for us so this way it goes this is the whole world and then win one understanding these realizing these takes the decision sugar each charge of a child frosted and what is the Schrager no no I am going to realize God and nothing else and for that I am ready to do whatever you ask me to do that is called Schrager and when the shoe eh account the Guru is very happy because he has trouble in the path and he knows where the true happiness is and when a person is truly understanding it and the bondage is so strong it is so strong the worldly bondages are so strong it is very very difficult to give up very difficult to give up so this way one goes is called ceviche and then pitcher on our reflection he goes on thinking it is true that I have taken up this path see whatever and gaining gaining dissipation from me I have got a room have got to sleep somewhere some food is efficient because my only purpose is to realize God why should I go on taking home why I am NOT getting this why am I not getting the benefit that is the problem comes when you take the decision to realize God but at the same time if you are not aware in the life of the mendicants in the life of those what trying to realize God these things again come I should get this I should get that why not this nearer all that I should be satisfied with only one square meal and then I am going on trying to concentrate that is called beach R&R and when you were constantly going on analyzing this world and going on giving up all these attachments your minds become very teen discuss the new manasa and it becomes very thin and thinness of the mind by team because only one thought is there nobody thoughts that's where governments in a medicinal never read their newspapers and all that so when informations are coming and crowding inside the mind only one time there's some people this to have only suit around nothing else will be keeping in the pocket only one small piece of papers read on that is sufficient from me I am NOT going to read all these books I know if idealized Siddhartha Rama will tell me what is all the idea I don't need all these ideas so this is a completely concentrated the mind it goes then software fifty twin I can make my mind reading this way then comes the subtle property the feeling of the realization and that is the truth the realization of the truth and it comes along with that desirelessness asama shakti they need no design no design because they don't need anything there's no desire at all is not only the life of a monster Ram Krishna those who have read the biography of Sai Ram Krishna you know even in the life of the mother of Agawam Krishna she also developed this a summer Shakti desirelessness she was having nothing practicing the meditation and the jabber then ultimately that the hold is she came from c'mon poco - - in asia and the german dharma - Babu who was serving the province Ram Krishna then kept even that small house that that one room only she was there and Wattenberg wanted to give some money to a once-around is- fused then he went to the mother everyone's Ramakrishna she also said what I am going to do mottle because he gave me everything you have given with his room and I can see goddess Ganga every time from these windows and I get food all the times the Prashad comes from the temple what else I need I don't need anything when the mother was insistent is okay bring that small thing little thing mater was a great rich person and he was thinking this much maybe not even in Hana now 1/4 way but the $100 even with that only that is that is called the desirelessness Osama Shakti is not necessary at all and then comes 6th part of Havana of gypped lessness no desire in the mind means there's no other object except the realization of the God no other object finally comes to yoga - yoga me means transcendence he goes beyond this so when you talk about the spiritual life actually most of us we think of little a higher moral life that's all this good no no doubt about it it's of course good if the higher moral values we don't do anything bad but no bad practices and then they go to the temple and sometimes you pray that is alright but when you talk about the God realization when you talk about the realization of the Brahma Brahma guiana these are the things that province iran o krishna is showing about it the su h ur bechara na dhanam Inasa subtlety Asama shakti but our table Ivana and to yoga these are the seventh steps in the Jannah mark and then it comes in this way but once I Ramakrishna how blessed it is he then we can understand when we read this page we find in the page number 497 of the gospel of Salama krishna translated by shaman Aquila and the G here is benching wrong he was a doctor by profession and very close devotee of sri ramakrishna when not many people knew him Salam was associated with cinema Krishna and used to feel all the time that I am with Salaam occasion and you'll be going on having the the hot dialogue many people in the Calcutta because they were not mine star Krishna these to criticize me then without knowing people will be criticizing that is also a bad characteristics and Rama will go and fight with them and he visited one person and had a conversation with a reporter and the editor of a newspaper and he came and he was reporting to salaam Tichenor but look at the behavior of serum krishna i read wrong I visited Shahada is started the show that Quechua Romani is a great person Sarah he visited him you asked me to as if Salam is not stood to do personal krishna sterling did I I don't remember but it is nice that you went you went to a good person then the ROM is reporting the editor of the Indian empire that it was a newspaper in those days was abusing you then Saddam okay suppose he was what does it matter look at it completely detached but it is from the viewpoint of cinema Krishna he doesn't mind whether people are criticizing him or praising him but what the devotee should do that is Ramachandra here and sale please listen Dean I began to talk to the editor about you and he then wanted to hear more and won't let me go and this is this should be the attitude of the devotee the devotee won't give up why because you do not know and that is the reason you are criticizing so you must understand this but the ceramic kitchen about whom things are going on it doesn't bother about it is it the two different types if someone is criticizing my the organization or my guru my philosophy my idol ah gee I must try to make him convinced talk to him and tell that he were wrong as a devotee but the person about whom they are talking if he's a Brahma Gani he'll never care about it but in the line of ovens Ramakrishna we'd learn many of you know that same type of incident happened with two different people both are his disciples and they're here the great disciples the one was very timid gentle and he was the from the very rich person's house he came and deported when I was crossing the river in the boat many of the people are criticized you then see Ramakrishna said what did you do I didn't say anything but I was sorry Sanka is what they were criticizing you guru and you didn't say anything you should at least if they say if someone is criticizing the good you should go and cut his able if not that much at least you could talk something about me he was asking that boy another person he was physically very strong and we the things happened here of course he didn't report but other people they reported their wins the same type of discussion came and they were criticizing see Ramakrishna and he immediately stood up and said if you were criticizing my guru I am going to capsize this boat and he started tilting the boat under the Ganga river itself the inhibited he was afraid and all the same sorry sorry and then the young man said okay dear Anjana and the G wrestler and pretty powerful he didn't say anything to Sonam teach the his frame told immediately simply no called him and say this is very bad why because he was taking it completely in a different way capsizing the boat means so many people would have covered to see Ramakrishna sit only one or two percent they were criticizing while we are giving the punishment each and every one so the devotee should be intelligent to understand what they should do in what circumstances that is the teaching and ceramic Isner he didn't react at all why because he was not attached all these things why reaction it has been I am affected with some of the criticism of the praise nothing I know myself so this is the way one should go now we will start this 26th chapter which sees the festival at others house it was Sunday August 3rd 1884 but it begins with the narration account at the Dutch inertia temple and the master mihashi is writing cinema Krishna was sitting in his room in the temple garden adoption Asia after his midday meal when he read you know the many small small group the read the gospel of selfishness as some of the group's the read bhagavad-gita the meaning the West Bengal the ladies group particularly they will be meeting in the noon time and all of them they will read the Gospel of John of the pages of the same krishna's gospel and when one is reading all others will close their eyes and they will transport their mind to that particular time as a ceramic evening sitting there so a master ma she wrote in such a graphic weight details garden the party our bowels from the ship pool and several devotees from pavani pool ball around and aim where in the room it means the most emerging himself so Mahindra not so is sometimes mentioned in most of the time when shift in mind Renault and bond along both the great devotee of sri ramakrishna and a group of bowel spouts also nowadays it has been fashioned to sing the songs but these are not songs these are the spiritual practices a group of people they are called power rules they are also practicing our Twitter but through the body they'll be constantly going on telling this body is nothing but God is everything but true a beautiful way they will compose the song and sing and they have a different way of dancing singing this is really very now it has become a profession some people are singing in there putting on the attack the trace of the bowels and they will be singing like the vowels and our people appreciate it but this is a sadhana there's a course of spiritual practices this group the game and they are from shipboard and also rock all got to harish they were living with the master we should notice these points recalled lot - and harish rock alone a lot to those who have raised their and associated with the Ramakrishna movement did they can understand Rakhal means afterwards the Shami brahmananda his name was rock hard not to show me but Bhutan under this to stay with ceramic is new they were learning the spirituality staying with ceramic Isha the master began the conversation by addressing the power musicians from shipboard yoga is not possible if the mind Wilson lost and gold these people they are not ordinary singers they are ascetics and they are practicing spirituality through the path of the bowel so see Ramakrishna is telling them about the yoga and what is the yoga we drawing the mind from the sense objects and putting it into the realm God and the Brahmin or the spirituality the mind of a worldly man generally moves among the three lower centers why cinema business telling these and it be in great details will you read that great details about the yoga because the bowels the practice of yoga and most of the time to make the mistake that's why sama Krishna categorically he is mentioning the mind of a worldly man generally moves among the three lower centers and those are at the level at the sexual organ and the organ of the obscure evacuation and that is mooladhar artist Anand money booth it goes in that after greedy foreign spiritual practice the Kundalini is awakened according to the Yogi's there are three nerves in the spinal column according to the Yogi's illa pingala and sushumna among the sorry along the suzuna are six lotuses or centers now saddam location and now he is talking about the yogic way of understanding the whole shaft of umi the lowest beam sushumna the lowest being known as the mooladhara through the suzune of the center one center part there are six stages and the lowest one is cooler at harder autonomous containing mula bees the main energy so mooladhara then comes successively shortest our money for another mission and akka these are the six centers the kundalini when awakened passes through the lower centers and come to the another which is at the heart now we need talk about the heart we always feel like this side now we have to remember that these are the things inside the sushumna which is coming straight in our spinal cord and then these three things there and one which is all the time - all the time crossing so here when it is coming up straight is coming to the center and this Center is the center of our body the center of our body that there the Yogi's the if they find this notice and ceramic Krishna is mentioning about it data and the heart at that time the mind of the spirit is withdrawn from the tour through three lower centers he feels the awakening of divine consciousness and see light when the mind comes from death the heart mooladhara sadist on mana pool and the fourth one on our utter another it has not been hit by anything so another that the center part over there when the mind comes it continuously feels season not the form of God and even hear the words of God he sees the light and this is the divine consciousness he feels in me moot wonder he sees the radiance and cries out what is this what is this sometimes some of the people in a in a modern age so naturally so many types of schools teaching the meditation varieties of ways and people are also learning in different ways they don't have much time so wherever but the mind is turbulent if one piece they go to yoga and whatever they find in a easiest way but they always tried to constraint it in in between the two eyebrows and then they see the blue like many of them they told me we are practicing such-and-such yoga and we find the blue a light in between the two I closed I don't think that is good it's not good because in a traditional way that we do have great and acid Amma Krishna is describing is better to go that but it may take some time but we know that we are going in the right that I directed by those who are realized Souls so this is the way we come to the anahata and in the center of the body that lotus is opening and in that Lotus on the mind when comes it sees the light only and it is full of joy that's why cinema Krishna see divine consciousness and how we will know the divine consciousness the joy the joy that comes without depending on anything else after passing through the six centers the Kundalini reaches the thousand petal Lotus known as sahasrara the Shasta Moni then comes the supplamine that is on the top of the head and it is thousand petals if you can imagine that a thousand little Lotus is opening up and as parent goes into Samadhi according to the Vedas these centres are called Bhumi planes there are planes of the Vedas according to the tundra that is in this centre Lotus called anartha with twelve petals the anahata according to Tantra it is having twelve petals the Lotus that is opening up and it is red colored on that you can see the God or if you are not initiated and not dedicated to a particular god or goddess know chosen title you can see the light the center note that the peashooter is the fifth plane this centre is at the throat and as in loaders with sixteen petals so so the push neva Tantra and botando they all speaks about the softer booming and in this softer bony it goes in this way particularly contra and yoga they go hand in hand and the Tantra is telling it is sixteen petals that Lotus when the Kundalini reaches this plane the devotee longed tall and here only about God that is in the throat and there it is the fifteen petals conversation and worldly subjects like the last and gold causes him great pain he leaves the place where people talk of this matter how will know that we are really progressing into the spiritual path the path of yoga particularly when you will be trying our mind and we are practicing meditation and prayer and the mind is going upward how we will understand the progress these the discussion about the worldly things we won't like at all but the discussion about the God the spirituality that is always had tractors and then that is the reason sometimes some people one lady was telling that I am listening your Gita Bhagavad Gita I delivered the greater lecture in only a complete Geetha so she's listening that she should even when I am sleeping I go on listening there then afterwards I go to sleep when I get her that is going on that goes on into my mind and so many wonderful thoughts no other thoughts are coming in the beginning we should behave like that constantly mind should be trained into that and nothing else and they don't then only we it is possible the girl the attraction of the worldly things tremendous why because God has made that God wanted our mind to go out and in the one of this the phoenicians katha upanishad it is describing as the father and the father asks the sons to go out of the house the similarly as if the father who is residing inside is asking all the five senses to go out not to come in so they go out and enjoying the outside of world they don't like to come back and you had to be draw slowly it is a really really difficult job and here when it comes then comes a sixth plane corresponding to the sainted owners Archaea chakra this Center is located between the eyebrows and it has daughters with two two petals when the Kundalini reaches thatis parent sees form of God here only the form of gods come so first it begins with the heart when the mind comes up to the heart the anahata he sees the light the light of not of these is a beautiful light one Swami totally easy on experience is a great respected Strom is still there and better what I am NOT going to take his name but he told me long that the before the sannyasa use it the great you know the austere type of mom and before the sannyasa the wing in the night when all I was sleeping he went to the temple of shri ramakrishna temple was go closed and outside his side and he was going on praying tomorrow we are going to the next thing we are going to have that sannyasa before sannyasis shall I not have any experience then what I am going to do without any experience if I get that sannyasa so he was going on praying praying praying and as if he dozed over there as if he slept over there and suddenly he woke up when he saw the bright light so he opened his eyes and so we're from the light is coming is it morning now whether the temple has opened whether the Sun rose or what he found no he's all acquired everything is as it is as in the night Dana found the light is coming out from the heart of his own heart he could see from outside the light within and it was a completely new type of experience he got terribly afraid though he's reading the book as we are doing now he had the idea of why this light but even then the experience he was telling I was so foolish instead of not cheating that particular experience I ran back to the room where the other Brahma Chinese were there and I lied down on the bed but I could not sleep because constantly my mind was going back to the heart and I used to see the light all the time then I was afraid with that other people are seeing it or not what they will think and I may disturb their sleeps he saw no outside the people they're all sleeping but he saw the light coming out of his body and enlightening the everything wherever he goes it continued just before the sannyasa it went away so these are the experiences are true and it happened in the lives very recently that person is still alive so it happens not only the Yogi's of the past only the the Rishi's of the olden days they theorized known in the very modern time it also happened so he saw that life and here's the Ramakrishna's telling when it goes in between the two eyebrows when the Kundalini reaches then he seized of all not God this is the time when the two but the most the people and the calm they're practicing their deep you the different names you know the difference very attractive names the give and people they're getting attracted but they see instead of the form of God to see the light in between Sahaba pista is the God himself she's experience shall we take his experience or experience of the others so this is the standard he and it says is it see the form of God but still there remains a slight pradier when he's giving the description and if you read the raja yoga of swami vivekananda when you read the description you find that these people have already visited all those places experienced all those things that means they are so clear about it the ceramic is distilling it they see they had burned they cannot touch it they cannot go very close to it and immediately giving an example it is like light inside the lantern you may think to have touched the light but in reality you cannot because the barrier of the glass in the lantern the light is inside and the glass outside it is so clean that you feel that you can touch the light that is burning but no there is a barrier the barrier breaks when last of all is the seventh plane which according to Tantra is a center of the thousand petal Lotus the center of the eight thousand petal Lotus when the Kundalini arrives there the spine goes into Samadhi this is the place of Samadhi why the complete consciousness goes and merges with the pure consciousness the Jeeva consciousness a little associated with the body-mind I sense when it goes into that and sometimes family living under is also describing the small little drop of water as long as it is falling from the sky and going on saying I am going to lose my personality identity I mean smaller of water but when you fall on that ocean it becomes ocean you cannot find that small water over there it is there but as devotion so there is no part in the ocean it is the whole thing and similarly when the aspirants mind the yoke is mine slowly slowly goes to the top of the seventh the one gentleman he is in a linear and a political way he has given the description of seanyb vehicle and this samadhi and the fourth of july and he was meditating and hackman is given the description of this seventh he started slowly rising there is power because cinema Krishna told whenever you want you can die each our motto they according to wish you can die or you can leave when Romney began the decided that this is the particular day I should give up my body and then he was meditating one after another the lotuses he was crossing touching and the beautiful way he has described and he is telling that these eceive the snake is going up and ultimately touched the seventh one and that was really really a wonderful experience and Shama Vivekananda only just like a little baby hearted the mother mother mother and he merged into that Shamim even Gandhi himself has composed a small poem when he's describing when it goes goes goes and ultimately the last one there's a sixth one in between the two eyebrow they are also I st. still mean and then i i i then the when it goes to the seventh one i completely vanishes I become down and here it says the last seven place according to the Tantra is the center of the thousand petal Lotus when the Kundalini Rises there thus parent goes into Samadhi in that Lotus drill searched on and the Shiva searched onon the super Shiva Shiva the auspiciousness he is not the form that receiver we worship there is no speciousness the purity and purity means only spirituality and no worldly things there's no nama Rupa jagat there's no nama Rupa only a CD that is only they are something is there that much feeling so that is called Shiva auspiciousness such cheat Arnon the silver well just to explain just to give an idea so that we can grabs that serve the existence cheat the knowledge and please searching on under Anand is the please Shiva auspiciousness the absolute the dear Kundalini the African power unites with the Shiva this is the known as the union Shiva and Shakti so the yoga and Tantra it goes hand in hand why the Tundra's is doing the Shakti and Sheba marches that knowledge is Tonto Tonya tea mr. Yeti Yanam Annina ET Tantra Tonya tea means mystery of tea mr. data means all expansion everywhere what knowledge jeonnam ET what is that knowledge the Shakti and the Shiva are one and that is the why as I was telling you the Krishnan and the urban baggage the he was bring the Shakti and Shiva the auspiciousness and the power of the auspiciousness when it is coming together in the yoga Kula Kundalini is coming and meeting the searched on and the Shiva in the you get back Tantra the shiva and shakhty the Kula Kundalini are the shakti the manifest the when it comes together these two you must understand then it's gone Tantra so tonight a mystery at a journey in our me Jana Hanina Eadie so this guiana and when it comes what happens in that state the life breathed lingers for 21 days and then passes out the ordinary people when the reaches over there they're tremendous spiritual practices they die after 21 days why because they don't have the body consciousness they completely forget that they have a body and the body cannot survive without food and water the anomeric osha it cannot survive without food and water as because they stopped taking food and water and stopped taking care for the body then ultimately 21 days they can somehow survive and then they die you know that in the life of a bonsai ramakrishnan when in the practice he went into the Samadhi and he was not waking up then from somewhere another yogi came with the stick and he started reading the body of the ceramic is not making bean so that he feels that pain and brings back the mind down and we never used to wake up because of the pain of the beating the Yogi's to feed him immediately and pour water and he serves Ram Krishna for that way that's why afterwards Ramakrishna could survive of course then after this they got the ceramic Yishun and himself told when he wanted to give up the body then someone the Brahmin came and told no you have a purpose to take this force Ramakrishna and you should be in between this spirituality and this worldly life so power nunca this power mukha is a great subject and he is leaving in between these standing on the threshold of the that one is spiritual life another this worldly life sometimes used to say to himself I am going to drink water is it cha desire that is to bring down his mind I am going going to chew the pauna we one type of Britain leaves and all I am going to chew that but that way he used to bring down his mind I am going to visit that person he is to say to himself just to bring down his mind and what we do I like to forget that person so that my mind at is go up so many persons are crowded in our mind so many other desires but still the opportunity is there because the Ramakrishna is telling it is possible after attaining Samadhi some souls of their own accord keep ego of knowledge ego of knowledge without ego no one can survive citizen knowledge ego what is that knowledge AHA and my father in heaven are one I and my mother in the temple are one see Ramakrishna stealing mother and also the same you like me to eat your food same thing the dead ego I remains as bird it is but this ego does not create any attachment it is like line drawn on the water so how he explains if you are making a line on the water how it leaves nothing the similarly this ego is nothing currently only to keep down the mind Hanuman he give the servant ego after realizing God but here in both his personal and impersonal aspect the mana mana he is the combination of Guiana and bhakti then we find that the great sages like the Narada then sanaka sananda sanatana sanat-kumara after attaining the knowledge of brahman kept the servant ego and the ego of devotion like Narada ego of devotion there are two classes of paramahamsas that this is read and then you stop today two classes of paramahamsas this we must understand it clearly this is the very high level the spiritual level and particularly those who are trying to understand the spirituality forum of ourselves the highest standard in the spiritual goal one are forming the formless reality and the other affirming God will fall one without form and other group which falls to Ananda show me believed in the formless reality from telling - Swami many of you know he was a great personalities to live in the car she your station in Kashi and they still call in the moving Shiva this paramahamsas like him like the trilling governor prabhu this is who are accepting the formless reality a brahman they care only for their own good and they feel satisfied if they themselves attain the goal so this is a great statement the some people at their personal act like telling gamma trailing Gupta Swami and they are thinking only for their own salvation and they are not bother about anything else you remember that Shami be big and also wanted that and he told the young marine he was telling I will go down into Samadhi and come up only to eat something to keep the body and like to enjoy that surround krishna rebuked him fie on you why because the second grade those paramahamsas who believe in God with fall keep the love of God even after attaining the knowledge of Brahman keep the love of God even after attaining the knowledge of Brahman after erasing art miyano from the path of knowledge they are keeping the devotion outside so that they can survive why they so that they can teach spiritual truth to others this is a great feeling for the others and that feeling it became so high in Swami Vivekananda that he promised till there will be someone even a dog I will come back to help that being to realize God so that is be vacant under that is the feeling copies of the brindaban to attain the knowledge of Brahman Brindavan the gopis you always talk about the love and these are there and there'll be so many songs and the dramas but they were all candies but they were not King it they wanted to enjoy God looking on this as his mother is brain his husband his lover the different attitude they took to enjoy so that is worth when we realized God -
