[230: Panchama Veda 230 : Ajnana-Jnana-Vijnana](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnaKiAqktAk)

good evening friends dear devotees this lockdown is continuing and particularly here in Illinois State it seems that it will be up to the end of the me so today is the last Wednesday of this month and hold me also we are expecting to be giving the class online but it's a great response lot many people are listening and they are very enthusiastic to learn questions to talk so I was thinking from today I will keep the last 10 minutes to give some answers you can in the chat you can write your question and relate it to this topic today and then we will try to give the answer from there so I think all of you are keeping health or healthy and happy though inside and the rooms and the houses but still let us be always be happy there's sometimes some people they become bored with this so I always tell them the story of the that happened in the life of autumn in the Ghosh so he was in the prison in a Cell and there was no one he could see he could talk and then he was thinking what to do it was a terrible punishment you know the cell is a very naturally you can't four months together can't see anyone talk anyone in the social being the human being can't live in that way but he to utilize that particular time he started meditating so that was the great turning point in the life of Sri Aurobindo and he came out as a richer Binda from the sale so utilize this remember that the Rishi's they themselves is to go into the seclusion and this to leave in the caves the life was not at all comfortable in that jungle and the caves but they still utilize this so meditation spiritual practices and having the company of the family members understanding adjustment all these wonderful qualities we should develop so when we were discussing about the qualities of a monk as a sadhu at the last Sunday in the Bhagavata you know that 28th the wonderful quality is that the sir krishna was telling and the Thames the Krishna the Lord he de sade acting in the Raghav at gita also - what is religion religion means developing some qualities so let us develop these qualities and this is an opportunity for all of us well friends let us begin with this mantra tava cotton rhythm Tata G Burnham Kobe be rewritten Calma sharp 'him shravana Mangalam srimad artem boobie goon on te bora dodging aha we are reading the account that has been recorded by the three ma master ma sha that is the October 5th Sunday 1884 and in that whether a person will make spiritual progress or not can be known to a great extent by his physical marks Raghavan C Ramakrishna's may be telling this it is in the page number 597 the gospel of serum kishna you know that this is called ashwamedh roberta the summit rabida is a different type of the study the subject some people they can understand but seeing the feature whether this man is good or bad at these at success and all that nowadays and that I use observing in the ananda budget Patrika they give that a different type of people according to their the star what type of characteristics whether they'll be successful they'll be happier Oh to some extent it goes really good the their calculation is really good as Salam o Krishna was perfect in this subject and he could do it but we are not going to discuss it today those who are interested you can read afterwards but he said that by seeing that a person's feature one can understand whether he will make the spiritual progress or not then he goes in this way and he says ceramic ish now is talking then suddenly he noticed that Babu ROM and more one master Marcia they are discussing something the he asked what are you talking about there then both of them they replied about nil contest performance nil Cantor was a very famous singer in those days the singer in not that sense they were all religious performers so this to perform different portions of the bhagavata or the purana and that was a unique system to spread the morality and religious different thing so the people is to get used to learn lot of things about the religion from those performances the education in those days when the the ceramic issue was there in the 19th century in India after the subjugation of such a long time the majority of the people they could not get there that proper education only very few books were not also available so in that situation these the performers the singers this to go from bliss to players and this to narrate the beautifully and sometimes with the dancers sometimes a song and then narrative narration that way people is to learn a lot and we can understand by reading from here at that time the gentleman nee named this new nila counter was a very famous person so the nilkantha has come to Dakshina sure he had the Hat perform in the night in those days it was only night only there's to do I had an experience when I went somewhere in the West Bengal in India in a village I was expecting people in the afternoon in the evening time so but there was nothing no one very few people then I was wondering what happened why they have invited me then I asked the organizers that they said oh no they will come after the night food after the dinner and truly after the dinner hall they came the huge of course not to listen to me they came to observe the drama but anyway they all came then I gave a talk after that the drama all night and in the morning they went back that is the village the way there still now they have this type of system so we can understand that the previous night the Neelakanta the he perform and many people attended Barbara Mirage afterwards sami prime ananda whom ceramic is nice to love him very much because he's to say even his bones are also pure the no impurity that means he was not having any association with the worldly things no attachment with the worldly things desire so ceramic krishna could recognize this boy is really very pure pure so that your barbara maharaj is Nick near the family name was Bob Arum server guru Maharaj and also the MA and they said that they were talking about him then salam o krishna started walking along with them particularly with the more him there is a you know the induction Isha those were visited you know there's a long at that corridor so they were walking over there suddenly cinema Krishna took that our aim aside and said the less people know about your thoughts of God the better for you see this is called guru guru knows what is good for the disciple so he understood the aim slowly talking about his ideas about God and exchanging this thing Sudama Christian didn't appreciate that so he told that aim it is better that people should not know about your God less people know about your thoughts of God the better for you saying these words the master abruptly went away a short time afterwards he began to talk to with Hodari now only one line that master marsha he noted it is a very significant those who are coming to God they should be very careful unless an ant they are conformed they are they know all these things they should not try to disclose it why by talking with them about through argumentation all these the energy if flutters away then suppose I say something my view about God and someone comes and contradict me no it is not like this you're making a mistake then the two things may happen first I can become agitated why he is contradicting me he doesn't know anything I will go and try to get out the references I will show him see this is here in this dis scripture it says like this might have to be a lot of energy will give it and secondly I may get confused also because when I am talking with him maybe the opponent was talking with me is very strong in putting the arguments and if he gives that argument maybe I get confused and the Holy sterling right so I will be carried away with his idea that may not be correct so that is the reasons Ramakrishna he observed aim and this is called guru the guru always keeps an eye on his disciple he knows how he is developing now there are different type of disciples few most majority they come they take the initiation and they go and very few to keep the touch with the girl the Guru are very sincere about the spiritual practices that is also for them it is nothing wrong slowly slowly once the seed has gone slowly it will sprout and it will the tree will come someday that is for sure but those who are very eager to develop particularly master Masha you are so close to see Ramakrishna and some Christian knew the true master Mercia his messages will go to the posterity so he was very careful about he is so here he find like this the Hodja was telling Neelam Kantor told you he would pay you a visit it would be good to st. for him the Harz are giving as a suggestion master see Ramakrishna's didn't know he didn't sleep at all last night it will be different if he come here through the will of God so I'm not going to call him let him take rest and if he of his won't come because it's a famous person if he comes good it's all right otherwise joke okay the cinema Krishna see the guard who is giving the call and the call should reached in the heart of the devotee and the devotee should respond and come so that is the reasons Ramakrishna wants to wait and he is mentioning over here that it is better that he comes here through the will of God the God will say will come so this is the idea many times that some of the devotees I can remember I'm not going to name but in under man a very famous writer came and to visit the under man and then the devotees told please invite him I told that won't be good because he has come for different purpose he has not come to visit the Ostrom but anyway if you like you can go they went they wanted to invite him but he said no see that's the evening time it is my party time I cannot go to visit the astana like that so he was a different mentality different people different mentality God knows it very well so he wanted to wait he's a famous singer and naturally see Ramakrishna is not going to call him in that way then afterwards sadhana Krishna asked Babu Ram to visit Narayan at his house is another boy he looked on najran as God himself see when the god calm in the for as a in the form of a human being to establish Dharma along with him different gods and goddesses also come and they are all in different forms and to make the leela complete the divine play complete so if there is one character refine the neuron ceramic krishna considering him as God himself so he longed to see him the master said to Barbara you may go to him with one of your English textbooks you know as because the parents were not very happy with Salem Krishna as the Ramakrishna is to talk to the younger people about the God about the renunciation obviously and naturally the parents they were not very happy so here Sri Ramakrishna asking almost the same age group Barbara Mirage that not that time he didn't become the mom so to go and visit this Nara and why because najran was having very good qualities so if these young boy goes to him and talk to him and become friendly he will also understand those things but he told you better take your book if the parents they see that the boy is coming with sticks books then naturally they will think oh they have come to consult about the study so they own mind about so Seleucus know about that way very very clever about three o'clock in the afternoon Ramakrishna was sitting in his room mainly come to arrived with five or six of his companions the master went out toward the east door as if to welcome them the musician bowed before the master touching the ground with their foreheads say Ramakrishna went into Samadhi Baburam stood behind him in nilkantha and the musicians we're in front of him watching him in great amazement demonic and officer of the temple looked on from the north side of the bed soon the room was filled with officers of the temple gardens cinema krishna's ecstasy abated a little he seated himself on a mat on the floor surrounded by nilkantha and other devotees so here you can see that the master marche a thing is happening something is happening inside the room it's not a very big big room this small we have in most of us we have visited the room where the Ramakrishna's to stay and that only one room everyone is to go over there now the temple officers they have also come why the famous singer is visiting see Ramakrishna and these people they paid money I think to the famous singer and the singer is coming to visit see Ramakrishna so obviously they were taking as what is the date is he going to charge again what is going to happen so they were curious and they were also interested to have the company of the famous singer so they also came who was standing where at a glance at that very moment master Messiah who was in front of ceramic isne as if coming along with the musician group and he noticed the bottom is standing just behind see Rama Krishna Babu room was very careful see Ramakrishna went into ecstasy he may fall because the body consciousness is not there the back room is to take very care about see Ramakrishna so he's standing just behind it and then one of the officials he is standing in the corner of the bed and many other so Britt details in a glance he looked and he remembered he noted it now when he noted it when this was published all these people who are alive accepts the Ramakrishna all they were there so obviously this is a vivid picture no one can have any doubt about it so this is how not only the conversation but also the whole picture and if we can imagine we can at least we can see that before our minds eye we can see that these things are happening so they enter into master still in an ecstatic mood I am alright and the nilkantha with folded hands make me alright to the master smiling why you are already alright so we will know afterwards when the conversation that goes on how the ceramic Krishnan could understand this is its performing but he was having a divine power if some realization of God and it is the God's will that he was doing that sri lankan understood it in because i am not telling it right now will come to that house Ramakrishna could understand a person and whomever he showed his interest we could see that he was really having some power so this man was very humble so he wanted to get the blessings he said you were already blessed an encounter he said Revere sir I am entangled in worldliness now the master sri ramakrishna with a smile he is telling God has kept you in the world for the sake of others this is a very important sentence I am entangled I am thinking but master the God Himself is telling God has kept you in the world for the sake of others then he said there are eight fighters one cannot get rid of them all God keeps one or two so that a man may leave in the world and teach others so some people who are doing something good for the other people and the old he is doing it it is not it's a God's will so he is there he is doing it now if the person who is doing it can understand it then what will happen whatever he is doing will become his sadhana whatever the quality I'm having I am a singer performer even through this I can this power that I am having the quality that I am having I am solving God I'm a missionary I go to the people and try to give them the spirituality the morality the religion through different type of performances I am a missionary I am doing this performance I become humble and if because of the clappings and the people they're happy with me at the fan club and all that then in that case you're bound the power is given to you by God but now that power misused but Neelakanta about him see Ramakrishna stilling see there are eight fighters what are the a traitors we have already discussed but let us remind it first is greener greener is aversion second is lockjaw - shame then the boy the fear Shankar is a doubt Jew Gousha disgust cooler family jati race Sheela cultured behavior so this type of things always should be very careful about the aversion we can understand the sometimes some the things are happening are people at there we don't like them no for that is also in other way we are bound to that because once you are having some aversion then the attachment is also there it goes hand in hand so one should try to be completely equal the Luck jar the shame this is also the same way I like to take the name of God but I feel shy because the friends may criticize me they mean what they will think about me so I am NOT doing it that way we cannot go towards God the boy the same fear the shankha the doubt Oh shall I go there is there God then why I am wasting my time only I don't know the God is there or not so different type of things do goofy odd the discussed the family cooler now sometimes we become very proud about our family we belong to surrender particularly the King's family and some rich man's family so that family thing always binds us we cannot become humble because of that background or maybe constantly I'll go all these people they're all very ordinary I am coming from this and this family I know this I know that the Ankara and a home kara means ego coming because of that also binders the same way jati the race we can understand the second world war because of this jati the group of people they started thinking they had the great race in the whole world and naturally other should be under their control and that was the second world war and naturally they all were destroyed and so much of difficulties and the miseries the people had to suffer in those days and Sheila also sometime we can't behave properly because we feel doubtful people are dancing people are singing we can't join with them oh that that is ordinary people how can I do that so this 8 the aversion shame fear doubt disgust family race and Sheila the disks cultured behavior culture baby is not that way bad but if I am thinking the only that and I'm hesitant to take the name of God because of that that binds so this all the eight fate is master Z Ramakrishna mentioned about it and he said one cannot get rid of them all God keeps one or two so that a man may leave in the world and teach others the this is the God's purpose that you should be here and he gives her in a strong that heart and that person is going on doing God's work but one should know that I am doing God's work this is important you have organized this theatrical company how many people are being benefited by seeing this theory your bhakti if you give up everything then where will these musician go God is now doing all this works through you when they are finished you will not return to them the housewife finishes her household duties feeds everyone including the main servants and the maid servants and then goes to take the take her bath she doesn't come back then even if people shout for her so giving then example dub like this that we have to perform our duties and then we have to go every in the life of maybe we can endure we can see these example very vividly the Vivekananda he used to say to his disciple to his followers you must die for the betterment of others the like that but a time came when he started telling let the dead bury their dead I am ready my father I like to go back to you the British shot car rhetoric aruch je prabhu joy so if you read that it is very touchy let the dead bury their dead what is here in the in the world it's nothing the vedanta says is nothing but just Maya's performance and we are also we have so serious to perform in that way now when we go beyond this and we can say let the dead body there did the way he expressed this is all the drama only and not real so this realization after this he washed his hand and say now I am free please bless me the Neelakanta says then the serrano krishna is giving the example say Yashoda went mad with grief because she was separated from Krishna as she went to Radhika who was meditating then radical said to her in an ecstatic state I am the ultimate prakruti the primal power ask a boon of me Yashoda said to her now all of you know Yashoda was the foster mother of Krishna and Radhika used the power of Shri Krishna what shall I ask of you please bless me that with all my body mind and speech I may think of God and serve that with my eyes I may I with my years I may hear the singing of God's name and glories that with my hands I'm a sob hurry and his devotees that with my with my eyes I may behold his form and his devotees so what is the blessings she is asking the Marja soda that body mind and everything all my our limbs our senses sense organs dedicated for God so that is the complete surrender complete surrender to God so I am NOT separated from God all the time my mind is thinking of God and my ear mice and hand everything my eyes all are seeing God hearing God listening to God so that is the prayer then Master is telling to that singer your eyes filled with tears when you art at the name of God why didn't you should worry about anything divine lab has grown in you the ceramic Ishtar the great master he observed the human being and he observed the singer others went to get the entertainment isn't it nicely singing dancing narrating so that is another part but Salaam Krishna went and saw the person who is performing and when the person is crying in the name of God he could feel that is a genuine tear that is truly that is genuinely he is crying for God is not just he showing off to the people know when he's singing the every word the meaning of the world touching his mind and his feeling that and that is the reason he's crying this is called sadhana even through the songs one can realize God this is the way I saw one of our Swami he was performing the oddity there are so many Swami's they do the oddity but when I saw that young man he was doing the Aarti I nearly liked it because his whole body it you can feel that he is doing the oddity with the great joy when he's showing the light on the face of the God ceramic ISNA as if he's looking at the face trying to see the face with that light so that from the back I observe it I liked it so much so you can feel the person who is performing over there he is becoming one with that performance so that is exactly very ordinary person like me if I could feel like that I really felt really great joy seeing him doing that so and cinema Krishna the mock God himself he observed it and he saw it and he was thinking that this man has already improved why then you should worry about anything divine love has grown in you to know many things is a guiana ignorance to know only one thing is gana knowledge this is the Pancham Aveda that's why I always I feel this is should be the perfect name for that gospel of Sri Ramakrishna why in every page there is a real knowledge is giving the Veda means knowledge just a conversation with the musicians Ramakrishna was having suddenly he brought you see austere parsha that is the discussion he mentioned about it then he is telling to know many is ignorance when a person is singing if he is thinking so many people they are listening to me appreciating my song he is ignorant this is just a performer ordinary performer a musician a dancer but the same act when he is doing with the thought all the faces all these people are around me who are looking at me nothing but my God the God in different names and from sitting before me it is God who is enjoying my songs my dancers my narrations and Blissett so that is the way one of the direct disciples of Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna and he went to the Madras Swami Rama Krishnan and the G many of you have read his biography it's a great soul so he used to go and give it class but sometimes in the whole hall in that big hall not a single person will be there he alone sitting and giving the whole one-hour talk today from here I am talking before the camera I know the some of you are listening to me and that but the schwa me he was sitting in a big hall not a single person not one day day after day every time used to go and then used to see at the right time and he'll be doing the whole reading and explanation as if hundreds of people sitting before him then he will come back someday someone asks him how he there is no one why you give this discourse the heater I am talking to a God God is there see this is the sincerity to see meaning is ignorance they only - no one is knowledge the inside a máquina this is this small para that explained wonderfully ignorance and then it says that a Guiana in Sanskrit then Guiana then big Jana this three stages of Jana ignorant what is that ignorance seeing meaning though there are different names and forms but in reality it is only God who has taken these different names and forms I am the performer and they are the listeners but all the same this is the beauty so here ignorant Agana knowledge Jana what is that knowledge - no one then beginner what is it beginner the realization that God alone is real and that he dwells in all and to talk to him is big Jana so only understanding intellectual knowledge that God is one and all else that we see is nothing but the manifestation of God just an intellectual knowledge realizing it feeling it and then how you can understand that the man has realized it his behavior what is the behavior just Ramakrishna on the G date he saw as if the God is sitting everywhere God is standing before him and he is dis coursing giving the talk and having that dialogue with the god himself that is called began another stable the beginner this word Salam o Krishna used many a times so first is our Jana ignorance I see different people and I am attached to these different people and I feel they are the main object of my performance wrong team and second I understand that God is taking all this form good knowledge but the best is feeling that God is there I am talking to him that's called fuller knowledge we gana to love God in different ways after realizing him is biana so this wonderfully he has explained the Salam Krishna Deb this is the schwa me Vivekananda said religion is realization and Salam o Krishna in this particular passage we can understand what to realize what is that realization God alone is real and that he dwells in all that is the realization one when one can have that then one is really realized person God realized soul and after that some people they become completely silent they become full they don't want anything else but there are another group higher than this group they like to enjoy the God's manifestation in different forms is God only playing so they like to be in the a part of that game divine game but without attachment and they enjoy the whole game that is called big Anna it is also said that God is beyond one and two he is beyond speech and mind to go up from The Leela to the nectar and come down again from the Knik tear to the Leela is match your bhakti bhakti means devotion and what is that devotion God is there God is doing everything God has created this universe this world God has created the bad people and good people God has created the joy and the suffering understanding all these things realizing this thing and without being affected by all this leave the life that Shankaracharya will say Jeevan Mukta he is liberated while leaving why after death while leaving so enjoy this world without being attached to it so that is called Jeevan Muktha and from the other point of view from the devotional point of view they are great devotees they like to be in the play of God the Leela and Nita Nita means completely one and there is no to a Leela once again coming down like the waves the the ocean it is there there is no wave so it is the knick tear and when there is the wave the wind is blowing and creating the waves different sizes of waves different rip reflection of the Sun and so many varieties is called Leela divine play I loved that song you of yours about aspiring to reach the lotus feet of the Divine Mother it is enough to know that everything depends on the grace of God but one must pray to God everything depends on the grace of God now sometimes the people they ask what about our effort Purusha Cara and Deva Kripa if dribble is the final everything God has already done then why should we worship if you have truly realized that you need not to do anything but if you have Norrell if it is a question here is a doubt then you must have to pray you must have to go why now see in this only not even a half a page so many wonderful knowledge is about religion we are getting from Saddam o Krishna he said that the CD is to sing a song this singer and that from there say Rama Krishna is mentioning everything depends on the grace of God but one must pray to God it will not do to remain inactive they say God is doing everything the grace grace of God but you must pray to God it will not do to remain inactive God is doing he knows everything why should I do anything no you have to be active yet as the Lord Jesus said knock the door it will be opened unto you so the beautiful way they have explained what is the knocking of the door prayer everyday we have to pray to God and one cannot pray the person is not having the faith that there is God there is someone who is listening to me how can you pray so this is the beautiful way that now he is giving an example the law year I don't know how the Krishna learned it because he never visited any Court but the way he is presenting the lawyer gives all the arguments and finishes he is pleading by saying to the judge I have said all I have to say now the decision rest with your honor exactly the lawyer they conclude their pleading in this way so when we are praying to God we have to say God up to these I have taken the name of yours and then I have trying to meditate now I pray to you this is the way please help me and that much I can do so what is that Purusha car self afford this much the pure Chikara is this much that I will go to God take his name work for him and then pray to him to give me his knowledge and his divine darshan so that is the way he should do and then ultimately wait for God's grace the grace the gods the divine debauch kripa and pure chikara de mingle together then there is success the last verse of the bhagavad-gita it says the same way and when the God's grace and the effort of the human being both go together there is success after a few minutes Adama Krishna say to Neelakanta you sang so much in the morning and now you have taken the trouble to come here but here everything is honorary I am not going to pay you anything that is everything is honorary out of your own you have to come here to perform I am NOT going to give you anything look at this man though he was a singer a performer but at the same time truly he was advanced in spiritual life so he said Nelligan why so and then he said I shall get a precious gem from here not the money but the precious gem he mayn't blessings see Ramakrishna said you already have that precious gem will you gain by adding again the later or two-letter are two car that mean already are is there so that he said if you didn't have the Jame now this is the important line I wanted to mention if you didn't have the gem gem means the blessings spiritual developed the condition should I like your song so much God loved those who are devoted who are pure the window Lord Rama Krishna God's the Rama Krishna he is liking those songs they are not songs their prayers so that's why Ramakrishna said you are already having that jam J means the spiritual developed condition should I like your song so much Ram Prasad had attained divine realization that is why he songs appeal so much so that is what C Ramakrishna said is there any question has come the the question is I do not understand why people always argue about God and religion he's a faithful he is completely having the faith that's a good it's not the question then his opinion so it is okay there it is better to have the doubt and to ask so and then then getting the the reply from different people but faith is there as you have the wonderful faith God is there and to reach to God the path to God is religion the God and religion the goal and the path both are there why to argue when this condition of mine comes a great success but those who are not having that okay they should have the doubt they should go and ask well let us continue a little since the questions are not there I had already planned to hear your music latter on Neoga too came to invite me he's talking about the performance in the Neoga family the master was sitting in the small couch he told nilkantha that he would like to hear his song or two about the divine mother Neelakanta sang two songs with his companions when the master heard the second song he stood up and went into Samadhi presently in English they have not mentioned those songs because it is very difficult for the non Bengali people to understand those krishna other kali curtain so perhaps the sharmaji didn't mention it over here when the master heard the second song he stood up and went into Samadhi presently he began to dance in an ecstasy of divine love Neelakanta and the devotee sang and the danced around him then nilkantha sang his song about Shiva and the master danced with the devotees when the singing was over Sadam Oh Krishna say to Neelakanta I should like to hear that song of yours I hardened kolkata kolkata about three gauranga master yes yes maganda sang the song the beautiful gauranga the youthful dancer fear as molten gold cinema Krishna sang again and again the line everything is stripped away by the Unruh of love see he was repeating the song the dance written in content other devotees those who saw that indescribable dancing we're never to forget it the room was filled with the people mano Mohan was in an ecstatic mood he was a devotee of ceramic isne and a brother-in-law of Rakhal sir several ladies of his family had come with him they were witnessing the divine music and dancing from the North verandah Master mache though the whole things are going on Master Mushin he was observing and recording the his speciality was three ma master ma cherie the he never wrote over there he had their photogenic memory used to see the things what is happening the ladies in the from the veranda they were also looking lot of people they also gathered they are also listening and seeing those things he noticed it and that he kept in his mind afterwards he noted it down and so beautifully published and this the way he is giving the picture so it we can imagine the wonderful memory of master Mushin we are so grateful to him hearing the loud music many people gathered about the room and the Brando's are to the south and not and the semicircular approach to the west of the room where crowd with people cow were crowded with people even parcel passengers in the boats going along the Ganges were attracted the music was over ceramic Rishon about to the divine mother said now again bother with dr. vagabond this is a unique way we can say the slogan of ceramic is no game bother but Bhagavad is the scripture doctor the student who is reading that and then Taliban the guard vagabond a vagabond now they sang the song they danced and they enjoyed that now what actually the ultimate goal that is what the Ramakrishna wants to say the ultimate goal you should transform yourself into that gadot the divinity the Bhagavad instructions of the scripture doctor the devotee who is following those instructions and then transforming into that godhood Bhagavad back to vagabond my salutations to the Gianni's my salutations to the Yogi's my solutions to the doctors any another question no the master was seated on the semicircular porch with Neelakanta and the other devotees the autumn moon flooded all the quarters with light cinema Krishna and nila contr talked Milla Kanta you are none other than gauranga so this is the devotees so he understood about Ramakrishna why should you say such ting and the servant of the servant of all is the humble way he is mentioning the waves belong to the gang Ganga's but does the Ganges belong to the waves Neelakanta you may say whatever you like but we regard you as gauranga himself which I tano mahaprabhu master tenderly in an ecstatic mood now these I must say one should not only listen but not doubt about the ram krishna the serrano Krishna is God himself when he said that you may so that you are the ways but not the Ganga that means you are not God but the divine play of gong the divine God but I consider you as the God now ceramic is not giving the answer My dear sir I try to seek my eye but I don't find it there is no ego at all and when there is no ego what remains God only that's wise Bhagavan see Ramakrishna he saved to the realization of God is possible when there is no ego the i-ight means the ego eimi and mine that that I is not there so Ramakrishna indirectly giving the hint to that singer that you are correct you are true I am that God that he is telling dear sir I try to seek my eye but I do not find it what shall I say said please be gracious on to us that he is praying to the ceramic wish 'no you are feeling many people across the ocean of the world
