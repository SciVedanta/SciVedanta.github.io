[271. Panchama Veda 271 - Divinity is everywhere](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csZh4TXgD78)

dear devotees and friends and today is the wednesday evening and as usual we will be reading from the gospel of sirama krishna panchama veda so let us begin with the prayer stortra [Music] in our last discourse we have discussed on be restless for god which is possible in four steps we can we can just we have already discussed it in our last class but to give a gist like that you can say the first step is hearing about god the hearing about god this is very very important shankaracharya said the human life is very important he's starting from the basic and after the human life manuscript and the desire to get freedom these are the three things in the bible shankaracharya he said but here we can say first he's hearing about god many people don't listen about god hear about god they have not heard about god and even if they have heart and they have all in a sarcastical way or in a critical we can say criticizing the god that in atmosphere they are born so they don't know and they may be hearing about god but that is also not proper way what is god actually so that is a luck that is the karma follower so fast is what is god then a desire comes liking for god so when we hear about god from and then slowly slowly we start liking for god this liking develops then feeling love for god from the liking it goes to love for god the first is hearing then it comes to liking third is the loving and then being one with god we cannot survive without god so these are the fourth step so be restless bhagavan sirama said again and again that and this is what actually happens so why we read gospel of sirama krishna so far i know almost all the centers in the united states in north america every week they will read the gospel they never stop when whole thing is over then it will be again another so everything every all these will be going on reading reading and reading the gospel of sirama krishna the panchama veda that because the god himself bhagavan sirama krishna himself is talking about god so we hear about god and the god the true god you hear about then obviously when you are hearing many i i i just read and try to explain in my own way very humble way even then so many people from the different parts of the world they'll be writing to me and calling me and telling me that they are liking it this is not just because i am reading it many people will be will read it more perfectly than i do but even then when they are they themselves can read even then why they are liking god's word so that means a liking for god is coming and it is already there so the every week they are attending the class reading this gospel and also listening the the or what how i am explaining it all this is going on by that way hearing and liking then the third state will come the feeling love for god feeling love for god means you know when the love comes then obviously constantly every moment every time we think about that person the whom we love to love for god and when that comes we are constantly thinking about god mind becomes purified constantly we are thinking that when we are going to sleep when you are getting up when you are working and in the whole time we are going on thinking in different way sometimes we listen to the songs the versions or read the holy books or hear the discourses or read but like this way constantly doing the taking the name of god all these slowly slowly develop the love love means constant thinking about that particular person and who we are thinking god and if we are constantly thinking in our mind about god and with a great joy when you are thinking or doing some work for god sometimes people they come they will be cleaning the rooms and here particularly in america the devotees they come they do all the work voluntarily because it is very difficult to get some person and if you engage someone it is very costly so the devotees themselves calm and they are well-established people educated people but they will come and clean the toilet bathrooms and other rooms and they will prepare some food and so many ways they try to do why they love it and while doing it if fortunately he or she think about god constantly what will happen if the mind is away from the worldly things the mind is pure and this god and this world god and his creation and if the mind is away from the god's creation this worldly things which is temporary completely then it is only god and mind is becoming pure when mind become pure then the eagerness to be one with god because i don't like this world so that is called to restlessness takes us to the god and we become god because we merge with god we know in reality what is god now the question is where we can find god so the next chapter the lord bhagavan si rama krishna is discussing a very unique way and today's topic the divinity is everywhere where is god everywhere how you'll find let us read from this the ramakrishna is demonstrating is the chapter 35 page 677 and the date is the 14th december 1884 sunday srama krishna arrived at the star theater on vidon street in calcutta to see a play about the life of prahlada look at it a holy person a religious person a guru and he is going to theater and it's not like modern the movie or cinema is the theater in those days the aristocrat people they used to shun particularly those who are educated and though and religious people will never go to that side but suramar krishna with all the devotees he has gone to the star theater very famous theater he is there the god is everywhere divinity is everywhere sometimes some people they think we should not eat this we should not drink this we should not visit there we should not do that but those who have overcome and then see for them that is that's why that we have to hear about god and then slowly develop liking for god then love for god then becoming one with god so that is the final and where we find god shall we go to a temple or the of course those are the places the manifestation of god is much more if you go to a holy pilgrim center to a temple a synagogue a church and of course it is there but in reality god is everywhere that is what suramar krishna is teaching and here we find he has gone to the star theater on pidon street it is still there and the play about the pralada the famous character you all know eem baburam narayan and other devotees were with him the hall was brightly lighted the play had not yet begun the master was seated in a box talking with girish girish was almost the owner we can say and he was the main person so he allowed sirama krishna to sit in a vip enclosure that's called box from there only you people will be there and no other else so he was there and he was talking with girish master smiling ah you have written nice place you have already heard about that so he was telling to get his chandra girish bhatt said how little i assimilate i just write so look at the girish he was so egoistic now the ego has gone ins in place of the ego the humbleness has come and when you are humble then you get the blessings of god you receive his teaching you can understand because the ego is such a thing will never allow you to listen properly forget about practicing that oh i know i do can do it what is that to listen from him and you were missing the god's advice and god's company but luckily girish because of his past good karma he failed that sudama krishna is not ordinary person so he is humble he was telling i have written i have only how little i assimilate i just write the master is telling no you assimilate a great deal sarama krishna is not telling that you have already understood no a great deal what is assimilation understanding clear understanding about god majority of the people majority not having clear understanding about god that they have heard about god there is someone who is doing either very powerful so we must be afraid of him don't disturb him and keep him in good humor all this temperament but the actually what is that god says ramakrishna is telling you assimilate a great deal you have understood it much better way the other day i say to you that no one could sketch a divine character unless he had love of god in his heart love of god in his heart sudama krishna's assessment about girish chandra gosh the god who can see the hearts of everyone the sudama krishna is disclosing that and obviously they are encouraging girish to follow that the path of renunciation and what is the renunciation ego the has already done a lot his ego almost gone so he is surrendering at the feet of the god so you have understood yes sirama krishna is continuing one needs to assimilate spiritual ideas i went to keshav's house to see the play nabu brindaban i saw a deputy magistrate there who earned 800 rupee a month in those days is a very big salary very fat salary everyone said that he was a very learned man but i found him restless because of his son he was very anxious to find a good seat for his boy he paid no attention to the spiritual conversation of the players sirama krishna is to observe here an educated person and as a in the society a deputy magistrate means a very big person but for the from the spiritual point of view he's nobody he had been nothing why because he don't have love for god he has come to see a devotional play and mainly the conversation he has to understand no love for that just he is there and then busy with the sun and all those things his mind is not there so suramar krishna noticed it girish i often ask myself why bother about the theater anymore so look at it and this is sirama krishna the majority of the spiritual leaders say this world is illusory this world is temporary of course it is and then when they say that they leave this world and come and join and become a monastic there is a question whether it is necessary for each and everyone to do that and what is dharma the definition of dharma bhagavan si ramakrishna is giving i often ask myself greece is telling why bother about the theater anymore but the master no no let things be as they are people will learn much from your place so whatever the drama you are staging from there the people will learn that means swadharma whatever the quality that you are having use that quality for the service of god that is called swadharma and by that way one can realize god when a another person has left the heart and home and trying to meditate on god so this is what sadama krishna so what is dharma whatever the promises that you have taken in your life responsibility you have accepted in your life perform that without any attachment and perform that perfectly as a dedication as a service to god that is dharma right from the topmost person in the administration down to a very ordinary person each and every one if they can understand this then the whole society will change we are going to the temple we are talking about god we are doing so many things but we are not understanding only one thing sometimes i find that the other political leaders they are giving their donation to the temple a huge amount where from from the exchequer of the government people's money without hesitation they're given it and thinking the god is blessed them they are not thinking that whose money i am utilizing it's not my earned money it is somebody else money i am supposed to utilize for the development of the society i have been selected elected for that he is not doing that he is thinking by this way he will make the god happy o fool completely foolishness it cannot be it's a god is consciousness he is in the hearts of each and every one the moment the thought is arising in your mind to do some something god knows is well why you are doing it so that is the reason the faith or understanding about god so it says hear about god fast know about god fast try to understand about god fast the god is the inner self and the gospel of sudama krishna in every page we find that that is the the reason we should each and everyone without the oh i am a christian i should not read or i am from different religion no not like that to understand what is god because all religions are trying to reach to god but what is god so that understanding should be very clear what is dharma what is righteousness what should you do sudama krishna is telling no no let things be as they are people will learn much more from your place the drama that you are staging from their people will learn some positive thing devotion will come so this is the performance began prahlada was seen entering the school room as a student at the site of him sudama krishna altered once or twice the word prahlada and went into samadhi this is the sudama krishna way of watching the drama he goes and he sees and then his mind and suddenly so into that height the moment he saw the pralada immediately he remembered the krishna you may remember the vishnu the god and his mind goes into that and this is called spirituality a little hint about the god takes the mind to that highest level krishna a person has dressed like that he's entering he saw he didn't see the man behind he saw the god immediately he goes to that the pralhada during another scene sudama krishna wept to see prahlada under an elephant's feet he cried when the boy was thrown into fire the scene changed lakshmi and narayana were seen seated in golakka narayana was worried about prahlada this scene too threw sirama krishna into an ecstatic mood he goes into that depth so this is called spirituality mind is completely free the moment there is a suggestion about the divinity about holy life about god mind goes straight to that and forgets all around who are the people around sitting what is happening what they will think about me nothing like that he goes into that not that everything that he is observing in the the drama he his mind is constantly taking a little hint and going and then merging into that this is swami vivekande said religion is realization and realization of this oneness oneness with the god oneness with the supreme after the performance giris conducted sidama krishna to his private room in the theater he said to the master would you care to see the farts bibaho be brought confusion of marriage another there's drama suramar krishna was no no no why something like that after after the life of prahlada so he said no i don't i am not interested in that the girish how did you like the performance now the reply of bhagavan srirama krishna girish is asking about the performance about the drama naturally because he has written here he has composed that and he is writing in this way and staging the whole drama he's asking and he's trying to know the siddha krishna's reaction about the play now sudama krishna he said i found that it was god himself who was acting in the different parts the suramar christian couldn't see anything else but god i found that it was god himself who was acting the different parts those who played the female parts seem to me the direct embodiments of the blissful mother and the cowherd boys of goloka the embodiments of narayana himself it was god alone who had become all these in the bhagavad-gita sixth chapter thirtieth birth bhagavan sri krishna he said yo mamatra and this is spirituality above religion religion are the practices the efforts but spirituality means becoming that being in that merging in that so what is that god is everywhere divinity is everywhere he who sees me everywhere yomam pashyati sarbatra saarbham jamai pashati and sees everything in me me the god in his capital to him i am never lost how can he because constantly he is thinking about god everything that he sees if can feel that it is the manifestation of the same god actor and actresses those who are playing over there they didn't feel that but sirama krishna failed this is the difference between a spiritual person and he sees to them look at them oh divine mother is playing like that in that dread so constantly thinking about god how can he lost god nor is he ever lost to me and when one is constantly thinking about god meditating on god god is also with him so this is the sixth chapter of the bhagavad-gita and we see it is demonstrated over here as a living demonstration of the scriptural teaching bhagavan sirama krishna is telling like this there are signs by which you can know whether a man has truly seen god now suramar krishna is suddenly mentioning about it giving the hint that he is god himself this is very difficult when the god comes and behaves like a human being he is living with us talking with us so difficult to recognize the god sarama krishna is giving the hint so how you will understand one of these is joy there is no hesitancy in him he is like the ocean the waves and sounds are on the surface below our profound depths so this how he is giving the example of an ocean and the above there are waves there are sound but the profoundity of the ocean the depth of the ocean it is all silent because it is one there cannot be two when you see the two as if the wave and the ocean are separate as if the air which is creating sound clashing way on the waves with the waves are different no it is all on the surface you see the sudama krishna coming talking sitting laughing discussing but in reality he is one and that is the joy and the joy is manifested whoever comes near they also feel that divine joy the sudama krishna then he is giving the many other instances how one can understand man cannot see god on account of his ego the god is everywhere god is sitting by your side but we cannot understand that why because of the ego you cannot see the sun when a cloud rises in the sky but that doesn't mean there is no sun the sun is there just the same so this is very very important the surama krishna is telling almost disclosing that he is the god himself and he is giving that example it is all joy and if only you see the waves and the sound but in reality there is no difference it is only the one and then he is telling people cannot understand because they are so egoistic they think whatever they thought whatever the way they think are all perfect it is that is why the faith is necessary how to develop faith the faith in the words of the scripture teachings of the scripture and faith in the words of the guru are the holy people how you'll understand the holy people a person who is not having the selfishness he is the holy person is then how you will understand that he is unselfish his love for all without any discrimination distinction so he is loving each and every one trying to help so then the faith will come and when the faith about god is coming then it is possible then sudama krishna is telling but there is no harm in the ego of a child very nicely he is telling the ego of a child because he is discussing about the duality constantly mixed up non-duality duality the non-duality means that brahman satchi ananda sarupa he is everything in different form he is the consciousness and that way and duality god is different i am different but i am the part and parcel of god i am god myself and i love god and one day i go and merge with that god so that he is telling a little ego is all right what the type of the ego he is telling ego of his child what the child did do always feel proud for the mother and the father so there's an example that a king's son a prince and the mid-servant of that house they were playing the mid-serbian son so the prince and the mid-servant son they were playing and something happened and the met servant sons said they both are small kids they are telling to the prince i will go and complain to my mother that you are behaving like this he never bothers the mother is a mad servant she can't do anything but great faith and similar faith in the existence of god never caring about that the faith of a child i am going to tell the god that you are behaving like this to me come the god is all-powerful example that the met servant i gave it means the faith in god as the child who is having the faith in his mother so the ego of a child i can do this i can tell this i can but at the same time he will forget all those things this moment the child is unhappy won't talk won't look at you next moment again come and jump on your lap so that is the child's ego so that way it is all right suramar krishna is telling there is no harm in the ego of a child on the contrary this ego is helpful because the child is constantly knowing that i have a mother at my back and whatever i do the mother will come to protect me so that is also helping constantly thinking about the same way if we can think about god i have god is with me i will go and complain to god about that you are not behaving properly with me so that type of ego is also good because it gives the it helps us to constantly think about god that this is the way it goes so i said to kesha if i tell you more than i have already said you won't be able to keep your organization together so that means the organization keshav chandra shain's organization it was based on not on the realization but on understanding because the christianity is very strong hinduism they could not unders understand and promote in between they started developing a philosophy and it was famously known as the samaj brahma samaj and naturally it is not a spiritual organization and that way the complete faith their understanding so we came to know and the history is proving the fast people who started that then it was broken then it was broken it went on so why because the selfishness is there i should become the leader and i will do like this so whenever there's an ego then there is the problem sirama krishna told to keshav chandra saying if i go on giving you the advices your ego will vanish and when your ego won't be there you will never care about the organization that you are leading the keshav was not ready at that time so that frightened him because if i am not having the organization then what will so that is the way krishna was talking about the spirituality about god but even then he was having that i should be the leader of the organization and when sudama krishna told that there will be no ego you will only realize god so keshav at that moment he was a very highly advanced soul suramar krishna liked him so much that one point of time when keshav was sick sudama krishna went to eve the mother kali the divine mother and prayed mother please save keshav chandra so that i can talk to him and not only that like the ordinary people suramar krishna told if you save kesha i will give you green coconut mixed with sugar then that usually there is to give like that so that is the ways ramakrishna loved him god loved him why he was having the genuine desire but that is the moment that he was thinking he will have a different organization he should be the head of the organization he should guide the people like that like that so sirama krishna even then is not disliking him that is okay he's trying to take people towards god that's also good so he's telling the ego is necessary also but when there is no ego what happens you become god yourself and when you are god yourself what do you care about the organization what do you care about the club that we have and all the position that you are having nothing so this is the slowly slowly we have to understand when he said if i say then you won't be able to keep your organization together that frightened him then i said to him there is no harm in the ego of a child the or the ego of his servant he who has seen god finds that god alone has become the world and all its living beings so this is hinduism if you read the veda the upanishads or other scriptures everywhere this is the tone you can hear everywhere all the time the people will be telling like this he who has seen god finds god alone has become the world and all its living beings that's why those who are claiming that their religious people are trying to become religious should not waste their time and i should say unnecessarily thinking about the political or other things a lot of energy is wastage on those things but it will go on changing society is just like that those who find that that should be their duty let them do that because they are karmapala that will take them there and they shall find the solace in that happiness in that and grabbing the power and that they will be thinking that i will lead the people give them the perfection let them think about that but if you go through the pages of the history so many people came they wanted to do that the world is the same same india and right from the beginning till today only the situation changed the dress changed maybe the language changed but the temperament mentality are the same so what is the uniqueness in this when we see the changes there must be an ecstatic one one which is standing there unchanged we have to find that and that is called god realization if this has come in my in our mind then we should always concentrate on that because time is very short and this is what suramar krishna is urging us to do asking us to do constantly concentrated on that so he is telling that he who has seen god finds that god alone has become the world and let the world the gods world his creation let it go in their own way whatever the responsibility i am having i will perform but i am not going to attest to that why i know that all these things are temporary going to be changed but the god who has created these is unchanged i should go back to god that is all of spirituality there is whole of religion going back to the source and he is telling this such a person is called a superior devotee again let me read this line again he who has seen god finds that god alone has become the world and all that is living beings it is he who has become all such a person is called a superior devotee now girish is telling smiling yes god is everything but the devotee keeps a trace of ego that is not harmful greece summarizing yes there is no harm in that the trace of ego is kept in order to enjoy god you can enjoy divine bliss only when you make a distinction between yourself and god the distinction between the servant and the master that means he just means a son and the father why then duality in that duality you can enjoy but if you merge with that then you are that so that is the when the waves of water of the ocean huge wave different shape and the powerful and because of the wind also sound is coming from that wind is colliding with the great wave and then making the sound all these things you are enjoying but the moment you go and merge with the ocean you are ocean so sometimes the god himself try to become different ah likes to become different not try he can do and he likes to become different only to enjoy this and when we understand that and thinking that i am the wave i am playing on the ocean which is my source and one day i'm going back to that ocean becoming the part and parcel of the ocean again so that is the you take enjoy the spiritual life so that is exactly what suramar krishna is telling there is also the devotee of the mediocre class he sees that god dwells in all beings as their inner guide the first god is one and whatever we see in different names and forms is nothing but god second one medyo kari says god is the inner self of the all beings is little advance but little below from the superior one the superior one is nothing but the same god in different forms just he is enjoying that medieval things the god dwells in all beings as their inner guide but the inferior devotee says the god exists he is up there that is to say beyond the sky all started laughing the when we think that god is living somewhere else that is the very lowest type wide lowest type devotee why devotee because he believes in god existence of god but he is thinking or she is thinking god is far away maybe above the sky or the like that is thinking but the second grade the mediocre is thinking god is residing in the hearts of everyone but the best devotee is thinking the god is everything so these are the three categories and we have to understand in which category we fall do we believe that god is only far away from us then there's a long way to go to understand and we have to study the scripture the guidance of bhagavad-gita and to see that same thing manifested in his life the god is everything a holy person is going to a theater without hesitation not only that when the actor and actresses are coming to play his mind is going back to the that atman merging in that going into samadhi that means it is possible that i can see god even in those places whom the people this to curse them oh the characterless people like that but for sirama krishna they were the manifestation of the divinity that means god is everywhere only i can't see because of my defect god is everywhere present so this is the way slowly slowly we have to rectify if we like to be real true devotee or just taking the name of god and doing whatever i like for my benefit for my physical comfort for my social status then it is a different category we are not talking about them let them do whatever those who have come to listen come to practice come to realize god these are the points we must remember every time that what is my situation my condition am i see god only in far away can't i feel that god is near in every being and when he is in every being that means i cannot criticize others the god is residing in the hearts of everyone so i should be careful when i am behaving with others i should not heart others rather i should do as the god is telling to girish that as because you are good in staging the dramas and through that the people are also learning getting the inspiration to realize god to think about god you should continue that that means my swadharma whatever i know i should utilize that for the betterment of others and then after the work i dedicated that at the feet of the god oh god you have given me this capacity so i do it for you only and i offer this to you please bless me then slowly slowly the eagerness will come restlessness will come my mind will never be on anything of these worldly things and it will collect and go to the god and the moment it goes to god my mind become completely pure and the purity is god so this is how he's telling there is also devotee of the media car then when i saw the cowherd boys of goloka in your performance i felt that god has become all he who has seen god knows truly that god alone is the doer and that is he who does everything sudama krishna's hint is very clear the girish understood sir i know truly that it is god who does everything master i say o mother i am the machine and you are the operator i am the innard and you make me conscious i do as you make me do i speak as you make me speak but the ignorance say i am partly responsible and god is partly responsible then he has the faith in god but don't understand that god is doing everything completely depending on god now the question may be if i am completely depending on god then whatever the wrong thing i will think or do that will go to god nobody should blame me for that but be rest assured if you are constantly thinking that whatever you are thinking you are doing your acting is just because the direction of the god you can never do anything wrong but that is the miracle you can never do anything wrong the god is holding your hand means you are depending on god means you are on the right direction you will never do anything wrong so that is that you need not to think that i am partly i am responsible and partly the god no the god is responsible for everything i am the machine the girisha said friends in our this present uh chicago calling i just remind you if you are interested srama krishna used this word machine amijantra to me this machine and you are the doer many a times and he gave many examples the one research thing has been published in our the chicago calling it is the electronic magazine you can go to our website and on the home page itself you'll find the chicago calling and you can read that article and you will find all those things in one place again and again and again sudama krishna is quoting that urging us advising us to become the machine in the hand of the god the here girish is telling sir i am not really doing anything why should i bother about work at all sirama krishna again rectifying him no work is good when the ground is well cultivated and cleared of stones and pebbles whatever you planned will grow but one should work without any personal motive then what is the religion religion is keeping the words keeping the promises i always say again and again it's not my words it is the my feeling by understanding after reading the gospel of krishna swa dharma a monk a sadhu should be completely free from any attachment but his heart should be full of love and unselfishness a householder whatever the responsibility he or she is having must perform that as he or she is serving the god in that basis this is my responsibility i should perform and in whatever the position in the society each and every one should understand if only this message the people they understand all over the world and in every society whatever the god they're worshiping whatever the faith they are following the philosophy they are following no problem only i should do my own responsibility perfectly correctly as it has been given to me by god to do on that type of mind so keeping my promises is that that is called religion and then what will happen your mind will be filled with love and unselfishness which is god and you will understand the joy of god realization so this is again and again suramar krishna is telling here when he is conversing with the girish chandra ghosh the girish is giving twice we have heard just here in two pages that let me give up the work and concentrate on the other things maybe spirituality suramar krishna is telling no work is good then what will happen when you are working sometimes the ego will come the ego means clashes will be there and immediately you will go back to your own self and say oh why have i fought with him it was not necessary again you are rectifying yourself and your ego will be less less and less your confidence will be there understanding will be clear and the more less will become your ego the more flow of god's blessings will enter into your mind and the joy the confidence and everything will come that is exactly what sudama krishna is telling by this way when the ground is well cultivated and cleared of stones and pebbles whatever you plant will grow that's the mind of the human there are two types of paramahamsa he is again giving the hints about the spiritual leader the gyani and the prey me the gyani is self-centered he feels that it is enough to know enough to have knowledge for his own self the preemie one who has the full of love like sukadeva is mentioning sukhadeva after attaining his own realization teaches men some eat mangoes and wipe off the traces from their mouths but some share their mangoes with others this is the difference one type of people will realize god and then the god don't never bother about the world but sirama krishna he is telling what about the others you have taken everything from them from the society after the birth everything we got from the society otherwise we would not have survived so obviously it is your responsibility to do something for the society and as a monk as a holy person what you can do you can go and tell them about god you can go and boost up their moralities you can guide them to be happy but after realization after understanding that's why the ramakrishna mission motto is it for the one's own liberation and for the betterment of others that is the the dual goal of the ramakrishna mission it was fixed by swami bibeka and himself and you will find the ramakrishna mission everywhere we are now almost having so many centers all over the world according to the demand according to the condition of the people we are going and serving them in the places like india bangladesh nepal and other places we have the schools we have the orphanages we have so many other organizations to help the people and and the developed places like the america europe we only give the teachings of the vedanta so that people can understand what is true religion so friends will stop over here and then we will continue our study you know next week again in the wednesday the gist of this god is everywhere divinity is everywhere we have to develop restlessness for the realization of god and restlessness means tremendous love for god thank you so the first question is from chatterjee he is asking how can we dilute our ego how can we dilute our ego show up so you know this is a obvious the way what is the the dilute means if you the first thing if you are analyzing what is the ego you will find there is no such thing is completely an imaginary thing what is the ego for intellect what is the ego for my family background for my education for my wealth for my success any time it can be destroyed so why i am having that ego for so this type of analysis if we do and slowly slowly that will go down second when you hear about the bhagavan si rama krishna if we have faith and love and respect for the words of bhagavan sirama krishna then we should say god you have given me this intellect so i have become a professor or an engineer or a scientist or a great leader but it is your power oh god be always be with me i am humble so if you pray like that then also your ego will go down and slowly slowly a self-confidence will come and you will feel that god is with you but the happiness without the ego will also be there and you can be rest assured that you are very close to god thank you for the question the second question is from srimad-bishwas she's asking some people believe in god some don't why ah shima this is we can say that is because of the past karma see the the the the the from bhagavan krishna went to see the drama and there the pralhada and his father hiran nakashipu two different characters prahlada had great faith in the existence of god and he was depending all the time on god whereas his father was trying to show that there is no god so that is depending on the karma of allah the past life if someone is having the faith in the existence of god but try to understand it clearly that is good now i don't believe the god in the way you think i have to understand god that is good when then slowly slowly if he is sincere then he will come to know the god himself will send someone after hearing after listening he will find that it is this is god so to answer your question why some people have faith and some others are not we can say it is purely the karma fella is a past birth so the faith of god comes in the bhagavad-gita also we have read and many a times we mentioned that those who have done something good in the spiritual life they take birth in this life in a to advance in their spiritual life in a wealthy and cultured family in the bhagavad-gita sri krishna said that so according to the karma fella it happens sure is asking again why god created this universe at all ah this is a wonderful question but this no one can answer you know when it was created and why it was created this no one can answer and swami vivekananda in one of his talk is telling hindus are bold enough to say we do not know what to say because it is god's will and in the punisher in the veda we find bahushyamavi suddenly the thought came in the mind of that it's not he or she of that the consciousness i am all alone i like to be many why the thought came we will know so we can't answer that shashi bhushan has a two-part question he said swamiji you said one should not be worried about ever changing politics at all and concentrate on our sadhana is it not wrong as a citizen he has a two parts next time so as a citizen this is of course you should be careful and you should do but some who are completely dedicated in the spiritual life for that i told for them i told so those who are completely dedicated that they should concentrate completely hundred percent on the realization of god for them is not for all second parties uh sashimi is asking again ego eradication and living materialistic life both are tough then how to balance it ah that's good see ego eradication that is the toughest thing in his bengali in his own mother tongue he said ami moly gucci be janjal ami means i the ego mole when it is eradicated gucci be janjal the all problem will be solved so that will be the last stage so to realize god that is the only way so we have to go on as you have you must have heard that one question i was answering we have to go on analyzing what is this ego why i am feeling egoistic but the self-confidence is good the self-confident that i can do it many others can also do i too can do so egoistic persons say i only can do nobody else but the self-confident person will say i also can do i too can do many others can so this is so we have to practice slowly and then the living in the wealth means suppose you are capable to earn money and then naturally you are having something unnecessarily if you are wasting the wealth just because you have the capacity to earn that is completely wrong from the spiritual point of view friend you must remember that i am talking from the spiritual point of view so that is those who are sincere to realize god and to understand god for them whatever is essential comfortable for them they must have but the excess thing you must give it back to the society by that way you can lessen your ego and you can have your comfort also in the wealth so thank you thank you very much so let us say three times shanti shanti shanti and then we will conclude [Music] [Music] foreign
