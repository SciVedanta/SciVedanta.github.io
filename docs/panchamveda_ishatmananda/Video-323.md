[324. Panchama Veda (324) - “Everything is possible for God.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGE2cv8scqo)

namaskar dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening we'll be reading from the gospel of krishna and today we are going to read from the page 773 english gospel and let us begin with this [Music] krishna was listening the argument of young narendra who became vivekananda afterwards vivekananda that he was debating with other devotees assembled in the house of balarama balarama in bhagbajar so things were going on young narendra was insisting the proof i don't say that these avatara or the incarnations are not true i simple simply don't understand them please explain them to me so this is a very genuine urge so the young man he is asking the the those who are following these classes regularly you know that the conversation was going on particularly the girish chandra ghosh he was arguing with narendra narendra that young boy of hartley 2022 years old he was arguing and girish ghosh the experienced person he the very well read also and there our master mahashaya he was also present master mashay the as he was very shy type of person he was not telling directly through someone he was putting his own views so that we know and sudama krishna he was sitting over there and listening and enjoying things were going on in this way then he mentioned one devotee mentioned about the gita that contains the words of god the master mashay also master means bhagavan sirama krishna yes the gita is the essence of all scripture and narendra says yes krishna or any fellow for that matter a devotee devotee means our master mahashaya we should not make the the confusion the english master master means bhagavan sirama krishna the teacher and the bengali master means a school teacher as a college professor it's a master maha shai so that is in bengali term so i'm using master mahashay for the recorder of this gospel of sirama krishna whose name was mahandranath gupta he was a teacher the headmaster the principal of the school so we say master mahashi and here in english gospel bhagavan sirama krishna they have mentioned as master the master means the teacher but spiritual teacher so here bhagavan sirama krishna he is mentioning in this way yes the gita is the essence of all scriptures now all we can imagine the young boy and he is arguing as ramakrishna sometimes commenting master mahashay that is the mahindra nad gupta he is also commenting girish ghosh he is putting his arguments many other people are also giving their views he alone is going on fighting so they are enjoying the young boy he is fighting with everyone talking with everyone arguing with everyone the bhagavatama krishna when he heard that someone said a devotee and you know that some sometimes the master mahashay the he hiding himself so he instead of his own name he sometimes mentioned as m or a devotee like that so he mentioned gita contains the words of god the god incarnation scripture all this but the young naren he is telling i'm little confused now sri krishna is telling this what is proof how can i believe it who will say that so this is his problem i understand this is a nice book it's a good book it's a good teaching but how do you know that sri krishna said that that is his argument as a young naren and others are telling why you are doubting krishna said so it was going on like that and sudama krishna he said gita is a sense of all scriptures a sannyasi may not may or may not keep with him another book but he always carries a pocket gita so that way he is giving an another way it is not he is not arguing with naren but giving say gita has its own at the place in the spiritual life narendra yes krishna or any fellow for that matter and now this is a very strong word he used about bhagavan sri krishna any failure that that way he said so naturally sirama krishna was amazed in these words of narendra he is telling it is no problem for me maybe krishna maybe anyone only give me the proof says rama krishna was amazing he says this is fine discussion there are two interpretations of the scriptures now bhagavan si rama krishna in indirectly slowly is trying to give the answer but he is not entering into the debate not supporting any party either girish or master mashayar narendra no so he is telling in this way the literal and the real meaning now we have to understand this is bhagavan's rama krishna when the debate was going on among the devotees he was enjoying he was encouraging the debate so that whatever they know that should come out and then then the teacher can understand uh what is his understanding about the spiritual life so this way he was trying to understand the spiritual growth of narendra and narendra was trying to understand how to believe that this is a scripture the basic thing here sirama krishna giving the reply how he is giving the reply he is telling this is a fine discussion there are two interpretations of the scriptures one literal another real one should accept the real meaning alone one is literal another real now he is explaining that what agrees with the words of god that is the real meaning there is a vast difference between the words written in the letter and the direct words of the writer just giving an example someone has written a letter but at the same time when you talk to him he can explain it much better way everything cannot be explained in the later so that is the reasons ramakrishna is telling that you can accept the words of the scripture in one way but when you listen from the mouth of god himself is a completely different thing the scriptures are like the words of the later the words of god are direct words i do not accept anything unless it agrees with the direct words of the divine mother now what is the indication indication is very clear you have to meet god yourself realize god yourself fast and when you realize god yourself and when you hear from the god directly then there will be no doubt because the pramana that is their direct experience and there will be no doubt at all bindante it burns away it cuts down everything because i have seen god when the jesus is telling the whole people are against him and criticizing him and arguing with him but he's confirmed because he talked with god when sudama krishna bhagavan sirama krishna is saying something with the scripture whether the learned person and these that because he knows i have heard from the mouth of god so this is the difference when the people who those who have studied the scripture when they something by quoting scripture that is one thing when ordinary people are reading the scripture they are understanding the meaning in their own way but those who have realized god talk to them listen from them when they say that it's a completely different so that is why swami vivekananda this narendra afterwards when he himself by the grace of his great teacher great master bhagavan sirama krishna realized god see that great mother kali not once thrives then he realized that then he practiced meditation and afterwards he realized that everything that is in this world and nothing but the consciousness whom we can call the god then there was no doubt and we never used to go to give a talk or or just discussing with people convinced i am the son of god i have seen god i know who am i so that conviction of a realized soul the bhagavad-gita suddenly commented when the discussion was going on suddenly he commented yes now narendra when he is giving a very strong comment about the scripture that is bhagavad-gita about that particular scripture bhagavan si rama krishna said is the essence of all scriptures bhagavad-gita is the essence of all scriptures now about that this young boy he mentioned maybe that's krishna is mentioned telling that bhagavad-gita whoever i don't care but what is the proof appreciating his eagerness to understand the truth sirama krishna mentioned this when you read the scripture you get a meaning according to your understanding according to your background now when you directly listen it from some of the great scholars that will be little different but when you listen directly from the mouth of god that will be completely different so that he is insisting but don't you realize god listen from him then there will be no doubt at all by this way sirama krishna is mentioning god is there god is true and one can talk to god one can realize god it's a great statement just casually he mentioned that the scripture are like the words of the later the words of god are direct words then he mentioned about his own experience i do not accept anything unless it agrees with the direct words of the divine mother goddess kali he was a worshiper of goddess kali ma kali so that exactly he's mentioning the conversation again turned to divine incarnation narendra it is enough to have faith in god i don't care about what he is doing or what he hangs from infinite is the universe infinite are the incarnations in the scripture it mentions the incarnations the manifestation of god in different forms according to the situation they're infinite in numbers because why because the creations are also infinite that is true hearing that sirama krishna heard the words as surama krishna heard the words infinite is the universe infinite are the incarnations he said with folded hands ah why because he himself has seen that narendra read and that he mentioned casually when you are reading as if he is casually oh there are infinite incarnations infinite universe but salaam krishna saw it as a god himself he know it very well so immediately he is showing the respect by saying that ah im our master maha shai now whispers something to bhavanath no master mashay he always he could directly say something but he was some way a little another shy type of person so whatever he was thinking he was trying to say and he said through bhavan at this time previously he said that through pal2 now this time through bhavanath he whispered to bhavanath and babunath said aim says as long as i have not seen the elephant how can i know whether it can pass through the eye of a needle i do not know god how can i understand through reason whether or not he can incarnate himself as man now though the master mashai coming and having the company of bhagavan sirama krishna he is also recording the conversation he is listening but doubt is there and this doubt is genuine unless and until we realize god ourselves reading the scripture hearing the from about god from the holy people the doubt won't go doubt will be there only after the direct realization of god all the doubts goes away pit dante chidante in a great wonderful way they are mentioning everything all doubts goes away and when there is no doubt when you see that god is there that experience sometimes some people very ordinary people so they experience something maybe they're strongly imagining but sometimes they see oh this must be the god and god is helping me faith comes of course when he sees in that way within him when he is thinking sometimes you know that is a psychological problem also the people they start imagining that is also another problem one young boy he was having some mental problem the he started seeing the lord vishnu coming and talking with him the krishna is coming that sometimes the the ganesha is coming that is not true then complete imagination as a mental weaknesses so one day he was staying in one of our asama one day at about uh night date night at the 1 30 or 2 a.m so he got up and went and knocked the the our insured swamiji's door and he said that ramiji you opened the door what happened why at this night now vishnu told i should take initiation from you the swami told you better go back and tell vishnu to tell me then i will give you the initiation now you go and sleep and let me sleep also so these are not true but just imagination one should be very careful about it consult the medical doctor take proper medicine but when the people they are practicing the japa meditation prayer we drawing the mind from the saints objects from these worldly things when the mind is slowly slowly becoming detached from the worldly objects the obviously the mind is becoming pure what is the purification of mind nothing but withdrawing the mind from the object sense objects or the worldly objects the thoughts are also becoming pure it is only god god and god and obviously one can feel the god is appearing before him and that is true and that completely changed his character our character when this this type of thing happened person changes in his behavior in everything so sudama krishna that he is mentioning as sudama krishna heart the world the infinite is the universe infinite are the incarnations he said with folded hands ah m whispered and the bhavanath said this now when the master mahashaya who is aim through bhavanatha expressed his doubt about the existence of god how i will know the god incarnate now bhagavan sirama krishna giving the reply and his reply in one sentence everything is possible for god everything is possible for god it is he who cast the spell the musician swallows the knife and take it out again he shallow stones and breaks and the musician sometimes they do sudama krishna giving the example the is it truly eating a swallowing the knife no it's a magical way he's presenting in that people think truly he is doing that it is not true but that is his capacity and the lord has created this universe from his own power which is known as maya are sometimes addressed as prakriti and that prakriti or the maya the power of god he can do anything anything what about talking about that elephant is passing through the hole of the needle everything is possible because he's all powerful friends here i was thinking that about the definition of god we find in the vishnu purana the vishnu purana it says particularly the fifth chapter 74 verse and sixth conduct he says opulence the unthinkable power capacity so much one cannot explain that's called oi sharia so some of gracia everything under his control second beriash's strength it is all it is thought power some are so intelligent they can present the thing in beautiful way they can think and solve the problems yashasya is the fame unthinkable fame shriaha beauty guyana it is knowledge barrage renunciation and this seeks if one is possessing we can consider him as the godhead what is the avatara is the god in human form god in this human form or any form but presently we are talking about bhagavan's ramakrishna god in human form talking about the sri krishna the god in human form so these are gods in human form and this they are having this power the bhagavan they are having all this power we we find another in the same the vishnu purana in the 78th verse of the same chapter chapter 5 it says and s creation and dissolution he knows everything when it will be created and when it will be dissolved everything is known to him that is called the bhagavan just someone is giving the name bhagavan or avatar they may give they like it they love the person so they are giving this type of the word that that way to respect that person that is okay but if you truly understand what is on avatar or the incarnation of god if you truly know what is bhagavan we have to think and then call someone as bhagavan we always call bhagavan sirama krishna why because it has been proved all these things have been proved in his life he knew the creation or and the dissolution of the bhutan arm of the people the being agathem gatim then wither agating appearance and deit's appearances it is possible for him only very casually he used to say narendra he is the one of the sapta rishis it is you know the in hinduism there are the three great the personalities are there the rishis the seers and they when there is nothing everything without form and with their own personality with their own purity they could retain their own identity individuality that's called sapta rishi the sevens subterm subterming seven seven great these seers one of them is narendra bhagavatam krishna saw it and he saw that he is coming down at the behast of the supreme god to help the mankind to understand the religion dharma samastha narthaya he is coming down suramar krishna knew it he knew that when he will pass and he said the moment the narendra will realize once again understand his own divine self that he is one of the sapta rishis he will leave this narendra farm and go away go back to his own abode so he knew it and so many those who have read the biography of bhagavan si ramakrishna or the gospel of sirama krishna you must have come across all these wonderful incidents you know just casually used to say is nothing but he could see and in one place he said i can see the mind of each and every individual as people see the things in a glass case almirah as we see through the glasses and can understand these are the things are kept over there like that he could see the mind the past and the present and future everything he knew and that is why when narendra was a very ordinary boy not even a graduate from the calcutta university and he said see if the keshap chandra shane is having the one percent power by which he is having so popular as a speaker all over india in those days narendra is having 18 such power and now imagine what he's going to do narendra himself felt ashamed he said i know that you love me but why you are talking like this i am such an ordinary person i didn't say sirama krishna said mother told that through me and that was proved that narendra about whom now we are reading who was arguing sitting over there in the nation and all other people around they're all making jokes and fun and arguing with him that young man when he came over here in america and in chicago in 1893 he shook the whole world and a vast varied country like india so many different languages cultures religion in one person 29 years old young man he completely changed the course of their thought can you imagine that is the spiritual power sometimes some people they doubt about the god's power spiritual power these are the proofs how a person like him narendra if you look at him he's a graduate from the university he came over here he gave a talk and speech and so many people are doing like that every year so many people coming and delivering lectures so many places but that one talk one lecture that changed the course of the psychology of the whole india in those days which was under the subjugation of the british rulers if that is not the power then what is power that that bhagavan sudama krishna saw that long back and he said like that and so many things he said so that is the reason the creation binary dissolution he knew everything bhutan agathem and gatim that sometimes when there will be appearance and dissolution what is going to happen to their life everything you knew abidiam now we say bhagavan sri krishna and this bhagavan sri krishna in the bhagavad-gita in this that 16th chapter and the fast three slokas he said all the good qualities to arjuna and then all the bad qualities to arjuna how could he say that because he knew it but he has created that the bedtime of it dumb is very clear about most of us what when we say something we read we try to understand according to our capacity understanding then we say that but when the god is saying that because he created that he knew it so bedam and abiddawar is vidya by the knowledge the knowledge that will take us out of this circle of birth and death out of this creation and who has created this world the god how through his maya through his supreme power the delusion nothing actually is there so this is another thing the vedanta will speak whatever you see is actually nothing but this moment is very difficult for us to accept it why because we are not at that stage it is not possible so that is the reason it is not possible to understand so this we can say bit of it bhagavati so when people started considering bhagavan sirama krishna as a mad person because of his behavior his talking because they were not understanding the extreme spiritual power that was manifesting through him then came a guru a lady guru and she the bhairavi brahmani it gave a challenge to all the the those who were at that in those days they were highly accepted as a spiritual people or the knowledgeable people having the knowledge of the scripture and they sat and debated and the rich man mature babu organized that he invited all those people and they were arguing quoting from the scripture how can you say that sirama krishna is having all these good qualities and one after another qualities she was quoting and quoting from the scripture and see look at it scripture described like this and sadama krishna having that these these this everything proves if the scripture has recorded all these things when the a person he shows it in a natural way not that he is just showing it just to impress people no the natural way normal way that is his characteristics how can you deny the scripture and that is the reason ramakrishna was accepted in those days as an avatar the abutara means just giving oh somebody he is no not like that you have to prove that all those great qualities are present in the life of that particular person otherwise it won't go like that then sometimes in the western world with some people when they don't understand some of the terminologies of the eastern spiritual life they use it in a different way like a fun and all that it is okay they are not understanding so the avatar they made a movie and it's okay but when a serious student of spirituality you start thinking what is this avatar the incarnation of god then he goes deep down to their lives try to understand yes they were born as if they were born as if they were born like us and they grew up in that society like any other children in the same society then slowly slowly some wonderful unique spiritual power manifested through them and hundreds and thousands of people started listening to them following them how it was possible they were not kings they were not spending money they were not giving any gift to the people and telling hey follow me nothing like that but still people followed them and not only that till now people have the belief and how this belief continue because sometimes some people lucky people they see them they can talk to them they get direct benefit from them this is kanawa so this is was conversing with bhagavan sri krishna those who were for i am giving the vagi class also those who are following they will be able to understand and those who have read it that you know and the uddhava gita that is i think the 12th chapter and 20th verse i am discussing now that the uddhava he was a friend and a disciple and a follower of bhagavan sri krishna sri krishna decided to give up his body because he saw that the whatever the mission that he was having it is complete so he decided to go away now the uddhava came to him and he said if you go away then what will happen to the righteousness the dharma so that the conversation went so slowly slowly where we will go what i should do then bhagavan sri krishna was mentioning you do do these do that so uddhava gita those who are following it they will understand and those who have read you know in one place where the sri krishna said is this twelfth chapter 20th verse he said that you better follow me you better take refuge in me now i am telling you you do this you do that everything you are doubting doubting and you are thinking it won't be possible well forget about everything just dedicate completely your mind your soul to me saranam means i am taking refuge in you and how it is possible i don't know anything i am not going to do anything i just depend on your decision it's called sharanagathi in sanskrit sharanagathi means complete self-surrender and after that i'm not going to think anything about myself what will happen to me who is going to help me and what are the future plans nothing i am going to think i am depending on you o lord that's called saranagati sometimes the people when they come they also are because uprooted for some reason social or political so economical then they they go from one place to another so they are also taking the refuge to that other society other another country like that but they cannot say anything the the country those who have accepted them they will say you better go and stay over there you have to live like this you cannot judge because you have come over there and you are taking the shelter over there like that when we are going to god and taking refuge at the feet of god and then we if we say give me these give me that no you cannot do that refugees cannot do like that so you have to completely dedicate yourself surrender yourself the lord said well if you cannot do all those things you better ekam eva shadanam yahi that is in the 16th verse of the 12th chapter i am quoting only half line the you better come to me who am who am i one mom eva now sometimes some people again those who are uh followers of christians they say look at it the krishna is the only god the only refuge you have to go to krishna only at this only will be difficult again the lord krishna is not mentioning only in the krishna form now who is this krishna god is all powerful all merciful that we have to understand the god manifested at one time as sri ramachandra another time in the hindu believes asri krishna again as bhagavan sri ramakrishna and in the modern time obviously we may doubt but ancient times we think oh it is possible in the modern times oh no this is our contemporary how it is possible you know all those places we have visited his birthplace and we doubt at a time of krishna people doubt it at the time of sri ramajandra people doubted that's why they fought with them they went against them they couldn't understand that they are god now in sudama krishna also how you will understand as we already discussed all these wonderful qualities that has been mentioned in our scripture in the purana we have to take from there and compare it yes it is possible he too is like this then only we will consider now here the uddhava who was arguing the lord the krishna said uddhava at the one point he said you better help people serve people by that way your mind will be purified when you are working against money that is a different way so sometimes volunteering why it is so important in the sikh religion they say karsheba kar means the hands with the hands you have to serve seva means serve and when you are serving in against you are not taking anything you may be a great person you may be an officer rich man but you are serving food to the people and washing their dishes cooking for them cleaning that the kitchen and all those work that you are doing called volunteering you are out of your own nobody engaged you nobody is paying for that you are doing why that is called service to god and for that your mind will be purified so without any self-interest when a person is serving your mind will be purified all the social uh the work department of the governments all governments are having one department the that they go out and they help the poor people maintain them the government projects are there and these people are working over there they are also serving the people giving them the food clothing medicine but against that they are getting the salary it is a job for them but they are not getting any spiritual benefit out of that because they're taking the money out of that but if they are doing it completely unselfish way the same work same thing will give them spiritual benefits sometimes i tell our volunteers so you people come over here and you are cleaning are in here particularly in america they clean the bathrooms even the our volunteers without any hesitations they will be cleaning the in our country people they think about of course their bathrooms are very good here so they will be cleaning the bathrooms they'll be cleaning the floor and they're washing the dishes they're cooking for the monks they are doing all those work and i tell them see you are coming out of your own and you are giving this service but and you are giving your money also sometimes they will give their donations but in exchange what you are expecting development of your spirituality how by purifying your mind why because your mind is not thinking that i am doing a job for some appreciation or money i am doing god's work this much difference in thought and that will purify your mind the moment you purify your mind niskama karma in sanskrit terminology nish kama kama means desire there is no desire only the blessings of god i do it for the happiness of god god will be happy with me so i have the faith and i know if i do this god will be happy with me with that faith i am doing and truly you will get the benefit krishna lord krishna said it to uddhava and uddhava said okay now here again when the krishna was telling but if you don't they are there then maybe if i have a doubt where i will go then ultimately krishna said okay okay okay then you surrender yourself to me and he said e come mama right now you were telling that i should go and work unselfish work now you are telling that i should surrender myself to you [Music] which shall i do what is the best way for me in reply to that in the uddhava gita bhagavan sri krishna and he was mentioning in the 20th verse 12th chapter 20th verse of the uddhava gita instead of giving the reply in a direct way he started telling him how the creation came and what is this creation he said abby in the beginning there was nothing it is in the bhagavata and bhagavata says in the beginning there was nothing in the nashville in the vedanta same thing it says there was nothing in the beginning beginning means beginning of the creation though nothing was there of course something was there that is the consciousness and that consciousness started driving why a desire came in the mind and if you read these uddhava gita is a new unique way and friends i will also tell you in this in this connection as a beautiful article has been published in our the chicago calling you know that every three months we publish the chicago calling this our ease in the electronic magazine you can read also you can pick up ah this printed copies in the last we always give introduction to the cover page in this cover page there is a the writer is mentioned a brahmacharyani she is mentioning frequency wave tsunami and beyond and then she is writing about how the word was created exactly the same thing of course she got the support from the scripture and beautiful way in english she has mentioned you can pick up this you can place order and all or download it and read from our website how the creation comes and that is the beauty of the hinduism and not that somebody just said something and we follow not like that they started thinking and went to that level how the word came i am going on talking you are listening that much but every word when it is created i am thinking and that thought it is not taking any form and it is not taking any shape is just thriving and from that slowly slowly it is coming to the bakery in the sanskrit word if you read that you will get a clear idea the boycott from it is the beginning is the bach the last is the bakari then there are another three steps then the word is coming the lord he thought and when he thought started creation sri krishna bhagavan sri krishna he is giving the reply to the uddhava then why you are asking me to surrender to yourself he could say because except me the lord the supreme lord there is nothing in this world with dhaba there is nothing not even you all these things that you see the jadabas then pandavas and all this that you have seen nothing actually is there all my creation and it's all my imagination as you imagine and see the dream i just imagine why because that is my enjoyment i'm not going to give any answer to anybody because i am all alone you see the krishna you see the partha you see the duryodhana you see the all other characters it is all mean it is everything is me in bhagavad-gita also he mentioned in that way pandavanam dhanam jaya i am the best one that you see everything anyone successful no my power is manifesting through him so this is the way the lord is explaining who is god when bhagavan sirama krishna he mentioned that everything is possible for god but that is because the god is these it is he who cast the spell in the surama krishna bhagavatam krishna mentioning it is he who cast the spell the like the magicians a devotee the brahmos say that a man should perform his worldly duties he must not renounce them now another view the friends we were discussing that the narendra the young boy and the others they were debating then a point narendra is very eager to have direct experience and that bhagavan suramar krishna his guru appreciated and he never became the disciple at that moment when the discussion is going on but suramar krishna knew that ultimately he will come to him and he was observing him trying to understand him you knew about him but he was very happy when he saw the eagerness to know the truth that is very rare and here when the ultimate question suddenly when the master mahasay he mentioned how i will know the god can do it doubt it then sirama krishna the god himself he mentioned these everything is possible for god now next comes a devotee he is mentioning the brahma's views what the brahmas they say they say man should perform his worldly duties he must not renounce them girish is mentioning yes i saw something like that in their paper that shulabha samajar they used to publish one the magazine shulava samachara was the name sulawa means easy samachara is the news the easy that you get the news and but a man cannot even finish all the works that are necessary for him in order to know god and still he speaks of worldly duties girish chandra ghosh he came to sudama krishna he is regularly listening to him and he's a very intelligent person so he understood the real meaning of it if you think that you are going to complete the worldly duties and then you will realize god about him a beautiful verse and one of our direct disciples of bhagavad-gita he mentioned in his later swami turianandaji in his letter if you have read the turiya letters of turian is purely vedantic way the views expressed in one of the letters he mentioned if someone thinks standing on the seashore or let the waves be calm then i will go and take a dip in the ocean it will be like a foolish decision like him the waves of the ocean never can stop will never stop so that is the way in this world different type of duties responsibilities work will go on coming one after another but you have to realize god within that those who wants to take it deep in the ocean they should not be afraid of those waves rather they may take the help of someone and and the guide that is available over there and can take a deep but if he waiting that the ocean will become calm someday it will be a foolish decision it is not going to be calm any time the similarly when the brahma samaji is thinking that i should complete my duties and then i will come and realize the god it is impossible duties will be there bhagavan krishna never said that you stop those duties and come no it is only for a few those who could come and that's why he used to take all the answer asking the question are you married that means you are not responsible for the family you are free well you can come directly and can practice spirituality that is the difference but those who are there like the greek chandra gosh our master mahashaya he always said be there perform your duties with all diligence with all sincerity but in a detached way that is called karma yoga karma means action yoga means union union with god through that work you can reach over there but be careful don't get attached to that so that is the way so christian is telling in a sarcastical way how it is possible in their magazine i have read in the paper i have read they're expressing these type of views sri ramakrishna smiled a little looked at aim and made a sign with his eye as if to say what he says is right girish whatever the giri says sirama krishna appreciating that and that you see how wonderfully the master mashay recorded each and everything when you are reading and if you like to meditate on that the leela dhyana lila means whatever is going on then you just close your eyes and take your mind over there and whatever we have read but just try to imagine the bhagavan's ramakrishna sitting in one place all these people all around them imagine their figure and they are discussing now girish gosh whatever he said commenting on the philosophy of the brahma samajis sirama krishna happy the grisha is truly understood and expressed in the proper way that he is expressing through his eyes looking to him and email understood that he is mentioning over here that is called depicting or painting a picture as if through the words now we should stop over here and in our next class we will begin from here well the first question is akshay bhatia he's saying how can we get rid of bad company and people who talk about worldly things akshay this is a very good question and you know this is the way this is the journey begins with this decision and in the vedanta they have seven steps in the vedanta not the yoga vedanta and in the first is the shuba icha your christian proves that you have already having that shiva the pure each other desire what is the pure desire you like to know god realize god and what you should do first you have to avoid the bad company how you can avoid the bad company mix with them if it is not possible completely to go away some new place and everywhere there will be some this type of worldly people everywhere you cannot completely go away from them in that case be with them and show apparently as if you are with them but mentally keep yourself completely separate bengali there's a beautiful song oh mind be within your yourself and don't go and mix with others that is the way you will get the success and pray to the divine mother oh mother i want the holy company please take out all these bad companies that will also help you debash is asking how to deal with a person in life who always thinks of taking revenge against others or any way to change their mindset about changing their mindset the bashes it is very difficult you can pray for them and if it is possible for the prayer of course is a very powerful if you pray oh lord please change their mindset it may be and they have their own karmapala sometimes they have to wear some something so it is going on that is the will of god but what we can do as i was just giving the answer the first question try to avoid it be you are there so you cannot just avoid that company show them apparently that you are one of them but at the same time inside the mind completely detached from them that is the technique that you have to develop that is your own so in the whole world that is the same thing goes on everywhere even in the monastic life also so many different type of people are coming so we have to handle them in a different way  karthira yo bhaita apna tams the great teaching in hindi it says for a for everyone he say oh yes yes you are very correct you are very correct but you know what is true and be there always with your own prayer that will help you thank you virendra majumdar is asking i cannot understand with my tiny brain what vidya and how they are what to do except crying and praying to shri shrima and tarpon none of it nothing like that it is like this means these worldly objects abidda means god this very simple the god is vidya true knowledge why because god is the only existing thing and what is these worldly things are all changing everything is changing mithya avidya and the car the darkness all different type of terminologies have been used so this is because in this worldly thing everything is changing look at our body we were tiny little kids and now slowly slowly we have grown up one day we will die our these wonderful body whom we love so much attached with it but it is going to die so that is when we think that i am going to survive eternally that is ignorance isn't it that is call of duty so otherwise everything that all around us we are living with them but at the same time we know it is nothing is permanent my grandfather grandmother mother father a children wife a husband everything someday we have to say goodbye to them that is so obviously we don't like it we love them but at the same time we know that is obvious and that when we don't like to accept and attach to that and then we suffer that is called a ignorant person this way you just simply say that whatever i am doing i will do but at the same time i know these are all temporary the only permanent thing is god and that is called vidya thank you rishikesh is asking is saranagati possible before realization of god this is a very good question rishikesh the moment we have 100 percent self-surrender that is realization it's true hundred percent self-surrender means you have complete faith in the existence of god then bhagavan sirama krishna said if you have complete faith then you have achieved the goal reached the goal so complete self-surrender means realization of god that's true but how we will try but for many things we will go to god and say that these are my doubts what shall i do and pray and wait then a thought strong thought will come do that thinking is god's will that way also we can do the devotees they do in that way thank you friends thank you for wonderful questions now let us conclude by chanting this [Music] [Music] [Music] namaste you
