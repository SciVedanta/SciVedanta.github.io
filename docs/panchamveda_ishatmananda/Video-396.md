[397. Panchama Veda - “Do Incarnations Of God Have Desires?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5VaUy_1Muo)

namaskar they are devotees and Friends this Wednesday evening will be starting from the Pancham of Veda the gospel of bhagavan sirama Krishna the English is a page 7 9 6. 796 is a car festival at balaram's house which is Monday July 13 1865. so let us begin with the stotra jivanam shravana mangalam srimadatam movie foreign he is now giving an the graphic description of the car Festival it is a very famous Festival yatra Festival now here it is a Monday and July 13 1885 sirama Krishna was sitting in Ballard arms drawing room with the devotees it was nine o'clock in the morning balram was going to celebrate the car Festival the following day the deity jagannath was worshiped daily at his house he had a small car which would be drawn along the baranda to celebrate the festival the master had been specially invited for the occasion that same card still it is there in that house and still every year on the ratajatra day the the same Festival they do the same way the monks will come the devotees will come they have a lot that the joy happiness and what is that that yatra the you know the Hinduism is always they will be doing something showing something and that is ritualistically at the same time there will be a philosophy at the back so who is that the shariram ratham in the upanishad it says ratha means the The Chariot the car and atmanam rathinambiti that the one who is seating the owner sitting inside that car is the Atma now this is the philosophical intellectual or we can say the very subtle meaning the how the ordinary people will understand so immediately they made it outside as a external ritualistic worship they will made it in a beautiful way sometimes it is metal sometimes it is wooden cart will be there and who is the inside the deity the God is the jagannath the literal meaning of the word the NATA means the master and jagan means the universe the master of the universe now here it is Krishna there is a long story the when the Krishna passed away and then how his relics came over there Etc so it is of course it is there and is true remembering that they will be doing and at the same time they will be having the philosophical meaning also the human body is actually the ratha is my this is the car and the Atman the Consciousness which is there inside for which we can talk we can see we can do everything that is because of that Atman so this is the two different meanings One external and internal one ritualistic another philosophical so this is the way if we understand this is the so important it is now we will come to that when bhagavan see ramakrishna will be indicating about the the preciousness of the human birth he is mentioning the sirama Krishna was invited special he has come all devotees are very happy they are assembled over there the baluram was a landlord so he could accommodate is a big house then P many people could come and this very spacious house still there in Calcutta there and they are so good people the whole generation not only the balarama the whole generation and there is a beautiful article published in the present recent the Bengali magazine and from someone related to that balaram Bose in their family srimati Rita dutta she has written the virtual article then one of there balaram bhosh was the great devotee of Sri ramakrishna but one of the year though they are very rich people but one young boy became a sannyas in afterwards and that is the story so how he he became that that's a beautiful interesting story so this whole family is a blessed family all of them are having this idea of renunciation of Purity thinking about God do they were rich though they were the landlords but they were not bogged down with the materialistic thought they were not egoistic so bhagavan SI ramakrishna liked them very much so those who are attached to this worldly life they may be educated they may be well off but they don't get the blessings of God the God loved those who are not attached I repeat the word actress not that they should be beggars they should be detached people they may be having lot of money and wonderful position in the society very high positions but they are completely free from ego and they dedicate themselves at the feet of the god and whatever the success that comes at the people when they are praising they always divert it to God which is because of you that is called purity was very pure that's why bhagavan sudama Krishna visited more than 100 times and there he used to call other people also so that they will be all they are assembling and listening to him the sudama Krishna in AIM were talking together Narayan teej Chandra baloram other devotees were in the room the master was talking about the Purna a lad of 15. he was very eager to see the boy now when we find like this the Purna is just a young boy but bhagavan sidama Krishna you are so fond of him why at this age in the when he was only a teenage boy a 15 years old boy his mind was completely dedicated to bhagavan sirama Krishna she loved bhagwan's ramakrishna she was eagerly wanted to come and listen and whenever he will be seeing bhagavan's ramakrishna listen to him he the diet young boy used to go into trans the siddhama Krishna is mentioning talking about him the master to aim well by which road will he come to see me meet each other when two people are of the same age have the same inner nature I bring them together so how the mission of the Lord now this is the time the Lord God has come in the form of bhagavan's ramakrishna and he is the avatara Incarnation of God and what is the ah the duty or the action the work of the avatar to established religion so bhagavan SRI ramakrishna is re-established a religion and what is that religion love God understand God realize God and don't gate completely attached with the worldly objects so that was the message of bhagavan Si ramakrishna and that is the the that's why he was the moment he found some of the young boys are having the pure satwaguna and they were not attached to the worldly things so obviously he used to show great love for them the other people would also know that these are the reasons the God loved people are the devotees these are the qualities not that the lot of University certificates not that lot of money not that lot of appreciation from the society to get the attention and the love and the blessings of God the only quality is completely free from the ego and when we are free from ego we are not attached to these worldly objects rather our mind goes to the higher planes which is the spirituality and God the master is talking about him the yes sir one day I was riding on a tram and he saw me from the roof of his house ran down to the street the great forward he saluted me from the street and master tears in his eyes he is having the joyful tears hearing the love and devotion of a devotee ah it is because you have helped him make the make the contact through which he will find the Supreme ideal of his life that's why he is so respectful to you anyone helping me to go to God to realize God should I should be always respectful to him or her mentioning that one doesn't act like that unless one Longs for God the pure love for God otherwise so many people will be there there are the requesting or instructing or asking the Juniors the youngsters why don't you go to Shrine why don't you go to Temple why don't you read this good book or talk to the swamis ah they sometimes oblige but they are not thankful or grateful because they don't really love God but when you look at the poor now why poor bhagavan SI ramakrishna the God himself and loving that boy so much because of these wonderful qualities he was grateful to the master Masha srima why because Master Moshe introduced him with bhagavan sirama Krishna and he understood that if I go to bhagavan's ramakrishna listen to him and follow his instructions I will realize God so he was ever grateful and when he saw the master Masha passing in a tram he came to pay homage to him Narendra the younger Noreen and Purna these three have a manly nature it is not so with bhavanath he is a womanly nature Purna is in such an exalted state that either he will very soon give up his body the body is useless after the realization of God or his inner nature will within a few days burst forth the Purna Narendra is a manly nature why because they were having the knowledge of God and the knowledge of God there is no not much emotion so there are that we will come to that discussion that three different Natures are there three different powers are there in every being particularly very manifested in the human being and three gunas they always talk about the satta Raja and Tama then all this combination when the satta is there so they love for God again in the love there is a Path of Knowledge I realize God because God is consciousness I am also Consciousness like that that I was just talking to a devotee who was visiting me today afternoon so I was telling them it is like this sometimes in our younger days when we were children we used to play with the broken pieces of the mirror and we used to have that mirror reflecting the sunlight and dazzling the eyes of the people who are coming to me or the pausing that was our play that's our game and that we used to have a lot of Joy there when the dazzling the eyes of the people with the reflection of the sunlight bitter dazzled and sometimes the dark rooms which to the direct the the broken glass in such a way the mirror the reflection of the sunlight we completely lighten the inside the dark room and we never knew what is it but we were happy in the playing sometimes we used to utilize that power to start a fire burning a piece of paper but is it that broken glass of mirror that doing it no it is the sun is the sun directly doing it no reflection so look at it the reflection has so much power and as because it is the mirror it reflects very perfectly the sunlight and people's eyes are dazzled with the light of the sun though it is not original Sun it is only reflection the whole dark room is lighted only through the reflection even we could put the the fire in in the dry leaves or the the piece of paper through reflection and the jivas are the reflected consciousness this is the pedantic conception the vedanta says who are the jivas jivas are the same Brahman Jiva brahmaika no Opera they are not separate they are not different Opera means different they are not different they are Brahma they are the consciousness foreign with great the confidence they are telling they are and in the dualistic point of view jivas are having the traits of God they can become God possible and here it says in this way and the same thing I think that when the Lord Jesus is mentioning the blessed are those who are Pure in Art but they shall see God this is the same conception vedantic conception and he was talking about the Purna he has a divine nature the threats of God it makes a person less fearful of men if you put a girl and a flowers around his neck or smear his body with the sandal paste or burn in before him he will go into samadhi for them but then he will know beyond the Shadow of Doubt that Narayan himself dwells in his body that is narayana who has assumed the body I have come to know about it is giving the indications but the of course he was telling those who are pure in heart because what is the Purity again and again we always say those who are not having the attachment for the worldly objects not that they should not leave within that it is better if they can because by that way the mind will not think about them but when you touch when you see when you are living so that will come but if you develop the pure idea that they are Temporaries they are not going to give me the permanent happiness even though you are living in that and utilizing for the maintenance of your body and the mind they are not going to bind you because you know the nature of those things and that is called purity and a few days after my first experience of the god intoxicated State addiction a lady of a Brahmin family arrived there she had many good traits no sooner was a girl and put round her neck and incest burned before her then she went into samadhi a few moments later she experienced great Bliss tears streamed from our eyes I saluted her and said mother shall I succeed yes she replied so this is the humbleness of the bhagavan sirama Krishna the lady was having that of course the samadhi but sudama Krishna the God himself who after that great the practices which he did only to teachers then he decided to give away the body then the Providence came appeared before him those who have read the biography of sirama Krishna one should read the biography of sudama Krishna you know that because without reading the biography of sirama Krishna you won't be able to understand from very as because he is depicting in that way for our teaching for our knowledge the very ordinary State he was not a rich man he was not an educated person but that so-called ordinary person and slowly developing the high spiritual values High spiritual power and he saw when he was sitting in a room inside the in the dakshination that room is still there they are preserving that room it is written over there on the wall I don't know where those who are visiting the dakshinesha whether they go and read that or not after reading the biography if you are visiting the dakshineswar you will get the benefit that is the hallowed place when you go see ramakrishna was sitting and he was thinking that he will give up the body because he has already realized God then the smoke came up from the floor and then the smoke took the form of a yogi a Rishi and announced you should live in this body but in a baba mooka the baba mukhaka baba Muke the three times the order came as they say in Sanskrit you must stay in that what is the Baba mooka you stay in this body stay in this world but you will be always connected with the Supreme Being so that was ramakrishna's life is so unique unique in the history of the spirituality I am not narrow-minded as because I am a monk of the ramakrishna order I am talking about SRI ramakrishna in that the way highly praising him no it is truth if we read the other biographies when you come to know about the others by other people they were of course good they were also the avataras but the manifestation of the power of the Supreme was completely hundred percent in bhagavan's ramakrishna and in this Modern Age it is not that it is a mythology we are just imagining not like that this ramakrishna he told those who are having those things that Purity whenever we are putting the girl and and that means giving them the idea of the spirituality immediately they and because it becomes a habit for them natural for them to withdraw the Mind from the sense objects and it goes to the inner the Supreme Being what is that meditation what is this samadhi nothing but we joined the Saints the organs from the same subjects and it goes to inside the consciousness which is there already present so our mind when goes to that consciousness and that is the reason the Hindus they have developed the Mantra diksha and ishta devatha conception is to devata means chosen Idol and Mantra diksha means a child's name of God chosen by your Guru given to you and you should go on repeating that without making any sign because it is that inside is going on repeating and you are slowly forgetting that you are a human being with flesh and bones and blood you are the Divine and you are meditating on that Supreme Lord the god which your Guru has suggested and you are visualizing that sitting on a beautiful flower and each and every place is nothing but the unique a delighted Place full of Peace joy happiness so when we go into that it is called samadhi we forget our body and of course all these worldly things the cinema Krishna is giving the indication to that I want to see Purna once more but how will it be possible for me the God is eager to see the devotee this is the beauty when a person is becoming completely free from desires it is not that he is or she is of course they want to see God but the God is also very much attracted to them God wants to see them to help them to realize it fully I want to see the Pune once more it seems he is a part is a part there's a note a part of the Divine incarnation he is a part part of the Divine incarnate how amazing not a mere particle but a part very intelligent I understand that he is very clever in his studies also therefore I have hit it right by dint of austerity a man May obtain God as his son by the roadside on the way to kamarpukur at Ranjit rise Ranjit rajas Lake bhagavati the Divine mother was born as his daughter even now people hold an annual Festival there in the month of chaitra in honor of this Divine daughter I feel very much like going there Ranjit Raha was the landlord of the part of the of that part of the country through the power of His tapusha he obtained the Divine mother as his daughter now when the power comes success comes always every success whether it is metallics this materialistic success or the spiritual success every success comes through the spiritual practices that is why when we read the mythology the Indian mythology particularly these asuras the devils the demons they also meditate meditate for a long period of time they withdraw their senses and they will be concentrating on one God and when that power of God manifests sometimes Brahma sometimes Vishnu sometimes the the the Shiva and they will be asking some power from them there it differs when you are successful at in you know austerity what you were asking because in the subconscious mind they were always having the desire to enjoy these worldly things when the divine power comes before them the opportunity comes they make the mistake by asking or get the blessings for some deep the power by which they can rule the country or enjoy the worldly objects and they go though they were getting the blessings of God even then because of their ignorance they thought that the worldly objects are very great for them they'll be ruling and they will get the king's power so they beg for that and they get the blessings but what happens they get separated from the God because they develop the ego and ultimately all their slain or punished killed destroyed Again by the divine power this is these are the stories it goes in our mythology again and again the same thing they are repeating in different lives in different situations why only to bring home the thought that this world is very temporary you should not go after it go exactly opposite towards God the bhagavan sirama Krishna is mentioning though that gentleman he was a rich man and very good person and he prayed to God and ultimately the mother Divine really came as his daughter and one day when he was working the doctor came young daughter is going on asking the father disturbing the father we can say because he was doing some office work the doctor was playing over there asking the father what is this what is that and he was she was touching this she was touching that the ultimately the father became angry and told go away from here the moment he told that the mother Divine who took that form of his daughter were waiting for this the moment he said like that way she went away I will read this this beautiful ah the the story that bhagavan's ramakrishna telling us through the power of His tapasya he obtained the Divine mother as his daughter and he was very fond of all and she too was much attached to him she hardly left his presence one day the Ranjit was engaged in the duties of his State he was very busy the girl the girl with her childlike nature was constantly uh interrupting him saying father what is this what is that Ranjit tried with sweet words to persuade her not to disturb him and said my child please leave me alone I have much work to do but the girl won't go at last absent-mindedly the father said get out of here on this pretext she left home a peddler of conscious articles was going along the road from him she took a pair of bracelets for her wrists when he asked for the price she said that he could get the money from a certain box in her house then she disappeared nobody saw her again in the meantime the partler came to the house and asked for the prize of his bracelets when she was not to be found at home her relatives began to run after looking for her Ranjit the saint people to all directions to search for her the money owned to The Peddler was found in the Box as she had indicated Ranjit was weeping bitterly when people came running to him and said that they had noticed something in the lake they all ran there and saw an arm with the council wrestlers on the wrist being waved after the water above the water a moment afterwards it disappeared even now people worship her as the Divine mother at the time of the Annual Festival to aim now naturally we'll think oh this is just the story and they are just fabricated so bhagavan sirama Krishna asking aim all this is true yes sir then the master Narendra now believes these things Buddha was born with an element of Vishnu I worshiped him mentally with bell leaves but the offering was not accepted then I worshiped him with the Tulsi leaves and the sandal paste the the that proved to be the right God reveals himself in many ways sometimes as man sometimes in the other Divine forms made of spirit one must believe in Divine forms what do you say aim it is true sir the the brahmani of kamarhati there is a gopalma sees many Visions she leaves all by herself in a lonely room in a garden on the bank of the Ganges she spends her time in Japan gopal sleeps with her and master was given that the showing them it is not imagination but fact she saw that gopal's Palms are red he walks with her she suckles him at her breast they talk to each other when Narendra heard the story he weeped formerly I too used to see many Visions but now in my static State I don't see so many I am gradually getting over my feminine nature I feel nowadays more like a man therefore I cannot and I can control my emotion I don't manifest it outwardly so much now by making the using the word feminine and the manly he wants to make the devotion and the knowledge those who are following the path of knowledge they don't bother about all these the Divine the manifestations are the the seeing God and all that so that is why the bhagavan sirama Krishna is mentioning nowadays I don't see any more the younger Noreen has the nature of a man therefore in meditation his mind completely merges in the ideal he does not show emotion nitogopal has a feminine nature therefore while he is in a spiritual mood his body becomes distorted three more well people renouncing green by Green but what he moved these youngsters are in today we are hearing that bhagavan sirama Krishna he is mentioning very clearly about the uh the youngsters that they used to come near him now that he can see our mind he can read our mind those who are coming to him it is very clear the master can understand us to those who are very free from the attachment they get all the blessings of the master through these all now at his time there are contemporary some of the young people is to come to him he is comparing but now even he is there he is the god he is eternal and when we are coming to his Temple and praying before his images or his picture same thing is happening so we must be praying to him to make our mind pure so that we can also understand we can also feel that he is looking at us talking to us near us so that should be our prayer be notes that here what is State DJ is passing through in my presence he only says his body and fixes a sways his body and fixes glance on me this is a wonderful statement that the bhagavan's ramakrishna gave that there was a young boy named DJ and when he used to come to bhagavan's ramakrishna he will be sitting before him and gazing at sudama Krishna look at looking at him and is that a drifling thing now he is saying if a man gathers his whole mind and fix it on me then indeed he achieves everything usually we do not find this type of statements of bhagavan's ramakrishna is giving the neighbor could say the me but now here he is very clear he is indicating that he is the god Supreme and that is true he gets everything this young boy DJ he realized that he understood that so instead of going to other deities other temples other forms of God now he is concentrating on bhagavan sirama Krishna usually this is very rare tham also mentioning the usually the people do not understand me the Lord the Supreme in human form they don't understand and that is why he is addressing them as Mula though they are intelligent they may be intelligent in other things but spiritually they are really a very low intellect they can't realize that God why because they don't have the idea what is spirituality mostly the people go for the mystical things when the Krishna is covering the Sun and to kill the jayadrata and all that when the krsna is lifting the uh the hill and then protecting his own people when the Krishna is showing all miracles that they like because the love power but the gopinis and the gopas they never wanted all those that is the pure love whether the God is showing the power or not the God is protecting me or not I love God so that is the purest way of The Duality and in The Path of Knowledge they find that Consciousness within themselves as we were giving the example of the glass the meter that is reflecting the sun they understand my intellect my knowledge my working capacity and all that I am having just because of the reflected consciousness now I like to get connected with the real consciousness think what it will happen just the reflected Consciousness can do so much so if I truly get the actual Consciousness then what will happen so this the way is mentioning taruk of bilgoria was going home from dakshinesha I clearly noticed that a flame like thing came out of this meaning is body and followed him when you read this page the it is really something very miraculous things that happen the young boy again who was great devotee of bhagwan's ramakrishna when he is going back to his home a flame sort of thing the spiritual Power King came out of Sri ramakrishna's person and following him a few days later Tara came back to dakshination in a state of samadhi he who dwells in this body placed his foot on tarak's chest this is bhagavan sirama Krishna this particular form that we see that is for our concentration but he is the all pervading Consciousness all powerful all merciful god well are these more youngsters like this was recommending a another young boy look at it the cinema Krishna choosing the boys though he is a devotee is an educated person but when he is judging he is judging from different point of view he is judging Mohit is very nice he came to you once or twice he is studying in our books to pass to Universe University examinations this is the difference between a spiritual person and an ordinary person the ordinary person are always judging things or a character or a personality from the point of view of the worldly successes a man who was there in the Cambridge is a great personality that they think in that way so he is telling oh he was in the two Universe he passed two exams in the University he studied a lot of book he must be a good person he must be a spiritual person so this is the difference if we notice it has nothing to do with any University whatever it may be immediately the master that may be maybe that he has passed two exams in the University but he doesn't belong to high plane the spirituality has nothing to do with the worldly success whether it is a very good looking person or he is a student of a very famous university school or is a rich person son it doesn't matter at all nothing worldly things but we the worldly people always judge from that point of view that is the mistake we always do that's why one should study the gospel of sarama Krishna and that's why I always say this the Pancham of Veda it gives us true knowledge friends we will now now we will discuss some other things and he says many troubles and Oris follow in the wake of a birth in a physical body the human body when we get and then if we get the desire to understand the spirituality and to go beyond the bondage of birth and death that is really blessed and then finally third as the Sankara acharya is mentioning the guidance of a true spiritual Lead Teacher like bhagwanamakrishna in 19 words it says foreign very difficult to get very difficult to get what a person who truly understand that God leaves in human form and God leaves everywhere he is emmanent and he is transcendent he can be informed he is also without form so these two emanate and Transcendent con who can understand gyanovan the Guyana again means the knowledge and what is the knowledge knowledge of one we should not forget that the moment we say that it is the knowledge knowledge means the conception of Oneness and what can be one consciousness and if it is consciousness then it can be pervading each and every corner every place everywhere all through is eternal it is no beginning and no end that Consciousness is having the power Dash Consciousness having the activity that Consciousness even having having the knowledge that has been transmitted as if to the individual self so that is why it is so the sudama Krishna is mentioning the master Masha as a teacher as an though he is also a very high Soul even then his Judgment of understanding a spiritual personality a completely different than sirama Krishna was impressed by a boy a young person young man so who was educated and he was also talking about spirituality so he thought this ramakrishna will appreciate no and he forgetting that he's mentioning one must be very careful why this human birth is very rare and he said one must be very careful one has to assume a human body if one cherishes the slightest desire if any desire is there immediately he has to come then a devotee is asking a question what are the desires of those who are incarnations of God so I put that does incarnation have the desires so the incarnations having desire the master smiling that means he is not giving the answer to this so when a person is asking this question that means is basic knowledge about the spirituality is very low is taking it in a very simple way he told ah I find that I have not got rid of any desires all my desires once I saw a holy man with a shawl at the rapper and I too wanted to put on one like it even now I have that desire I don't know whether I shall have to be born again for it then all are smiling The balarama Smiling then will you be born again just for a shawl or laughed the Mr Master smiling now friends say this human being and God the Incarnation now there are two strong views in the Hinduism itself one is advaitha vedanta and it says the Brahman the pure Consciousness is the only existence and nothing else and it is one without two so means negative means two there is no two and again in the same Hinduism it is there what is that vedanta same Consciousness which is all powerful manifest as ishwara so they say well when the Consciousness is consciousness and not active then what is the use of that but when that consciousness becoming ishwara becoming the powerful then only we are connected with that they are quoting from the Brahma samita a scripture it says ishara parama Krishna means image means form B graha vishesh rupee grahan then the very spatially they have taken that form they have taken not that they were forced to we the jivas we are forced to take birth because of our Karma Palma but the ishara is not like that ishara parama Krishna the Supreme Lord parama Krishna Krishna means that who is drawing the constantly the Mind towards the Supreme Being Krishna akarshana means drawing the his name his form his activities are so enchanting the people are very much attracted so Krishna so there that that particular God which is constantly attracting the pure Souls Pure Heart pure Minds Krishna and then they are mentioning as the advaitha vedanta they say what is that Consciousness this is how to explain that so they use these three words sat existence cheat knowledge Ananda is joy why they say like that by analyzing the human body analyze the human mind analyzing human character even the human also the best manifestation of the nature it is having this three no one wants to die where from this notion came look at it the vedanta is the science is not accepting anything it is judging analyzing then only they are accepting it each and every being right from the and up to the dinosaur no one wants to die where from these particular notion of mine came it must be one source and that particular Source don't like to get destroyed so sat sat means Eternal existence is one proof cheat means knowledge and it's so very manifested in the human life everything we like to know we are so curious to know what is there in the sky what is there in above the sky what are the stars are doing what are those planets are doing why can't you fly like a bird why can't we swim like a ah the fish all these we are inquiring and then slowly slowly we are developing and we say oh the scientists that developed it of course they have but where from this notion came then that that I like to know it's from the original because the original from where we have come is a source of knowledge cheat in Sanskrit c-h-i-t cheat and then Ananda the goal of every human being is nothing but Ananda though unfortunately in we do not understand that we think we should be rich we should be powerful we should be known and accepted by the society and will run after that but it is not it is only it is only joy it is the happiness so that should be the goal Ananda sat cheat Ananda why we need Ananda because our souls from where we have come Ananda so what is the source sat chit Ananda existence Eternal knowledge Eternal Bliss eternal sachidananda and that when it is taking form taking form accepting form it is not bound by any desire here the difference of a Jiva the Jiva the individual cell though it is reflected as the according to vedanta so advantages reflection but the dweta vedanta says we are separate and they take form because of their desires that's why bhagavan sirama Krishna said if you have a desire you have to take birth again now in ishwara Avatar how they work ishwara the Supreme Lord Avatar he is adventing or he is accepting a body sometimes in the form of a srirama sometimes as SRI Krishna and recently it is bhagavan SRI ramakrishna now this how they are working three power they are having and that in the the book of devotion Duality the dualistic advaitha they say sandhini sandhini means existence eternal Advantage existence eternal and the way the vedanta says the power of God sundini a Sanskrit word what is the sandhini means Eternal existence eternal and that is why we like to leave we don't like to die then some beat is a beautiful magazine that the nouns of the sarada Marts are the mission they are publishing it's a beautiful articles always there if you are interested you can subscribe to that it is called sambit the sambit means the knowledge knowledge Eternal it is the knowledge Eternal again means the Blissful Eternal Bliss eternal sandhini sambit ladini in the advaitha it is the existence eternal then knowledge Eternal and Bliss eternal and dweta it is counterpart what are they they have the karma Shakti they have the as in the modern day terminology we can say carnation condition is called Chester do we like to do that is the power the Jiva is also having the same thing do we like to do this the karma Shakti action this is a Guyana Shakti cognition we like to know the cognition that is through our thought the action thought icha Shakti is for the individual itself and that's called desire so this is the beauty of the Hinduism how they wonderfully analyze this power when it is in God it is when it comes to the individual it is karma Shakti gyaneshakti icha Shakti Shakti means power and that is in the modern terminology say Carnation cognition emotion now utilizing these three the what they have developed he gave unique lectures on these three now when one wants to start the journey in the spiritual life they must and must read this four yogas of Swami Vivekananda one is karma yoga gyana yoga dhyana yoga and bhakti yoga the beautiful four the the yogas why because we are already having those things within us we like to perform work we like to do something Karma Shakti and utilizing that power in such a way the technique if we can learn we can become completely free from the bondage of birth and death same with the gyana same with the bhakti so bhagavan sirama Krishna when he is mentioning that if there is a desire then you have to take birth but it doesn't mean that avataras have to come again no it is like the superintendent who is inside the jail he's a superintendent of that jail anytime he can go he can come out he's not bound by that but a convict who has been punished and living in that jail he cannot come out because of his karma he was put into jail behind the bars now he cannot come out unless the judge is giving the verdict favor of him just like that the jibatma individual self we have to pray we have to work we have to analyze and understand and then only we will be free from the bondage of this world thank you friends we will continue in the next Wednesday so let us see if there is any question is asking because thakur told that until realization it is not okay to say I am God then why practice is needed how it works please explain that this is a very good you know observation you know the unless and until we are developing at least some an understanding clear understanding one should not practice the advaita because it is really really very challenging when I say that I am the god okay you can understand that I must be convinced that I am not having any attraction subtle or otherwise for the worldly things if I am having the attractions for the worldly things name Fame physical comfort it is better to practice the Dubai that's why tagu said like that the oh God you are there please help me I have these weaknesses I am faltering again and again please help me the dwayito will help you that's why the Hindus they develop these two paths thank you Vijay is asking I see many kids they have bad parents do these kids also have obligations Dharma towards their bad parents can these kids consider Divine father and divine mother as their own please answer thank you and that is true that is true that is a very practical question that you have asked the if they think that the God is my father my mother oh that is wonderful but at the same time you know that as because the father and the mother though they may not be good but it doesn't mean that I also should be bad they were not good to me but as a son when I grew up when I I am having the power capacity to help why should I not in the the beautiful story of one of the famous and the personality in Bengal he wrote If you are bad does it mean that I should have to become a bad the story he mentioned that this very famous statement foreign why should I not be good just because you are bad that also one idea you can keep in mind thank you somewhere that once swamiji Swami Swami Vivekananda said marriage should not be driven by indriya so what would be the ideal way to stay can you explain as I am married recently that is the marriage marriage means you know that it is the the two souls are coming together it is good that you are thinking in this way but at the same time your partner also should think in the same way if both of you are thinking is a unique couple you can say the marriage means just not the nowadays everywhere you will see if the small little kids are also the gesturing posturing and singing those songs and hundreds and thousands are clapping including their parents are also clapping and encouraging them and putting them into the only body body and body consciousness but the body Consciousness is the very lower idea is a self-consciousness the husband and wife means you know is the man and woman of course but you are making the Human Society the father and the mother the next to God and sometimes they consider above God why because they are making the Human Society nothing bad but at the same time you should also feel as bhagavan sudama Krishna said after one or two children the husband and wife should leave like a friends both friends or brother and sister that was no that physical desire but you should perform your duties the I'll appreciate if you can pray to God both of you and you will be not only happy in your other life at the same time you will be a great help for the Human Society also your children will be blessings for the Human Society every couple should think in this way Swami Vivekananda said when a person is born out of only the physical the contact and the last only they are lectures they are low born but when a child is born through prayer that is called the higher caste so thank you very much okay friends so let us offer this pranam Mantra to thakur and then we conclude today foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] I mean
