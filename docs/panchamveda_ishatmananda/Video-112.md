G venom go vvv rhythm Cal mashaba home sabana mangalam srimad artem boo bakunin de bourr√©e dodgin ah it says in the bhagavata that when you were hearing are Eva discussing about the holy words the one who is discussing all the person who is listening received the that wonderful blessings the when a person gates after giving a lot of property in donation so like this this is the first always in the back of our gospel of the Ramakrishna in the very fast loca it describes in that way because each and every word is a holy word and each and every word is saved by the God Himself raghavan sri ramakrishna in the last time we discussed about the ceramic ISNA talking with narendra and other devotees and then he is telling to the Narendra not a very important sentence he said pure knowledge and pure love are one and the same thing the most of the time that people are fighting with this to you know in traditionally in hinduism we are having four ways for God realization one is knowledge that is gianna devotion of the karma that work and also meditation Diana so this four paths here he mentioned about the two pure knowledge and at the same time pure devotion so this is very very interesting the pure knowledge says there is only one and there can never be too and pure bhakti also says there is only one and can never be too only the terminology the name of the goal it changed his differs one they call it from one another they call it God issuer vagabond and he says the pure knowledge and pure love are one and the same thing both lead the experience to the same goal the path of love is much easier though both are leading to the same goal but the path of love is much easier then Narendra he was sitting over there after listening these he was a singer so immediately he remembered it wanted two lines of a very famous song Oh mother make me mad with thy love what need have I of knowledge or reason that is a devotional way they say I want to realize God that is the main thing I want to see the creator and the Creator to me is mother so it says the prairies in Bengali oh my the map our goal curry am I Dima bubble hoodie Oh mother make me mad with de la recoja nima young Richard II what need have I of knowledge and reason Jana and bichara are if culture nima gonna be jadi Dima boggle guru I don't know whether sharma vivek and the sang in this tune or not but this is the popular that song not in this rate to him that not in the young man he said to the master marche that he had been reading a book of hamilton who wrote alerted ignorance is the end of philosophy and the beginning of religion master to me in when he was telling like that in english the ceramic krishna couldn't understand what he is telling he wanted to know about it not in the himself explained that in bengali and master beamed with joy and said in english now narendra was explaining explaining the holding in bengali and master immediately say thank you thank you and everyone laughed at the charming way he said these words ceramic ISNA was knowing only a few English words and that he properly utilized and this time he knew that one should say thank you so he used that it was almost dark when most of the devotees including narendra took leave of the master so master Masha is giving the description of that particular time the maidservant lighted the lamp in ceramic ishness room and burned incense the evening worship began in the 12 temples of Sheba and in the shrine of Krishna and kali we can close our eyes and can imagine we can transport ourselves to that particular condition when see Ramakrishna resolve evening Dirk he is sitting meditating and incense sticks a burning like this so master Masha always gave that in a such a nice way so one can meditate on that particular condition and he say to him I have taken refuge at die feat no this time sorry he was praying to the god he was meditating then after that I am skipping a few sentences and he is telling to himself I have taken refuge at defeat o divine mother not i but thou i am the machine and thou are the operator nom nom too-hoo too-hoo and not me not me but you you and then again Oh me janta to median three and the Machine thou art the operator now in two ways Jana and buck teeth he's praying nom nom not not me not me it is the UU and at the same time I am but a machine only and you are the operator used me properly so both ways when a devotee completely surrendering to God what happens his self-confidence is their capacity to work is the air everything as it is only the ego goes away and in that place comes the faith in God you are there within me and you were working through me so naturally I'm humble Xiaomi we began the return to Calcutta after the great success in in the West in America and oh all over the world they came to know once again about India and that is because of swami vivekananda and whole India with so many millions of people forgetting all the differences of religion caste culture language the stood up and they welcomed Shami Vivekananda almost all the cities where ever he visited it were as if all people came on the street to welcome him even the Kings the students the professors they all came to celebrate and when they were shouting that glory to be waken under immediately he said no no not me it is ceramic resna then he commented you do not know that man he could make hundreds of awaken on the like mean from the dust of this road so that is the power of God and one must be humble even after the great achievement we must not forget we should not forget that it is the power of God that is working through me while the master was meditating the sum of the devotees a few devotees they gathered in his room see Ramakrishna sat down on the small couch he said to the devotees now he is giving the hint it is 1883 1886 Saddam o Krishna he knew that he won't be here in this body so he wanted to make people aware about the greatness of Narendra and also recalled so he told and afterwards we will see again and again he is repeating these words Narendra pavana Rakhal and devotees like them belong to the group of the nick de secours mr. sudhir they are already realized eternally realized Souls need to sit there they are eternally free religious practice on their part is superfluous so when you talk about this be bacon under we think that a person who was a student of the calcutta university and these and there no he was completely different all these things that we see only to teach us then we are hearing will all this time we were studying that master marsha explaining the Monday and August twentieth 1883 here Master ma che SI explaining the master to him I was meditating it occurred to me that meditation after all was nothing but the imagining of hip form in that meditation when we meditate what happens we are concentrating on a particular form and so I did not enjoy it one gets satisfaction if God reveals himself in a flash again I say to myself who is it that meditates and on whom does he meditate again the two indication one from the point of view of the devotion and from the point of view of the gaana knowledge when one is meditating his meditating on a particular object a particular form of God but he said why if there is no flash if there is no realization what is the joy of meditation the cinema Krishna was very practical type of person so that is the difference between others and ceramic ISNA cinema Krishna always stressing that one should realize God and when he is meditating on a personal God he should realize he should see visualize the living presence of that God within his heart and enjoy or otherwise he is telling and who is it that meditates on whom does he meditate this is from the point of view of the knowledge I am that Brahman then how can I meditate on whom I will meditate so that is the from the point of view of the knowledge he is telling and aim said he said you say that God himself has become everything the universe and all living beings even he who meditate is God and that is where Shami Vivekananda commented about ceramic esna is a ananta baba maya see Ramakrishna when you look at some of the avatara's or the great Souls the great spiritual teachers religious lumen luminaries we find that they're giving only one type of instructions one type of thing in Saddam addition we find together all everything this moment he is talking about the devotion another next moment he is talking about the knowledge because he was that person who traveled through all the paths realized through all the paths and that is why sharma vivek on the side onon the baba my ceramic dish nuh salam o Krishna was having innumerable ideas God is the embodiment of happiness onon the zaruba naturally his association feels the heart of the devotee with divine joy so baba bilasa is explaining over here it is good to have a trace of ego which makes it possible for a man to feel that he is the servant of God the one type of person one type of temperament mentality that I want to enjoy and they want the company of God and sometimes some people when they see that God is with them the feeding the god roaming with God playing with him talking with him there's a tremendous joy and it is true so they don't want that they themselves become God so that is why salam o Krishna still and it's better to have a little ego but what type of ego as long as a man thinks that it is he who is doing his duties is very good for him to feel that God is the master and he is God's servant when one is conscious of doing work one should stablished with establish with God the relationship observant and master and that's why he was telling that you are the doer you are making me work please do that i am the machine so he is again explaining and one particular musical instrument is there in india it's called son I'm when the Sun is playing the two two persons they do one the main one he will be playing on all the seven notes but supporting that one person goes on in the same one tone he will never change and this other one he's playing or in different tones see Ramakrishna said look at that the person who is going on playing the same tone poem like that you'll never go up and down no other music only that that is sometimes boring but when you are having playing on seven notes 77 tunes are so beautiful so why not do that have the relationship with God as a God the Father and the Son of God is the son i am the gods parents or mother father and god is my friend god is my master so many varieties of ideas are there so why don't you develop that he is inspiring both sides next he is telling him he was always reflecting on the nature of the supreme Brahman in the master master he was not a devotee type he used to practice the gana Margie so when see Ramakrishna was explaining about the devotion sitting near him he was thinking about the Brahmin the knowledge understood understanding that the master Masha didn't disclose anything but see Ramakrishna could understand the minds of others immediately he understood what that master Marcia was thinking he he mentioned to aim to master mache like the Akasha Brahman is without any modification master ma she was thinking about the Brahman and Braman has no modification it is like the second flute which is going on playing on the same tone so he is telling is the Brahman without any modification it has become manifold because of Shakti so that is the conception of the tundra without the power nothing can be done the sometimes the bead on theme that denying the existence of this universe but at the same time some of the bead on thing they say we cannot simply deny in that way because it is very much present do the exact example the game when we see the dream it becomes so real to me and when we get up we think oh my god what was happening it was so real and when I was dreaming I was not aware it was dreamed I was very much affected at touched with that whatever the activities was going on in that dream and similarly here also when I am awake there are so many varieties of activities are going on so obviously i must say or no this is also just like the dream I am affected I am feeling that is the argument of the Baron things but some say at the same time how all these things are happening even when I am dreaming that is the activities going on if it is the only Brahman there should not be any activities will be only same thing when the activity is going on even in the dream or in the ave kingston who is doing it then they say shakti the power of god because of that they have been given the name as maya mahamaya like that ceramic is dimensioned over here it has become manifold because of shakti again Brahman is like fire which itself has no color the fire appears white if you throw a white substance into it rate if you throw a rate black if you throw a black the three gunas sattva Raja and tama belong to the Shakti alone not to the brahmana brahman itself is beyond the three gunas what brahman is cannot be described it is beyond words that which remains after everything is eliminated by the Vedantic process Nathan 80 and we tease of the nature of bliss is Brahman we wonder how he's so clear about explaining at the highest pedantic knowledge cinema Krishna never started all the Scriptures but just threw his realization he's so perfect when he says like that everything goes as it is and here he find in the puter agita it mentions like this are khosham Manas amrit wah Monica tois near a Sodom nice chillum tongue be Johnny art samad is the sheer luck shanem the how you will know that you have reached to that samadhi nedovic alpa samadhi then it says these are khosham mana Sumitra mine should be like the sky infinite and free from all desires when he look at the sky we see so many clouds and other dast flowing Exeter but we know the sky is not affected by that sky is always clear vast similarly if one can make his mind like that it is so infinite there's no limit and at the same time there is no desire though maybe apparently like the clouds it is floating on the mind but it's not affecting the mind that is the condition of the needs be culpa samadhi aakasam mana sama katoa Monica to our nearest padam near ask for them without any desire nish column motionless when there is no desire there is no motion and ceramic ISNA is mentioning the same thing without knowing any Scripture that means what the scripture saved that's true why without being influenced by the scripture now when we caught we have not really at least I have not realized but I quote quote from where from the books i quote from the scriptures because some people after realization they have given this description i am taking that support of that to explain but in solano kishna saying he says from his own realization and more clearly that is the specialty of ceramic ISNA then he gives as his own speciality of the Ramakrishna very difficult thing and he will say in such a way even an ordinary person will understand how it is when we realize Brahman what happens not these not days not these not these Nathan 1880 we reach to the ultimate and what remains that he is explaining to a very wonderful example he says suppose the husband of a young girl has come to his father-in-law's house and it's and is seated in the drawing room with other young men of his age after their marriage usually it happens in our country that the husband is going to visit the in-laws house with the frames etc the girl and the frames are looking at theme through the window secretly the girls this to watch the person they're naturally the frames of the girl is also interested to see her friends do not know her as and ask her pointing to one young man is that your husband no she said Nathan not these no smiling they point to another young man and ask if he is her husband again de she answers no they repeat the question referring to a third she gives the same answer at last they point to her husband and ask is he the one she says neither years nor know but only smiles and keeps white her friends realized that he is her husband can you imagine the way and so very common in our society particularly in this society also must be like this so the example of realization of Brahman is this Brahmin all these varieties know there is the body no mind no intellect know it goes on no no Nathan Nathan Nathan then ultimately when you reach to that Brahman what happens we become completely silent and that is exactly what the scripture is explaining after the realization of the Brahman one become completely full and silent but the tremendous joy the expression in his whole person in his face the joy of realization comes out so that is the proof that he has achieved something which is really very good and that's why he is satisfied without accepting or hankering for anything of this world so that is Nathan 80 process of the pedant in they'll go negation negation negation and when they really realize Brahman they cannot say this is Brahman because the moment you say this you have to express within the frame of time space and causation and Brahman is beyond that so naturally the only expression is satisfaction joy unlimited joy and that is called Blease so see Ramakrishna giving that example one becomes silent on realizing the true nature of Brahman so that is why this gospel of ceramic ISNA which is the Pancham evader constantly in every sentence in every paragraph of the book is the knowledge knowledge and knowledge and knowledge from the God Himself we are going on reading and trying to understand so many ways but here it is ceramic ISNA after explaining these that after realizing Brahman one becomes silent then he started tasting his disciple and he is asking this question well why do I talk so much because he Ramakrishna when he worried the people are coming is to talk to them always why to give them the master Masha see mom he was highly educated person in those days he was the Amy from the calcutta university master degree and he was a sanskrit scholar he knew good very good English so master Masha at spatial capacity to understand also immediately said you talk in order to awaken the spiritual consciousness of the devotees that is true this type of people they go and mix not for appreciation not for money not for anything else but with great love when we see that someone very close to me and not understanding what is good for him are hard we go again and again and tell don't do this try this way this is the good because I have experienced that you must do this when the spiritual giants like ceramic ich nur comes they are the avatara's their main purpose of life is to establish the religion well what is the religion consciousness in the human being that they are not ordinary persons that divine divinity is already there and they have come so many lives there on the topmost now only they have to understand that they are divine and their journey will be over that that is the ultimate and the Sundays we discuss about the saga of the soul is a the soul the human soul which is thinking that it is bound bound by the desires bound by the attractions of these worldly things going on on and all then ultimately it finds that particular condition oh this is my home and that is the joy ceramic ISNA is asking why do I talk he gave the wonderful reply then master Ramakrishna now is not telling do you know the nature of a good man now he is coming down to the very general level of our level God realization realization of the Brahman that is the highest but before that one should be good a good person one of our Swami's is to tell first be a gentle man then be a monk monk is the most refined all the best qualities win it is dawning in a person then you can call him a sannyasi or a monk so that is why he is to say first be a gentleman what is that gentleman ship he knows many things but at the same time he will react only when that is really necessary otherwise not he keeps his mind calm and behaves always polite way is gentle and try to understand the feelings of others all these qualities when these qualities are there in a person then he is fit to become a monk because he has to see no difference in everything some other wah Sosa Ramakrishna stealing do you know the nature of a good man he never travel others that is the nature of a good man you will never trouble others he doesn't harass people now he say the nature of some people is such that when they go to feast they want the spatial seats a man who has true devotion to God never mix a false step never gives others trouble for nothing it is not good to leave in the company of bad people a man should stay away from them and does protect himself this is very very important as so practical we want to realize God we want to get the blessings of God we want to have all the best things in our life and ultimately we want joy happiness success in our life how it is possible and he said that you have to develop inculcate these qualities how you can do one is negative negation another is assertion all the bad qualities of a bad person you must avoid because the company in English they say a man is known by his company that's true because whatever we think and accordingly we choose our company because we feel joy in discussing about that some people they like to talk about the politics they feel the company of that type of people great friendly some people about other some people are with others but the highest type of people at that those who have understood everything that we see in this world a foley big useless very very temporary now whole America and of course the whole world they're so eager to understand and to know and to support or not support in the free of the president elections but then what four years again it will come so many of the channels that TV channels they are not showing anything else except that for last one year it is going on and all people are at go wherever you go people are all the time looking at that as if there is nothing else in this world except that but it is very very temporary and that is the reason one should avoid that know that understand that keep that in mind but don't be influenced by that and ceramic Krishna said it is not good to leave in the company of the bad people who are bad people those who always think about the body the comfort of the body they are bad people because they don't have the ideas of the infinite the only thing very limited way and they think this is the best but at the end of their life they understand or know still I have so many things to achieve again another jump another lip again for that again they get the heart again the thing it goes on on and on and that is called chakra but private thanthi it goes on in this way mastermind she say yes said the mind things far down in the company of the weekend but it is quite different with a hero as you say master mishary used to listen to ceramic is news to go to every places though not for a long time they are hardly for five or six years but wherever he see we found that the Monday August twenty next that para is coming explanation is coming Friday September seven august then September only one day he went and saw and he noted then the whole month passed we didn't get any any description of those conversation the Saddam tishner had but still we are blizzard that he noted presented and presented as it is and it was verified by the great personalities like Vivekananda mansoura Domini Debbie and all those who very much present in those scenes that has been described over here all the conversation narendra when the first book was published he is mentioning about the Narendra his comments he songs his behavior his nature nor in the didn't object hey why you were writing like this way I never taught him that or I need you never did like this much time salam Krishna neighbors say that way he never said that rather he appreciated mashallah Dominic appreciated that is the great hook when he read others scripture spiritual books there are so many different type of versions the quotations in the mouth of the great personality on the basis of whom on the life of whom the old philosophy came religion came very famous religion but if you read different persons are writing almost the same thing in a different way which is correct we do not know so that is here we find this is a book here is a look the tribute talk was written much afterwards the Buddha and all other things also but here when see Ramakrishna was alive master Mercia is to note ceramic ish needs to ask and then rectify and something correcting him no I didn't say like that human it must be dias so that is the best thing in the Cotton Belt and the gospel he mentioned like this and that Master mache said as you said that it is different with a hero even in the bad company but nothing happens with he weak person unique person means in the very advanced soul in the spiritual level it never nothing happens to him Master how is that Saddam o Krishna asking the aim the when he said like that how is that to understand whether he understood it properly or not then the immediately aim he quoted exactly from Saddam o Krishna when a fire is feeble it goes out when even a small stick is thrown into it but a blazing fire is not affected even if a plantain tree doesn't know about the plantain tree is full of water only even a plantain tree is thrown into the fire the tree itself is burnt into ashes it's a blazing fire when a person is well established in the knowledge of Brahman in the knowledge of the God whatever comes before him whatever happens whatever they may be the company he's idea is there you'll never be influenced by anything so that is the god realization and they always saying in the beginning you must go to the holy people listen from them learn from them then you prepare your mind quietly and that time you should not go on listening here and there a majority of the people in the name of religion they will go to every players and at the end of the day they're confused they remain where they where the begin from where they began so that is the reason it's nothing narrowness a very practical thing if you change the school and the teacher every time of a child you see his development but if you keep that son of them in the boy or a girl the student in a particular school under a particular care at least something that child with learn the basic you will learn so that is the reason if you are constantly changing some people say I like Ganesha and at the same time Shiva and now after reading the life of ceramic esna I have started liking Colleen and of course traditionally we're the worshipper of Krishna can I meditate in all this now think of it meditation means one point concentration and constantly if you are changing like this what happens there is no concentration the similarly ceramic ISNA is telling if you go to different places what that confusion comes of course that is not bad company but still the confusion because explanations are different so fast establish yourself then go any place and he will understand it far better way then the master he's inquiring about a gentleman who was accompanying three more the master Mercia weezy the master mature introduced his friend he's very babu babu usually the bengali people to give a respect as in hindi des AG or in English they say sir and like that they say Babu hawawa is not mentioning the Tsar name is only respecting them he has come here to pay you his respect he lost his wife long ago say Ramakrishna to hurry to gentleman he is asking what kind of work do you do Master mache giving the reply on behalf of his brain he saved nothing in particular but at home he takes good care of his parents and his brothers and sisters a grown-up gentleman is not doing anything particular but he's taking care of the family salam krishnan never liked in those days the Bengalis they called Babu culture they had a lot of money so they never engaged themselves for earning money or any social work only just passing time ceramic ISNA with a smile he never liked that you are a man and you should work engage yourself otherwise what is this life so he said how is that taking care of the mother and the father and the brother and the sister you are doing that and spending time in that way how is that then he mentioned as it is Sadie Bengali you are like elder the pumpking Carter in previously that was the tradition the women they never cut the pumpkin that they used to call the brother elder brother of the husband that they used to call them the elderly person sitting at the front room constantly smoking having no work but all the time having the ego so the days to send message to him will you please come as because is the elder brother of the husband they never called him by name and these to say Taku vertical that his elder Taku is expected bought taco ravindran article the taco actually are respected we also lovingly called ceramic ISNA as tar cool that is called highly respected the burnt occur he has a respected person what he used to do used to come and is to make this two pieces of the pumpkin that's all and no work in the whole family for the whole day and he used to be proud of that without mean one can do that so that was a funny thing Saddam o Krishna joking and he is smiling and saying is it like elder pumpkin carter you were neither a man of the world not a devotee of God he was very straight very clear why he's the master so he wants to help the person or is it or good no he never said like that that is the speciality of Saddam occasion this person is totally unknown to say Ramakrishna but when he came to see Ramakrishna as a spiritual teacher as a spiritual master he never said good continue no he was very clear to tell this is not the way you should spend your time that is the speciality of Saddam Krishna never cared for the appreciation if I say like this this gentleman may take it otherwise he may not come back to me he may talk against me in the society let him do but as a spiritual master this is my duty to make him aware and sometimes a little harsh words may awaken his nature is good nature then he said you must do these as well as that do your duties in the world and also fix your mind on the lotus feet of lord these and that you must do these and also you must do that read books of devotion the master continued but the day changed it was friday September seven eighteen eighty-three and I am reading from the 281 page of the gospel the other day I went to Calcutta as I drove along the streets in the carriage I observed everyone's attention was fixed on low things everyone was brooding over his stomach and running after nothing but food I saw only one or two with their attention fixed on their higher things with their minds turn to god this is really really for a human being people should go to earn money see I'm Krishna himself is urging this man but at the same time all attention should not be on the body why because that is the animal stage if you look at the animals and birds that is there only one object of life only one object they go on picking up the food searching for the food and going on eating eating and eating nothing else and little careful about the other dangers when I observe this the birds are sitting they want to eat something but before that after sitting they will see here and there is there anything dangerous know then if they will go and pick all the the squirrels are coming they're searching for some food and then sometimes they're watching the deers are coming food at the same time watching air and the air so only two things and nothing else in their life human being should not be like that and it says in the scripture ahora netra by my furniture semana me that pursue me nayana these are very common people like to eat like to sleep then all these like the animals Dharam aina haina pachuta semana what is that Dharma Dharma means his consciousness about his duties why had got this human body what is the goal only 2 earned it is money and little bit a comfort and one day I die living all these things over here no there may be something else and that type of tart the philosophical thought this type of philosophical questions will naturally arise a consciousness within him because it is very much there it is very much present so ultimate thing is that master Masha he said the present age has aggravated disto mccrory trying to imitate the English people have turned their attention to more luxuries the English means that time the British they were the rulers of India so ordinary people the Indians they used to imitate them there's to the thing that they will leave like that so obviously you need a lot of money what do the English think about God salam o Krishna is interested to know about that what do they think about God master Masha said they believe in a formless God immediately see am Krishna replied that is the also that is also one of our beliefs that is also one of our beliefs it is not the only believe he is not only faith is not the only philosophy one of our belief and he was telling one day I had the vision of consciousness and he is giving the description his own experience is not from the books not from quoting from the scripture his own experience friends we will see in our next class how it is ceramic ich nur realized that which has been described in bhagavad-gita and other scriptures as a realization of the brahmana the consciousness without any form and see ramakrishna's theorization in this modern the world proves that ancient realization of the rishis were true were correct thank you very much let us conclude today and again we will study the gospel of salam o Krishna which I have given the name Pancham of either in the next Tuesday there is offer about pranaam to see Ramakrishna need anjana medium on entire bum Bottineau compa Drita become by ye chaahat orem para Misha medium tamarama krishnam she'd asana mama oh my Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry you that's it sri ramakrishna our eponymous to
