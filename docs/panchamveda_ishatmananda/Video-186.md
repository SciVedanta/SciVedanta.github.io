[187: Panchama Veda 187: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna: By What Kind Of Bhakti Does One Realize God?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L10pgGuPNpQ)

good evening token handwritten top the jeevan KO BBD column Masha struggle among three madhavan's booby green and the Buddha dodging ah Salaam Tichenor was visiting a great devotee balarama's but numbers actually they were rubbish novice until today I am Krishna also this to have the ratha-yatra and the first floor of the house the small data they will be that will be decorated nicely ceramic is not participated in to that almost every year this is the only house ceramic is not visited more than 100 times and he saved Balarama that food is very pure because Balarama was a landlord but at the same time Balram was very humble some of the descriptions if you read in the Gospel though he was a landlord but there was no and at that egoistic showing and all that usually in the Calcutta Babu semaj this to call the Babu's means very another respected way it is to get them treated and all that balarama's completely humble people never could understand that he is such a rich man slum Krishna liked him very much because of his devotion and used to visit his house this time also his visiting and here Saddam vishna petitioner also was there so he is having the discourses talking with him sure sugar is asking this wonderful question by what kind of tea one realized God the session are asking ceramic Tichenor now what kind of doctor why he is asking what kind of bhakti there is a page 493 we find this the what kind of bhakti why he asked is there any difference and they're in different types of bhakti of course that is exactly he is mentioning by what kind of bhakti the different type of bhakti Sathya Raghavan see Ramakrishna I mentioned a devotee must assume towards God a particular attitude is afterwards we'll come to 957 page in the gospel itself the ceramic ish name is mentioning a devotee should assume to world God a particular attitude that there's a beautiful Smurfs Sanskrit verse local it says to me vomit are Chaput artem iva tammy matusa socata me Tammy betta trivalent amoeba to me verse album mama diva diva when we were children to use to memorize this type of verses now this da neva means the God here that one the god that is da Dada like this you were my mother you were my father Marta chapito Tommy again Danny Bob undo you are my friends socata me you are my beloved to me to be there you're my knowledge driven and amoeba you are my world David says to me verse album namadeva table you are my everything this is devotion so I have a family my father mother and the relations with the frames and at the same time whatever the world different if world mainly knowledge and other things everything is yours that is called devotion the widow did had a devotion it is impossible to realize God the complete devotion trying to beat 494 we find a ceramic dish nur is mentioning three kinds of of tea are formed according to the nature of the man shorting rajasic and tamasic disrupting of tea we know that different levels of thoughts are there here the swapped occur the salam o krishna is mentioning is it is known to God alone the swap thing he knows only garden and nothing else but it makes no outward display a man with such devotion loves privacy she will be crying he'll be praying preparing food will be decorating God but very very secretly nobody will know that apparently there is not show nothing so there is a different type of devotion the pala Ram Bush was that time and another person was there from East Bengal used to come nod Marcia his surname was not so these two call him not Marcia so this knock Marcia was also like that apparently people will never understand other they would think that is a crazy fellow Saddam Krishna when he was very very sick in Kashi poor Nam are shaking then Saddam pitched in at all please cook some food for him and bring it to me then they cook the food for the knock Marcia he was hungry but never expressed salami she could understand that he needs some food and he asks the devotees to bring that food that time you know the ceramic ISNA was not in a condition to take the solid food he was taking only liquid food only for not Marcia he took a little from that food and ate why you know he said if it is not Prashad he won't eat the type this type of devotion complete devotion you will never do anything else so this is very very dear Shattuck devotion not disturbing others no I don't take these I don't do that the sometimes some people will go and they make a mess the whole thing I cannot sit on these I cannot eat on that I don't take this I talk like this they will be you be if they are visiting your house if you will feel when this man is going on because different type of person they're showing that I'm a holy man but these shocked people people are not like that but the devotion is one point only Prashad ability so Saddam didn't make that Prashad then they took another incident of that man the shot ticker devotion he went to Ma Salamone Devi and someone not understanding the intensity of the devotion gave some pressure on paper thus a type of plate is there they made it from the lips and they made that plate and they gave it to him he started it in the plate also because mother touched this plate how can I throw it that is the idea sometimes some people they'll be printing their devotees they don't be printing taco marks images for toward goddess Kali Durga on a piece of paper and they will distribute and the people will take and they will throw it is lying on that and people walking on that and they don't mind so just a piece of paper that given that it's okay but the devotee will never do that that is the reason that balloon part again and again send the circular to our devotees and our astronauts do not bring the picture of Takahashi ammiji on those things may be the handouts that people are going to throw here and there human it must be very very respectfully check because the devotion nothing else so this type of devotion this is not Marcia this butter and bush they were tactical devotee susan rama rama krishna and Swami Rama Krishna knology he was that type of devotee preeminent dig' that type of devotee when they are offering the food to Taku they'll be coming and checking even the bananas if when you peel the banana you will find there's a little little trace that containing that banana mass inside so when you peel the looks very tiny everything people usually eat along with that but Criminology will be very careful to remove that too because that mean and sometimes go and create problem in the tongue so taco should not have that the tightest of me when you are cooking when you are offering when you were doing anything I remember that one Swami was there he passed away long back and I was bringing see Ramakrishna's image in the balloon temple and after that usually we wash it and with the soap and a magnet I was that and in water also and hang it properly as to see when he was about to leave session ami called me if Abby was that Club nine years from meeting let me change he again to eat out and we went to that that water flowing water the tab and I found that still the some of the remnants of that soap is coming out you see how dark you will feel if you are not dealing it properly the smell of the soap will be there takuna doesn't like it it is not that it is just the image it is your devotion I learnt it so much from there stood from him the love when he will go residence he made only stone image but when he is entering the tackle very carefully and as if he will see the Tucker is meditating and nod then he won't disturbed like that just like a living person that is the way it's called a shock digger devotion the ceramic history is mentioning is a stock ticker devotion this is a love Jamie love no show in it and this love only knows God and nothing else and naturally you are completely engrossed and attentive to see that nothing should disturb my master that is the way one should behave and a man with Rajat Gupta feels like making a display of his devotion before others the rajasic party that they'll be all displaying they'll be having the marks and the cover and these and that's called Raja sympathy the people will know and there were so many another the Rudraksha mala also they'll be putting and in hand and so on all these things will be there to display that he's a great devotee that that's why I see Rama Krishnan even like that but he liked two types of bhakti the third one he is praising very much first is Swati cover the second is Raja chicken but rather she didn't like that way but policies this is Thomas a cup of tea is the devotee with Thomas occur bhakti shouts like a madman Jara Jara go boom victory to Kali and he shouting as if is going to rob the dead wing and he's completely like a man and he's Ramakrishna is telling that God I have altered once the name of Kali and Durga I have altered once the name of Rama can there be any scene in me that is tamashii character he doesn't bother about anything with complete faith and strong faith and he says the scenes I have taken the name of God wants then one there's a story that goes in this way there's a abundant as we call the religious teacher was there and a group of people came to him to get at his blessings she was absent when his son was there with a young boy and he don't know I can give you that what father usually says I will tell you that this is looking and he gave he the green you go out take the name Rama Rama Rama jerilyn then it will be alright usually his father says like that he heard it so he gave that mantra to those people then they lived in the afternoon when the father returned then he told his father father a group of people came he were not there but I give them that televised what advice you gave he said I told them Rama Rama Rama Rama Rama father give a slap in his face you are my son living with me till now you do that faith in God once uttering the name of Rama is sufficient why three times that means you are not having the faith and that is called this Dhamma sukha lakhtin I have uttered the name of God how come by saying there sadhana Tichenor a man should have such fiery fate as to be able to say I have ordered the name of God how can I be a sinner imagine a man repeating the name of hurry dl9 at the same time saying that he is a sinner that we see is not having effect ramakrishna still at the same time is asking us to take the name of God again and again but then while describing the different type of failed to believe that he is stealing you must have the faith I have taken the name of God there cannot be anything that is the main idea that's right selamat each needs to say whenever you are going out just to repeat it tries to regard the god oh god and Shiva which is trident will protect you that is the thing I have did in the name of God I still can going out now it is the responsibility of the Shiva to protect me if he is not doing it is his business he's failing in it that is the faith complete faith so this is the way one should have that's why I was watching a movie there one small group of soldiers and they are going to face a huge number of soldiers the opponent and some was telling do you think it will be worthy to fight them the White House we have God with us see we are having the Holy Cross within our hand we can do it because we are not ordinary people which is soldiers of God 1 is equal to thousand the field Shami vivekananda again and again he said you why you are thinking that we are weak we have the children of God even if necessary we can choose the stars in the sky tremendous feat to that faith that I am the son of God I'm the daughter of God we are the children of God why should I be so weak that is the R is ramakrishna is telling and hastily avenging a man repeating the name of God day and night at the same time saying that is a sinner then Saddam o Krishna in an exalted mode in ecstasy he stood up and started singing if only I can pass away repeating the gods name how canst thou then opposite one we told from me deliverance Richard though I may be Derka Derka Derka Poli Maggiore mori are clearing 18 e na paro Kemeny daca Java Kishan career at the time of death I have taken the name of Durga as we are going out we are taking the name of Derka Derka Derka similarly at the time of day typical to dad then obviously you come surely will come the bound to come to save me because I have taken your name so that is the face Ramakrishna is singing bundi Shahada was weeping so this we find and this type of tea we find in the Narada he is mentioning devotion is the easiest way to realize God devotion is the easiest way to realize God this is very interesting Narada active shooter if you read his only 8086 verses are there and they had this Narada is a great devotee he never knew anything except the God all through his life he was there and his historical character this not other it is ously his life is also there and devotion is the easiest way to realize God he says and then he says what is the ocean but his devotion saw to us mean piranha prema Rupa is the second aphorism of the norther of the shooter second Japanese mrs. Shah twas mean piranha prema Rupa it is supreme love towards that this is not an agenda that that means that truth the consciousness whom we call God whom you call father mother this is the supreme law now another question comes she could say this is actually intense love is a very different a problem known is his supreme Allah SAS - mean Parimal remains supreme why he mentioned his supreme because of all other loves all other types of love occurred of self-centered selfish even the mother loving the son still the selfishness is there man my son should be successful then that I can talk about my son my son will take care of me afterwards all this dream surrounding the Sun is there in the hearts of the parents and whatever you're doing everything at the back of it some selfishness is there but we take the the fruits two are the sweets or some offering to God and it presumptive God please do these two please do that something is there but when these nothing is there I love it that song that is called supreme love and Varna Primo the Primeau prima the supreme love that is in this in the inspired talks Shami began the deliverer you must read that inspired talks because Vivekananda those few days he was painting in the Thousand Island Park near the New York still if you have not visited the Thousand Island Park you might visit that place this is a very holy place of course I think you should go to the website of the new society there and Vivekananda Vedanta society I think they are maintaining that only hardly one month or two months only they keep it open the timing is there and all that whatever you can go and see that still the same village is remaining as teas when we began on the visited at the same shop where Vivekananda sat and to tea and it was all that saying we visited that here so wonderful and the house also a little bit up but the maintenance so nicely and dear vivekananda took only a few devotees chosen and very he picked up some devotees and then with Davis failed some days and give them the best of the knowledge dear one day he was explaining this verse this aphorism of the narrative of the Shudra and she was explaining we are mad for so many things but is there anyone who is mad for God here man means forgetting everything except God so that is madness usually madness means a not normal way we are all the time thinking but he's very very special time he knows everything understand everything he does everything all his duties but at the same time within his mind only one thought that goes on God God and God before sleeping before eating people moving before talking constantly he feels the presence of God that is completely hundred-person the mind is devoted there what does it mean this supreme love for God means for faith that there is only God and nothing else satis mean Parimal prema Rupa this Varma this supreme means these form fate complete failed after realization the field there is only garden nothing else in this universe and that is called param of prema rupa then see ramakrishna he was mentioning about that and when he was singing in that way explaining this such other one did you know he was actually a bit nothing and he reads annex expands he explains Vedanta between he came to see Ramakrishna he is singing and at the same time he is crying but did shatter was weeping a man crying before everyone because his heart is touching the love of God that is very special when you go and see it and discuss and only just go on arguing and then some of the information some of the terminologies we go on and then we are satisfied though we have talked about the spirituality then what about your own heart do you really feel that this is very important the way you are feeling for God and all the time thinking the God days after days Greenaway every step I am going towards the grave I don't know when I have to leave this world but without knowing you should I have to leave it so this is an opportunity that you gave me this human birth and got a whole opportunity I got the Guru I got the philosophy and then only you have not given me the field that I see there is only God and nothing else am I so wretched so this way if we go and pray then only Serano Krishna is telling he will surely realize God in one place he is mentioning he who is crying to God and praying for the region he will get it she went into an ecstatic mood the master went into an ecstatic mood because the bushnell which are another great singer he was not only ordinary singer but sadhana he used to sing see that this is the difference when a singer is singing it pleases but visas the mind in a different way but when you say Dada is singing it touches your heart open up the emotion and the devotion and you feel that this world is nothing this so temporary and you feel that you were losing something great in this world this man was going on singing or tongue always repeat the name of mother to God and master after listening that this song went into ecstatic mood and that is the song is not a sound but the prayer when the God is revealing through those words that is called the prayer so this master then afterwards cinema Krishna slowly slowly came down to consciousness and pointing to the pertain Shahada Ford it was in a great mood the cinema Krishna wants to bring them out mind down and again he was asking he was asking them aim the master MA said he was waiting to prod him that means ask some questions then one devotee ROM they are he is asking the question master Marshall when recording he is giving the names of those people mentioning what happened who asked the question what was the answer the historicity of this thing the time-space and all the people and here the Ram Dayal he is asking to the pandita shada the scripture speak up Brahmans form as a projection of mind what is it that projection that projects sorry who is he that projects the citruses putana on important brahmana Rupa Kalpana the Brahman is all-pervading consciousness but the same Brahman is taking therefore different forms why to help the devotees how it is helping the devotees because devotees when it is getting a form a name and a form then they can concentrate do God will guard or govern I am repeating the name of Durga I imagine the goddess Durga and so powerful all pervading this is my mother and she so compassionate and she's protecting me from all the bad thoughts the bad deeds she is protecting that way I have seen but we is not there just you are taking the name or there is no name just thinking about the God how do you think the long back in under man I asked this to a Muslim in demand she was a scholar I told tell me frankly how you meditate without the form is it possible in the beginning of your spiritual life you need this as in the beginning of our student life we need the book we need the pictures we need there are different type of things to learn and slowly slowly we know how to handle all this and only one indication and I know so that is the ultimate knowledge with the beginning if you see that the children won't be able to understand so when you will beginning our spiritual life don't you think that you need something before new to meditate he agreed Julius without that actually it is all dried and slowly we become just hypocrisy we are closing our eyes as if we are meditating and thinking and thinking nothing and as because we can't withdraw our minds from the worldly thoughts what are the things and it is not getting purified futility means what you have to withdraw the mind from the worldly things and there is no other thing where mine can go so automatically when I am meditating when I am sitting closing my eyes a whole different type of worldly thoughts will be there but I am closing my eyes and thinking sometimes when you sleep the the sleeve has not come and you are in that almost like a slumber different type of thoughts are coming your closed eyes lying down you're not moving the people are thinking that you are sleeping but you are not you are going on thinking thinking in such a deep fashion deep way that you are not a moving does it mean that you are sleeping no you're awake the same way when you are meditating we are sitting quietly closed eyes but going on thinking different things when we can we draw the minds from those saints objects and then concentrate on one point thing that is communication that is concentration and what happens then if you are concentrating on God who is the source of joy and peace and happiness after even a minute if you can concentrate on that you will feel great joy a satisfaction that will give you the indication you were meditating your meditation is successful if that is not there you just tried but you couldn't do the meditation that is why Saddam efficient is telling that the scripture is telling that you know here the Rambler is asking the what about the images who is throwing the images which projecting the image Brahman is consciousness all-pervading Brahman is projecting the images the question is who is projecting the images here upon did see it is Brahman itself that does so it is a projection of a man's mind the point it is a true person is telling now the Brahman himself is doing because except Brahman there is nothing when except Brahman there is nothing if there is anything projection his only premonitory who else we do so that is the reason he says like this the drama but then Pratap another devotee who was also present why does Brahman predict the fall he is asking this question now ceramic Krishna entering into the conversation and he is telling you ask her why Brahman doesn't act in consultation with others it is from months pleasure Brahman is self we lead why should we try to know the reason for drummers acting this way of that this ambition is very very categorically asking us not to unnecessarily wasting the energy and the time just enquiring about all this you have gone to the orchard to eat mangoes eat the mangoes what is the good of calculating how many trees there there are in the archer how many thousands of branches and how many millions of leaves one cannot realize truth but futile arguments and reasoning this is very important if we truly try to understand God then all this futile the conversation and the argument we should not enter into one thing is very simple if I have to take it bad whatever it may be the Buddhists are the Giants are the Christians of the Muslim or Hindu you have to accept someone as a supreme and then to accept the teachings of that and without any question and then follow that sincerely that is exactly what it says so here it says that in the other day this last weekend I went to the st. Petersburg and in the Tampa and the Asuma the it was the topic was the different paths Harmonia paths the harmony of paths why this question is coming I am travelling in my own way that's all why it is a harmony is necessary it's very much nice rava bansemer krishna himself didi you know why because a Suffolk ego is all the time playing I am following the path of guiana and that is the supreme and the best for others that they are working or the devotion or the meditation okay I just look at them and go be there sitting over there and closing his eyes literally so like that we are all the time thinking that is not alright moreover this is the only endemic the Hindus there are four paths but others the Christianity they are going to the church once in a week and with the Padres and listening and chanting and then afterwards they are coming out and we are nosey they think that they will see God by that way never or they are going to the the mosque and kneeling down getting out of the hole that they will do we are will laugh at them so by that is what happens ego is playing I am thinking myself that I am correct that ego and as long as the ego is there no God because ego he is connected with this world Jayaram Thani calm calm means the ego everything comes from the ego so why the harmony of all pairs some if we become the declared over here in Chicago not only that a toleration but we accept all paths are true and that is true Hinduism Shama Vivekananda he wrote a readout on Hinduism what is this Hinduism we not only tolerated the paths of others we accept that as true why there is to ego is a God's will God want that he should come through this way he should come to that way they should come through that way Who am I to judge it I am humble God has given me this attitude that I am bechara I am discriminating and slowly slowly feeling that everything is nothing but the consciousness including my body my mind my age and everything is nothing but that consciousness and I am blessed I will join that another one he says this is when the meda boy was singing that made it appear eternal aldosterone occurring almost at that time this they were discovering that Columbus was discovering America now when the Columbus was discovering America and that time in India a lady a queen she was realizing God can you imagine so that that time she is singing me to get that allowed to stroll and Kui I am only having the glittery love I'm only having that God and no second world that is called forever prema Rupa that is exactly what see ramakrishna is mentioning to show that holy why you are going on counting how many gods are there who has projected them who are now go on mentioning the writing the least and researching on that win the form of Goddess Kali came in the form of Durga ki and researching and you are becoming old and nothing is there and ultimately lot of books no realization if they see one donkey used to carry the load full that very costly things used to carry that all through his life he carried that but never understood what he is getting the same way we are going on researching on Sony different we are thinking we are all rationalist agree we are approaching then ultimately what that being exactly see Ramakrishna mentioning again and again so why one cannot reverse truth by futile arguments and reason so naturally the question pop up in our mind the other day when I was telling this thing to one of my disciples a young man he immediately same rehearsed does it mean that we should not argue heroes Pratap he immediately truly reason anymore then he's asking the same question recently that boy asked me this question and long back someone named Pratap was asking the question to surround Krishna what is his answer master said I am asking you not to indulge in futile reasoning but reason by all means about the real and the unreal about what is permanent and what is temporary you must reason when you are overcome by lost anger or grief what type of the emotion that is overcoming me that time it should reason Who am I why this type of thoughts are coming in my mind why I am behaving in peculiar so these are the reason you must do without that reason you cannot move so this cinema Krishna's advises one must be very very immediately the Shoshana Turkish Romani is that the learned person he is telling this is different different type of reasoning we risk our reasoning based on discrimination reasoning based on discrimination ceramic isne is accepting that supporting that history yes discrimination between real and the unreal that reasoning what you do that discrimination want you to constantly one should do all sat in silence see how the things that the mind is going up all the time ceramic is nur when he was singing the song and bringing the tremendous faith in the minds of the people and then suddenly he is bringing it down and arguing again he's giving this story because the mind is not ready he could take the mind into that supreme condition and people could be very very happy he used to do that why because he's an avatar oh he came to establish the religion and religion is nothing but the realization and realization of joy great joy without the support of the worldly things a realization of joy we have the support of any worldly things how is to do is to go to different groups to sing the kitten those who have break the life of ceramic Rashmi you know used to go into and thousands of which never stairs to come and this to sing the song Salaam o Krishna will go and join in different groups small small groups is to sing and cinema Krishna will run into that and start singing and dancing and because of that the wonderful atmosphere he is to create all around people hundreds of things all of them this to dance and sing as some of them this to go in trances some of them this to fend down and then afterwards rounders are slowly come down why he did like that because the people at least for some time some moment some day we feel this truly joy great joy during the kitten and just by that Quintana per channel and this is an under but only in the name of God it is not be shy on under when you go and purchase it something which I like or eat something or meet someone or visit some place we get joy it's okay but at the same time that is called be Shia ananda it's only for you know the ayahs and advertisement is come in the indian newspaper that you can go and spain in the King's palaces now they are opening up the one day we'll go and spin speciality what speciality that you have to climb through steps to climb on the bailed on which even sleep you can imagine how the height of the break and you have to pay what only for one night seven thousand five hundred rupees that many cans you say oh seven thousand is nothing acharya and then what that you have to climb only the Kings is to climb all other people the light on the floor on the low paid the Kings and actually other high so that is the beauty and you have to Spain that me and then you go be shy on another that is called that we share the objects and we enjoy and the schwa me over there he took me to a place it's not ice creams from different fruits they extract that in the special type he told me the name I have forgotten that is how people are coming they are taking it there laughing singing eating like the testing which I Ananda but it is virgin and now we are discussing about ceramic Asians words that was gospel of Sri Ramakrishna and some people one there listening there is so happy understanding one after another all the ignorances are going away and I can understand what this is the thing I must do that is also the Ananda and sometimes I am going deep into the meditation and great joy is coming because of the song that I am singing this phenomena and then finally is brahmana and when we realize that Brahman the God the all-pervading consciousness who is nothing but the joy the peace the happiness and I'm marching to that what will happen I will also be part of joy I will join myself and that joy is completely different not depending on any object there is a source of joy so ceramic isne is talking and he's telling I am NOT asking you not to discriminate you must discriminate you must reason but reasoning for what real and unreal the decisions are all unreal so naturally the master years discriminate between real and unreal and front it's a reasoning based on discrimination and the master to shada she was they were going on singing I'm not reading the whole part the grades they were going on discussing about that ended the singing and the shelter was very very happy the salami business telling deceased call a Jolanda when you were doing on singing the name of God and getting a great joy so what is the mantra mantra is reputation of the holy name of God but how long can I repeat that this is not a time limit why because the more and more and more you get the joy in repeating the name there is no time limit constantly we are going on repeating the name of God and when you are repeating the name of God you are also at the same time remembering the qualities of the God and when you are remembering the qualities of God and all these wonderful behaviors that gives you great joy within you are closing your eyes you are taking the name of God and remembering those things a great joy is coming and after that you get up your roaming moving at the same time doing the taking the name of joy descalvado under the I was reading a wonderful the piece of information I got the ceramic is none when he was almost in the verge of his death he was ready to give up his body that time one day he told see I saw so many fair-skinned people are visiting me hundreds of them harvesting and they were a different type of dress and they eat through spoon I need to wear that dress and heating drink spoon in that condition so they purchased a trouser for Salam krishna Solanki Shippuden the trouser and then he some people they hold him so he said and the table was given before him and a plate like the European fashion food was given and he took in the spoon and the writer after was mentioning master the teacher showed his disciple Narendra show me be vacant under that there is nothing in the trays or the style of eating food this has nothing to do with religion because you know that traditionally Hindus particularly monks they all is afraid they shall we give up the giver that has been given to me by the my guru so that his beloved Vivekananda should not have any doubt about it the trees and the food habit and the company nothing is only the purity of thought that's why not in the Vivekananda when he came to Europe without hesitation he changed the Guru and put on the European dress now of course many of them they are using it has nothing to do with the the trace so that is the reasons see the master how he's doing it and that time he asked only one person wish to serve him the great devotee his own disciple the Ramakrishnan and the G Hashima he asked him to go down because no no one should be there did he call Narendra not and he told see you and we are not different but in this life I was playing as a guru and you are playing as a shisha as a disciple now you will play as shri ramakrishna and i am giving all the time earth to you i am now completely empty and you are Raja Raja sure he'll be the supreme why because through you that divine power will work the ceramic crystal gave all his power to Shani Vivekananda and vivekanandan son Krishna are not at all different so these are the think that you should understand and what is that the sedimentation of game I should give you the tradition as the father gives each treasure to his children what is the treasure purity and unselfishness love purity unselfishness these are the results of Raghavan's young that he gave to Shama Vivekananda she carried it and spread it all over and that's why still this human society is working all have not become behaving that animals still the love is there sympathy is there services are there the this is called religion and so these thoughts are there only we have to connect with that particular level of thoughts the dirty Saddam additional is telling him this is called pajeon Ananda through worship devotee received the grace of God and then his vision then then they enjoy brahmananda the police a brahmana to step to Ramakrishna stealing when the beginning if we jump to the brahmana that we won't reach there is not possible that is the reason he is telling through worship devotees receive grace of God then his region so the first is with image with devotion through the path of devotion of team then they enjoy brahmananda then afterwards they march into that enjoying to brahmananda the Bliss of Brahman then desponding is humbly asking a question what kind of yearning gives one this blissful state of mind these answers to this love this question this enquiry of cinema Krishna we will discuss in our next class this day this particular we are discussing that he was asking ceremony Sheena by what kind of tea does one realize God and next class we will discuss what kind of yearning gives one this blissful state of mind need an Jenna Oh but da gamba Drita become we Ayesha Adam but ameesha medium - ah Krishna asana shun the hurdy you that's earth sri ramakrishna our eponymous to
