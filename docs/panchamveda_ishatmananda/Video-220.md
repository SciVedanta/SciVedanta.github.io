[221: Panchama Veda 221: Bhakti Yoga Is The Right Path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UoKM__w_tpE)

good evening tava cotton written dr. jeevan KO be rewritten Calma shavon shavon among golems Swimathon booby grunty who lead Arjuna in our last discussion on the 8th that is also the Tuesday we have briefly discussed about the Mukti from the pedantic point of view the discussion that Raghavan Ramakrishna was having with the devotees that it has been recorded on October 2nd 1884 so from that record in finds Ramakrishna he is now telling according to Narada the devotee should sing the name and glories of God the path of karma is not the right one for the Kali Yuga bhakti-yoga is the right path to your duties in the world as long as you need them to reap the fruit of the actions of your past lives but you must develop love for God and be passionately attached to him the singing of the name and glories of God destroys the effect of past action this a wonderful real relevancy Ramakrishna he is describing the path of devotion to sometimes some people the thing the path of devotion means only rituals here this is very clear as many times we are repeating the name of God with sincerity with love with attachment to God and our past Karma's slowly it is why he know that is all clean because God so this he mentioned over here according to Narada he mentioned the name the Narada who is the great exponent of the of T so that Narada he said the name of the glories of God sing the name and the glories of God it goes together when we are singing not the time you have to sing just you are repeating the name of God the people they take mantra diksha and they repeat the mantra but the mantra when they're pronouncing it should eat the joy as if you are singing so that is the main meaning the singing the name of God and glory what is the glory that God is the combination of so many wonderful good qualities the qualities of God he is renowned sir he's completely fearless he is full of love compassion and so many many good qualities that we see the most of you know that a 16 chapter of the bhagavad-gita the 26 good qualities that has been listed over there all that we see in present in the in God so that is why when we are thinking in that way all those qualities also slowly slowly manifesting within us and we can proceed towards God how because our past Karma and removed what are the past Karma's because of the Karma which is generating because of the desire we take this human birth and different birds first is the desire then the action and to perform the action we need a body and the mind so this circuit goes on so the desire pops up and then to fulfill the desire we need an instrument so comes the body and the mind according to the desire to fulfill the desire so the same way sometimes the that life is born as an animal maybe a lion a tiger and these and that why because the desire is like that so that particular body and mind will get the satisfaction otherwise human body and mind can't give that satisfaction and at the human body and mind also sometimes the desires are so so slowly slowly the human form he works as a Devere like that so this is the desire that those desire will slowly become weak and goes away why taking the holy name of God repeating the holy name of God and instantly remembering the glories of God so that is the effect now Bhagwan see Ramakrishna what is the doctor yogi bhakti-yoga now the question comes in the Bhagavata he is also a yogi he is also trying to get attached and through the path of devotion supporti the bhakti yogi or the bhakta Gupta means one who is trying to God and to get liberation in that way that United with God otherwise this unification is necessary why because we are separate as if separate from the operating point of view we are not we are only thinking that we are separate but the waiting point of view we are separate whatever it may be that one proves that there is a source original and from that a separation has come in whatever way maybe that is a complete separation and maybe it is just imaginary separation that this separation slowly and we had to go back to the source because that is the ultimate joy ultimate that Liberty so this we have to go one who is trying to going back through devotion call bhakti yogi artefact earth when the Parvati said is asking this question who is a bhakti yogi in one whose interest has been awakened to know God just by hearing about God so who can be saved as a prokta anyone whose interest has increased to know God to realize God just by hearing the name of God is above the dr. yogi this is a bhakta are the bhakti yogi Salam tishnandrew he is also telling we were will drive to know God sincerely will surely realized God he stress on the world surely whoever is trying to realize God sincerely this is the word sincerely but most of the time we are going to God to try to know God worshipping God just out of curiosity out of tradition out of the different practices as because all around people are they are doing so a year of surgery but Salaam Trishna say sincerely if you he who is truly a hardness to know God will surely see him he says see him Takeda Kajol you can see him see God in person you can talk to God so this is the assurances of Raghavan see Ramakrishna we need yearning to know God but what is bhakti now I will before going to all the other conversations of Raghavan's Ramakrishna I like to give you the some of the ideas from narada bhakti sutra in the narada bhakti sutra and he has given the different views different definitions of different great sages about body so what is that bhakti it's a very fast that SAR - main paran√° river power the very first verse of the Narada bhakti Sutra very first verse saw this mean paramah highest prema rumba it says bhakti or the devotion means supreme love towards him and so it means he or she or it Oh God it may be so not other is not giving any form it'll be eat it it may be he it may be she so that full gamut is now open it's according to you - sometimes some people that be worshipping God as father some people God as mother some people God as these and dad the tradition of the ancient people this to worship God in the nature whatever it may be but oprima but this is the main thing he is the highest form of love again and again I say what is that God God is nothing but two qualities love and unselfishness in the narrative of tissue to have the very first local he is giving the introduction starting the whole scripture by saying that is nothing but love para ma bream aruba supreme love the Venice is supreme that means there is something which is also not supreme so we will have little discussion over here bhagavata it says through the practice of devotion reaches the state supreme devotion the bhagavata says by practicing the devotion one reaches the position of supreme devotion this is slowly slaughtered Swami Vivekananda he say we take everything we never say that we are traveling from the ignorance to knowledge no lower truth to higher truth lower truth to higher truth when we were children used to play and particularly in the Shivratri we saw that the elderly people are worshipping Shiva we children also used to have just just play we never knew what is devotion but will be also having a little but then pouring milk and what imitating all the senior people whatever duty interested to play and nothing else but from the early start and very ordinary people they'll be worshipping a tree maybe a cow maybe a river maybe a stone just something from there they start and slowly slowly they cannot restrain themselves to visit that particular place and thing which he or she has considered as God a curricular they will go clean he'd offer some fruits burn some incense sticks and slowly slowly devotion and that is called ritualistic devotion so gonna come the in suspects called goning of thee there's a lower type of devotion but we do that you cannot think of reaching to the higher devotion so you cannot in one day you cannot simply go on Tillich taking the name of God and just behave like the chaitanya mahaprabhu it cannot so chaitanya mahaprabhu the moment he will hear the name of krishna he will go into trance because immediately his mind is going and mixing with the supreme consciousness which is krishna to him so that was completely different it's called form of prema rupa parama brain highest so that what is the beginning everything has a beginning so the first small step is rituals is very very important this rituals and when we are doing the rituals we are very careful that we are not having the nails and we when the flower we are offering we must be very careful that the flower is completely clean no insects there inside the flower when you are offering the fruits we must see that it is properly nicely washed and also as it should be offered to a person to eat it should arranged in that way sometimes just the coconut we offer to God how the God only did do you expect him that he will break it and then read it that means we are just doing that but we don't have it really love for God when you are giving the offering means it should be proper now we are offering the sweets without knowing that whether it is really good taste or not whether in a condition and good condition or not so that means we don't have to love so that is the reason we cannot make progress in the devotional path we are doing everything but at the same time we are not if you go to the Hindu temples in India they will be throwing all the packets under under there itself just in almost near to the temple and everything is all water /e and garbage is do you think God will be happy suppose someone leaves that same condition and offer you food and everywhere dog turds and he offers the Buddha take it take it quickly do you think you will be able to eat it if you cannot take that way how can you expect that God will do supreme on the love is necessary when there is no love I throw coins to a bigger just compassion but no love and when there is no love there is no devotion so we have to understand these vagabonds around system is telling bhakti-yoga is the right path but what is that Optio gur faith in the existence of God and approach to God with pure love that is cup of the yoga if you don't have love so naturally your about the faith is doubtful you don't know whether that God is there unarmed in majority of the places if you go I'm sorry to say those who are so close to that God worshiping God and getting there of course their livelihood from there I don't think the belief that God is there that's why the behaves so peculiarly telling lies and cheating people standing so close to that God whom they're worshipping so when you experience then you understand why all to the life they are there in the temple worshiping God but not making any progress in spiritual life does it mean that God is not there drawn it is they don't have the love they don't have to feel that way but once around Krishna and also the all great masters they are telling about it Sartaj mean piranha prema Rupa that Freema the table comes it begins to build some little faith however the bhagavata that has been explained by shamim petition and the ji maharaj the I think he was the twelfth president of the Ramakrishna order he said a person having his household duties also at the same time he goes to the temple he has his devotion he's praying to God sometimes he is crying secretly towards God the police can please show me who are you like that it begins at the same time he goes and attend to all these duties it begins like that that is also a devotee but let's call go near up the a lower category devotion Marshall a domani Devi very nicely is supporting these she said if you want the fragrance of the flower in your hand you have to go on handling the flower when you are constantly handling the flower then only slowly slowly a time will come when without flour your hands your fingers will be touched with the smell so that comes that means when you are going on slowly offering the devotion in that way the poverty will come so go near octi the beginning of the devotion Parvati the culmination of the devotion I will quote from here from the narada bhakti sutra some of the great sages that did definitions that they are given about the bhakti the devotion and first is the weight of Vyasa and that is the sixteenth words of the knowledge about the shooter it says Pooja Deshawn araga edy para sorry Jana para Acharya is Veda Vyasa and according to Veda Vyasa puja the issue Anurag our love for pooja the ritualistic systems and associated our activities that is called bhakti and you find some people are so fond of puja they'll be arranging things so nicely they'll be cleaning things up nicely and plucking the flowers arranging the flowers even offering the flowers each and every so much aesthetic sense each and every day maybe twice in a day there every time they're doing so nicely and so happy after making a flower garland when they are offering they will go at little distance they will look at the God the image and they will appreciate all so nice my god looks so nice with this girl with this God so that way so according to the way the bear show that is devotion so which are the issue on regard other other means love with attachment that skull Anurag love with attachment and attached to God some of the ladies in the traditional way in our country and I was wondering even the young lady is also the modern ladies they are also carrying a little you know the image of Krishna sometimes the little image of Rama Chandra and they'll be carrying it all through everybody they go and they pass through when they are traveling by flight it goes through all the checking they have to go on explaining everything but the only they'll carry it every day they will feed them in check just as if they are carrying their little baby so puja the issue anuraga is the love with attachment to what to the ritualistic thing puja according to the weight of yasser this is called devotion another sage called gardner and it is the 17 verse it says catotti should eat eat gargle gargle is the name of the sea he says rituals it mean it may not be bad some people they love to listen to the words of gods cat addition when I read gospel and in Bengali and Bengali people majority of the they have read the gospel but still you know there will be sixteen thousand twenty thousand people they'll be listening to an explanation of the gospel that I do every month once from the Bengali Association this ring earlier situations the talk it goes and to reaches people so many people like the love to listen to those words and according to Gege the sage Garga that is called devotion cut Hadi should altar and devotional people particularly the vishna verse they are very fond of reading the Bhagavata we are reading the bhagavata we are still continuing every Sunday we read over here and the bhagavata from the point of view of the knowledge so we are accordingly we are reading that so this parvata also the stories of Krishna that is under tainted chapter of the bhagavata and people are so fond of that bhagavata pundit the the knowledgeable people they'll be expounding that narrating that and in a beautiful way people goes mad when they listen to the stories of the Krishna so that is called the cathode issue the love to listen that they love to read there according to the sage Garga attraction for the stories of God is devotion now the third one comes on Delia another sage the Shandilya moon edex a chandelier he says art Marathi Oboro Dena et bhakti Admiralty of Bureau Tina et Admiral peace the bhakti is the devotion to God one's own self he's not going outside is from the point of view of the knowledge he says when you love yourself the Atma authority that he means the desire the desire to know your own Hartman and when you try to know your own Hartman what you are going to do so obviously all your mind will be continuously going on thinking about the art man how to reach to that art man which is within me it's covered with five seats I know I am oh no Maya pranamaya Vicky Ramayana and the Maya all these coverages are there I have to read you over there and you will naturally go on understanding learning what is this anime oh sure what is this monomial kosha the intelligence and all the slowly slowly so that you can go on opening the door of the door and after the five doors you can reach to that ultimate so that is called the Hartman and it says at Marathi you love to understand that Atman the self which is within yourself and that love that attachment that desires called devotion so that is shaundalyn and then comes the Narada about whom Raghavan C Ramakrishna is referring and he said the path of Narada is the best for the modern age this modern age what is that Narada stool according to Narada that Arpita that means that supreme it is not he or she it is that consciousness you can accept these as God or the goddess or whatever but that consciousness or Apatow Akilah our charlatan whatever you are doing everything should be dedicated to the God in the morning we do the japa then he chant the holy name that is the way the spiritual practices of the Hindus all traditional Hindu they will do that they will take the name of God they will read from the books and the chant etcetera then ultimately for whom they are doing to get the blessings of God but after action after completing that they will offer to eponymous to I offer all these to you Oh God so this way that our pita Aquila our Charaka Achara means the action anything that you do before eating food you are offering it before going to be to sleep your offering to God God please come I like to sleep on your lap then like this like each and every moment you are thinking and thought the Bhishma Rani and when you forget for some reason if you forget the God is a tremendous anguish para mo cool a tidy someday we will read that now about the shooting details then we will explain we will try to understand of each and every world that Bhishma Danny taught me is that again that God that is accepted as God and Bhishma ranee when we forget that even for a moment mother Coolatta and we feel the anguish when you love someone and then we forget to do something for him we go to the market we purchase something as a gift to give and then we remember after coming bad my god how come that we forgot to purchase something for the little one we loved that little so much so that anguish what will happen to me now how I'm going to face that little baby so all like these like that anguish because I love so that love gives that much attachment so Todd Bhishma learning when you forgave Brahma Bakula Tahiti and in this modern age this is very very effective turban sadhana Krishna see that the Pratap karma is not the right one for the Kali Yuga and family bacon is telling true karma unselfish karma work you can reach the same goal we're good the risk by his knowledge and Christ by his prayer so are the different know this karma means the what means here when Bergman's Dumpty journey the yaga yaga even still now in many of the Indian societies even in America the same thing they'll be lighting a fire here it is a hazard you have to take special permission you have to make a special room and even then they will do it and they are so much attached to that they will let like light the fire and they will offer so many things inside that and they are thinking that this is the Karma that Karma's Rama Krishna studying this is not possible in the modern age why because the pronunciation of the mantras arrangement of the things of the fire and all then complete thing that in olden days when the recisions to do that it is not possible now the suppose you have an laboratory but that laboratory is not developed as a very developed laboratory where they are being different paper explaining doing so in your own laboratory in the village school there are laboratories are also there we're in so poor condition they won't be able to find out the truth actually they're the same way when the present day our mind is not that we shot those people who are the pure eater who are sitting at the front they are not that way trained maybe there may be good people maybe there is there not and when they are uttering the mantra of the pronunciation is not perfect when the perfect pronunciation is not there effect is also not there so you have to use the same old Matar then only Sousa Ramakrishna say is very difficult nowadays in the modern days you don't get the teacher we will teach you that way you don't have the time to perform that you don't have the ingredients to use that so all these things together it is not possible so what this of T and what type of book did not at the above T what is the knowledge above T do whatever you are doing only offer it to God at the end of the day that's all in the bhagavad-gita Sri Krishna himself safe yet Kuroshio - Nasia Juho see the dasya yet apostasy County that guru shishya mother Poonam what ever you are doing each and everything you offered to me so see ramakrishna is telling you don't have to perform duties all your life he is stealing the duties means the responsibilities all through your life you need not to do slowly you should withdraw as you develop unalloyed love and longing for God your duties become fever it becomes really very difficult for the people who never knew what is spirituality so they were very busy in the beginning when they growing up they go to school and then the competition then DS in that ultimately they reach to that mature wine and then defined there's nothing to do that they try to find some of the clubs where they will go spend some time even that is also not very satisfying and slowly the frustration comes and the ladies somehow manages because they have the habit of cooking cleaning talking to other people engaging in but the main P the because they go to off-leash and come back that's all and after that when they are suddenly they lose the job there is no job then they feel what will happen to us but that is the good time when you are retired that is the best time because by this time you have had not only understood it but realized also through your life all through your life everything is so temporary everything is moving out so I should not be so much attached to this I was so eager to get the job I prepared myself for thirty years then I got the job then another thirty years ago now I see that job is also gone my education my preparation might the job that week the effect also now it is gone now what some of the money that is in our bank and some in the insurances and I am left alone what I will do so this is the time that one see Ramakrishna see if you are preparing yourself for the realization of God from the beginning of your life when you are young this is the time you will ripe the fruit and this that is the reason one people should start practicing religion when they are young so the that time will be completely matured and all these religion things of the world will never affect them you'll never affect them at the age of seventy seventy five if you go to the club and try to dance you can't dance and people won't say anything but you yourself will be exhausted and you you're still feeling awkward that is not the age for doing that what is that contemplation and the joy the love the sympathy or everything that will come slowly by taking the name of God and meditation that will come out of your personality people will be attracted to you they will come and sit by your side they will start talking to you and with all devotion if you talk to them encourage them that is called ultimate sannyasa so see Ramakrishna you don't have to perform duties all through your life notice not necessary when the young daughter-in-law is pregnant her mother-in-law lessens our duties after the birth of the child she doesn't have to do any household work he is giving that example and slowly slowly because when you are practicing early morning you should get up and then go for meditation then you should bathe then you should come without taking any food and then perform the puja clean everything then go and take something for the breakfast and start reading the books then do some Karma Yoga like this whole routine goes on and on so one young person came to a monastery he said that I like to join in the monastic what type of work I should do these things that we do that some people are bringing water some pin blood that maintaining the cows as some are doing these very hard in the summers everything you must should do yourself then he's found that the one gentleman elderly person sitting under a tree and he is talking with some devotees then he said what is doing he is the Guru he is teaching the religion to others he said oh I loved that work that I'd like to so he wants to go to that directly it is not possible so you don't have to work then he said several young men from the village of the option Isha entered the room and saluted scientists master marsha is writing it was about four o'clock in the afternoon they sat down and began to talk with the master see if we read in this way we find that is exactly what the spiritual person he is sitting in one place and people are coming and then he is giving them the idea about religion cinema Krishna is sitting in a small room and then the people young people from the nearby villages they're coming they're sitting and look at it how they are asking question one young man is asking sir what is knowledge that means they didn't know what is worth the what is knowledge but definitions at least so he is asking the question to be once around Krishna and as in English the suspect came the reply immediately the reply came back from Raghavan scientist though apparently the people think that is a devotee he's going and crying before the goddess Kali and all that giving the reply it is to know that God is the only reality what is knowledge it is to know that God is the only reality and that all else is unreal that which is the real is called brahmana he didn't say Oh God have you noticed the difference he's not mentioning the word god I read again it is to know that God is the only reality our capital reality and that all else is unreal this is one again he see that which is real our capital is also called also called Brahman that God also comes under the Maya statue eyes the Brahman is completely consciousness all pervading from that consciousness it comes the first day is the God it is all another name caller the time there is a same oh brother how many things come into being in time and disappear in time so he is mentioning this time is unlimited the timelessness there is no time you cannot limit that within this time that which sports with carla also called Kali because Saddam occasions sitting in the Kali temple the caller column is the time and the time when it is working activated Kali she is the primal energy caller and callee Brahman and Shakti are in devised about some Tichenor didn't use the word Shiva Shiva Shakti Shiva and Kali she said Kali and the Brahmin Brahman and the Shakti Brahman that consciousness and shifty is the power and they are inseparable they are the same that Brahman of the nature of reality is eternal he is going on giving their what is knowledge people talk about knowledge it exists in past present and future eternal immediately he gives again explained that past present and future all the time it is there it is without beginning and without end it cannot be described in words the utmost that can be sada Brahmin is there it is of the very nature of intelligence and please utmost you that is not the exact word to explain Brahman birth you can go near to eat what is milk it is liquid and white at most but it close to that you can explain but that liquid and white is not milk the liquid and white may be many other things but me to explain the milk you have to drink milk then only you will understand what is this milk so it means in this way that ultimate a way we can explain that it is intelligence the best thing in the whole existence is nothing but intelligence we all know that particularly human world those who are intelligent they are respected so intelligence and please the ultimate intelligence to understand the subtlest of the subtle and when they understand that they go in great joy that is called the police that Brahman of the nature of reality is eternal the world is illusion now Brahman and the world two existences one is there Brahman another is the world and what is this world the world is illusion Brahman alone is real now what is illusion is a big discussion goes on and I think this Saturday I will be giving a talk in the Utah the city Salt Lake City and there the subject is this the self so how to go back to the sub and it says in this way that the world is illusionary Brahman alone is real the world is the nature of magic the magician is real but his magic is unreal Sudama krishna is trying hard to explain the creator and the creation then the young man is asking if the world is of the nature of illusion magic then why doesn't one get to read it he is asking very intelligent person he is asking if it is a magic this is very easy to get rid of it master it is due to the some scholars inborn tendencies what are the some scholars inborn tendencies repeated birds in this world of Maya makes one believe that Maya is real repeatedly when you are having in the same circumstances every time every time you start believing all this is this when the India was subjugated by the foreign rulers and the rule for 800 years almost all Indians started thinking that now we can never get freedom we will live like this it will be the life this so they almost mentally adjusted the Dean came Shami Vivekananda who showed that light as they called silver line in the dark cloud so the aim there is a light you can and what is their self-confidence you can do it you can do it so that we he gave a be bigger than the effect what is that Vivekananda effect what he did brought back the self-confidence into the minds of the thirty three hundred million people so that is so huge number of people they got inspired because of his saying really these few words the people who wonder is it possible history proves that so this he says it is possible here again and again when you are taking birth in that circumstances and it makes Maya let me tell you how powerful inborn tendencies are but in then he is giving a small example through a story a prince had in a previous birth been a son of a washer man while playing with his frames in his in his certain incarnation as the Prince though is now a prince but the previous birth he was the son of a washer man and now they are playing he said to his friends stop those games I will show you a new one I shall lie on my belly and he will beat the clothes on my bed as the washerman does look at it so they that impression that the washing man the washer man in the villages if you could see how they are washing the clothes that is soaked clothes they're beating on a hard thing so he knew it so he is telling now let us play in a new game I'll be lying down like this on my back you beat the clothes meeting is ringing round so that is many youngsters come here but only a few long for God's sake to study the minute they come the few the long for God this few were born with spiritual tendencies this viewer born with spiritual tendencies so this tendency this samskara is a very big work so thank you friends now let us chant this mantra and we completely need a Numidian [Music] compa Drita Bikram ye yatha taro but a Misha medium tongue Ramakrishna she - ah whom Shanti Shanti Shanti javi you desert Sri Ramakrishna eponymous
