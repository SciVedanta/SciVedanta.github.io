[317.  Panchama Veda 317: “Incarceration of God.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_OemaK9g5Q)

namaskar dear devotees and friends uh like every wednesday evening we'll be studying the gospel of krishna panchama veda and we'll continue the discussion on the reincarnation so this here uh before we start as usual let us chant this mantra [Music] now we were discussing the incarnation the page 758 of the gospel of sirama krishna we previously read the girish ghosh is asking the question to trey lakia do you believe in the incarnation of god now that was the question incarnation of god but the reincarnation theory means every soul is taking a birth and taking a life taking a body and leaving again dying again it is coming back and that goes on the reincarnation theory supported by the karma theory the karma theory means you have done we have done some good or bad work and obviously the result we have to enjoy either good or bad whatever we have to bear that and who will not the physical body because physical body has a limitation it cannot survive maximum 120 that much and sometimes some people they think that there are some people who can survive for eternity but anything that is combined it's made of something some other things is a combination the result of some combination is going to break so that is the death but for the soul what is about the soul this is the law for many many many years the philosophers and the the scientists they are debating on that whether there is a soul or not still there's a lot of doubt is there so whatever it may be the discussion is going on on this question that was asked by the girish ghosh and we will continue that now however the hinduism and the buddhism they believe in this and of course the souls survived and lord buddhas the off-quoted you know that of the the words of the lord buddha it says if you want to know the past look at your present and if you want to know your future look at your present because whatever you are working so that result you will become at present what we are that is the result of our past karma what will be in future that is the result of our present karma the present is very important lord buddha used to give the stress on the present what you are thinking some people used to ask what about the god and all that so he always used to stress on very practical rather instead of just groping in that the the darkness what is soul and how to achieve this knowledge don't bother about that concentrate on your work and the work physically mentally and through words the three types of works are there kaiika monasika bachika the kayak of physical work i am not going to harm anyone and all this physically we can control what about the mind the monastical the mentally we go on thinking many bad things so that is also the effect is also on that and of course bicycle sometimes through words we create uh the pain in the minds of others result is there so that the hindus and the buddhists that believe in that particularly tibetan buddhism they believe in that joe fisher in his book professed by the dalai lama is a very nice book the case of reincarnation quoted from alice a bailey reincarnation is implicit in the manifested universe and is a basis and fundamental theme underlying systemic pulsation and he is from the that it is a small book but many informations are there in this book ju fisher he's quoting this this way the reincarnation is implicit he has also quoted the tao of physics of prophet kapra i'm just mentioning one line even as we die we are capable of activating another body dead yet very much alive this is the idea nowadays the physicists they are also thinking in this way there must be something the consciousness and it is very very difficult to analyze the consciousness how you will explain because the consciousness is not an object it is subjective so obviously only we can feel we can realize but through words it is impossible so though present day only buddhism and hinduism are mentioning about the reincarnation the reincarnation of god that is a different thing but it is i am discussing about the reincarnation of the jivas the individual souls this particular soul is taking birth again and again taking birth in a body and then dying after finishing the karma and according to the karma taking another body another birth in another place and sometimes the i feel that what will happen to those people suppose they are fighting for a religion called a that they are all they belong to a and they are fighting for a then they die after death they were fighting with b and after the death suppose they born in the group of b again they will fight against a this is not funny so this is the way it goes so when we are thinking that we have to fight we have to do this we take it for granted that this is the ultimate but it is not nothing is ultimate these are all temporary things the moment we understand this immediately all these conflicts it goes away and that is called knowledge and that's why the vedanta after realizing that all is nothing but the consciousness their teaching which is now popularly known as the hinduism and it goes on teaching only unity in diversity though there are many different groups are there they are all moving towards the same goal but sometimes because of the ego i have not made god i have not seen god i don't practice genuinely anything and god though we say god is love god is compassion but still we are in the name of the the god of love god of compassion we go and heart others because it is completely ignorance and egoistic way of working so what is this discussions the all the spiritual discourses only to enlighten us about the temporariness of this life and permanence of the soul of the consciousness of the self so this is the very interesting question that he has asked and before we go for incarnation of god we can think in this way now christianity they don't believe only now they don't but you know in the economical council that was hailed in 553 after the death of jesus the a.d after the death of lord jesus innumerical council they decided a group of people decided well we can't understand this so forget about it so we are not going to accept the reincarnation theory in christianity but those who decided they were not realized souls only they could not analyze that is the problem when it goes in the hand when the religion goes in the hands of those people who have not realized those who have not controlled their mind their senses in all sense organs so obviously they make mistakes and when the other people following this type of people they are also in the teachers that's why in the upanishad it says and a blind person leading another blind person possibility of falling in the ditch so this is the problem but i'll be quoting that jesus christ he affirmed before abraham was i am it is in the john the book of john it is there the lord jesus is mentioning before abraham was i am almost like the when we read those who have read the bhagavad gita they say oh this type of word the bhagavan krishna also mentioned isn't it when he was mentioning that i taught this yoga to that son and the arjuna doubted how that is possible because you are of my age and the son vivasvata he is very very ancient how it is possible that you taught him then he said bhuni me bhatti tani janmani tabacharjuna the four many many births we have taken arjuna you and me both we have taken birth many a times but you don't remember those which i can the same way that jesus could remember and that's why he announced before abraham was i am who is this jesus then is the consciousness though we are hindu we worship jesus as the incarnation of god because of these statements because the love that we find in the life of lord jesus because of the knowledge that we find in the life of lord jesus so this is the reason in the gospel of the matthew chapter 11 also we find lord is identified john the baptist as being elisa reborn elisa reborn the lord himself on the basis of his words which is now they call bible and the whole christianity is depending on that but they are not either explaining it properly or accepting it truly so that is the reason but without the conception of the rebirth we cannot explain many things many questions in this world so this it says that jesus also uh accepted these lord buddha accepted these and of course the hindus all the great souls they have accepted these why we are discussing because we are the product of our own action the friends this the the morality and all that we learned and we try to practice not to help others but to help myself the suffering that the people they serve suffer in their lives because of their past karma it is true so sometimes some people will say oh the children those who are suffering are they and it is an emotional question the children newly born children why they should suffer and all these but if we could see the life of that particular person we could find something is there no result happen without any uh action there's a must be a cause before the action before the result so that is the truth the reincarnation even i was going through the writer of the the near death experience that became the very famous book near that experience by dr raymond moody he has also mentioned in another book life after life that was published in 1975 he has given the so many statements of the doctors because the the physicians they got uh interested in this uh to understand what happens after the depth there are so many examples that there the experiments that has been mentioned and in the forward of that book by even alexander is also an md uh he's a doctor he mentioned he concluded the consciousness is eternal now even the medical science also is accepting consciousness is eternal is a great statement and we always say the hindus they always say all the rishis all the seers they always say consciousness is only existing and nothing else brahma satya jagat mitta what brahma means consciousness it's all pervading and what is this jagat of course there is a different explanation so many different views has been expressed on that but on the consciousness all these things are reflected that is the advaitic vedanta they will say and the shankaracharya view they will say it is the reflection and some will say no it is a permanent that is a different question but consciousness is there this consciousness is called brahman it called atman it's called self this is the way if we understand then this question that we are now hearing from the mouth of this girish is asking this question do you believe in the incarnation of god is very important another question of incarnation of god when we were discussing the incarnation of the soul reincarnation theory here comes the question of karma or the action that we have done but if we accept the incarnation of god does it apply the same way has god done something so that he is taking this birth and working on the according to his past karma no this is the difference incarnation of god and the incarnation of the jebus or the individual self individual soul are completely different it is like the superintendent of the jail and the convict of the jail the convict is in the jail because of his bad action and he or she will be there in that prison till all the judgment is done proper etc but superintendent of that is completely different superintendent of the jail he has accepted that position and he or she the superintendent that he is going to see the discipline and maintaining all that any time sorry any time they can go out but the convicts cannot the same way here also we find that we are the convicts we have to complete our term otherwise we won't be able to go out the term means all the action that we have done that we have to follow otherwise it is impossible sorry for today's interruption this the term means the action that we have done previously all the result we have to suffer or to enjoy so that is the reason they always say be good to others the morality is basis of the morality is this be good to others why otherwise you are going to suffer when you are thinking that you are going to give the punishment to these people or making all his life in the troublesome and you are very happy they are our enemies we are giving them the punishment maybe but because of that action you will be also in difficulty either in this life or in the next life now we were discussing about the incarnation of the god how the god comes of their own they don't have any karma the god is that creator he has started this all this law that we can say of the the action karma and this result this is all god's rules but he's beyond this that his will he comes but why a tremendous love for the creation i am talking from the viewpoint of the dualities the god is is separate it is consciousness and he is creating this world for his own enjoyment out of his himself now then he is separating us through ego the the hindus they say particularly vedantin they say because of the ego we are separated from the god and in the christianity day talk about the first the scene that was committed by the adam and the eve but for us it is the ego the because of the ego immediately we are connected with this body the name and the form and we separate ourselves from the supreme cell otherwise we are self the same self but we are separating ourselves but when we are separating and all these actions are going on but who is the controller who is the creator who is the maintainer the god himself the why god is coming down as a human being taking birth as if taking birth and then growing up as if growing up i'm using the word as if actually it is really not in the life of all these great souls if we check you you'll find that something very special in the life of particularly bhagavan si rama krishna who was very modern we can find that though apparently there was a cancer in his body and in those days people were not aware about that particular the disease not much of medicines were there so they were average different type of ideas were there but in reality it was nothing for him his body was all right when the people are coming they see that he is suffering but otherwise there are many many incidents those who have read the biography don't know his all right so how it is possible because it was not real it's all apparent it's thinking so this incarnations are there it is true but it is hard to believe and that is why when we find of the the hindus they believe the 10 incarnations and then many particularly the human form the incarnation of goddess ramachandra and this sri ramachandra he never declared that i am the incarnation he never tried to show it also rather very humbly he lived lived like a just a human being you will never find the sri ramachandra is asking us to meditate or to go for the taking the name of lord nothing like that rather he is always asking us to follow whatever the responsibility that we have taken we must follow that whatever the promises that we have taken we must keep that so the human mind was the society was slowly created the one should follow these how should be the behavior of the brothers and the relation between the king and the subject like this like this all this was there so this is the way it was going on but the lord krishna came and in the next after the sridharma he was very much exposed to this divine things when he was a small little kid from there you are showing the varieties of power supernatural power but still people were doubtful with is it possible the god can be in the human form see it took time many many many years because the god means something which is living in the sky somewhere the creating punishing and also and like all this conception was there the god can be in the human form and then can leave with us and can show us the path and what is that ultimate it is the joy the bliss so that we find in the lord krishna and he had to show a lot of miracles to make people believe that it is possible for the god to take the human form so this is the incarnation and again in a very modern time only 1836 uh the bhagavad-gita came and he grew up just like an ordinary brahman family and he was not showing any miracle but still people they understood that he is the incarnation of god and some accepted him is that manifest the ease the god himself why now what is god the our conception of god means he is giving the punishment or the reward as like a ruler nothing like that in the bhagavad-gita itself shri krishna he's mentioning as an incarnation of god he's mentioned no i am not giving any punishment or the reward it is of your karma so why what i am teaching you so this is good and this is bad don't do bad because you will suffer again and again try to do the good so this is the way it goes when he's asking do you believe in the incarnation of god so here it says the master to trey lucky we have already read all troubles come to an end when the ego dies look at it the why we are suffering because we are separated from god how we have been separated from god because of our ego now what is this ego no one can explain but each and every one is having the ego this is a very peculiar very unique that each and every one is having the ego even the children nowadays so they are also boasting eye and what is this i and the moment we say i all the fingers goes to this body but this body was not there say before 50 years or whatever the age before that it was not there the mind also the same age then before that where do you wear we don't know suppose you die after 10 20 say 50 years what will happen to your ego then what is this ego is it constantly increasing or decreasing and what is happening but still we are so much associated with this body and mind friends this is called knowledge this knowledge if we have and understanding this if we now make a nice routine for our life and practice that that is called tapasya that is called spiritual austerity will be completely free from this bondage of birth and death you know it is almost that easy you have to go beyond this so the vidant in they have coined a term called maya it is the power of god it is constantly showing something which is not there or not true as true so understanding that if we are aware oh it is not actually it is not like that then there will be no problem i went to see at that studio in hollywood last time when i visited they took me to that hollywood the studio and you will wonder those who have visited you have that experience the huge beast is coming to attack your boss and he's holding your boss and then shaking the bus it's almost true the people are the ladies are screaming and the people are shouting children are crying it's as if it's true truly the boss is that tilting but it is nothing so that is the way it goes that is called maya you know only light sound picture and all those and we are thinking that it is true we are thinking it is true after some time when they put all the light on we understood oh no it was not true and everybody was so happy so this is the way it goes and they were showing how the movie they take you feel as if it is really really true and same way the maya also does and what is this maya this ego when this ego goes away then immediately we reveal that consciousness so bhagavan srirama krishna is very specific and to the point he said all troubles come to an end when the ego dies in bengali he said ami mole gucci be janjal janjal means the problems all problem will be over when that i goes away as long as a trace of i consciousness remains one is conscious of differences nobody knows what remains after the i disappears nobody can express it in words that which is remains after the i disappears one cannot say that a part manifest through this man and the rest through the other shachidananda is the ocean the part of i is immersed in it as long as the pot exists the water seems to be divided into two parts one part inside the pot another part outside the pot but when the pot is broken there is only one stretch of water one cannot even say that who would say that excellent example apparently so simple but see how bhagavan sirama krishna is explaining so religion is nothing but understanding this that's why bhagavan shami vivekananda said religion is realization the krishna bhagavatam krishna's disciples is also very simple and very straight religion is realization what is to realize that when i am talking about i it is not this body because body is constantly changing the little eye has become this old eye the guru-napai no it cannot be the consciousness is eternal the same and similarly when that is and giving the example of a small picture full of water and it is inside the water the inside water outside water why the form of the teacher now when that picture goes away it breaks away then what happens inside water outside water and mixed and who will say i was the teacher i was inside the picture so that is called muktin that is called liberation liberation all this con concept is this only when that little eye concept is gone then you are the same consciousness but you cannot express it how we can express the suramar krishna is mentioning this way after the discussion suramar krishna began engaged in pleasant conversation with trilocha so he was discussing in another way just now this consciousness bhagavan srama krishna whatever he said on the basis of his own realization and each and every realization is actually and each and every realization truly is going along with the realizations of the rishis of the old of the veda so that is the reason i mentioned the gospel of krishna is the fifth veda it is the veda means knowledge so all this is nothing but the knowledge we will go to another but before that let us conclude in this way this particular discussion the reincarnation the hindu they continued because they follow the dictums of the realized souls the optio in the sanskrit they call aptia means realized one and that those realized one who are also known as the rishis munis they said that it is nothing but the consciousness but we have separated maybe as if a small part of consciousness and we are saying i and the moment we say i and associated with the body and the mind and naturally you and all these things all around us it becomes a phenomena it becomes the creation it becomes the world everything that is there and we live into that world we cannot come out of that as if in the dream we are suffering in the dream but we cannot come out of the dream why because at that time we are inside the dream the moment we break the dream we are completely free all the suffering all the enjoyment all those things all around us that was happening in our dream it can do no effect when we are awake the similarly in the as we call it so called waking stage that is also similar to the dream stage according to those who have realized the soul according to those now when this dream stage will also break because of the realization we will say just as we say after the after our dream breaks the same way we will say oh my god what was that so these two stages now waking stage we are thinking we are conscious we are awake awake and everything we are understanding no it is also same like the dream stage we are imagining but difficult to accept it dream stage as because the time frame is very short we can accept it and it is happening in my own life we can immediately compare waking stage and dream stage dream stage i was dreaming bad dream i was suffering moment i get up from the dream break the dream i'm free but our life is a long period there either we suffer or enjoy whatever according to our thought and action but we can go beyond that going beyond that is called god realization or the mukti or the ultimate of religion and as swami vivekananda said realization religion is realization what to realize that actually i was dreaming in my waking stage that is not true what is the truth consciousness now the example that the lord suramar krishna bhagavan srama krishna is giving the picture full with water and also that waterfall pitcher is putting inside the water someone is keeping that what water full of that pitcher and putting inside the water then outside water inside water but still we are thinking i am inside water that is outside water when the picture is broken then it is mixed so this is the whole of the religious theory i have to go and mix with that and how we will go that is the call the processes now when we decide yes i have understood it now this small little i i have to eradicate but it is not so easy just if you are deciding it is good but that is the first step to decide i am going to eradicate and how i will do that slowly slowly slowly and that is called in the bhagavata the i'll be giving a class on that in the bhagavata when the lord krishna was asked by his friend and disciple uddhava he gave a list of the things that the devotee should do and when he is doing it the only thing that person should be concerned that he is doing it or she is doing it for god and nothing else just by that maybe someday we will discuss that so here the master is asking you are happy isn't that so the toy look but i shall become my old self again as soon as i leave this place here i feel very much the awakening of spiritual consciousness so this is the experience when you go to a holy person you feel that your heart is full with joy happiness why because all the burden all the thoughts that was there preoccupied it goes away goes away means you're hiding somewhere else it is not on the level of consciousness it is just in the subconscious mind so the sadhu sangha that when we go to a holy place or a holy person we should feel that happiness the triloka very clearly mentioning yeah i was happy here as long as i am talking with you staying over here but the moment i go away again that unhappiness comes because what is unhappiness again those thoughts the worldly thoughts all this coming so why we are happy because the thoughts that is creating problem in my mind are absent and why we are unhappy because the happy thought is not coming rather unhappy troublesome thoughts are there it's only the thoughts from here we can work in such a way that the thought should always be happy full of happiness how it is possible when our mind is free from ego fast and secondly love for others and thirdly unselfish the more we become unselfish so it's good that person is so successful he's doing this he's doing that if you can appreciate then you will feel some your mind is completely free from jealousy and there will be no anger and you are happy so it is only the thought if we can understand these we'll be happy all through our life the sudama krishna is asking this question to trail occur you are happy isn't it and he said yes but the moment i leave this place i feel unhappy master you don't have to be afraid of walking on thorns if you are wearing shoes you needn't be afraid of the last and gold if you know the god alone is real and all else illusory srama krishna is mentioning two things one is the last and gold the gold means the support and for why to satisfy our desires the desires the extreme desire is the last so he's mentioning again and again so if you are not having that idea that means you are not very strongly rooted in the body and this body consciousness you look around the so called modern society what is there only body consciousness if you go to seven star hotel five star hotel wherever you go all very nicely dressed people and they are only jumping dancing drinking eating but why for the joy but again the next when they are coming out they are not happy but temporarily their excitement their thinking that is the joy it is wrong again it's a wastage of time in the human life so we have to understand that those who cannot let them continue in the bhagavad-gita mention well let them continue with that karma but when after suffering suffering suffering one day they will oh my god all through my life almost all the hotels in this city i have already visited and so many gallons of the the wine i have drank but no i am not getting the joy why because you are not really opening the true door of happiness what is that ego you have to remove the ego and then flood the happiness will come so this is the ramakrishna so what we should do take the name of god always that's why he said but you don't have to be afraid of walking on thorns why if you are wearing shoes what is the wearing of shoes it is taking the name of god when we are constantly taking the name of god even before the sleep we go and lie down and think of the image of god whatever the god may be according to my wish i think of that image and thinking that i am actually lying my head on that lap of that god or goddess and slowly sleeping imagining that joy will come because there is no selfishness the joy will come because there is no competition the joy will come so that is called putting on the shoe shoe means protecting the feet and we can walk and the thorn won't be able to harm our feet similarly you are protecting the mind with the holy name of god holy thought of god imagination of god and whatever is good so when we are doing that so srama krishna is indicating the question is we have to be happy how we can become happy the more we can reduce the ego how we can reduce the ego the more we will go towards god and slowly slowly develop unselfishness and love for each and every being and how that is possible constantly thinking the god who is full of love and unselfish so that's why siram krishna is telling and second is the desire the one desire towards god and towards god we have to protect our mind with the holy name of god that's why they take initiation the diksa diksha is nothing but the help to cover the mind and take it this safe from the suffering the constantly thinking of god thinking of the different beautiful stories of god and that is the way we can keep our mind away from suffering and then the desire and that's why he is mentioning you needn't be afraid of the last and gold if you know that god alone is real and all else illusory sometimes some people they when they see the rich people they think we should be like that nothing wrong it is good but those who truly like to become happy don't bother about this worldly wealth sufficient if you have having the two square mil and then little comfort in your home that is sufficient so simple living high thinking that was the idea of india at one time now when you go for cheese for the money and comfort and name and it is you just just go and jump into the at the place from where it is very difficult to come out the mire of that you are stuck to that there's no aim to this if you look at the rich people they are so rich so fabulously receive they don't know how much wealth they are having maybe once in a year their accountant will come and say sir ma'am you are having this much wealth they don't know where it is but just the amount oh that is good so they're happy then there's some group companies there they will be listing the reach oh he's the fast now among the rich people he's passed he's second third again the jealousy again the burning oh i am only fifth i have to go for fast see there is no end to it and when you reach to the end of the first and the next year another person will be coming and knocking on you and again you are thinking how to get lot of money and you're going on saving keeping in the bank show that it will be you are the so many crows you have collected and what the happiness rather as bhagavan sirama krishna said the money doesn't belong to you as because the past karma the lord has given you the intellect and the opportunity to collect all this money but it doesn't belong to you so just as a trustee you are just keeping those wealth why don't you share it with the others and when you go and spend a portion of it for the betterment of the poor and suffering people they will remember you they will put your images your photo in every room they'll say this is the person who is god in this world a living god why don't you become that what you are going to do keeping all your wealth inside the bank and one day suddenly he will die god forbid and then the bank people will say oh he has not kept any the the right of nothing is there so we are taking that money look at it so you lose everything the bengali they say that you lose that the bag and also the mango that you collected inside the bag amo gallo chalao gallo that is a very village they say so we have to understand this friend so we our goal is to become happy and happiness is possible by sharing in this way so the last and gold if you know that god alone is real it was about nine o'clock in the evening balarama took triloka to another room and gave him refreshments sirama krishna begin began to tell the devotees about trilocha and the people of his views the master to girish aim and the other devotee do you know what these people are like they're like a frog living in the well who has never seen the outside world he knows only his will so he will not believe that there is such a thing as the world likewise people talk so much about the world because they have not known the joy of god must be many many many of you who are aware about that fast lecture that swami vivekananda delivered the famous lecture almost every indian traditionally in the generation after generation they remember the first lecture of swami vivekananda that was delivered over here in chicago the parliament of religions 1893. swami vivekananda he mentioned these frog in the well story the word sirama krishna mentioned is the page 759 of the gospel of sadama krishna he is mentioning what is that narrowness what is this narrowness ignorance ignorance about the others and they think they are so proud no no there cannot be any other god than my god how do you know have you met your god no but that full he will go on and flexing his muscles and will say my god is the only god and your god is a fake god and either you accept my god or i am going to kill you look at it in the name of the god who is nothing but love and unselfishness this person he is going to kill another person and the result suffering this person who is going to boast and thinking that i am going to kill this man in the name of my god does he think that god will bless never rather because of the bad karma he'll be suffering in his next life so one should be very very careful about this reincarnation whether you like it or not whether you accept it or not believe it or not it is the truth each and every action has its equal and opposite reaction and the action that you are doing in your mind in your thought in your words and in your physically do you think that the no result will come obviously so the hindus they believe one should be broad-minded and one should be sincerely following his own path and also encouraging others to follow the path of god it may be different process may be different language may be different it doesn't matter at all but the result of that is knowledge suppose a student is studying somewhere in japan somewhere in london somewhere in india somewhere in america a subject may be the mathematics different teachers different atmosphere different language whatever it may be but when they are graduating they are all mathematicians they are all graduate of the mathematics so that is the idea whatever may be the path that we are following in our different religions different philosophy different groups the goal must be the love and unselfishness if not there is a wrong path wrong system we are following thank you friends we will stop over here in any question yes casey is asking at the time of death does the person have a choice where they will take their next birth or is it entirely decided by your karma entirely decided by the karma okay see that's a good question entirely decided by the karma as if there is someone there are many examples are there as i was mentioning these two books there are they have given they're actually the doctors physicians and in their laboratories and in many other laboratories they had a lot of these experiments and ex that the near death the near-death experiences some people they were almost like they have given the stories also if you read that book you will find they went after the death where they went somewhere again as if someone asked him to go back so like that it goes but according to our karma we go to different places now in this life suppose we have done something bad harming someone sometimes are not understanding sometime when we are young we were not aware of all these and if we go and pray just alone i made a mistake i'm sorry and i'm not going to repeat it i'm not going to harm anyone then slowly that action will go away that follow will be minimized that result will be minimized so that is the way it goes that's why swami vivekananda said you are the maker of your own destiny the ultimate result is yes when we die whatever the thought will be there on our mind on the surface of our mind that is the place we are going to reach in the bhagavad gita also sri krishna mentioned about it subandhu is asking shri krishna declared himself as the supreme even shri ramakrishna exposed himself to some close devotees but why not sri rama 3 rama's it is the god he took the form srirama but his purpose was different the god is coming in different name different form in different times that their purpose if you see the dharma but according to the situation of the people of the society the god is acting so very much we can understand that after the satta yuga the if you are aware of that the four yogurts the after the satya yuga where most of the people they were about aware about their nature and the life and the atman mostly and it came the treta yuga sat rita immediately after but the ordinary people are now the maximum number of people who are there so they were little bit confused rishis were there highly exalted spiritual people were there but ordinary people were there and they were not knowing what to do so it is the god who came then he gave a complete conception of the family husband-wife relation brother-to-brother relation and that was the work as sri ramachandra god did so he is marjada prusama he is the that is the way he established that beautiful society i will just give you an example if you have read some the portion of the ramayana people they know that the great sage his wife allah she committed a mystic sometimes in some ramayana they depict in different way but she made a mistake she thought the indra who came in the form of her husband she couldn't realized it then after when she realized she was sorry but her husband gautama muni the famous rishi he said well now that ramachandra is coming to this area if the rama said that you are free from all sin i will accept you as my wife now they accepted sri rama chandra and rama said it is not the fault of the lady it is the fault of the krishna that indra so we should not blame the lady and again the allah was accepted by the gautama muni we can find out in the the societies in a frame it is coming and slowly slowly it is developing the krishna was different he wanted to prove that god can take human form so that is the difference thank you devdan is asking is it possible to be with spiritualism and ambition together after leaving ego see the see that the completely two different things ambition is good and so long the ambition is there i like to do this it must be there that's why swami vivekananda said i must believe i have the faith in myself i can do it it is possible achieve that but don't get entangled to that don't think if i can't achieve that particular position or that condition i'm going to die i'm going to lose everything no so that is wrong achieving something or reaching out to that position it is good i can do it but at the same time if you are practicing spirituality you should know it is all temporary before me there were so many leaders were there after me also so many people will be there so it is only for me i am reaching over there that's all if i don't no problem for me so that detached way of action is called spiritual and you will always be happy thank you sadika is saying it is very difficult to love each other and every being but i am trying to practice oh good congratulations so that practices is most important when we are trying to love each other understanding each other the more we grow more we understand that these things are really really difficult because when i am trying to love the opposite also should understand but that is sometimes it is not so it goes in this way but from my side we should always try to understand love help others already it is asking a big question if we just read this what how can that be so clipbeam means what clipboard means here yes the same god he said the klibata means when the arjuna was thinking that he is correct that is from the his egoistic way he was thinking and analyzing and he said that i am not going to follow uh the practice my own swadharma so the lord to awaken his consciousness he said you are a shatriah you should fight for the just fight for the good and you must do that why not then how you are behaving like a brahmana there are different categories are there so this is a clive ata it is we are covering up our weakness with some philosophical thing oh i am not fighting because you know like this and that no that is the khlibata and then ultimately he said that you know that there also he said whether you do it or not everything has already been done because according to the karma that will go so he said to arjuna sarva dharma mommy comes around dharma means the responsibility then you forget all about that and dedicate to me i will guide you so here he is asking us the through arjuna to stand up and fight and perform our duties responsibilities and then ultimately we have to surrender everything to god because that is the ultimate thing so thank you thank you for your interest and let us chant this mantra and we conclude is [Music] [Music] foreign
