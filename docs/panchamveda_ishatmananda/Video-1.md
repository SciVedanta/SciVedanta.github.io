[2. Panchama Veda: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wyCYJMk4uWo)

like that because we always think about the more you grow more you think of two things doctor and god and the this is in in every profession in every way that's why brahma means why they have said it like that the person who has only had the knowledge of brahma brahma and brahma been uttama perfectly he has that knowledge there are so many instances will be there one lady took her daughter will be getting married to get the blessings in an astronaut and he went and she she went with her daughter she didn't found that daksa the in-chair swami so there was a brahmacharya young brahmacharya was there and with all happiness she told maharaja my daughter is going to get married within 10-15 days please bless her and this brahmacari recently he has read all these things immediately he shouted you people are in the bondage again putting this daughter also in the bondage she missed it now then afterwards somehow the senior person that that injured swami came and he has also read all these things he also knows but he has a practical idea see he said no no no this is all right so good see takur and ma they also married be like that and both of them were somehow pacified so like this the knowledge is same but the thing is experience is also should be there so here we found the brahma therefore they are also realized soul they have got some idea but how again bhagavan siram krishna he is explaining in a very simple way the four blind people black persons they we founded an elephant and they went to see the daily fan how the blind man blind people they know by touching and the person who touched the leg of the elephant another person touched the tongue of the elephant another belly another the tail they came reported yes i have seen elephant how is it just like a pillar he is correct but very only a few percentage is true it's not the whole truth how is the elephant just like a pillar correct well the person who touched the trunk is like a huge pipe you know he's also correct and the person would touch the bailey and he said oh no no no you are all wrong i myself have touched and i have seen elephant is like a huge pitcher huge preacher and the person who was holding the tail he touched the tail i can't understand what all these things you were telling as a elephant is just little bigger than any leecher all of them are correct but are they really telling the complete truth no why these are the differences of knowledge so there also we have to understand all people are telling the truth but partial truth so who can tell the incomplete see one person saw the king he was standing by the side of the road and king was passing with all his people suddenly something happened king stopped over there and the window of the car was down and king picked from that the person who nearby he saw the king and he came and told all the villagers i have seen the king just from this distance is true and the person who is working there at the with the king he is also seeing the king almost every time the personal servants are also seeing the king so many times the wives the children also seeing the king they can also explain about the king abizine but can any of them tell in complete way how the thing is no maybe that powerful king alone when he says he enjoyed tom and jake nobody knows he'll be closing the door and he'll open the tom and jelly and you will love like a child it's just so simple whatever apparently that only king knows we do not know so that's when siram krishna said you can never say i know the god in totality no he cannot no one can say even also it is telling if anyone say that i have no know it for sure it doesn't so here is one who is the king himself the god himself bhagavan krishna himself he comes and he is telling about the god and we know about the god we have we were telling in the scriptures they have tried to give some idea about god and what was that we read that that uh we should just hear some is the future of all the beings but no one knows about me mount veda here in the vishnu also we quoted last time he knows very perfectly what is what is avid when you go through the videos of the bachelor the gospel of krishna we will find the wonderful conversation between the writer and suramar krishna writer is three more here we find that in bhagavad-gita he the sri krishna is telling like this now about when the god himself is telling about god then also it is so difficult because the god is beyond time space and causation time space and causation that's why he cannot say everything within this timeframe he himself also struggling and surrounding i like to tell you what is god what is mother but someone is holding my the throat i cannot speak out it is not possible in his own simple manner sir krishna is telling that it's not possible to tell about god in totality incomplete you have to realize it and here the god is trying to tell what to do and what not to do how far you can know about him all these things are telling but we have to believe it the moment we say the belief immediately the modern mind rebel believing why unless and until we examine unless and until we know until unless we are understanding this thing by ourselves how can we believe it you know there is a judge from calcutta high court he went to angama and we were having the discussion that evening two of them were there their family members and then when i was talking about this faith the belief he said swamiji so everything is all right religion we can do something understand but the moment you say the belief that i cannot understand why should i have to believe i will never judge i cannot contradict that i could judge is a tremendous power i just jokingly i told i cannot contradict but the thing is when you came from calcutta to port player randaman yes the person with the white dress sitting at the front by lot have you checked his certificates whether he is a really certified person to fly or not you did you believed since he is sitting over there is obviously some people must have checked his credentials and must be having some experience so you believed and sat quietly nicely in the front seat and the lady that here hostess who gave him the water of the tea and all of the food did you ask her to taste whether it is mixed with any other things no you believed and hate we believe everything in every spirit of our life in every state of our life the lady whom i am believing as my mother cannot be father all people that we are believing that they are our own may not be we are actually believing and then when the question of believing god comes immediately we become so so much scientific that we don't like to believe why that is an explanation because in the past life it is not there so slowly it is coming so naturally we don't believe arjuna it was difficult for him also to believe because shri krishna was with him all through every moment they were friends suddenly to believe him as god how but then those who have break the teeth they have found then in one place he is telling na parambra pavitram you are that god why how can i say that then he is supporting his statement by you have said that you are god you yourself say to me and i believe you i believe those people asita develop they're all great rishis they're like it proves that they can never say anything wrong lies so why should you not believe that they are the mirrors in one place in that time i was also young uh you went and there was a christian answer suddenly one boy stood up and said swamiji one thing is very clear unless and until i see with my own eyes i do not believe anything boy i am sorry then you should not believe that you have eyes because you have not seen your own eyes with your own eyes no no through mirror and through mirror not directly you can't see your own eyes directly can you no we infer that everybody having two eyes so i'm also having must be then the mirror when i see the mirror then i say okay i'm just like this then now it is the photograph okay but through some media why not look at the life of sri chaitanya guru nanak jesus christ sri ramakrishna their lives at the mirror where the image of god is reflected why don't you see that and believe as you are believing things in the mirror in the car in the mirror resolve is written the thing that you see at the back and that is actually it has really happened they are so close but we are thinking it is so far so we were nicely suddenly you stopped and got it clash and then polish will come etc will go on so why because even in the mirror we cannot see things properly so here the times are there swayam remain bhagavan could say i am this word he could not pronounce there was no ego at all and when he said sometimes you must remember me then you will be getting the blessings of god you will get the mukti that much he said all that you see are within me this time you rama yo krishna this type is in sirama krishna then few different places he is telling about it that means like sri krishna sarvabha dharma kamsa there's a group of people they are vishnu they are the worshipers of sri krishna but they don't worship krishna with a except one there is no two that is their philosophy and who is that one krishna so you just forgive forget all of the things only you believe me come to me so naturally not properly understanding the broad teaching of sri krishna they have become so narrow fanatic not understanding others not trying to understand others like this like that as usual it happens and i went there and when i was talking with them they're telling only god is there krishna there's no one else that's true but that same krishna is telling anyone anywhere in any form when he is worshiping i accepted worship i accepted puja then how the same god same krishna in the same body here and there he is telling the two words you know what like this father told his son in the morning two hours you must study in the afternoon you can play one hour then when the father left the son told the mother mom i cannot obey put the orders of the father i will better follow the afternoon in the morning two hours study it is difficult so afternoon will be good for me the same god is telling and now you are only observing one not the other so this way people always they try to be nervous whether the goddess say it or not whether scripture has said or not i am telling that hong kong are always takers and like the asika devala vyasa the excellent rishis of the presentage swami vivekananda cannot imagine how much they did and when they said siram krishna is god why can't you believe when sriram krishna said the person who was not having an iota of ego why can't we believe because our ego you always say no no no it cannot be my person my god my guru my people's dad i comes and there we fight this panchama veda here siram krishna when the namre only speaks about spirituality when shreem boy is meeting the master mahasha the writer when he met siram krishna he or shiram krishna was already famous there master masha forgot to mention the date the first meeting because he was not prepared that time he went for something else you know that i told you last time and now he was in agony his mind was restless and that time his friend is relative he took him to suramar krishna and he found the moment he heard siram krishna is telling something to the devotees his mind became quiet tranquil and he got so much of attraction in one word only and that's why he forgot to mention the particular date of his first meeting but the assumption is saying that in in by though those things that time siram krishna was known to the light of the society the very knowledgeable people of the society this other keshav and joseph cook he was an american he went to calcutta keshav chandra took him in a boat and siram krishna also traveled with that and that is a wonderful way that they are telling assalam krishna so much afraid when he heard that one american is coming he doesn't know american or british the white skinned person shahib is coming and he constantly he was going to toilet coming and praying to mother mother what will happen shrive is coming how i don't know anything i can speak a single word in english how are you understand how i will talk how he will think all this just like a child he was so much afraid but the moment he went over there he found there's nothing the knowledge from within that came it doesn't bother about the university or other knowledges that proves the existence of god and all powerful god the moment he went an ordinary person from a village without any proper education any training and he met two wonderful person great personalities keshav singh and joseph cook but both of them with folded hands they were sitting before him so here after that see more came to him so maybe that this 23rd february uh 1882 siram krishna in a boat sailed with this two person in the ganga in mid afterwards so obviously his birthday was also observed 18 february 23rd february this thing happened then afterwards when he's coming maybe that in the first week of may 1882 he is meeting him sirama krishna already having some disciples 1879 dr ram gather and monument king those who are accustomed to that all these names they will understand how only from 1880 we can say up to 1886 six years only and his great disciple vivekananda only ten years and he himself only six years that was sufficient to give this vast knowledge to the humanity 1879 ramadan they are coming to sirama krishna 1880 kedah shurendra chunning lattu nani gopal they all came i am telling these names because afterwards again and again we will come to know about this people personalities this siram krishna used to accept different things from his surrender he used to love it is not some there will be some people having lot of money they are spending also for that but god may be not accepting their donations there sometimes it so happen most of the time we have seen one person came with 10 000 rupees in those days and salaam krishna said no i don't like to accept even holy mother also said no but that siram krishna used to tell to the surrender can you please bring this thing for me that thing told me he aims to use is very poor pure and these we cannot explain why this happened but this is true and here we find that in 1881 narendra modi 1881 86 he passed away 16 august 1886 sriram krsna passed away and this people came came in only 1881 here we find that master masha is attracted to siram krishna but just hearing only one single word only one single sentence what is that siram krishna is telling when hearing the name of warrior rama wants you shade tears and your hair stands on him then you may know for certain that you do not have to perform such devotions as the sandhya anymore see with so much authority he is telling you need not to do any other performances the moment just by hearing the name you found find joy and all joy means so much the joy is coming within your heart and then you need not to bother about and that is with the authorities telling because this is called spirituality a religion means there are three steps first is religion ritual sexually in the religion there is a ritual if we take the religion the word religion not dharma only religion then it has three states fast is the ritual it's very very essential without ritual it is difficult to move towards god in the ritual one must be very very careful by washing the hand and feet and wearing the washed clothes then only they'll enter and with all great devotion they must prepare and do all these things and then wherever i found some people they'll be bringing this type of flowers wherever some nice flowers are there they brought it they'll be cooking for some food for god and they're so happy when they are the berlin for whom for god one lady came she purchased one you know a flower garland and she wanted to see that siram krishna is putting on that that was there she took the picture i brought that berlin and sriracha is wearing it this is devotion and that way all these things happen this is ritual if you stop over there this is the problem ritual is the beginning only as you are going to school going to college with university and going to the laboratory to get knowledge and when you go over there slowly slowly slowly different stages of knowledge comes to us similarly in religion first aid is ritual second morality love thy neighbor as thyself in islam also use they say distribute all that you have and then go for hajj hajj means the people they'll be going to the main source and this in our places also they say that you do these and do that and wonderful thing is ghana so many things that you because only those who have understood what is god they only can give some donation not all others sometimes they'll be helping you know that's why swami vivekananda say give or should kneel down with great humbleness suppose you are not helping a person do you think he will die not at all he will survive some other way but when you are helping with an attitude that god has come to me and i am helping even the doctors the lawyers different professions the teachers everywhere only this thought helps god has come to me and i am helping the god but if you go on telling oh god please come then there'll be a problem because the person whom you are subbing as god doesn't know that he called his grace problem one boy was running and one dog was chasing the boy walking his friend was in a distance he said hey why you are running don't you know the working dog doesn't fight i know does the god know i don't know the dog it was barking and chasing and the boy was running when his friend said barking dog doesn't guide he said i know it but it does so similarly you know that they are god but they don't so you have to work in such a way knowing within there is nothing but god coming in this form so here siram krishna is telling and master mosha is attractive in a bengali song is there about mother kali it's a unique song i just speak a few words quoting this in bengali i can understand what is real mother is how is she i only heard the name kali and i am so much attracted to her i have not seen her i didn't see her only i heard the name kali and my mind is attracted to her so that is from the past birth is comes master with his friend going over there his name but he is not attractive he is not telling that he will go and sit at the feet of siram krishna and listen his words no nowhere once only he do and he we don't know whether he visited again or not but master masha is thinking i must go  this or not why a rebar theory that proves the rebirth attraction to god aversion to worldliness attraction to god only undo abortion to worldliness that is also necessary unless until we have that we won't be able to go both the things you cannot have only one could do in a wonderful way that was king janaka so he he was rajashi rishi but the raja same time there's no attachment when his kingdom was burning people came running oh king your kingdom is burning you know what am i to do people are there they'll be trying i cannot do anything he was quietly sitting there with a tranquil mind can we do it our small thing if it could get lost immediately one person came and he said that swamiji this pain i have brought for you then he wanted to bring it out and it slept from his hand it was falling down i was so much i almost jumped and cast it because it is my pain now he didn't deliver it to me he only said so much of attachment we are having the moment you say that i will give it to you immediately it becomes you tell the children i will give you this thing and that thing every evening the moment you are returning back from office papa where is that when you are going to him he never forgets that why the moment you say immediately the attachment aversion by iraq here at the next class maybe in the sunday when we will be discussing about the meditation maybe we will be discussing about the rocky how the without weight we cannot move towards god you must have to have and what type of idea one person was eating puffed rice and he never gave anything to anybody but suddenly there was a gust of wind and some puffed ripe rice it just scatter immediately he said vishnu in the dharma anyway whatever is gone i am now offering to vishnu at least i cannot pick it up from that dirt and eat when it has gone let it go to vishnu i may get some punya so that way your people they behave that's called samsari so much attest to all these they cannot forget but still they practice religion why we will discuss afterwards but here we find the wonderful character sri moan and we will hear sri ramakrishna's assessment of this person about sri lanka and then when he is noting down the words there is no ego nothing at all sometimes the editor of the newspapers or a newspaper maybe they have to do particularly the magazines of the books editors will edit in such a way the writer will read that who has written it he'll understand not understand that it was his article only he is editing everything all words sentences changed everything that's not everything and why he is editing in that fashion editor is supposed to see that the facts and figures are correct then the pronunciation punctuations are all right spellings are all right references are there and then published he has nothing to do with that because every writer has his own way of expression and that is the beauty of writing so here also why it works like that ego everywhere we see here when he is going and asking he has not that ego why he is dispassioned about the world that aversion about the worldliness and he never won the name fame and all these things of the world and he has the inclination towards god so he is going to that the people go to temple but do not come to listen to the discourses why you see if you go to temple you go to churches and all that there'll be so many people will be going there they're holy for some holy cause only they are doing but then what do you do in the temple then you have to go into first you have to put off the shoe and what walk and then you have to purchase or you have to take the puja and there are so many gods and goddesses are there in the hindu temple it is so confusing so many gods and goddesses are there then one after another you have to go we do not know we'll be angry it's better to go and bow down to everyone and then and this vishnu i like so 10 but shiva okay one dollar will do like this your whole is after all these things we come down and there is also prasada that also sometimes frees sometimes we purchase and the children are there playing we are also forcing them bow down over here these things will happen it actually there almost every week we come there's no problem why because our mind is actually turbulent and when we go to the temple of this light it tallies with our mind ask that person to sit for 10 minutes quiet over there he won't be able to do that is the most difficult thing to do ask that person why you are coming over here to get the blessing so that no bad things will happen to our family so like these only they go so if you will see one person came to us and he was telling why there are so many cards and so many people here nothing nobody is there i feel at least you are here at least to tell these things you have come that will do and now sit and take a cup of tea with me and let us have some discussions about no i don't have time you know some other day will come so what so he went why because the philosophy the knowledge sriram krishna again and again he is telling when you are coming listen to me that is unless and until that first step of ritual that is good and then second step you have to go morality how can you develop that the love for all being how can you develop that sadhu the company of holy person that you have to otherwise it will be so difficult here the master master he comes back again after visiting all those he's coming why so much attraction you know once when sirama krishna was praying to mother kali the mother said assuring him i and you are one he was telling mother kali ma you be with me all the time just like a small child the child doesn't understand the mother is other work also no you must be with me all the time krishna was praying to the divine mother in that way and divine mother assured to me our army you and me are one and master masha is attracted to kali through siram krishna he is coming and here master masha is mentioning it's trained in english manner who would not enter into a room unannounced when he came back all other people lived salaam krishna was alone the door was absorbed and he was inside and masturbating english manner the indian manner simply go inside don't bother anything and if you go in there some other places like tribal people if your door is open you simply enter and you'll go like say that and why you were here in hindi used to tell them in that way see here when i was coming here then some of our friends they were teaching me they were telling you go on telling please the moment you starting a sentence a word pleasing before thanks in the lecture so i have to practice almost the whole month please and thanks so like this all cuz in our place somebody will be going and the can you say how much it is time maybe the person is having a wristwatch and he will say this is this ago without thanks or anything you have a risk to watch and you are only telling me what is that's why he's categorically mentioning he's trained in english man so when the krishna was inside the room he didn't simply open and enter he was trying to knock then there was a lady a maid servant her name is brinde and this bindi he asked is the holy man in and she replied yes he is in the room how long has he lived here him wanted to know about the holy person oh he has been here a long time he came almost at the age of 18 19 with his elder brother and you know that life of sirama krishna then aim asked a wonderful question does he read many books you know the knowledge means books well from knowledge we get you have to say so many things you have to quote from different people and if you can quote from different you know writers that means you are a great auditor unless you can quote the great auditor like that only people think and naturally aim he thought he must be reading a lot of books bindi was just a main servant but she answered i don't know a unique way she answered books oh dear no that's all on his tongue boy now is not no one has noted it down written from the intellect we write so many things from the intellect and there will be some people who will be using the language in such a way beautiful manner and we all clap but that is not knowledge knowledge is something else and here the brinde without knowing the truth she told the correct things he's all on his tongue because veda is coming from god the knowledge is coming from god and then only it reaches the hearts of others veda is or borussia is not created by any person then aim just finished his studies in college it amazed him to hear that sirama krishna read no books you know in the coffee shops or when you were going to some people's parlors some people would be talking about and they will say are you reading that oh wonderful and they'll be quoting some books and the writer whether you read or not you must have to purchase just to be on that and there will be so many books you can find in the shelves of the people that maybe they have not actually seen all the books and is still pasted to to pages may be pasted so why because we think without book it is impossible we must have to so he was wondering perhaps it is time for the evening devotion another thing he is telling him perhaps it is time for his evening devotion may we go into the room will you tell him we are eager to see him the sending the information fast and then we are eager to see him maybe that he is in because in the evening time usually the people will be meditating tilling the beat etc etc but about he has already completed all those things with full knowledge the god himself he was sitting sometimes some people out of sheer practice you know we made the routine then afterwards routine actually run us it's good to make a routine but afterwards we become so much so there will be routine only that will run us sometimes some people they follow so here he was thinking that maybe that he is having the evening prayer etc some people came to siram krishna sat before him and the moment it was dark immediately they closed their eyes and took out their b and started taking the name of god before sitting god and what god said why you are doing all those things here it is not necessary what is the necessary for your map to reach nowadays you don't see the map there is a here every time that in the car one machine is there you know you need not to see even it will go on telling you take the left take the right leg then you are in nepal and when you are in nepal you have to only find out the number of the house all that much so like this when we are taking the name of god meditating for what when you reach god when we have reached the god god is sitting before us but we don't know they can't understand the god and now we have kept the picture we are worshiping we are closing our eyes we are constantly praying and that time people even when they were sitting before the living god could not understand so that is i am illusion here go writing children go and sit down brinda is tilling because brinda knows everything about siram or krishna so you're still go inside and sit over there it's no problem so this is the uniqueness the most of the time the people will be having so many paraphernalia don't come near don't do this don't do that you don't like to explain you don't why you know there are many things to hide when the simple person will be there his life is open book you know anyone can come and read it that is the simplicity and when you are complicated you like to hide something then the restrictions come don't calm this thing that thing will be there so simplicity that is essential and i know that i can never do anything wrong if anybody is coming to me what is there if anybody wants to talk about me what is there people are so scared that someone will criticize let them say what is there why should i be afraid of so much because i want please if anybody is criticizing me maybe that he has seen something is good can we think in that way that is called positive thinking the moment you think like that there will be no tension otherwise somebody will come and tell you whisper this type of words they don't say loudly they'll whisper do you know he came to you now he is telling this this this thing about you you will be immediately burning without inquiring is really he told it or not why this thing because we have so many things as a desire we want to hide we want to get and that's why we cannot understand what god is here we'll see how siram krishna is behaving with other people when they are entering into it siram krishna's room he entered this is very very very important it's not the room he's entering he is entering into the sanctum sanctorium where god is there when if we read only his room he's entering now he's entering he's going towards god how he asks somebody can i go in you go brinde is giving the permission here we can say it is guru who is actually introducing we are confused shall i go to god will he be angry guru says no go and sit before him talk to him and listen to him in a simple manner guru will guide us but guru cannot come along with us and can say everything for us no that is we have to do so bring the here the only simple mate and she is guiding as if as a guru to master who was in those days past aiming and was getting ready to go to london first ics examination and all that now this he went go writing children go and sit down the brinde calling master marsha yes sir go no oh sir you can go no she is telling children both were there shidu and master marshay and that's why addressing them as children the mother the affection mother always wants the children should go to a holy person so that their character will also develop yesterday only one gentleman came and he was telling he knows and he is also i think organizing the sunday class as they call it sunday class something like that and the children will come etc our parents are also eager to send their children to sunday class so that they get the impression of this thing that is essential like that as if the ordinary lady sending this master master master masjid went over there it was task siram krishna was sitting and he was talking where do you live what is your occupation why have you come to baranaga this is also very special sriracha is asking the master master why we will afterwards in the next tuesday when we're reading this we'll come to know because master maha was not an ordinary person surrounding the moment he glanced he understood and that's why he is inquiring where you live and what is your occupation now and why have you come to varana just opposite to the nation it's in calcutta and doctrination is the opposite so here after this we will conclude and now we will chant that name of god the i think you are already having um i'm here okay i'll just uh say one word and then you can continue with me repeat with me is you know in indian languages anjana is a black type of thing that they use usually to the eyes etcetera anjana here means that the strain in the character that you are neeranjana there is no stain in your character how can this be because unselfishness god is perfectly unselfish the moment i have somebody as me and mine but you think oh this should be for me and that should be for sometimes it so happen when you are very close to some devotee any good thing is coming has come then the good thing will put it aside oh it's for him that is no connection like that it's all equal whoever comes first we give if it is there you take or done so that is called means totally unselfish nithyanan eternal ananta rupam goddess god is having so many forms what are those forms this all that you see the men women children old all living beings and everything that you see in this universe is nothing but god in different names and forms and then why he takes the form out of compassion to bless the devotees is just taking accepting that body big means the body is the highest god that you i bow down to you bow down my head once again we will just repeat it on krishna you thank you uh our next class will be on friday at 7 30 on qatar uber nation next saturday as i already told you that we'll be going to ganges and sunday as usual will be why we meditate like that that one over that in morning 11 o'clock and next tuesday also the same our the punjab we will discuss thank you very much
