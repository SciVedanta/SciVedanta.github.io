[168: Panchama Veda 168 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqtQz62YTFQ)

today we'll be discussing three very interesting and important topic the ceramic business in the way that has to give the answer by that we will be giving the answer but these are very very important from a development the spirituality but as usual let us chant this mantra and we start discussing about this rhythm jeevan KO be rewritten commercial shravan among three Matata tongue booby green and ee hula dodging are only through these words the words of God's words of the realized soul only through those words one can get the life of eternity umbrella tov oh god ha Amrita so your words is nothing but the negative the and you get the life of eternity this eternity what is this eternity means of course not the body then what so today I was just discussing with someone that the people after some age to be get a little frustrated sometimes suffering but if you go and look at the holy people that if they are realized Souls very elderly people maybe 90 years old but still in great joy why because they keep their gold in a very high level and that's where the process is continuously going on and right trying to reach over there so we will discuss that but Raghavan see Ramakrishna is telling the process should be continuous and reaching to that highest goal after that there is nothing remain to achieve the complete satisfaction total satisfaction will come and that is called unbreak that is called the nectar and it's called eternity and that is called Mukti so this mean we can understand now he refined alabanza Ramakrishna she's talking they're having a conversation with an actor who came to perform induction Asia dictionary show you know that definitely in the olden days the temples of the Hindus those were the places where people is to come and perform and different type of show different type of things it's not only the the ritualistic worship and all many other things is to happen and that's going into temple you always find a sanctum sanctorium garbha mandir and then not Mandira deer in that not Mandira the all different type of things is to happen these people came this stage at drama many people came of saw and all those things then there'll be discussions debates on some topics all those things they is to have that and this person the actor main actor he came it was the distribution noted in the page number 429 at the gospel of Salaam Tichenor here we find the solution is talking anything do you different duties in the world fixing your mind on God do you different duties in the world then second fixing your mind on God mom a new smother you Durga in the Bhagavad Gita so in Krishna is telling asking Arjuna go on remembering me and then you fight you Dodger the activity like killing people in the world but don't forgive me beating the name of the god or remembering me so that is the require the question is there are two things serrano krishna is singing but practice is necessary and one should also be alert do your different duties in the world fixing your mind on God then he said but practice is necessary and one should also be alert so this is spiritual training and otherwise we won't be able to do we see so many things and we forget that we are supposed to remember God suddenly we become open now I have to remember God again I bring the mind back and it started repeating the name of God and looking at people different things are happening announcement is going on so many things in the airports and other places but you are repeating and say again you were forgetting again you're becoming alert so the alertness should be there how it will come alertness the effort and there's wisdom Krishna see practice is necessary without the practice you won't be able to do every day every moment you have to try failure is obvious every moment and slowly slowly you start walking when the child starts walking so many times it will fall but then again getting up and working getting up and walking and the mothers they will inspire the children come up get up you can walk you can walk come come come like that and they will go on learn practice makes a man perfect Oh PRC to continue that obvious repeating the name of carp is an operation but the question is why why we should take the name of God we can take that so other things also suppose I am meditating on something of the achievement I have a project over here and I have to complete that I am thinking in that way if you can complete the project then you get some money or your other things name fame and all that comes under Chara and two things we should remember one is juror another is chattin Chetan is conscious and juror is exactly opposite the juror is this pretty inert nothing is there and if you concentrate on that inertness ultimately what will happen to your mind you know so that is why the companies necessary holy companies necessary if you are not some people they are having to polish the girls the duties in the jail and in the prison they are all the techniques in with those people who are their minds are just like the brutes some have killed five someone like these there the way the table will they move with the way they thought everything is completely different not even the normal human life if you are having you are not a prisoner you didn't do anything but your duty is all the time with them in the company slowly slowly slowly to change is very very difficult to keep one him sometimes some people who are having and the their the duties that job is to go and find out the informations the news they will come back and reported or be and that becomes a habit than nature everywhere wherever they go they will do like that so if we were in the company of the holy people it will become holy that's where Saddam additional in one of his disciple his to practice concentration to bring down the departed souls not that was the practices so these to bring down the souls and they should talk to them and these things days to do that Salameh Tichenor told him if you are thinking about ghost ghost will you become and in the same mind you are giving to God cover a miracle so this we must understand the jeredy and the cheetah and that's why the prayer long long back in the Vedic times the prayer was a sitamma circle Maya a subtle means this temporary and this weekend we are going to discuss about the Vedanta again and again this topic will come Assad and serve these are the two things only Jura and cheetah only two things in earth and consciousness only two things and we are the particularly human being boundedness the moment we can understand that we are conscious being then our go is very far and and we can continue and continue and continue joyful way so this auto masts at the gamaya from the temporary things take me to the permanent one and Thomas Ola jyothi's Goliath same thing in different words to embrace our mind tomasa ignorance darkness thomas literally dark and each and every one wants to go to the light suppose you are traveling every man is dark somewhere you can see a lion our attention will go to that light and we like to go and reach over ba a somewhat the air they don't like the lights like the animals they try to avoid the lights because the darkness is good for them they can hunt so but the human they like to go to the light and what is that light is a symbolic light is nothing but knowledge particularly among the Hindus in every religion is the air but the Hindus are very specifically in the whole thing anything that is we are happening immediately we like to learn even in America you are not allowed to burn a lamp because it's all closed and they will go and purchase a type of electric lamp and they will light it in our 150th depth from any vehicle in this birthday anniversary or devotees purchase 150 lamps that was decorated and our firm he came and press that button immediately other wine without the language not anything as long as we think of something is missing we should burn a light - laughs symbol of knowledge we have forgotten that but we are practicing we have to constantly be alert Thomas OMA Joe Teague Maya we must go to the Jyothi that knowledge and who can give the knowledge who has occurred and what is that knowledge conception of one that is the knowledge conception of one is the knowledge hundreds of books are there yoga Vasishta shop then these things that so many so many a Sonia are we we are going on selling so many books but what actually they are speaking only one thing only one thing that is from ignorance comes to knowledge so what is the ignorance understanding things as mean and what is knowledge one from one everything has come and then we try to understand how from one so many has come there is a naja column that is lecture in that book the many become one or one recommended something the title is there so this way then ripped or muharram gamaya the last the tree line birds is very very popular among the Hindus aceituna Satya Maya thomas uma jyothika Maya and Wilma what to meta means temporary and unwritten Amrit is permanent it and this hombre the eternal eternity that we are thinking and what that can be now sometimes the bell Anthony will give the example like a drop of water coming down from the sky and surrounding we become this also explaining in a nice way and it is shouting all I am going to lose my individuality and then it falls in the ocean the drop of water tiny little drop of water it becomes ocean itself so that is called from birth to birth we go back to the source now as because we are not this moment we are not very much aware about the source and we always think what is there now present this condition is all right shall we go over there what will happen the wind I was asked by our headquarters below got to go to Andaman and you know the Honda Honda particularly in India and there's a kala pani that you have to cross the ocean and there is no chance to coming back Britishers they went on to the beautiful island but still very good when I was doing I was thinking where I'm going I just knowing so many people who were here so many Hmong so many brothers and the osama's and I am going well I do not know and the as it happens I was sailing so the fourth is sailing from Calcutta and the moment is to the ocean where the river and the ocean is meeting but if Calcutta port is a river port oh my god and it was tossing like anything you would shitty but just like in a small pot it was tossing all people a committee and they were I saw the bodies enrolling people they can't hold their rolling in there so so many things happen and I was thinking where we were going and after reaching over there what will happen after that four days when I reached over there I found some of the boys and the people they are all holding the saffron colored flag and when I came out the shouted Swamiji Swamiji everywhere that same God is there so I remember the few lines of Ravindra not pure no Abbas jdj job a morning every morning till Aniki hobby in Bengali the revenue not exciting when we give up the whole thing and we constantly go on thinking what is going to happen to us anxiety no too near magic to me Puritan shikata GA Lajoie I do God every everywhere that I forgot wherever I go seeing God in different forms different names is there the death if we can remember the brittle ma am rotten jam'iyyah will you are leaving all this we are going to the eternity so the Sahaba Krishna is telling again that practice practice is necessary again and again you have to remember whenever you are moving tsunami I stay over there in a room and I have made the office over here amid people hood here who work over here this is a very good in-between I am constantly crossing this room so we never I am going and looking at tackle I am going to my room and coming back and going to my office so constantly I can communicate with Tucker and whoever comes to go to tackle and all this then we discuss about why different pictures why different symbols the constant practices goes on and you reading books and listening music and easily we had to and then sometime we think that if this world is temporary the one gentleman I went to Canada and then one gentleman's were asking if this world is temporary then why should he work I will try not to work and see what happened only a day not even in a few hours then you jump up and go to some mall at least if don't but if you don't purchase you will go on with the window shopping you have to keep yourself busy we cannot sit like that so in the bhagavad-gita understanding the psychology of the human being there many Gita is sailing pratikriya Minardi gunaih karmani sarvasah the problem your leisure will provoke you force you to go and do some work you cannot stop you must have to do that pratikriya mana near nature will provoke you to go and do so we will do the work why not do it in a way by which we can realize the eternity we can realize the Hartman and the God and hear the sadhana business dating again the gentleman is asking say what is the rule that the soul is separate from the body he is asking that see if the person who is asking - Salam krishna we also received this that you question again and again and this question also comes crosses our mind many times where is the proof we are coming to and then worshipping and then but where is the proof we never saw anything so the dead true now why we ask for proof because the human being is having only five sense organs by which they can conceive otherwise they cannot the only these five sense organs sometimes some people who are blind their one organ is absent but other organs - that they die - when you are introducing someone hey this is mr. su and so if the blind man will come and touch your face and touch your body so that they tried to true touch the neck to get them idea how you are and then the sound till the smell but the five organs a normal person using the five organs suppose beyond that what will happen so that is called science proof God can be seen now look at this this gentleman is asking what is the proof that there is a soul this art on the God and sadhana mystery is telling proof now what sentence is using that word is in God can be seen who is he octa insensitive skull after a PTA after after means realized one and so without any hesitation he's saying God can be seen and when we say that we after reading some business book and other books we say there is admin and if somebody convincing if you stand before us and say no but there is not now will you say like that maybe I said let me let me try again so we are not convinced now green one who knows what is word if they say don't say no I know that so this is the thing that's why realization realization is so essential without that the other ization you have not started your journey the shaman is telling religion is realization so many people will be talking about the God and so many different ways and they think that we should do this we should do that but when you ask how you say like that now this is I have read this and after reading this is your idea it may be different so that's why the philosophers are all different but after the realization they become one the convincing ways dramatist is technical of the baqia so we will come to that point also the proof is necessary naturally without that how can you proceed but the problem is the thing that we are going to prove cannot be seen or touch or smell and nothing you cannot test God can you because no you cannot taste God you can touch God you cannot see God you couldn't smell God you cannot hear from God and then you have to be means that it is gone how it is possible so majority of the people they say we don't believe in God that is very comfortable we just say that there is no God and they see only the physical world the believe in that time distance stealing and some people they will need to use the signs and Sciences these science is that science and religion there are so many lectures and books are there surroundings are simply brushing it aside science and religion cannot be why because something which you are going to feel that you cannot prove through this five sense organs that's why he is telling proof immediately he said God can be seen because he's convinced by practicing spiritual discipline one sees God a so clear by practicing spiritual discipline one sees God if you in the one of our Swami ji he was an a very bright student of capital diversity he's meek not Shahar of this very famous person and the personality in scientific world he was his classmate once he came to meet and say hey why you have left you are a bright student of the university you have left and now you're here seven eight and doing this and that why unless ruling tell me about God can you tell me can you convince me about God then he said dare over there one person is plowing the land can you go and teach him your mathematics your science and know that it's not possible because he is not having the base knowledge so he has to go and have developed the only we can go and talk to him the same way you go and practice this thing then I will teach you what is God - Yama and niyama yama means the internal purity and external purity these yamas and Yama's these are the two words only to later world Yama why he gave me and in a way I am in Yemen these are the two words unless and until you are having those two you some new used listening to all this huh some intellectual satisfaction because the speaker is very convincing and then you'll be putting all the arguments and you get high yes after five minutes everything done again you have to go and listen again here - why we cannot retain it because we are not trained because we have not given our mind into that that's reasonable Krishna is telling the Rishi's directly realized the self one cannot know the truth about God through science here he used the word science what is it science is that is constantly trying to understand things through the external way how can you prove it in the level three if you prove oh this is there now we cannot now the DNA test they're doing of the Rishi's if what is speciality in them that you cannot prove in that way then some people are also thinking that and the cloning system is slowly developing it may be that sometimes they will grow and become under hundreds Vivekananda think of the problem every coordinate Vivek on the standing like this and giving the what happened think of the problem that if the Jesus is everywhere and asking a brought the boat at your back and follow me look at these people walk he then clothing we create lot of problem then well no it is not possible neither even possible so we can reach to a great extent but are timid reaching to God and realize God and then transforming yourself into that godhood is only spiritual practices that what is this science gives up information only about things perceived by the senses look at Saddam efficient he never attended any school but idea is so clear science gives us information only about things perceived by the senses that means the realisation of the art man realization and God is not an information and that's why they use realization suppose someone is from some particular place and then if you talk about thing about that place he says no no said you are making the mistake I am from that particular place I know what is what so the convene conviction come after being over there after realizing that then only you can understand me I know that maybe a little bit of development has come previously too small small houses nowadays big houses that may be there but I know those places so naturally you cannot convince others in that way so these you have to move over there for this reason a man cannot comprehend spiritual things with these ordinary intelligence but nothing intelligence means maybe they are very very highly intelligent they can remember so many things they can understand so many things but religious things are completely different again and again the Rishi's they are all telling completely different Jesus never activated school but rainey spoke thousands of people listened and when he came after that millions they followed him do you think in just accident some people came and they they propagated about Jesus and then for the last two thousand years millions of people are following him because of that same thing about the good the same thing about the Hindu the religious teachers it is not possible there must be something very special that is attracting people and then few of them are truly reaching to the same goal and then coming back and again inspiring others I have received that you can also please go otherwise not so this it says if the disease to understand him he must leave in the company of holy persons with the holy person realized Souls holy person does not mean only taking the Ganges water and taking some name of God and walking slowly talking sweetly is not the only person is a good person but holy person is completely different and convinced about God you cannot just say ignore me you will never even understand anything else holy person means but that is completely personal and if you go to him talk to him living that company whatever he does that means value to be good so that is called a holy person one cannot explain the vision of God to others the vision of God cannot be explained to others that is worth ceramic is names telling now the here we find in the Vedanta they have done a lot of research how to realize God not a brahmana this is very unique we the peaks of science and we subjected to only prom on Ramadan is blue production Divac drama and simple human inference and then art comes out there are other trees also but majority the main with antic schools they accept only these three production Hanuman and shut up and funny we become distressed and to protection shut up shut the means the words of the scriptures and those who have realized their words Duskull shut up so many books are there so many people are writing that won't help me with the wastage of time and so many people will be reading so many things and after that they are terribly confused now that's a totally wastage of time even by the grace of God the hack type of mentality has developed the desire has come to understand God it is better to read only those books those words but realized people that's why this to say read only gospel of sedimentation first then the mother's words then slowly Vivekananda Ramananda to the end the those who are interested in bethalto if you read the latest sub from iturriaga but without the means you should have some basic idea otherwise you won't be able to understand so that's why this if you read the later subscribe to the ananda full live adult but he is writing to the ordinary people so naturally he is even toned down so much so this wonderful and the practical way to practice daily the spirituality the words of Shani Brahmananda the spiritual the discussions that Shami brahmana and the direct support of Shani Saddam vishna so these are the words that's called the chapter and then come Prakash in-between come on aman inference so what is that inference whoever has practiced spirituality has developed a wonderful life all of them are satisfied and all of them are free from desires all of them so that proves something special must be there that I discuss on you man is there God now what is that God complete satisfaction so naturally as because there is no other desire this satisfaction comes from where the desire when there is no desire at all there is no problem suppose you are traveling and you don't have any other engagements you have a lot of time so naturally if they say they announce one hour late the flight is one hour late and there are so many shops of the air then other things around so the one on that good let us go and she what is there so you go and then you take and one hour is good and those who are having the something you have to reach over the area to catch another flight connecting flight or to do this and that they will be oh why avoid this lead and what will happen to us like this do do so if you have the free from one of those desires the same problem it is a joy for you and those who are having the desired the problem believing to be suffering so this is the thing in the world you see so uh naman I mean some people the religious people must be satisfied people if there is not satisfaction they are not religious people through criticizing others they will be talking in about others and you visited that man which don't go this fine let them go only question about Christians telling us because you are new try to hold one and then develop then other words you were free and he gives the example when a small tree is sprouting it he needs the strong fencing otherwise the animals will come and then eat it up but the way that tree grows up it becomes a strong banyan tree two to three a difference even if you are tying down nothing happens the street you'll that is also like that before or in the beginning itself if you go to different places and living here and there who here against was good this is nirvana then some people say Norte some people say we did and some sad like that different technical things you were then ultimately after five six years they were totally confused there's a no it was better as I was the desire came to realize the truth but it is unfortunate that God has not given you that guidance so the bonamana you have to understand very clearly what is religious life on endure if the on earth is not there that means I should not go over there and suppose you go to a university what is the purpose of that to getting in that University knowledge and then you look at that there is no classes no timing and the professors are not proper and so many difficult device to go over there when you naturally when we go to anything even to the restorer we go and check over here what the cooks what are the best how many stars they are having then only we go and sometimes we make the mistake of course but still most of the time so no mana is the main thing for us so who will help us to get the Hanuman charger and shut the means the scriptures when you reading it is giving us that that contain what will happen they will come we will have our own realization and then they will say I myself will say yes in the venetie correctly the rishi said children they are the buildin the salabhasana all the doubts are cut asunder and there is no bondage at all I have realized that so this is the way we go when he was asking then Saddam Krishna he'll then next question was how does one realize the Hartman he is asking that man though is an actor but in those days people is to study the stitcher and all the drama acceptor was on only on the different estate of subjects so he's a steeled how does one realize that hard money and look at this and this Friday Saturday I'm going to talk on that then I got this the toggles words he said he watched me about the self-realization I'm skipping some of the other things here another thing I just like to mention the one of his disciple rocket after version brahmana he came cinema Krishna was asking why you have not taken food go and take the fourth and Alma's sattva then ceramic crystal turned to these people why you people are also hungry why don't you go and take the food from the temple and what they say they say all of us don't have the same opinion about the food so our food is cooked separately there are we it is a dimple only and the good for God and offered to Macaulay and then money they are not ready to give me another ready to take it even the errors of discrimination is a my god his guard this guard that guard his super God only and they offered it is a bully whatever maybe the guard but the thing is given to him that also is not that idea is not there he's asking about Darkman never the god realization the basic thing is not clear they are thinking majority of the people will be talking about food only religion means first full and what is the food and then we go on coating from others hardest this up this is what is the haha only eating to the mouth knows when you are collecting information through all the five senses uh or Anna collecting the information through different sense organs is also harder and when it becomes suta sutra means unselfish then only we can pure not through taking things to the tongue if you feel is okay Solano kishna in a everything he always gives the answer and guide them here it's simply known these people when the gentleman door why didn't all of you take your dreams and wish to say they say all of us don't have the same opinion all of us don't have the same opinion about food what means this temple food see Rama Krishna himself got some special food from Kali temple and their versa in the Dutch in Asia different type of people is to come sannyasins to practice spirituality with great love and affection salaam peace to st. uh spoke to him and told the person he told go and tell I have given and is a special food let him take it but that man you know what he did he threw it again a Kali temple food I don't touch he was there living over there and he threw that those things salam Krishna became very angry and he said hi he could give it to somebody else why he listed the food and that to the pure and sacred food offered to Macaulay he insulted Colleen that way I feel that somebody should give him a good beating [Music] the moment he said look at it he never said like that and it became proof that man started fighting with some of the local people they were all gardeners and he waved and started fighting with them and all the gardener's ultimately started beating him and the Temple Authority had to ask him to go away from there so whatever he said one should be very very careful just by that respectfully if you say sir I cannot take this food because still my mind is not open so I'd like to give it back it's okay no problem so that's wisdom occasion of any heart here I find we start giving the answer to that not pursuing them to go and take the food he's simply ignoring that why in the bhagavad-gita I can say now about the rhythm generate a bee Onam karma sanguinem now sometimes some people they will come and take this is the religion that is the religion we do not do so Kay that's for you no problem go ahead but remember that religion means everything good so whatever you do you see the transparent transformation should be good you are becoming a good person did much nothing else so whatever practices you are between I have nothing to say but you should look at the result of it so there but then he is going to directly to the answering this question you asked me about self-realization longing is the means of realizing Hartman and we always talk about the realization of the brahman Brahma Gianna Artem Gianna what is the basis of that the one person is coming from far away and going on writing to us can you please help me how can I go and then used to why because the the lecture he want that person wants to listen and that it's appropriate under Jesus but what is all full non online go and somehow if necessary we purchase attained and we will take camp or somewhere like this so eager good but for what is it really that you go and hear some lecture to benefit you of course then if it does as maximum people come under great divide into that man this is good for our awesome but what about those people you see after some time that a Friday usually people don't come Saturday after half day slowly is becoming less and less but they will go back and say we attended that for the benefit so I really feel the benefit should be there once you are going you must understand but before that the basic thing is a man must try to attain God with all his body with all his mind and with all this space those who have read the bhagavad-gita particularly 17 chapter 14 15 16 sloka you must remember the Sri Krishna is also telling that way Guide bar chick monastic tapasya the  bar cheek and monastic tapasya and just remind you cinema each dimension that longing is the means and I must have to realize that Hartman that is the first thing and the longing will never come if you don't have the clear conception will never come that longing so that is this two basic thing then comes the practices what is the practice either for teens look of the Bhagavad Gita diva DJ good practice Fujinon shogen RG bomb Brahma charger or him such a char enum W chubby this is the fourteenth verse seventeen chapter not over Gita very clearly mentioned worship of the Devers that you have to worship the god some of why because the other depository are the manifestation all best best ideas tezcan God that doesn't mean just you know that different type of gods they're there then there between these them are harming others that's not God Curtis is the manifestation of all divine qualities so when I am worshipping that I am also developing those divine qualities so worship of the tables then the twice-born and gurus twice-born means brahmana white rice ball I was ignorant now I have become in the life of knowledge so that's called twice-born the brahmana in our Hindu caste there is a different caste is they're called brahmana they always stick the yep tofu Vita and they say twice for there is a different but here krishna mentioned those who have crossed the ignorance and come to the life of light or knowledge or untight is called so you must be very very thankful today my humble to tame than the Guru's who are helping you to go towards God wise people they are not gurus but they are wise they're realized people they are giving you so many ideas through their realization then purity what is the purity according to genre Vivekananda unselfishness a multi-column or katene indicate a immortal and that is concerned business when we are born we come like this the impurity all our teachers will go on till impure as ecological then ultimately we become like the Lord put look at your back that the statue is sitting like this all yours everything you take because I don't want and that is called purity the straightforwardness the way we are thinking about things you should really straightforward countenance that attention should be to that realization non-injury and these are the austerity of the body the physical austerity the physical hostility how many of us can practice the physical austerity - we are going to realize God we are going to devise art man we are going to listen about the brahman is there any preparation is there and we teach some of our seniors and Ramiz they are teaching this to our Brahma Giants who already practiced three years or years practices they come then they are learning and the information is given to the householders because they're all busy people engaged in different things so information is given there is something good and just keep in mind when the time comes you can start practicing not before that's why one must be then another vehicle Markham Satya Priya heater chariot swadhyaya a platinum jet bomber Parvati and that is the austerity of the speech honor to be your current vacuum the the words that I am telling to others should not confused or make the anxiety developed anxiety in them one should not select their own it would be go on would be Caramba young and then system it must be the truth and priam that must be helpful so that people they've been underst it is possible for me so these is called bhava mahabhava who practice it Marshall is Imani Debbie if you like to see how in a person all this three wonderful tapasya deal master of the manatee be the one is sharira of the qualities second in the bond and third monitor were the mental austerity the moment we talk about the austerity you always think that we should not eat food in the night or one time in the day then we should take the food and then we walk in the bear food of these and that there is nothing the people don't read the scriptures so they do not get what type of things we should do development of the wonderful qualities fighting with those lower qualities dragging our mind constantly fiscal austerity tapasya doesn't mean that you have to go all the time to him Allah and eat only the milk and the fruits diseases Manama Prasad containment so me Adam Munem Artibonite father-son suit irritate top o manasa Chetty that is in the sixteen Percy says the solidity of the mind constant all things are happening but by the grace of God you should get that so we started talking about the umbrage the conception of hundred means eternal joy B's eternal Sunrider like that how it is possible we don't suffer in body which number in mind only when you attain when in that body the mind is absent the deep bodies you are burning nothing happens to the dead body it will never Shout a what you are doing with body is dead body so this sweet serenity of the mind it all depends on the mind whose mine you need not to bother about my mind or somebody else you mind so one must be very very careful about one's own mind serenity of mind then kindness then silence and self-control honesty are more deal whatever we are doing ma team that why I am doing honesty should be there and then it comes this is called mental austerity in the next class we will discuss this qualities of leadership in details and then we'll go to other discussion of Shanti Ramakrishna so he is giving the answer to that person that actor that these are the three qualities on man must practice a marked man must strive clear in God with all these all his body all his mind with all this speech these three thing and if possible you can please go through the pages of the vertibird gita 17 chapter 14 15 16 these three slokas and in our next we will discuss about it a little and the more we discuss about these when it is asked to memorize all the 700 smokers of the bhagavad-gita only this type of few smokers very very beneficial so this
