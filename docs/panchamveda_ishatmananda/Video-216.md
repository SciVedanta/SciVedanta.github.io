[217: Panchama Veda 217 :The Pure Self Is Free From Attachment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_p7FO-Pr0Y)

this is beginning to look at home written dr. Cheever now go be a little calmer shop striven among three Martin who began de bruit dodging our province along Tichenor this clear instruction to remain somehow united with God the last time we have discussed he is asking the devotees the to remain somehow united with God and He has given the process also suggested the two method one is karmayoga another is mana yoga and about the Karma Yoga as the last time we have discussed and he is mentioning here also as because he were the householders you must perform karma what are the Karma's were the world what are the duties and responsibilities of the householders they call it five-year Jia what are the five regions do yoga resilient patriarchy really again and put a Jungian these are the five first is table yoga were the devil again to worship god or goddess every day morning you have to must have to whatever the god or goddess who believe a little puja etc second is Rishi idea Rishi is the thinkers they have given you the scripture they have discovered the truth and that truth has been given to us so reading the scripture is also a must at least one or two pages every day and second we try again remembering the ancestors remembering the ancestors are also direct gratefulness expression of the gratefulness now the Durga Puja is coming after few days there will be all the devotee induce they will go to the rivers the holy rivers and they will offer the water remembering their ancestors the white water because we know the admin has no form we will discuss that Salameh krishna is coming to that topic the admin has no form but at the same time I this moment do not understand that flawless condition so those who have given me this per the life the culture the family I remember them I am grateful to them so that is big Priyanka and the fourth is region helping the poor people the not only poor sometimes people they are that understanding thinking's are not clear so if we can counsel with them listen to their worries and anxieties and problems that is also a service so INRIA peon helping the beans and then finally who the Yankee the some of the beings all around us we should also try to imagine that we buy I mean we have to remember they are also helping us to survive so we must help them the birds reptiles there are depending on the human being we should not forget marshal dominant ABC in them the Bengal religious Indian villages so they said well you are finished with your food whatever the leftover is the air which the cows can eat you should give it to the constant wasted don't throw it away and then ultimately whatever remaining that the corner some portions of the rise and those things throw it in the water when fish will eat it but in this country I don't know they will allow or not but in our country it is possible so you go and give it to that so like that so this is called puto jung da-jung rishi idea patriarchy Orillia can put the area so we discussed that and then he said that in different stages of life different duties and responsibilities different stage in the beginning brahmacarya grhastha vanaprastha sanyasa so these are the stages and different type of responsibilities I really wonder at the time of brahmacharya when the young minds are supposed to learn they are so busy in many other things which they are not supposed to take in sanskrit they say of the Aparri is the apparel this is not your duty this is this has nothing to do with you but you are engaged thinking in that the politics and these and that they are not supposed to think about that the people are there their parents that they have the guardians of the year they will take care of the society or the problem that is coming this young minds this is their duty to only to learn learn and learn and then having the friendship and these college life means Banco say college life means complete dedication to the study no fun at all fun will come afterwards because you are intact so this is us because we are not paying attention to my duty properly what is happening I am becoming an important in the society I cannot help the society and becoming important by that we I am suffering and creating the problems in the society too so this is the sasame distance dating and again there is the another one are yoga what is the mono yoga always an every moment United with God in worldly always in every moment United with God not remembering United with God in worldly and cinema Krishna gives the examples of two great personalities one is cha Rivera another is sukadeva we know about the shoe Kadima who was not having the body consciousness at all he all the time used to march in the Hartmann so that is the way used to roam and this is a funny story I don't know where from came some more somewhere a her the sukadeva was roaming around no clothings nothing just stayed like that because just like a baby not having any body consciousness then Shiva and Parvati they were passing Parvati took it the great orphans why he should be like this she burped look at it he's not having any body consciousness he is just doing like that it's constant emerging in the brahman the Parvati no I should curse him so he cursed him if you are roaming like this go and become a camel in the desert so that sugar makes a story says he became a camel that he was roaming in there and he was also happy because camel body of the mentor II the no problem for him his mind was constantly merged in the supreme Brahman then after few days the Parvati was expecting that he will cry and he big burden the thing is happening what is this then she got curious and she let us go and see how easy she was ok let us go and the camel was roaming around hey you were a human being and now he have a come coming body so how you are now I am fine mother there's no problem for me mother I'm enjoying this body why why because when I was a human being I had to take another care for the nature's call but now because I'm an animal anywhere I can be no working for me so I am very happy so that that is a funny story but the thing is this is the way win one so young he says that we are ever and the shoe apparently your average the people is to think he can't think but used to think about the brahmana the disturber at the story now but the renunciation of the world is needful but those who God wants to be teachers of mean that this way other ones a non-fictional now comes and will read he said the renunciation is a must and mastered but those who wants to be gurus when the wants to be that is the different thing whom the God is making the gurus they must renounce and it says like this but the renunciation of the world is needful for those whom God wants to be teachers of men one who is an arch area should give up last and gold otherwise people will not take his advice when we find in the life of Jesus he met some other fisherman he said the burn your boat and follow me so that means you have to renounce the world there should not be any bondage any attachment otherwise you can never become a teacher of man what is the teacher of men through your life through your character through your behavior through your presence people will understand what is God and what is spirituality what is religion that is the teacher of men so Saddam who - name is mentioning about him then he is gaining in other bodies in the scripture you will find they will always also show as a negative also why because then you will understand it clearly what one should not do I have seen the hachaliah Rd Brahma semaj in those days it was very very popular RT Brahmo Samaj I understand that he has managed for second or third time he has grown up children and such Manor teachers say Ramakrishna the note of explanation you have mentioned about here if they say God is real than all else usually who will believe them so what you are saying you are not following that that is hypocrisy you should not do that now how people should follow you so this what Robinson our Krishna then is telling life teacher like desirable if this type of people also get some disciples everyone Ramanathan used to say all will have their followers so like teachers like disciples also but in Bengali their words ramakrishna used it is very strong but I am mentioning that here even if a sannyasi renounces lost and gored mentally but leaves with them outwardly he cannot be a teacher of men so this is very very important for the sannyasins history knowing and economic so you are leading householders life immediately is coming to the householders it is necessary for you to leave in the company of the holy men first of all the company of holy men then immediately the explaining failed in God fail in what is the faith in God how it will come by seeing that holy man holy person by seeing the holy person the free thing the existence of God will come how you will see that person always happy always equal to everyone so then you will understand how this man can live in this way all the time happy broad-minded accepting everyone and also caring for everyone how it is possible so the faith in God will come by seeing a holy person so surrounding two lines he is mentioning you were leading householders lives it is necessary for you to lead in the company of holy men one person came from back in under one there he came and he told Tommy Tommy G my mother cannot eat without moms so she will be birth mother but you know in under one the guest house is there but we don't keep there because so many hotels and restaurants are there and people have different type of choices if you give the food it's so difficult to satisfy and we were not having proper cooks too so I said you can stay but go on will be a millimeter so you can get all the good shops and food but this boy young man he told my mother she cannot eat without the company of mom so he will come you I told how many moms are there in your house the axial mother you eat with them so that they go right you were the mom take your back this is it was not a fun that the company of work it is not like that the company of a monk means not other facilities but the knowledge this is men this is very important whenever you are coming to the person you have to understand I have come over here not to get these or dad I must have knowledge knowledge of God and knowledge of God by seeing him understanding him liking him how can I die like when I see the positiveness in that person everything should be positive the one lady was asking someone gave you a glad told her a negative thing it would do you think that person is correct I told you the first I don't know but the thing is those who say is the negative way cannot be correct the break in the mind is not a good inspiration always every moment so that is that that's why the great word that there is gonna take her wrote about Shawn in Vivekananda in him everything is positive nothing negative the Wayans Rama dividend was talking about his own people the country and he was telling what is it every time you are thinking negative no no no are you going to become a negative so that is only a fatherly like in a rebuking to every is not negative comments so we this ceramic Easter is mentioning and he is giving even if one has attained knowledge one must still constantly practice God consciousness then he is explaining then afterwards someone was telling when he'll of Manila Allah gentleman he was telling Kashyap Shane's mother came here the other day the two monoliths Ramakrishna stood in to money dollar cash options mother came here the young boys of her family sank the name of Mary she went around them clapping her hands I noticed she was not much stricken with grief over teashops death she observed the first of acara here and counted at beads I was pleased to see her devotion to God so the cash option to shame the son has passed away but the mother is not that way affected the luck that moment it was but afterwards not affect why salam o krishna is appreciating because not much of attachment rather turning the mind towards God Manila Ron come on Shane he Shops Babu's grandfather was a devotee he used to sit in and till she go and repeat God's holy name then Mary Mahon teashops father was also published devotee Kashyap Chandra Shan was the leader of most a founder of the Legion of the new dispensation Brahmo Samaj but mana Valley is giving the history he is grandfather words in a common poutine if you go to Calcutta with vine still that houses their community I was waved but because Ramakrishna visited ours and the cash option was a great personality he moved the whole Indian psyche at that time so I visited that house come on duty they were very rich people and his father Perryman he was also the devoted master the son could not have been so devoted to God if the father had not been like that Luke and Vijay his father would become unconscious of the world in divine ecstasy while reading the bhagavata beecher can hardly control his emotion while uttering his name he sometimes stands up control is amore but he sometimes stand up from his seat the forms of God that Peter sees now headings are all real at each nakusha me you are know used to come to see Ramakrishna he was seeing the different forms of God when the mind comes to the throw people like to speak about God and wind speed about God the other people who they are hearing the lighting very much and when the mind comes on the sixth that is in between the two eyebrows then that person sees gods and goddesses different forms so that is exactly what happened to be here Krishna sadhana mysticism that is real most of the people they imagine so this is real PJ is really kind less one cannot realize God without being kindness and liberal-minded kindness and liberal-minded accept him all others also the majority of the time we appreciate those who are narrow-minded why because we are not very much concerned about God we are concerned about our social status political standard and economical views and he will speak about God or reality or the truth in it in their own way only the one group of people that came and told why don't you remove the advances on Tichenor practice at the Islam battle but that is a history if you don't mention after few years people will forget about what is it so this is the way they think the Hinduism will be great but I don't know you have to go and talk to the billion more people but why should we that is the truth and that is the great truth but they won't understand this is a very peculiar because this is mind is becoming so narrow so this with the Sahaba Christie himself is telling the we doubt one cannot realized car this is the key word really is God talking about God are thinking that they are propagating the god Ganesha Karthikeya D is that and they are linguistically they are jumping and doing and thinking they are doing they do not understand he's all-powerful God can could do if he wanted and without being guided less and liberabit minded this Dhamma busines is singing you will attain that priceless treasure when your mind is free from stream a moonlit on bubbly moon holy Carty in there's a group of people called wish never that's bowel the bowels they'll be singing like this and through the small small the couplets and through the music they will sing and dance and that can be printed in the minds of ordinary people or moon a little Paula Barbieri some people who think oh that must be very precious that will be very good if we can get some will understand this is God some will not like this it will go but more only katya what is the Kirti you have to stick to truth but that is the main thing have to stick to truth I went to this new Toronto and I spoke on the beacon of the effect then I was dating this that why this Hindu people particularly in India who were so truthful they were ready to give the life for the truthfulness even our grandfathers they will ever do anything if it is something Falls never do the truthfulness how come that after independence is just completely gone its truthfulness where it has gone they are so truthful forget about Rama Chandra our God our idea as because his father given the world he were ready to sacrifice and indeed dead sacrifice and about us also the ordinary people if the person before dying before remembering God he will be remembering that I took some help from those people my son you must be back back to fulness where it has gone why it has gone why we have forgotten so I'm gonna go down probably more will a party what is that Katya Katya means this simple guidance and broad-minded Saddam Edition is telling you cannot make it Ward without first carefully preparing them at the play so the moment he gives something say something immediately you'll explain unless until your mind is pure you're not going to realize God then he gives the example he says you cannot make a board without first carefully preparing the play the pot will crack if the play contains particles of sand or stone that is why the Potter fast prepares the tree by removing the sand and stones so when we are trying to do something giving the ship we must have to make the clay completely clear then only it is possible otherwise not Shankar Acharya in his famous book The Witcher domine he also mentioned the first is 1/8 1.1 ah shodhana Macario priya nina beaugeois moo moo shu monk should those who were willing to realize God but it's easier to know God just careless they can't do okay the God is also there any other things but them it is not those who are sincerely trying to understand God first and foremost thing is how you are going to realize God through this body no to the mind and what is the problem with the mind it is attached with the worldly things so what you should do you must have to detach yourself from the worldly things Todd therefore mana pseudonym got him to purify the mind that is the first thing what you do Priya Nina moksha carefully very carefully one should do that the training of the monastic life is this what is the monastic life first the faith in the existence of God second I am going to realize God third I am going to realize it through my mind fourth I have to prepare my mind how to prepare this pseudonym karyam Bisutti is a teacher it does mean Mukti Cora Filardi the moment your mind will be clean immediately he will get the God as if you are having something which is on your palm it is already on your palm we are going to get it and then we know so this way Raghavan Rama tishner and strong Swami it's long distance now mentioning the pedant Oh says that a man does not even desire to know God unless he has a pure mind friends sometimes some people only the other day when I went to bungalow burn one devotee he was asking what has happened to me how far I told you have come very very far we are not understanding this now when you were a young person have you even thought that he will sit over here for one hour and listen to the discussion of a monk or read the gospel or the kilometer or anything no but now you are doing that means you have gone to a great extent every day when there is a discussion on the gospel you feels really sorry and restless when you cannot attain that that is the sign that you are progressing you are going towards God but we always think that from now onwards and beginning no we have already began and I made a great progress that is the reason you always come and listen and then we try as best as possible the sadhana business telling be shankara's we should taste each again this mean we have to beautify the mind and this is possible otherwise it is not the Vedanta says that a man does not even desire to know unless he is you're mine now flames again and again listen to the world purity what is this purity and I always called that Jesus see bliss it that those who are pure in heart for they shall see God he has siddhaloka sneeze mentioning you can see God if you mind dispute the same words the two great personalities 2,000 years before the Jesus saved and 100 if you two hundred years before Salameh business a pure pure mind what is the priority only no desire for the worldly things that is purity no desire for the worldly things but that doesn't mean that I want to eat I want dream I don't do anything of this in the to survive no that is not wrong thing whatever is necessary I must do but at the same time not with attachment rather understanding these are all temporary things it is going to change no just am living with them enjoying that much when it is raining I use the umbrella this is nothing wrong oh why you shouldn't use the umbrella but there was a group of people at the time and at the wrong conception comes the monk should not use umbrella wrong should not use the shoes bow should not use the upper gardeners and even today if you go of course because it is a very warm place the southern side of India states of India that we are body take good that doesn't mean that is really even here also I have seen some people the other day when I saw it and gentlemen completely we are body working he is thinking he has seen he is from the southern states of India he has seen from his childhood the religious people are on his bare body so he thought in America also good that that they does not call and outside they are body use it must be a very educated person must be a either a doctor or an engineer most of their Indians the error like that are scientists and professors but look at it wrong conception he is thinking put off the dress or the garments on the upper body is a religion nothing like that nothing like this we cannot get we cannot understand unless we listen to distinct words the pure mind is necessary and what is the pure mind the thinking the only Ganga water and boiling the that double boiled rice it is nothing like that pure mind means no attachment to the world things one cannot be guileless and liberal-minded without much tapasya or unless it is once last part and on its official last son that tuesday we discussed Raghavan see Ramakrishna said somehow you have to keep your mind in God that is rubbish somehow the tapasya what is sahaja mind is going this way and that we again and again we have to my this is the best place go to God go to God go to God as the mother as the palings they always kind the young children go and see it go and read go and learn why because they know that act will be good for them that is the time to learn same way you have to take care of your own mind one should not be angry with the mind you have to just treat the mind as a very young naughty child the other day when you went to see the church where Xiaomi Vivekananda said I think yesterday all of us away we saw a mother child this little that girl she was super furious she was shouting at the mother crying and throwing all the the best doll the mother gave she threw it she was not liking but the mother American mother going on talking to her sweetie sweetie like that then after some time again it was alright it exactly the same way we have to treat our minds we have to treat our mind in that otherwise it will be very difficult sometimes some people without preparation they try to control the mind they lose their balance mental balance that you should not do her slowly the purification what is the purification take out one by one the attachment to the worldly things and when that judgment to the worldly teams are not there where the mind will go automatically to us God and how you will understand that is going towards God he will like to read the holy books and when you are reading the good books including the Punishers the vedanta very different type of expressions over there but like the sometimes he will like the philosophies are different quotations when you were reading that gives you encouragement that proves that you are on the right track and previously some someone has to go to the movies and going with the frames and party and these dead slowlyslowly distasteful you are not liking it that shows you're on the right track only two things at their world and God nothing else only to this world and God this world are different five senses that enjoys smell taste sight sound and touch that's all these are the five things if you are slowly withdrawing from these we have the mind will go there is no other place to go gardening you know sometimes in the ramakrishna mission some schwa means little reveal type so the whenever they are posted to any center that Center aid will complaint valu-mart no it is not possible to work with him he's always rebellious so please change him so he goes on getting changed from different centers and he came to Advaita somebody just was very liberal so no problem so one day I found him in the afternoon there is pacing up and down on the terrace we were younger Majoris we used to go into some physical exercise we met the name Vivekananda that Club like that and he was busy and then I saw that Ismail as a show me but to you it seems you're very happy oh yes see this is the last question in India us but most of all the Indian sentence they posted me and all the monks are not liking me only this Center and if I can somehow had a fight with the in charge of this place then where the very word will put me they'll send me the foreign country I'll be very active so simple I'm so wonderful Shani he was tell you just like that making fun so I will go to foreign countries and suppose in the foreign countries they will put you in Bangladesh what will happen to you so that was Pamela teasing no no I don't know English so they won't put me no no no what is there you will go and learn Bengali then there is no no no don't don't say like that so sometimes premature is what they come true though is so this is the way sometimes we thinner than the funny way it goes now we had to understand liberally mindedness and Saddam occasional comes to these he said that funding from city city is a very close object opposite to the Ganga this decide the value what other side is the city that is very good the fundament means the Sanskrit scholar I discussed Balanta with him see Ramakrishna never attended in high school and he said I discussed with anta with that Sanskrit scholar so what is this Vedanta is not only reading is a realization then we come to the main topic there the pure Artman in on is unattached the floor admin is unattached we were talking about an attachment the when the minds lowly slowly withdrawing from the or it becomes completely unattached when it becomes completely unaddressed what is become pure Rodman he says like that that which is pure Altman is unattached Maya Arabic there is in each in the Maya Arabic that the power of God we say is innate in Maya there are three gunas how perfect dramatist says he never made but he realized it so it is nothing wrong everything is perfectly he is mentioning what is this Vedanta beta under the last part of the knowledge is this Artman which is pure which is an actor's and it is having a power that's called Maya and in that Maya there are three gunas what are the three gunas sattva Raja and Dhamma and that's all the Hindus the founders of the Hindu religion the sanatana-dharma they were just like the scientists everything analytical the satrajit on all these three gunas also exist in the pure Artman noted these three gunas are also existing in the pure argument because we believe that only apartment is there are nothing else our Brahman is there atman and brahman are the same thing we sometimes we say Hartman some time Romberg some time when it is the sum total of all individual earthman's we say it is Brahman and then Hartman means individual as is paramaatma supreme Brahman and also the Hartman satrajit amar is the earth bad Atman itself is unattached a butcher was carrying a load of meat when he touched shankara shankara means the adi shankaracharya Shankara explain what you have touched to me because as a person who is doing some low job and place the butcher replied venerable said neither have you touched me not have I touched you you are pure Hartman unattached so that is called Vedanta the on this particular Manisha Pancham Shankar Acharya after this dialogue the he wrote the five verses and dear he was commenting to himself taking old himself the five thinks that now I accept what is that those who have realized Artman whether they're low birth or her birth they can become guru they can become teacher this is my realization Manisha that is after thinking when chicken we had a wonderful retreat over here on despite verses the pure Atman is unattached and one cannot see it I is capital one cannot see it if salt is mixed with water one cannot see the salt with eyes that which is the pure art one is the great cause the cause of the cause the the groves ascertain the cause of and the great cause the close the circle and the causal and the brain cause so that is the great cause the five elements are close what are the five elements you know the puncher hooters the five elements the bunch of others when you see that they are doing the other thing that Punjagutta to use the five elements the with the five elementary see the and along with their mind but the ego a circle five elements are gross and mind body and ego are subtle these three things are certain and fives of gross together is this Maya and they are all the time getting the mixture of the sattva Raja and Tama this is the whole thing is so clear the small way we can explain we can understand only these that all these things are coming from that supreme being the great cause now if I am happy with the power of God my God will take me to this place or I can build my himself to be calm and happy which is all dolls and playthings the God will go or not okay enjoy enjoy enjoy the when you are not then only were getting in the story that our combination the young boy when he wanted to know about the Hartman then the Yama the King updated told I will give you everything which even the cars cannot get to enjoy I'll give you that can enjoy that he said no let all those with you I don't need those I want to know the art man so you have to be careful we have to be careful the pure Hartman alone is our real nature real and unreal shown in the vacant the game a wonderful table pure Hartman is our real nature and what is Gianna TCC Ramakrishna stealing usually always rating the Solana Beach the means a caddy temple Poojari and in Bengali there's a long back there's a movie came and one gentleman acted as Ramakrishna and seeing him we all think that Slava Krishna means just like this they he'll be constantly another shaking and cannot talk properly all the time trying for mother as a pure knowledge at Toyota Tercel my attache eaten provocative art Arboretum karmic irreverent put sister Yami Gullu sharanam deities functionary became the composing apostille on occasion his pure on Twitter when some of the disciples tada show me miracle and they were taunting the show me G is asking us to practice meditation without taking the helpers Ramakrishna's picture that is wrong they wrote to mother marshal Adam you need a be the Shamy pivot understanding like this is right or wrong right mother say your gurus Ramakrishna is a Twitter and you are also a treated and why she said that look at here this viewer Hartmann alone is a real major real nature what is this Jana to know one's own self and keep the mind in it and it is to know the pure Artman now we find that today morning with the devotees who are attending the retreat they have come from India and South Africa in the morning every day they're chanting you may remember today we were chanting from the bhagavad-gita and in the Bhagavad Gita's second chapter and particularly 17 to 30 these are the verses shri krishna he is explaining to arjuna what is a hartman and all these verses in the different way he is mentioning mrs. Altmann this is Atman this is Hartman and then he said to make him understand not joy of the Rio de Baca dodgy not joy 80 Maria be baka da ji now I am good 12 Morita we are in the past present future every time he was the same he named the bird he never died a Jew meteor Shastra too young Ronald now unworthy under monisha needing a unique dish a shot Oh piranha with these four words he wanted to it is unborn adjourn eternal mcdeere changed knees shall shatter piranhas it is evil itself so these are the four qualities through which they are trying to give us the picture of Hartman why this subjective frames I have made a list and what is this Hartman in different places they have tried the Rishi's the great soul those who have realized they tried to tell it but once lambda T is one place say I tried to tell you about the God what is God but someone is whirling choking my throat can tell don't allow me to speak so you have to realize then only you will understand otherwise not and what of this list harmony is identical with Brahman this se llama business a art man Brahman arkanese the supreme reality ultimate reality rarity means existence and nothing else Hartman is beyond names and photos and in a one-liner only in one life says was C party Priam nama Rupa it is at the file Qi Township and chatham from the consciousness this fight thing come a sea party and real existence knowledge and please and nama Rupa any firm and its name are all world things the Atman is beyond words and speech the Artman is beyond mind and senses it cannot be expressed it cannot be taught also the Atman is the limitation of space-time causation limitation that you cannot bring it within this space-time and causation immutable Atman is immutable Atman is undifferentiated Atman is imperishable Atman is imperceptible Atman is without activity Atman is the absolute existence Hartman is the absolute consciousness Hartman is the absolute please Hartman is the source of everything so this is the art man how LLL still be able to express about Atman as because this is subjective so that is why on the twenty-ninth words of the second chapter the bhagavad-gita it says Sri Krishna is mentioning Oscar Chavez Piscotty custody no Oscar Shiva brother Dean David John Chang jnanam John Young ostrich Abacha onions annuity Sutra ope Nam be the natural baggage it otherwise it is impossible DC Sun they say artment is marvelous as changeable ostrich Shiva but the t30 verge of onion and others they say it is wonderful heart surgeon that is how that they are expressing that God the Hartmann is here Hartman is their admin is very closed admin is very far harmonies outside Atman is inside that how you will understand everywhere that agent eternity the during the done thinking that under the syllabus here reduce our worship Ayodhya so this is called Hartmann and pregnancy Ramakrishna say truth to opine on Veda achieve a custody hearing also people do not understand and that is the reason including Shankar Acharya they have propagated twenties otherwise people won't be able to understand that which Hinduism always for this the pure rock tweeter Hinduism never believes the existence of gods and goddesses never believed even the heaven that is Hinduism and no form at all but at the same time Hinduism stand to go to that level you have to give them steps so the rituals and SOTA images so the stotras songs Pujols and so many things Thank You friends we will study how the Amish nice explaining please repeat after me Needham Journal need [Music] he prints and now today's Tuesday and this Friday Saturday Sunday there will be the retreat and on the first of every gesture we will go to Ganges and this time the our devotees will go in a big pass the some of you those who have already registered if you like them the bus I think you can also go it will be a 50-seat adverse so you can add of that but those who are not registered I'm sorry the accommodation won't be possible because it's completely full but Saturday you can come and obtain the worldly program till you can go again and that is also possible but accommodation is not possible this time so this is a second degree how do you wonder full fall banquet I will send you the reporter the teachers and others this is a really good and many people came forward to help us that the proposal a we came to Verdier that's for the home of harmony has a very good response and other people's are also coming with the pledges with the promises there's a big project but it will be really really great project no one even thought like this but that is the main idea of Salam o Krishna miracle and that should be in this country in Chicago why the ships this is the place where Swami Vivekananda expounded the pure Buganda by telling and through the lectures that all are leading to the same goal this truth which is good Raghavan serum Krishna lived in his life so we should try to do that thank you very much but whoever has come today please go and have the dinner for all of you
