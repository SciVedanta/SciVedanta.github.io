[149: Panchama Veda 149- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBCF5zWKvRM)

dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten Calma sharp aha seven among golem srimad Adam boo begin on the body dodging aha Sarang kishna was talking about the East the Buddha and that is the wonderful culture that the Indians are having the Hindus are having and that is the reason there is no conflict you should undoubtedly bow before all views but there is a thing called unswerving devotion to one idea that is called Ishta nishta Ishta devatha mr.  tea etc the page 371 and we find this that you should undoubtedly bow before all views so that the humbleness should be their acceptance should be there is not only toleration it is acceptance as Shama Vivek and is mentioning the I tolerate the others God or goddesses or philosophy or paths there is a different thing not only toleration it is acceptance why acceptance because I believe that through the way that I am going if that is true and with faith I'm moving I'm not sure I have heard it from my guru from my master I have read it in the scripture I have understood it in my own way and I believe that if I go through this I'm going to reach to the highest goal this is my faith my belief my understanding my effort if it is so it is the same thing with the others why should I not accept there is a very important question the moment I say others gods are not true gods does it mean that you have already realized God does it mean that you have already visualize the truth realize the truth does it mean that you know that there cannot be any other path except mine so this is the important thing so if we without knowing this thing without understanding these if we say like this that is blasphemy that is blasphemous because without knowing the truth when I talk about truth when I say this is the truth not only that a force others to understand that is very very wrong particularly in the path of religion one must be and should be the broad-minded this is you should undoubtably bow before all views you should shun see ramakrishna is telling you must bow before all views but there is a thing called on serving devotion to one ideal so this is so clear true you should salute everyone but you must love one I deal with your old soul that is unswerving devotion then he gives the example of an Amana gopis etc here this Easter Easter Easter that Sanskrit word Easter means the desired and the cherished one desired one jurist one de votar means Divine Being Mista means that faith so that cherished are desired that God the cherished divinity is called Easter devata adi shankaracharya though he was not do it in he popularized among the Orthodox Brahmin five form worship Ganesha Vishnu Shiva DB and Surya mainly to unify the Hindus there were Hindu sects were there and look at these are the Shankar Acharya he is just working with the Avatar he came to unify each other one person is worshiping Ganesha and he takes Ganesha is the best and no one else so this Orthodox Hindus he unified how yes your Ganesha is all right for you but the other one who is worshipping the Sun the Surya that is also all right that is also true so they be Shakti they're also true for them so that way that's called Easter bhakti Eastern Easter that devotion to one ideal that will take to the same goal where you are thinking will reach following your goal your God so that is Ganesha Vishnu Shiva Devi and Surya these are the five main major gods and goddesses that people used to worship he unified so that is the reason if you go to Hindu temple in America too so look at them all these gods and goddesses are present and all are happy those who were the worshipper of the Ganesha they go and bow down before the condition also they go and bow down before other gods and goddesses so this is what the Hindu tradition in the wave that constantly teaching be on your own path but at the same time be respectful with others this is the only thing if the world religious groups they understand that there'll be no conflict at all we are having the religious Parliament and this inter-religious conferences all the time exchanging this is the view that's very clear you need not to accept my god but have respect for my god I need not to accept your God and the path and the philosophy but what is the problem - respect your philosophy so that is the way and even the Buddhists there's a group of Buddhists but jarana they accept the Easter David are I for the better concentration if you have some idea before you it helps to concentrate and do a besom of course as in the last time when you were discussing in the ganges about the bush Nava path that's called the dual ism the to God is separate I am separate and there all the time the many gods and goddesses are there Bhishma is the main god and from the air and about others the incarnations of the same God is Rama then Krishna and many other the very high souls there also as the this they always think that I should have one God like ramanuja chharia for him one God his disciple again he was thinking not that I would have my own so Rama was his own god Vishnu was somebody and the Krishna were so but all they were bhagavata-dharma they were all the Bush neighbors and different there some one is Krishna someone is Rama someone is the are Bishnu like this when they were having so there was no problem see Ramakrishna is giving the example of two and the famous devotees like Hanuman ji you having that armed agenda without Rama Chandra no one else Mira I was having the Krishna as a idea of Ram Prasad a very famous sage in Bengal ma Kali so this way we always find the Easter cup tea helps people to understand the religion much better way and it was the Saturday December 29 master marsha the small paragraph is writing master MA she was practicing austerity staying with ceramic isne and that's why see ramakrishna asked him to be away from the frames and family so that he can concentrate he was living with ceramic is nine - Anisha and this Saturday December 29 1883 it was the day of the new moon auspicious for the worship of divine mother at 1 o'clock in the afternoon Sri Ramakrishna got into a carriage to visit the temple of colleague at Kali guards the Ramakrishna was induction Asia but from there he was going to colleague at if you go to Calcutta and you will find now the Calcutta has spread it but in those days Calcutta was under the guidance of two mothers one is this Kali guard Macaulay and Dakshina Sharma Kali so both are from the both side as if was protecting the whole city so the ceramic Isner was induction Isha and he was traveling to colleague heart he intend to stop at others house on the way seen order was to accompany him to the temple while the carriage was waiting near the north porch of the Masters room aim that means the writer the master march√© went to the sea Ramakrishna the master and saved may I go with you look at it here usually we find the master Masha is always accompanying him wherever and wherever he went he always noted the conversation and the things that happened and then he presented over here and Saddam Krishna also liked it so obviously see I'm Krishna had an idea that whatever the conversation that he is having if it is recorded published afterwards that will be beneficial for the devotees in future as we are now reading and getting a wonderful idea of spirituality but today as because he came with a purpose to practice spirituality in the company of his guru and he guru say that you should not have the comforting 'king of anything else when he came and told said may I also greet you see Ramakrishna is asking why I should like to visit my house my home in Calcutta so master Masha was thinking as since I am going to at the same Road and he is so near to that I will go and say hello to my house where whatever there then again I will come back along with the master Sadam Krishna reflected a moment and said must you go home why you are quite or right here see the it would break that is the reason and this is the great teachers so really he understood that continuation that he is having constantly remembering God taking the name of God reading about God singing about God and all this sudden little break if he travel over there so the austerity the practice at the time they should not move that is called brahmacharya period and constantly ten years we doubt any break if we one can do that sure and certain that he will develop the spiritual power so that is the way cinema Krishna is giving the training aim wanted to see his people a few hours but evidently the master did not have drew and he retains the old record because the master see Ramakrishna didn't take aim along with him and we don't get any record of that next day Sunday it was Saturday that happened see Ramakrishna went to visit the see that Kali temple colleague heart Kali temple now it is so difficult to go with crowd tremendous crowd but this time in the Sunday December 30 at 1883 at 3 o clock in the afternoon while aim was walking up and down under a tree a devotee came to him and say that the master had sent for him now the master Maharshi and the master we should not mix up master mihashi means the recorder he was going on recording and he was a teacher a teacher is known as master so master mihashi in bengali particularly so master maha so he is mentioning him means minder so here he was just alone he was walking there's a part of the spiritual practice then his teacher ceramic isne called him when to Ramakrishna's room and found a number of devotee dear he saluted the master here also the disciple all alone thinking now serum Tichenor knew that he is going to give some discourses through conversation he called the disciple so that he should be there he should listen and also as his own he recorded Ramachandra the dr. then kadar and other had arrived from Calcutta Rama had brought with him the branding monk whom the master had visited near his garden a few days earlier we have already read that and ceramic is not old Rama please bring him whatever see Ramakrishna said naturally his disciples his followers that matters this to do that as because the ram krishna wanted to talk with him so he brought him on that occasion see ramakrishna had asked him to bring the sadhu to Dakshina sure sada means that sannyasi the monk the monk was sitting on the small couch with the master they were talking happily in Hindustani Sri Ramakrishna knew about that because a group of people this to leave so close to the docks in Asia they were all from the North India not inside of India this Hindi speaking people cinema Krishna is to talk at them and by that way he has learned when he was young he used to go and serve the monks coming from different parts of India and cross going through their village and in every village in India that was the system just to have a beautiful room for the monks to come and steal with the earth and we never any monk or any group of people monks this to come and stay the villagers is to come and give food then water and all that whatever they needed see Ramakrishna has a very young boy used to go and used to serve the monk most of the monks this to come from the North India this to speak among themselves in Hindi and that way he picked up India not that chaste very grammatical correction or correct character Hindi but he knew Hindi so he is talking in Hindi what do you feel about all these that means this creation he was asking he was a pedantic monk ceramic isne life wanted to talk to him and liked him because he was having a desire to develop now some people the moment they become Hmong they think that I am a monk I know everything and book is there I will read devotees also this is one type of ego that also pulls them down they cannot get the light by that way so one should be humble and always ready to learn from wherever the light is coming they should receive it so the master brought him over here and talking and then he has allowed him to sit by his side that means that gentle man that mom was pure otherwise a Ramakrishna is very very choosy he never allowed people to sit by his side at this person when sitting by his side means he was by that way a little higher and Saddam Oh Krishna asking what do you feel about all these this creation then the monk said it is like a dream that is the Ballentine way it's like a dream and as we were discussing about the creation the creation according to the Advaita Vedanta is just like dream like the Mirage it is not actually there we are creating that is the idea so he said like that is a dream the Serrano kitchen immediately asking the Brahman alone is real and the world losery that is the brahma satyam jagat mithya that is the dictum of the Vedanta well said what is Brahman is asking about then the monk said Brahman is the sound it is all as in the open assured particularly cotton pony she says ohm ET brahma and all means a sound this would occur they say and many other philosophy also accepted so this way he said ohm is the Brahman Almighty Brahman kotoba Nisha say see Ramakrishna immediately rectify human telling but there must be something indicated by the sound o itself is not Brahmin ohm is indicating something which is Brahmin now we always say such cheat on and the Salewa the moment that gives the complete idea of the Brahmin such cheat and Anand the three qualities if that is the Brahmin that means Brahmin is limited again that infinity that is lost if we say ohm is the Brahmin that means it looks like these and it sounds like these and that is Brahmin limited that cannot be it is something infinite unlimited so sanam o krishna immediately mentioning and never read any books though your heart but the realization the conviction is this through the realization these can never be so he is all the time telling the truth but there must be something indicated by the sound isn't that so he is asking then the monk is telling the Hat itself is the thing indicated as well as the indicator now the home is indicating something and that is the indicator he meant at these words the ramnish no went into Samadhi this is the speciality of Sri Ramakrishna he never argued but through his life he taught people those who had little faith they really got benefitted by them if the then this words Ram Krishna went into Samadhi and sat motionless the monk and the devotees look wonderingly at him in his static condition jesus said to the monk look at himself this is Samadhi the Kader was telling that monk this is Samadhi the Mong Kadri of Samadhi but had never seen it before after a few minutes the master began gradually to come down to the normal clean of consciousness he say to the Divine Mother immediately he is coming down and he's talking to the divine mother mother I want to be normal please don't make me unconscious I should like to talk to the sadhu about satchitananda mother I want to be Mary talking about sat-chit-ananda I want to feel happy talking about this is a wonderful personality on explainable when we the ordinary people to reach to a little better concentration struggling so hard there is a person who goes so easily into the Samadhi nirvikalpa samadhi where the moment the monk indicated that ohm is something that indicating and that is the indicator immediately into that sat-chit-ananda saruba or the source that is Brahman immediately mind goes to that and it is so difficult to bring down the mind and ceramic dish nice praying to the divine power ma Kali to bring his mind down the monk was amazed to see the Masters condition and to hear these words Sri Ramakrishna said to him please do away with you I am he don't talk that I am he latest now keep I and out to enjoy the fun the God is there I am here let us talk about that the moment I say I am there's no conversation we cannot talk about anything so let us at least this moment master to cater with a smile what did you think about the saddle then they were walking the sod was still there that this Ramakrishna came out and he was asking Kedah kidder was a devotee a householder devotee and matured person the ceramic Christian sometime is to ask him his opinion and kidder it is a whole dry knowledge and he's dead telling about because they are observing see Ramakrishna for a long time when they saw comparing with the monk is telling his all dry knowledge the pot has just been put on the fire but as yet there is no rice in it he is indicating that the cooking it is pot only it is under fire maybe the water is there but the original thing the rice has not been given so no cooking master then he is telling that may be true but he has renounced everything this is the important thing he has renounced everything means unless and until he is having some conviction it's very very difficult to give away these worldly things so he who has renounced the world has already made create progress that is ceramic is now he is asking the devotee developing the deep respect for the monks what a whether he has realized God or not it doesn't matter but he has at least renounced the world there is a great thing the desire to enjoy these worldly things from there they have gone out Saddam o Krishna indicating to that the sadhu belongs to the stage of the beginner Robert Dhaka they call in sanskrit Probert again they have started no matter no problem because at least he has started he has renounced the world that is the great thing in my mother's masala Davis life we find that one lady she was walking another Indian lady they wear the sari and the last part of the Sadiq at the skull until our chill sir that was moving and when Brahma teri was sitting on the edge of that veranda and that touch double notch re which she never cared about it and never paid any respect to the brim acharya immediately mother noticed it much out of the stopped her and said why you are not paying any respect because the debt barometer is sitting over there you should be careful about your clothings you should tight it and then go while you are walking like that all he is a brahmacari only then the immediately mother said even though a small the baby snakes are also snakes that means she meant that there will be some day will become the moms so learn to respect them they are announcers that is the great thing the renouncement all these things that is constantly dragging us luring us binding us and is so difficult to do away with it now some people at least trying to do that respect them this will bring you good so that ceramic is now also mentioning and he told nothing can be achieved without the realization of God when a man is intoxicated with the static love of God he doesn't take delight in anything then he was singing bengali song that means cherish my precious mother Shama tenderly within Oh mind may you and I alone behold heart letting no one else intrude so it is God and the devotee that should be and no one l should be there Joe Tony Rio Rico harder in Ishinomaki Mon three-decker a Medici our general nahi dekha that is the original bengali song the cherish my precious mother Shama tenderly within Oh mind me you and I alone behold our letting no one else interviewed kada repeated the words of a song in keeping with the Masters feeling see Ramakrishna returned to his room about 4 o clock the door of the Kali temple was open and the master walked to the temple with the mock him accompanied them entering the inner chamber of the chamber the master prostrated himself reverently before the image now it is induction Asia the monk with folded hands also bowed his head repeatedly before Kali now just a few hours report he was talking about an balantine way now in the company the holy company of alabanza ramakrishna he has understood the Shakti the power of God is also there we should go and accept the same way ceramic is not convinced his master his guru totapuri our dwelling he never believed in this world and all but cinema Krishna told look at this as long as you feel that you have a body you are reading this Shakti realm objecting and why should you not accept it you must have to so that way if you don't like to understand this your realization will be limited so this is why we find that Shankar Acharya also he started thinking then afterwards he himself is composing the hymns and praising the Shakti the mother the divine mother and master what do you think of Kali now master is asking him then the Mong with devotion Kali is supreme master Kali and brahman are identical is that not so monk as long as one's mind is turned to the outer world one must accept Kali he was also a good person at least intellectually very clear as long as a man sees the outer world and discriminates between good and evil he must accept good and reject evil to be sure all names and forms are illusory but as long as the mind sees the outer world the Spirent must give up woman the ideas of good and evil are applied to one who is still a student on the path otherwise yields tree from the path of righteousness das conversing master in the Mong returned to the temple returned from the temple master to him you do notice the shadow bowed before Kali and he was very happy this man is making the progress accepting the boat and aim yes sir now next another de come it is Monday December 31st 1883 at 4 o clock in the afternoon the master was sitting in his room with aim raka la - Harish and other devotees if we notice most of the time at 4 o clock master is ready to meet the devotees in balloon wat also singing hymn timing they are maintaining though apparently it is an image but we believe that Lord Rama Krishna masters Rama Krishna he is present over there whatever was his daily routine that we all follow after the noon food he is taking little rest then getting up and taking little the water and all those things getting fresh and after that he is coming and sitting to meet the devotees then the doors is open and the devotees all come at least as if the master is talking with them meeting them etc so here also you find in the when the master Mahad there he is noting at 4 o clock Salam o Krishna is AD and the devotees are also coming and addressing aim and Balaam the master saved Hallowed re followed the path of knowledge now why he is explaining again and again he himself ASDA adieu 18cm as Ramakrishna within himself he was pure and pure of do 18 but for the daily practices daily live it was necessary to for understand this there are two things are there so he said in this way holo-diary followed the path of knowledge day and night he used to study the Punishers the Atma Ramayana and similar books on Vedanta the Balanta has his main books there's Adi Atma Ramana is one of the very famous book inba dontoh and also do punish its etc he would turn up his nose at the mentioned the form of God Allah dari he never liked the form of God is it God is formless so Saddam o Krishna is how huge to behave the moment you mentioned about the form of God Allah dari is to make his mind make his face in such a way as if body language is to tell I am not liking it once I ate from the lip plate plates of the Vigors the salam o krishna he was a brahmin and in those days in a society then even today a higher college is the Brahmin they will never touch the lower caste people and think about the beggars that have come there eating ceramic is know went and touched their food and took something from there to eat to break his ego to see that I am also the same with them they're also human being they're also having the divinity though not manifested covered but I'm the same so that you all did all that he said to me how you will be able to marry your children so that is the higher cut the ceramic is not got very angry I said you rascal shall I ever have children me the neck naturally naturally ceramic is never stealing how do you think in this way you are thinking that this is a do eighteen and this world is illusionary at the same time you are thinking that I am a Brahmin I am separate from others and a higher level of the start of the society and these in these that if that means you were not true to your own ideology if world is illusory what is there even if I go and touch the food of the other people you are caste people what is there so ceramic is non level I never like this hypocrisy there's a sort of a hypocrisy the showing apparently that I am these a reality it is not it's never liked it so he used a very strong language just fancy he declared that the world was illusory and again would meditate in the temple of Vishnu with turned-up nose if you say that the world is illusory then why you are meditating and meditating on the form of Vishnu and at the same time Critias criticizing that God can never have the forum most of the people they behave like that that's why the path of knowledge is wonderful bad but not for all those who are really understand that that is the path for their very chosen few very very few people can understand it follow it very difficult and that is why I Ramakrishna though he was and not waiting out an out of date in March our other Munni Devi also say he was an updo 18 Shami be vegan and also mention he was a nabbed waiting a Toyota Samar eat a cheetah his mind was all the time dwelling on the truth of advaitha but externally he used to show because for the general ordinary people so we should also follow the path of the Ramakrishna then he will reach over there then the he a little latter the master began to talk to the mother in a very tender voice that touched the heart of him the his evil master see Ramakrishna was praying to the mother Kali mother don't make me unconscious with the knowledge of Brahman so look at it as if the mother is trying to give the knowledge of Brahman ceramic isne is telling mother don't give that mother I don't want Brahma Gianna I want to be married I want to play mother I don't know the bed anta mother I don't even care to know the bathers and the Vedanta remains so far below when thou art realised so he is giving in wonderful conception when you truly realize God the truth whatever it may be called Brahman or the Artman according to see Ramakrishna's markali the moment you realize dad in everything all this knowledge and other thing it is far far below Oh divine mother then he said Oh Krishna I shall say 2d eat my child take this my child Oh Krishna I shall say to thee my child thou has assumed this body for my sake that's the devotional way to approach God and it becomes very very easy masters marsha he is giving another day at the that is Wednesday January 2nd 1884 and he is telling how many people they came Rakhal are two Harish Ramallah and M himself had been staying with ceramic isne at the temple garden about 3 o clock in the afternoon him found the master and the West porch of his room engaged in conversation with a tantric devotee now this the varieties of people coming to see Ramakrishna by his neighbors they come and just we saw that at one or two days before Abaddonn team came now a tantric has come that those who practice Tantra sadhana the shakti sadhana that Tantra has come the tantric who is wearing the ochre cloth ceramic is not asked aim to sit by his side perhaps the master intended to instruct him through his talk with the tantric devotee mahima chaudhry had sent the later to the master this country was introduced by another devotee known to see Ramakrishna by Indra see Ramakrishna always followed this that if you were known to some of our devotee my devotee well then he was introduced master to the tantric it is a part of the tantric disciple to drink wine from a human skull this wine is called Khurana isn't that so he's asking the country's Ramakrishna practiced sixty-four Tantra so all those approaches the sixty-four Tundras approaches so he practiced and now he is asking this tantric the devotee who has come yes--if to know from him and the tantric is telling yes sir then see Ramakrishna is telling but I cannot touch wine at all why wine smoking this little secret or that double bubble at least you do not lose the control on your mind this is important some people you will find the monks they are smoking maybe from the habit but they don't lose control on their mind but someone drinking wine after some time lose the total control on the mind so one who is losing the control on the mind how can he concentrate that mind how can you utilize that mind to practice bechara discrimination will remind is the main if that gone completely out of your hand and that is the reason one should not drink if they want to one trying to reach God or realize God and it says like this I cannot touch wine at all tantric you have spontaneous divine bliss one who enjoys that bliss wants nothing else tantric had his home tax he knew where he is coming say about the Ramakrishna he is telling master I don't care for Java and austerity but I have constant remembrance and consciousness of God the wonderful indication if you are constantly repeat in the name of God you don't want anything else so I have to sit for Jafar and meditation and then I have to practice austerity nothing is necessary if you are constantly going on repeating the name of God that you have received from your guru because whole mind will be conscious constantly conscious about the presence of God tell me when the speak of six centers what do they mean is asking that country country these are like different holy places see ramakrishna knew it very well but why he is asking to know how for these people they know and whenever there will be any little mistake immediately with a very soft and kind way a fatherly way he's active eyes them these are like different holy places in each of the center's dwell shiva and shakhty master listened silently to the conversation looking at him the master asked the aim was listening both the conversation that is going on the master asks the tantric devotee can a man attain perfection without the help of a bija mantra a sacred word from a guru he is inquiring from that tantric says yes he can if he has faith faith in the words of the guru now faith in the words of the guru but may be that he is not having a mantra particular month it's called bija mantra medium is the seed the mantra that one has as received from the Guru that's called bija mantra which means the seed and that mantra the word when we were constantly remembering monana constant remembering and thinking on there then that from the seed comes up the sprout sprout of spirituality and that slowly grows so that he is asking the moment he said faith see Ramakrishna turned to his disciple him who was sitting and he looked at him but the meaningfully to that look at it what word is it and he repeated faith master to jerubbaal one should not harbour malice towards any person or any opinion this is spirituality the most of the time we do not understand we have taken the garb of the Hinduism and Hindu my Hindu who got Sapolu Hindu who and then we are going to fight with others they cannot be monks it cannot be spiritual people their social people no problem they have a society they have a faith and they want to be united to save their own class of people that is alright for them but the moment you declare that you are a monk you have left your own people your heart and home how can you be again once again can go to the narrowness this is ceramic each nahi is telling one should not harbour malice towards any person or any opinion this is very important the believers in the formless God and the worshipers of God wit form are all without exception going towards God alone so that's why you always say whoever comes near me to listen to about the spirituality read gospel if you read gospel at least two pages daily market and go take the little note carefully then again you will understand after you have finished you have very clear idea about the spirituality religion and spirituality then from the step your standpoint I am a social worker I am a political leader I'm a man of the society I have this tent no problem but the moment you say I'm a spiritual person I have taken the garb of a monk you have a complete totally different attitude you should be the moment you say don't come to me then you are not a spiritual person the one young boy afro-american young man he came to me and he told I went to that group and they said don't come to us who don't like this thing and if you are coming you have to accept this views this music site etc another group also they're also very narrow all Hindu groups then I heard from someone about the be bacon and that and the broadness of Vivekananda then I was searching Vivekananda then I came to know about Vivekananda Vedanta society that you are in Chicago then I found no it is not Chicago far away but I have come to meet you people the moment I came someone told you you're welcome that I liked very much so those who are associated with this Center as organization you must be very very careful whoever comes the new phase please say welcome and be very very polite they do not understand the shah mean they do not understand the philosophy but they understand the behavior of the members of the society so anyone who ever comes why sir why you are outside please come in and this is our thing that is our thing we have nothing much to show only a little basic over here the exhibition of Vivekananda these are the things that happened in 1883 like this we all say 1893 and this way we all show but the Sun but they're happy he sat over there he gave his email address he took my card and he was so happy until Inc I can feel that this is second home for me I'm free then he was asking suppose I come in when there's a function is going on but the other people will behave properly with me no no nothing is going to happen nobody will say anything to you you are most welcome so I just invited him why we can do that because we are the followers of vagabonds Lama Krishna who always say that a ball paths are leading to the same goal anyone any with any idea he is traveling no problem Shami Vivekananda who is our leader he always said we travel from lower truth to higher truth neighbor from era to truth this is our philosophy from lower truth to higher truth maybe a person has come he is talking in a different this way or maybe his behavior is different but he is also cherishing some truth with maybe the lower truth and then slowly coming they'll be higher and higher we do not know whether the god is going to manifest within their heart any time so that's why Sri Ramakrishna's day is telling like this that one should constantly one should not harbour the malice towards any personal any opinion the believers in the formless God as because that was the main problem at that time at the time of Shri Ramakrishna he is mentioning this formless god and the worshipers of God with former all without exception going towards God alone then he said yogi calls him H capital Atman or / Hartman doctor calls him Raghavan further it is said that there is the eternal Lord and his eternal servant then Jaggu Ball he's asking a very intelligent question how can we know that all paths are true that's a very intelligent question see ramakrishna is telling that all paths are leading to the same well how can you know see Ramakrishna a man can reach God if he follows one path rightly sutter mean eternam see a paradigm of Iowa in the bhagavad-gita the sadhana your path this I have chosen this is my path I will go in this way and that is why he said you're surely rich rightly if you follow then he can learn about all the other parts the moment you are successful the path that you were following then there'll be no doubt with the day there granthi chiton t.server samsara Chianti just check Armani doesn't mean this day per hour a in the Upanishad it says the moment you are realizing that truth all the bondages will be cut asunder and they will live in no doubt about it but anyways somehow you have to reach to the higher goal that's all it's like reaching the roof by some means or other when you are on the top of the house then one is able to climb down by any party likes maybe the wooden steps or the stone stairs maybe through a bamboo pole or even through a rope he can come down he can know what is the roof go to the roof fast that is Raghavan see Ramakrishna the unique way he always taught us and that makes the Ramakrishna followers broad-minded and happy happy with any situation their friendly with all types of people thank you very much let us offer our pranaam to this great soul and conclude need anjana medium on
