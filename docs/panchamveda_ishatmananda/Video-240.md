[241: Panchama Veda 241 : Mediatate On Consciousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgBddZGDyeM)

namaskar dear devotees and friends today is wednesday and every week every wednesday we study the gospel of salaam krishna which we always say as the panchama veda and today also we'll start but as usual we will start with the sloka tabok a was inspiring the devotees to dedicate the whole mind to realize god and the last wednesday when we were discussing and he was telling uh that to the devotees that you must become mad mad that is the thing then he remembered that one con comment of the then one spiritual leader shivanath shivanath was the spiritual leader of the brahma-samaj and shivanath once said that one loses one's hate by thinking too much of god so that shivana sastri commented and sirama krishna heard about it and quoting that he said what said i can anyone ever become unconscious by thinking of consciousness because sometimes some people they think god is there but at the same time this world and too much of thinking of god they consider that they may lose the mental balance but the if the god is the consciousness and if we know about it then there is it can it cannot be something else it is the consciousness only that we are meditating that we are praying so obviously the result will be consciousness and what is that consciousness understanding everything as one and there'll be no fear no fear of death no fear of losing and there'll be no enmity whom i am going to fight with everything is me only in different names and forms so how can one become mad and when you talk about the mad so losing the mental balance means not understanding the situations and the mind goes on brooding on only one thing so it goes on thinking and this process so people they consider oh is a lunatic he's a mad because he cannot think rationally but when a person meditating on the consciousness praying to the consciousness dedicating his whole soul that is concentrating his whole mind on consciousness who can be a in unconscious person it cannot be so there is a great difference that's why the bhagavan si rama krishna he commented in this way mad that is the thing shivanath once said that one loses one's head by thinking too much of god what said i can anyone ever become unconscious by thinking of consciousness god is of the nature of eternity purity and consciousness look at it that is the way bhagavan sirama krishna is so very clear complete no ambiguity about the idea of god and he said god is the nature of eternity purity and consciousness through his consciousness one becomes conscious of everything through his intelligence the whole world appears intelligent now this is the pure vedanta and in the vedanta it says our mind is having poor parts that in the hindu way when we think mana buddhichit in english when you say mind is only one substance but when he in the we say is sum total is the mind in english this buddhi intellect which takes the decision that particular part of the mind is getting the reflection of the consciousness this is vedantic the vedanta always say like that and when that consciousness is reflected i repeat the word reflected it's not original original something else completely different that reflection gives us i the i consciousness and from that i comes the ego can you imagine this way so he is telling the from the god only everything is happening when everything is happening in this way how can you say he says in this the god is the eternity the continual continuity of all this continuity comes in this way the eternity purity and the consciousness and what is this purity purity is always i say as i feel that it is love and unselfishness the god is the embodiment of love and unselfishness so god has no choice he loves everyone everything so that purity and consciousness what is the consciousness there is no ignorance sometimes we think that is a very good thing i like to take that maybe something in the world maybe a car maybe a house maybe some position but it's all temporary so i lose my consciousness over there my judgment to understand the thing but those who are conscious ever conscious they will never make the mistake so conscious through his consciousness one become conscious as i was telling the reflection on the buddhi and through his intelligence the whole world appears intelligent shipner said that some europeans had gone insane that they had lost their hates by thinking too much about god sometimes some people they behave little uh the queer way peculiar way then the the one gentleman is writing to many of the other societies and he is claiming why you people are not understanding that i am the incarnation of vivekananda so what is wrong with you can't you understand that vivekananda has appeared so we are not giving any reply to him because we can understand that he is thinking that he has become vivekananda like this it always goes the one young gentleman he came to one of our swami and almost the midnight he knocked his door and said vishnu came to me and told go and take initiation from that xiaomi swami told ask vishnu to come and tell me and then only i will give you initiation and don't disturb me in the midnight so this goes on because sometimes people they think that they have realized god they have seen the light their deeds and that but they don't have the pure idea about the god that is the ramakrishna that he god himself so no ambiguity a person who doesn't know he'll be reading and he will hearing he will recognize that he will thinking and then he will say there may be mistake in that but the truth that truth means the one who is that truth taking the human form there cannot be any mistake so that is ramakrishna is telling some european he said and he became like that and then our shivanath is telling like this in their case it may be true but they think of worldly things there is a line in the song divine power fills my body and rubs me off consciousness the consciousness referred to here is the consciousness of the outer world this is ramakrishna he was he never attended the school and not having any certificate but look at it the thought is so clear so he said when these type of sentences are used the words are used it is robbing of the outer consciousness issan was seated touching sirama krishna's feet and listening to his words we all know those who are following this class you know the sudama krishna giving the advice to ishaan and that is the the whole chapter advice to ishaan it is continuing and today also we are reading their advice to ishan ishan we by this time we all know the issue was a righteous person and he was practicing spirituality outwardly he was sitting every morning and evening taking the name of god occasionally he was practicing austerities like fasting and not talking to people all those things that he was doing as we always think that that is the spirituality sadama krishna the great guru he is interested to make this person realize the truth when he was doing this ishaan is doing not only isha and most of the people all of us we think that we are doing we i have taken the name of god 108 times i am become pure of course if you can take seriously with all your mind you can become pure but the god realization means forgetting the whole world forgetting your body forgetting your mind the ashtabakra there the janaka wanted to get the knowledge of brahman what happened he had to forget his body he had to forget his mind he had to forget his own kingdom then he was just there and he was his mind was not having any ripples of thoughts that time his teacher came and told us came and told you have realized that brahman you need not to say to anyone you can feel that what is the trouble then what is the problem problem is the mind in the mind always there are so many thoughts and thoughts are always connected with these worldly things and the when those worldly things are they're all temporary sometimes we are getting agitated sometimes attracted sometimes repulsion so many things are happening all the time in the mind so we have to withdraw that how it is possible for getting your own body and consciousness that mind if it is possible and it is possible how deep sleep when you go to our deep sleep each and every one we are experiencing that in the deep sleep we don't know whether we are having a body whether we are sleeping on the bed or on the floor whether we are having these or that just sleeping and that time no mind we are not also dreaming so deep sleep is an example and the proof the consciousness is there and when we come back from the deep sleep we feel so happy so that proves the ishan he was trying to do that why suramar krishna he is targeting ishaan and constantly ishan came to meet him all of you know he came to meet him then he went to practice his spirituality sitting in front of the temple dakshinesha kali temple and he was sitting over there just like the brahmins as the practice he took little water on the right hand palm and then drinking in the name of vishnu then all those ritualistic thing he did then he was counting his beats siram krishna went he noticed he saw that afterwards he was telling till now you are doing it so many years you are practicing this still you have not realized it that was the first thing he wanted to impress by this time he should have graduated you are continuously going on practicing and there is no revelation of the spirituality in your character in your behavior in your nature in your thought those who are practicing spirituality the monks and nuns and also the devotees again and again we must ask this question to ourselves you know that i heard in the uttar kashi that is the place in the northern part of india mostly the monks will be there when they see each other meet each other they sometimes the great drishti safa swamiji like that they will say whether you are conscious who are you and what you are doing drishti means is it clear you can see so there is a way of expression drishti safa is ramiji one mom saying to other so by that way we are reminding each other we have left our heart and home and after coming over here in the organization then again in a very wonderful way we are hypnotizing ourselves we think oh this is the this is my asama that is their astra oh my god so we have to remember this is a very important chapter bhagavan's ramakrishna through ishan teaching us so many years you are going on taking the name of god and practicing so-called spirituality but what is the result if i regularly go to school and attend the class and not going on passing the class exams and not getting the education then what is the fun of going over there so that is what he is telling isha now understood and he felt and he understood that leaving god is just in front of me and i am going over there and sitting and taking the name of god so he understood it at least this much so he came and he hold the feet of the bhagavad-gita and he was sitting over there listening to his words now and then he cast a glance at the image of kali in the the dictionary those who have visited these are the some places one should go and see because the religion was experimented over there so that kali that same temple the same image still there so vivid so one can go and see and can visualize here is the person he was sitting over here holding the holy feet of bhagavad-gita he was casting glance at the kali in the shrine in the light of the lamb she appeared to be smiling mastermind imagining it was as if the living deity manifesting herself through the image was delighted to hear the master's words holy as the words of the vedas holy as the words of the vedas so panchama veda i always say like that that these are the holy words what is veda veda the the basic scripture of the hindus of the sanatana panties and what is there the truth what is the truth god alone exists and the same thing we again and again we hear and demonstration also is there in the life of sri ramakrishna ishaan that this is very interesting ishaan we can imagine surama krishna is sitting ishan humli holding the holy feet of sudama krishna is looking at srama krishna and also glancing to that goddess kali and pointing to the image he is telling those words from your sacred lips have really come from there that he is telling surama krishna it's not you but the goddess kali is telling through you so you and kali are both the same after so long ishan was a well connected person and after so long now ishan has realized that then the master is telling i am the machine she is the operator this is the humbleness in the veda if you notice so many people they realized those truth but they never mentioned their names they remained in the oblivion very very few the that very few the munis or the rishis the seers we know their names very few but hundreds they realized those truths and they gave it to for the prosperity for the human generation then name is not necessary that is the humbleness those for little thing if they are going for name and fame no they are not basic religion is not there why because the religion spirituality means this world is temporary so that we have to remember always and every time the surama krishna as i always say he was demonstrating that when the ishan realized it and before everyone when he said that those words that you spoke is actually the coming from the goddess kali the great respect that he gave and in replies ramakrishna very humble way he is telling i am the machine and she is the operator i am the house and she is the indweller i am the chariot and she is the chadiate i move as she moves me i speak as she speaks through me so that is the way one should understand swami vivekananda we all know the success that he made the great wave that he could raise over here in america and that was a very important time in the history of india particularly why india was under the subjugation of so many years this is 700 800 years and indians lost their faith that any day they will get the freedom and vivekananda brought back that confidence so naturally all those millions and millions of indians they were so happy and when this young men man went back you can imagine in thousands they came and they were shouting vivekananda glory to be bigger and how vivekananda reacted he said oh no please don't do that because the one who did is my master suramar krishna and he can do it just by taking small dust from the street and can make that famous i am only the machine this humbleness if it is not there then it is not possible to make success in spirituality suramar krishna is telling in the kali yuga one does not hear the voice of god it is said except through the mouth of a child or a madman or some such person you have to hear through somebody directly god's voice in this age it is not possible why the mind is not completely pure when the mind is pure then only it is possible a man cannot be a guru everything happens by the will of god this month on the fifth was the guru purnima the full moon was dedicated to the guru and we had two three programs and all over the world the hindus they celebrated the guru purnima and this word guru means one who removes the darkness is the guru what is the darkness ignorance what is the ignorance i and this body and mind are all there i get associated with my body and mind and obviously body mind means association of all this whole world my friend my foe my likings my dislikings all that comes that is ignorance and guru comes and removes that in the bhagavata it says can anyone do it because the ignorance that has come it is from god can a human remove that how can he get that so much power so this god again who can do it maybe through someone that is possible but guru means god that's why he's telling a man cannot be a guru everything happens by the will of god heinous scenes the scenes of many births and accumulated ignorance all disappear in the twinkling of an eye through the grace of god why in bengali they say kapal motion the motion means it can change whatever i have done in my past birth in a moment he can now someone did something wrong see he they brought him in the core king's court king looked at him and then said okay release him no one will be there to challenge the king how it is possible last year for the same reason you give this type of punishment to this man why the king is a king no one can challenge the king wish oh that okay just release him he can't do the same way the god also can do you cannot go and ask questions you cannot immediately make a rally oh go against god why god is doing nepotism no that is not possible so god is the whole power and we have to remember most of the time we always make the mistake even when vivekananda was young narendra not he was telling why god is creating so much problem for the people sometimes some people that they had they've been god they could organize the whole world much better way but they don't understand it is god only we suffering it is god only who is creating problem so that is the highest spiritual thought unless and until mind is completely pure we cannot understand a little bit of science and little bit of these and that we read and we think oh no this is the cause and this is the reason so it cannot be there is no god i don't believe god they say but one day he will die and when he is dying he cannot save himself it's not possible it goes according whatever may be so that is why it says how the thought came who created these sometimes the neuroscience will say something but if you go deeper and deeper there is always a question mark where from where from where from there the vedantin they say it is god the devotees will say it is god and that consciousness it is there the sudama krishna is telling man cannot be the god is all gods that is happening when light enters the room that has been kept dark a thousand years does it remove the thousand years darkness little by little or instantly it's a wonderful example a man is ignorant the moment the light comes immediate effect a person who was ignorant touched by the holy people immediate effect that is why the swami vivekananda said religion is a process that makes a brute unto man man unto god it just transform returns from the personality today we were having a talk with some people and they were asking about the vedanta they were asking about our activities one hour the few questions they asked to swami bharadanandaji few to me so you were answering and i narrated in this way our idea only is this a man is a basically holy why he was created by god and god is holy so when god is creating out of what holiness so that faith we are having and as swami vivekananda said to make people aware about their divine nature aware we are not creating we are not giving we are not acquiring it is there only you have to make him convince make her convinced you are divine to make people aware about their divine nature and to help them to manifest it what is our mission to help them to manifest it we are not bringing from outside we are not giving it to him or her nothing it is already there only helping how that they say then leave your life and show them the path leave your own life and show them it is the air then all it is possible when a teacher go to the classroom he knows what he's going to teach and he knows what are the questions that may come he knows how to answer them why because already passed through that at that confidence that reality comes from the realization so this god only can do and when that knowledge comes immediately everything changes it's not little little at once what can a man do he may speak many words but after all he said and done everything rest with god then as cerama krishna is owned he always gives an example people may say many thing but it depends on god whether the god will do it or not that is up to him we cannot do anything the same way immediately he's giving the example he said the lawyer says i have said all that i all that can be said now the verdict rest with the judge lawyer cannot give the judgment lawyer is giving only the arguments putting all the references judgment is depending on the judge the same way the people when they're talking about god they can say and then say this much i know and then that's all up to you so mantra they sometimes say what is the mantra the secret words that the guru is giving to the disciple and what is that mananath constantly remembering constantly pondering constantly concentrating on that particular world that the guru has given and then triathe you get freedom freedom from the bondage what is that bondage this world the bondage that i am different than god that is bondage the vedanta will say this is ignorance that is your bondage you are actually free but if you don't believe it then what to do so this way it always goes one has to have that faith guru gives that mantra and say go on practicing else he cannot do anything else but the god can god can do it so this is the way suramar krishna is telling brahman is actionless now once again he goes back to the vedanta dualism dweta and monism the advaita mixed together action activity devotion and rationalism and concentration always every time whenever he is speaking all the four are coming and clubbing together he was telling the guru cannot be any human being god and you have to have the faith you should be humble that god has chosen me to do it with whatever many people they are doing many other things but the god has chosen me to do it and i am grateful to god that he has chosen me for this brother lawrence that today they were asking in the interview you being hindu do you get inspiration from the other religions is a very tricky question but we particularly the followers of krishna vivekananda many of you i don't know whether you know it or not we read lot of religious books spiritual books of other faiths the sufism and the lives of the great holy sages first generation leaders in the christianity mother teresa that the teresa of avela not mother teresa of calcutta teresa avela our inspired life brother lawrence his inspiration we all rate that when you are very young so obviously this we have to understand he was in the beginning he was thinking why the abort is giving me all these jobs the difficult things i have to go to the market and it is so cold and i am having trouble in my lake but still the he is choosing me to go and purchase why not others they are inside the church and in the particularly that was winter very chill inside it is cozy those people are sitting over there and asking me to go in the market to purchase that he was thinking in that and then he was going on fighting with his own god why god why all the time you choose me for this difficult job you know that i am suffering it is you only he is going on talking with god god and god he went to the market purchased those things came back and when he entered his room then he realized i didn't feel any cold i went such a long walking but i never felt that i am tired how it is possible because his mind was with god this is the wonderful way the teachings so it goes in this way the brahman is actionless we are suffering we are all having the problem the who has created us the vedanta will say the veda will say it is brahman but the brahman is actionless that's true that is one aspect of the brahman then he said when it engaged in creation eat it's not he or she when it engaged in creation preservation and resolution it is called primal power shakti bhagavan sirama krishna can you imagine his idea is very clear but he never read all the upanishads of the brahma-sutra no but his own revelation one realization that's why it is telling so it is always said that if you have realized something in the hindu tradition if you have realized some truth it should tally with the veda why the hundreds of the rishis they have realized the same truth in different time zone in different period in different places in different ways but the realization of the same that is the beauty of the veda all rishis in different places they practice the same type of spiritual practices almost and they realize the same thing in the modern age 1836 bhagavan sirama krishna he took the birth and all these things are going on in the in the 19th century beginning in the end of the 18th century you can see and he said the same truth which is recorded in the veda in the upanishad the brahman is actionless he never do anything then as if he is creating from his own power and that is called primal power adhya shakti and that shakti is creating preserving and dissolving all these things are going on it is his power its power this power must be propitiated why the brahman is completely actionless if we have to when we separate ourselves because of the ego from this primal energy now we have understood it we have to go back from the one many has come and now back calculation from the many we have to become one we have to reach to one that is the whole of spirituality i am we are all many we are thinking but now we have to go back to the one how by realizing or praying appropriating the god's power the brahman's power which is ada shakti don't you know that it is so written in the chandi the gods first sang a hymn to the adaya shakti in order to propitiate heart only then did what he means the god wake up from his yoga sleeve and every time you will notice that hindu avataras they're having their shakti in the form of a lady that this time bhagavan sri ramakrishna he expressed his shakti through martial devi one day one someone told a devotee told we are going for on pilgrimage we'll be visiting these holy places sirama krishna he was that time sikh he told have you told it to the mother masha adamani devi they said no we didn't inform because we are telling you when sanama krishna told no you better go to her then he said without hard blessings no good will happen even if you visit the holy places go and tell her and pray and request start to bless you so when you are going to the holy places pilgrimage and you should get the blessings of these pilgrimages benefit of that so this is the power issuance yes sir brahma and the other gods sang this him at the time of the death of the demons madhu and kaitaba salam krishna mentioned ishan is a knowledgeable person he read the chandi and immediately he was quoting like this we chant from the chandi the first chapter 72 to 76 verses it gives that swah this way they are giving the offerings and in the footnote you will notice in the gospel of krishna very clearly it mentioned why swaha why swadha etc so he was chanting master yes but you must assimilate that again this is also pointing to us majority of the people i know many people will memorize the whole gita and you just say quote from any sloka any words immediately they can quote from there but they don't assimilate it they don't practice that knowledge only memorize that many of the people they think by chanting the holy slokas i become pure unless you know the meaning of it and unless you try to imbibe the spirit of those words how it is possible you have to change yourself only just like a parrot if we are going on chat chanting no that won't have any effect so these are the very clear ideas ramakrishna is telling the moment ishan got the hint immediately chanted from the sri chandi and chandi is the book that is that we can say in a small book a whole tantra is there that is usually that the time of durga puja kali puja the people they read chandi and ishan was knowing that he quoted from the those verses but what's ramakrishna's comment this is important we go on reading but we don't notice which is that exactly there the teaching of krishna when he quoted that the ishaan chanted that immediately sudama krishna said yes you know those verses but you must assimilate that so this is the important thing it is for us that we are only quoting from the verses but not understanding the meaning of it not assimilating those qualities and not changing our whole thought process and the character is of no benefit the master rose he mounted the platform in front of the shrine and saluted the mother touching the ground with his forehead the devotees quickly gathered around him and fell at his feet they all begged his grace he descended from the platform and started towards his room conversing with aim first he sang means the master master who is recording and he first sang his song so this is also through the songs the sama veda bhagavan sri krishna when he is mentioning in the bhagavad gita of all the four vedas reek sham yaju atarba i am sama veda why because very nicely it expressed that truth sama it is in a political form and you can put the music into it tune into it you can chant you can sing and in olden days they used to sing in that way there was no saregama so naturally they used to have their own way to sing some of the swami is the the older tradition they know how to chant it the very well audience the god krishna said of four vedas it came from me but i like sama veda why the song the truth is expressed through song words are there meanings are there but the musical way it expressed so that's god pleased with that many of the people they like the poetry that sometimes some people they go and talk in such a way so nice way the presentation [Music] same thing they'll be telling but the presentation that pleases the person to whom they are addressing it so that's why sirama krishna is first singing how i bow my head says prasad before desire and liberation knowing the secret that kali is one with the highest brahman i have discarded once for all both dharma and a dharma that is in bengali ram prasad he was a tantric but he i don't know in his biography he's not there he never practiced meditation as usually we think that tantrics they do in the cremation ground nothing like that who only used to compose the songs and he used to sing in that way what he is telling through his song i have realized that the activity the power of brahman and the brahman are the same and therefore the righteousness and unrighteousness they are also same dharma and adharma righteousness and unrighteousness sometimes we hate the people who are telling lies and these and that but why they're also because of the influence of that i have no right to criticize or to hate that's why jesus i like that very much he said hate the sin not the sinner because sinner may change any time but the activity that he is doing that should not be followed head the sin not the sinner here he says i have understood that what is this holiness and unholiness everything from god so why because the brahman inactive pure and holy and the same brahman when active utilizing the three gunas satya rajatama and through the satya little better raja makes tama the lowest one all he is only so why unnecessarily i am going on thinking oh that person is bad this is good this and that i have given everything why this so the truth is everything is nothing but the god but i should not take the power of god but the god himself i have understood it the master continued do you know the meaning of dharma and a dharma that next sunday when we will be studying the bhagavatam we'll be reading this krishna in the bhagavata because the uddhava is asking him what is dharma what is a dharma what is good what is bad beautiful way they are explaining in the upanishad we don't find this upanishad is just like giving the statement so it comes to the puranas they explain those truth we'll in the coming sunday we will read that and explain here bhagavan sirama krishna is telling do you know the meaning of dharma and dharma righteousness and unrighteousness here dharma means religious act enjoyed by the scripture such as charity then shraddha feeding the poor and the like this is dharma the performance of this dharma is called the path of karma it is an extremely difficult path it is very hard to act without motive therefore one is asked to pursue the path of devotion the dharma as srama krishna is the action but he never meant swami vivekananda he is telling through unselfish work one can reach the same goal where buddha reached by his knowledge and christ by his prayer here suramar krishna is mentioning karma is very difficult what karma he was mentioning sakama karma i want to have these i like to go to heaven i like to have this power i like to so with all the desire when we are performing that is very difficult we do not know what type of result we will get sakama karma so it is better to go for devotion bhakti i love god i like god i like to please god that's all a man was performing the shrapnel ceremony now as i told this is the in the characteristics of suramar krishna he will say something immediately he will give an example and the example he says he was you know after the death of someone the relatives particularly the son and very close relative they will perform the shraddha ceremony from sradha the sraddha and with the with the respect they will remember and they will feed the the people the poor and and the brahmins all that and thinking that the person who has passed away whatever he did the karma fella will be naturally distributed among so many people and he will go without carrying the luggage of his karmapala but that is a debating thing to a different thing the salama krishna is mentioning he was performing sad ceremony in his house he was feeding many people just then a butcher passed leading a cow to slaughter he could not control the animal and became exhausted he said to himself let me go into that house and enjoy the feast of the sraddha ceremony and strengthen my body nanish i shall be able to drag the cow along so he carried out his intention but when he killed the cow the scene of the slaughter fell also on the performer performer of the shraddha ceremony that is why i say the path of devotion is better than the path of action so path of action you do not you are feeding people and you are thinking that you are distributing all the karma followers that a man acquired to them but it also happens so this is the way it always goes but without any desire without any intention if we do if we perform the ramakrishna mission now they are feeding in thousands in in the india in different places because of the present day situation the poor people where they will go the factories are closed life is installed no one is going out but the daily daily earning people what they will do so the ramakrishna mission as they always do their collecting fund to feed these people and to arrange their stay their medicine we are also acting all over india all our monks they are doing the last three months going on not only that our monks are also coming in contact with this terrible uh this kovit 19. some of them the young people they are also suffering now our headquarters is thinking to start to construct a separate building to keep them where they will send them so that that building they are planning to construct and they're trying to get the fund raised found on that all these things are going on we are also working working intently and we are the followers of sudama krishna what does it mean we are working only to please god and for nothing else so that work is nothing but devotion that work can never bind anyone so this is the way it goes the devotion is necessary the master entered into his room accompanied by aim he was humming a song the forceful words of renunciation that he had just spoken to ishaan found expression through his its words thank you friends i think we should close over here stop over here and next wednesday again we will continue uh this chapter any question so we will close it with the pranam mantra need [Music] is [Music] namaste
