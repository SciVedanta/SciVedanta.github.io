[198: Panchama Veda 198: The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna : God Is Both Vidya And Avidya](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7m5fPQ5lp4)

good evening let us begin with this stotra Kadam written dr. G venom riddim column 3 Matata booby greed on the board Arjuna today is a very auspicious day and all the Hindus believe the Akshay Tritiya whatever you do that becomes permanent eternal they say that the Ganga started flowing from today and there are many other auspicious things that happen particularly today so this oxide routier evening we are starting when Chama Veda and that is the gospel of advance Ramakrishna and today we will discuss that the being and God are same the topic is God is bought with and evicted this ceramic business the from ceramic richness I coated the Vita and of India they're both that is God the dystopic is all this is a confusing thing for the thinkers and the Philosopher's how we the limited being the we the people the being who is taking birth and dying with being that is making so many mistakes can be God how that is possible that is a confusion all the time and here can God be bought with that is knowledge and a big deal that is who is enlightened or maybe we can say this room is lighted at the same time it is dirt how it will be so one has to understand it very clearly the bigger and a bit away from it came can that be the God the same in page 5 to the gospel of C Ramakrishna we find that in a conversation narendra is commenting the ceramic is nur he said that there are three glasses of holy men short ik rajasic and dhamma see now holy at the same time Temasek the holy person at the same time rajasic sucked ik okay we can understand rajasic also to some extent okay but how can a holy person be Temasek at the same time holy just maybe the young narendra he in a sarcastic tone TC what is it like the elephant god all indeed a god like that he said not that he was supporting the the sentence the subject but he was just making a little fun with ceramic is not sadhana business mind but we confirm it is God Himself who sports in the world as both Bhatia knowledge are good and obedient ignorant are bad so this is the Hinduism that good and bad cinema Krishna again you say that's why I salute both good and bad there is a realization once the ramakrishna mission was taking shape taking form you know that ramakrishna mission started in 1897 first me the swami vivekananda officially announced and with the help of two ladies from America the American ladies a plot of land was purchased which is now been dormant and slowly slowly things pre-screen after this day so all these things are additionally the Hindu monks they go to the guru take the initiation and instruction and then they go away and start their own astronaut in their own way they grow spiritually but an organization that Concepcion was not there among the Hindus particularly among the the monastics it is foot who developed this conception and then slowly swami vivekananda for the first time among the Hindu started that you can understand how challenging it was and imposed discipline on those people who were not caring for anything do they have left the heart and home they have come over there and you cannot just find them with the rules and regulations but organization means rules and regulation you cannot do whatever you think so it was going on Shami brahmanas the tea the he used to meditate all the time used to be in that mode he was the president naturally it was the responsibility of the manager and he was also known on the G the direct acceptance of Saddam of Krishna the one day Rahman on the ji came and complained against some young officious who joined and he was they were not listening to him so he was angry he came and then complained to the president and told Raja you must review them scold them otherwise they are not listening they are not following the rules he put a very hard taskmaster and it was necessary to make the mind control this is necessary but the comment of the Roger mother she said I cannot see any difference I see only salam o krishna who are the boys you are novices are not complying with you and listening to you or obeying you I see everything sinister how can I score that this is the highest point when advanced Ram Krishna said that this the whole universe or that you see the good and bad both are the same from this point of view now friends before we go to the other discussion we can try to understand it from different points of view the God ceramic agency it is God Himself whose pores in the world as both Vidya that means the knowledge or good and have idea that ignorance are bad now what is knowledge and what is ignorance from the point of view of the vedantam or the spiritual scientist the Builder means knowledge means the conception of one and not to one who has the conception of one and in this so many varieties sees only one finds only one that is knowledge and those who see different signals these are the two things so obvious made these things we can prove it you know in Vedanta we prove only with three different ways first is the study what is through T that is Veda and what is beta the realizations of the Rishi's and we call it obvious up tear up the means the realized soul what the realization really do we see many at the back of it it is only one like there's so many time I'm Sathya the bulbs are there the form the fans are different they are also working and different to be names the different forms are different but the scientists will come and say oh no this is only lectricity there is only one the one that is we see so many the children are the ignorant people if you go and say oh whatever you see this light this microphone and the fan and TV and whatever everything is one how come how it is possible from that point of view one to appear so many so this it says that's called Shruti they realized it then another is yuck T now we being Hindus we accept beta but why other people those who are not Hindus why they should accept that sometimes I attended a program where the Muslim gentleman he was every time it was said the different religious people they were sitting and they were talking from their own point of view every time he was raising the Quran the holy book and he was telling see it is written over the Quran every sentence he was raising that book and it is written in the Quran then someone said you believe that we don't you prove that what is written over the truth doopty doopty means reasoning the win every code from the bhagavad-gita we approved it why say Krishna see then a person will ask the American Allah who is this richness that the nicely but who is he obviously this is very very important only sruthi on duty the reasoning is necessary and obviously the perfect thing is the anubhooti the realization unless and until we ourselves realize no amount of statement of the weather readers can make us convinced of it when we realize it then it is now we go on telling that suppose you put your finger in that lamp the small little lamb that is burning over there but if you go and put your finger it will burn all people are telling like that but unless you put your finger and there being a burning Dean only the actual realization will come otherwise not the saw the people they need that type of experiences is the main thing is really how many people are talking in so many different ways and if they say it is all love it is all compassion it is all servings so then I attended some of the different type of the meetings then one lady came dancing almost and she was dealing like this you're showing and moving hand on the heart let the heart come on me my touching my heart like the year that you may hurt all people were all so good this is okay nothing wrong in it three gentlemen approve we understand what is love so that is and when you see that Shankar Acharya he said I am NOT going to die because I am the consciousness and the self truly when a person in the asam he went to visit the eastern part of India and when a person came and told I have a dream I am a tantric following the path of Tantra and I had a dream that if I can sacrifice you and offer you a lead at the feet of my goddess I will achieve lot of power will you sacrifice yourself hungry that he immediately agreed and why not if with the mind dead do you get the benefit okay so let's look at it without any hesitation of course his disciple when he was meditating but not bother and then he understood that there is something wrong and he came out changed reached over there saved his guru there is also another but look at the person whatever you say is convinced Shami Vivekananda was delivering lecture in the in America in the southern part in Texas and he was standing on a wooden box under a tree and he was delivering the talk and he was talking about the concentration and of course the avi the fearlessness and some of the Cowboys at that time it is 1894-95 we can understand we immediately did took out the gun and started shooting all around him and the bullets were passing but then he began under never cared that never blinked as if nothing has happened so when they see they are convinced fearlessness of V truly that so that is called realization and when that realization is a they truly they understand DC's the truth nothing else necessary no book no lecture no can other things because they have convinced as bhagawan's Ramakrishna say if you have drunk the milk you know what is milk if someone comes and says milk is like these milk is like that you won't believe because the realization different ways we reach to the truth one is Rudy now here if we see the suti and an abuti let us begin from the an abuti in our last discussion with quoted from the courier the Shankar Acharya he said Shyam / Egypt who paid with the tabanga-do Sheena param Rashad mana sir God maka Sunapee big Shetty so iam SATA protect nina raedo cotton even in the Vivek - Romani 190 verse kidding Shandra [Music] as you not this is the realization and the analyze before that you know those who are the student of Atlanta you know they have analyzed the beam what is there is a physical body then a mind then slowly slowly the under Maya mono Maya pranamaya with Gianna Maya ananda maya all different types of coverings are there then finally they go to that art man then ottoman what is that art man then we see that the consciousness reflecting on our booty on our internet now we are taking the decision but there is no God who took the decision my booty my intellect not my body not my mind not my ego of course they are all there present but the final decision is taking by the intellect the booty and what is this book the reflection of the consciousness which is known as God now we add consciousness with the help of that consciousness someone says I don't believe in God it's also K so this consciousness the Supreme Being who is one and without second is assuming the different from Y the ceramic Krishna answers to play the in in the beginning itself we have braved the ceramic richness telling this is to play it is written in the joined it is telling both Vidya and a bit dia therefore I salute both it is written in the Chandi the Divine Mother is the good fortune of the Blessed and the ill fortune of the unlucky in the bhagavad-gita again the seventh chapter it says those who doesn't want to realize God I am their desire I develop desire in their mind and they start thinking that as maximum possible in this world we should enjoy the physical injury where from that thought is coming again to God this is very special this is very peculiar the God is encouraging those who wants to enjoy this world okay enjoy but those who doesn't want then he will help in the other way you know that story that see Christian place that person who was very rich he said may your the richness grow and that lady elderly lady she was having nothing accepted cow and selling the milk she used to somehow survive and her whole mind was devoted to Krishna and Christian of Leicester let your kite out darling let your cow die and what happened Arjuna asked this why she is so devoted to you and served him so well and so poor you are giving the blessings of the wealth to that man then the Christian said look at this lady she's trying to get liberation only one bondage that cow now if I click now dad she will have only one to cling to that is me the God and she will come to me she'll be liberated so this is the way the God always work the car commish we bharatarsabha in the bhagavad-gita say Bharata Rishabha that means the Arjuna I am the desire in their mind who called himself and the desire means going away from God and then ultimately suffering my firm it is coming coming from God this is the confusion the why God does like that and why it happens because God creates the human being and gives the intellect but D and in again he comes in the form of Guru he comes in the form of the avatar the great Souls teach them that this is bad and this is good now you choose you know that particularly it is among the Bengalis and also in that this is a practice of the hindus a child becomes five months old or six months old they start giving them the rice right first rising and they'll be placing some few things before the child to grab the child doesn't know anything there'll be some rise there will be some grasses there'll be a money there will be a paint something and not a Christian that with a playful way it will touch it and yesterday day before yesterday one baby came he touched the money and the parents are very happy our son is going to be rich now this is the way always we think the indication perhaps so this we find that in the bhagavad-gita and in the chandi you say that I am the source of their desire so God is the source of the desire then from where we will get the blessings of God so that we can get liberation from God itself but how it is possible go to God and pray please don't make me deluded with your Maya and here we find like that in the Bhagavata also we find the all-pervading Brahman created this world full of miseries he death and the emo immortal things and from his own conscious being again and again with the power of his divine divinity he created the Maya delivered them and finally for their liberation manifested Veda and incarnated himself when the bhagavata their question is the God has created and then he is greeted his and it puts the being into dead again he seems the Rishi's the great souls and the knowledge of the spirituality the Veda reveal into their heart to guide these people not only that he himself is coming down abathur an Avatara to keitel people ultimately he is leading them for liberation he is landing he is giving the liberation but why he is creating he is creating the problem he he is helping them to get liberation for all this they say this is pours divine spores you cannot ask the Sadam Oh Krishna said it is all divine spores you cannot ask but if you understand these then you're crossing the Momo my art identity Momo Maya all the delusion then immediately it goes away through the different stories the Hindus try to bring this idea to the people the two brothers karthika and Ganesha they were sitting with their mother the mother was having a beautiful garlic and suddenly input the brothers they wanted that girl mother give it to me the mother said okay whoever will go and circle the whole universe and come back the first one I will give this Karthik again smile to his elder brother Ganesh first is little heavy and then his particle very smart his carrier is the peacock we can go very fast immediately he started moving around and coming agony he just circle the mother and said on a lap and mother gave that current to him tika came back saw the girl hanging from the front the Ganesha and he complete mother this is not right he has never moved I have noticed he has not gone anywhere how can you give it some Vidya and a beam the big the Ganesha understood what is this universe what is this world mother herself the mother has created this universe why should I go for the shadows all the pictures all the media marriages everywhere no is a mother so she is the source of everything she is all he he subdued the mother and sad that is called big dia and another is told universe and then we go to moon we go to Mars we go everywhere to find out the peace the happiness the joy when this world will be populated and there will be nothing no resources then we will go to the moon or to the Mars we'll settle over there so many thoughts are coming why to survive to get the joy but the joy is within your heart so that it says why the God is doing it the divine play and if you understand that then there is no problem so again them how we will know the God has created this here we have to go back to the who Phoenicians that the Rishi's from their own experiences realizations and I will quote from the Mundaka Upanishad in the mundaka says eater smart jayati bra no the prana the vital forces from where eaters mark from this from this means the Brahmin from this Brahmin from this consciousness appeared the vital force then mana the consciousness it is reflecting convicted almost in separated azim survey indriyani churn and all the different our sense organs in rioni and now India dear my eyes are there but nothing to see I don't know whether you have sailed in the sea and not in the high sea if you go from the shore the sea is so beautiful but if you go inside the high sea and from the ship you see all around water and nothing else only water water and water then you become very tired very very tired so in the sleep when they are sailing they give lot of food and you just eat and sleep and there'll be movies than the other games otherwise it is so boring sailing into that from the distance we think how it is a wonderful fun no because you can't see anything you have the eyes and there is nothing to see so the most of the time the people will be talking the between among themselves out-of-plane are watching the movies what they can do sitting in the room itself but they go spending so much of money and then when they reach that sure thing there is joy what is there inside the city then they will go and visiting different shops that is the joy that means what all this Indian is I like to be listened to someone I like to talk to someone I like to test I like to see I like to touch all these things are necessary otherwise all this hour then the Saints organs there have no use the God created all the Saints organs then he understood to what they're going to do the same seconds he created again come come means the sky the space by you then the air jyoti the fire and the water and the Brit via the heart so all this five elements can come by you Jyoti ' we shifted Harini and that became the whole universe so one is the object another is to someone to enjoy that object now a very good painter he has drawn a beautiful picture and there is no one to appreciate you want to see what will happen to that the wastage if some people come and appreciate that then only our yes I drew it people have appreciated it anything any creation for what for whom so where from the creation is coming from the God how he started with the prana the vital forces then come came down to earth so this is the whole thing the object and the enjoyer of the object both are coming from the same God this is Mundaka Upanishad says and we find that panel booty and Shruti and about the duty as a student of Vedanta we know all the time the duty we want to survive Beauty means reasoning we want to survive this is a feeling no one likes to die if you go to the hospices then the elderly people whom the doctors have decided there nothing to do you just let them be there and peacefully go and ask them to let you survive I have a miracle I can make you young person today to receive that every one of them will raise their hand yes yes yes make me young again I like to enjoy I like to leave the matter to die where from has since come some the source must be there otherwise the cause and effect effect is desired to survive what is the cause desire to survive desire to leave live a healthy happy life where from that calm the cause is it okay effect is okay the cause must be something from where it has come and that is the God where from that desire has come the existence and knowledge we like to know everything the moment we see some new faith prayer from your coming what is your name to sleep what European courtesies you see where it goes in like that why we like to know where from that desire came well from that wishes came there is also a quality and effect or is a cause again that the source and finally this is all the duty this is all the reasoning the reason cause and effect the effect is there we can understand what is the cause we have to desire to survive we have to desire to know we have the desire to enjoy says it must be those sources the chief part of the slough it is the embodiment is a soul of existence knowledge and bliss this existence knowledge and please this three are coming this is called juke tea not that the simply someone said and we are accepting after reasoning only we are accepting and then this body look at this body is a beautiful body and so many mechanisms are there the medical students their part so visualization in medicals income without then you deserve a beautiful body isn't no use I was reading in the news she was happy she was having that only 22 cm and something happened she fell down and died on the spot yourself now what did he the beautiful lady as lost she was standing she was moving she was talking she was leaving all they were attentive to her the moment she fell down and it was declared the doctors came running said she's dead everybody turned to my god she is dead what is this Jared she is there everything is there but what she lost is a vital force so that is called the prana the way from the prana came and where it went out this is the main thing the wind we understand that through the reasoning there must be something which is so powerful that we need easy we have I did and no value at all as you like but no value unless and until you then put one day in the zero it has value so otherwise not without the God without the consciousness within us this body this mind this intellect this social status this name fame has no value at all so doing we understand that we need not to go for the scriptures we need not to go to the gurus we understand ourselves that is called duty the suti the statements of the realized soul yuck t the argument the reasoning and also sir tu tiene anubhooti after the reasoning when you realized yourself that's true so I must be careful so on this type of these are Hindus in Khalid Hindu calendar if you go every month there is a special day very holy day you should what should you do go to the pilgrimage go and do some charity and take birth in the holy rivers and take as maximum possible the name of God why because by that way they will always encourage you to take the name of God every month will be one or two holy days are there and that way they are encouraging and slowly slowly we understand that it is true all that we are doing is futile only thing that remains is the good that is prevailing with our mind so this way it goes now see Ramakrishna come back to the direct pages of the gospel the Salam o Krishna now conversation turned to the glory of God's name that this is a very special today three ladies came and they wanted to be here so what is the purpose of meditation purpose of meditation to develop be purpose of meditation [Music] practicing spirituality jean-georges immortal or different type of power supernatural power to solve the levels are different of course but ultimately people start thinking I am going to God only the joy and happiness so that is how it is possible the conversation and all this time it was they were discussing about that Vedanta philosophy and Tantra philosophy non cinema Krishna says the glory of God's name Bhuvana is a young boy whom Salaam which means to love very well and I feel such relief while chanting the name of Hari the bonnet is telling that is experience to Saddam occasional many TC unless I can repeat the name of God I feel Restless then I say you are blessed you are blessed because in the in our scripture it says that Dena Dena money mega channel another Tina yes Dena hurry some blop pyou Birgitta that dude in the bad day the day when I cannot take the name of God but the cloudy day and raining that is not a bad day this is just nice natural bhakti is that day when I cannot take the name of God tap Dena Dena money mika-chan nadu tina recent love of the table pooja Birgitta the deal I cannot get this right most of the time when the people they come I will say before going to bed see to all the men from any members and read two or three pages from the gospel of the Ramakrishna then go to bed Harish and la bocca tepee you should decide the nectar when you are reading there it is a to understand the truth we go any villains time you read the meaning sir will be revealing to you this is ramakrishna is telling when the pub owner said like that ceramic is no sale she who relieves us of sin is Hari he who gives art his honey means harren the hurry hurry hurry what is that Adi what it means ahran tick sorry Robb's of what the name of God then he takes out all our scenes she relieves us of our three afflictions in the world what are the three afflictions the curve shanti shanti shanti we see the three afflictions are there are the the ibeacon are the optical and at the Arvika these are the three afflictions are the devika it comes from the nature to the some people they were all right poor people that have to go and feel catching fish in the ocean suddenly something came a tremendous if they have given the name funny and it is destroyed destroyed their houses destroyed whatever little they were having everything so they were not prepared they didn't do anything just because of the nature everything lost so that is why one should pray pray and pray then someone who was arguing with the front desk person in the airport the why when two three minutes before the craft of left so I could not catch that at least within that three minute I could go why you have not waited Exeter Exeter he was going on arguing and they were telling sorry sorry certainly they were there was an announcement in the the TV they found that particular flight client in the man say thank you because you didn't allow me to go the same thing happened sometimes we are thinking oh this is a butler - sometimes the battler becomes good for us so we do not know here we go on taking the name of re what happened when you are going on chanting the name sometimes some people say only this much no other processes and you have to tell them or go and stand in the cool water and then close you breathe and win your legs are freezing in that the ice-cold water then come up and all this type of process if you say they are satisfied and you have to put your lip cord and the eight downward and you have to hang for five minutes then write down all this they're very happy so great process but you should take the name of God that's all why we don't know the move you are taking the name of God more our scene what is the scene all our desires that binds us the at the scenes and we have so many varieties of desires think of our younger days we had so many desires if all those desires were fulfilled we have died look much earlier our parents didn't allow that they were protecting us we were not sometimes happy with the parents they didn't allow us to go to the movie in the late night with the frame no you should not go within the nine o'clock you must and they stink we're from our tribe do they know all these things they are doing it should behave like that why did you do like this then now we can understand because they were strict discipline guiding us today all success because of them so this is the realization and take the name of hurry and you need not to do anything the Salama Mishna says jaden preached the glory of his name chaitanya mahaprabhu and we know the historical perspective of that so we are trying to develop to teach in tourism and presently only Hinduism why Hinduism how the Hinduism and special and economical geographical all the aspect that helped to grow a philosophic suddenly the here it is coming down and Hinduism dropped in India the Christianity dropped in the Middle East not like that so this is the shaitaan' mahaprabhu Feeny came and that time the political social situation was come to different the Muslims invasion entered into India they were trying to reach out every nook and corner of India the people basically hundred-person of them they were Hindus now the this Muslims they were forcing them to convert it into Islam or killing them and this where the social turmoil was going on what will happen then Tom about hurricane sweet Chaitanya he never seen go and meditate in the secluded place and then take three times inside here and old sister and nothing like that he said dig the Nemo green relish nari Krishna Krishna Krishna really that's all and you should not take it inside the room in group you come out and dance so that the in the society the fear will go away and when you are united and united in the name of God and showing your strength of unity rulers will be afraid so that was there we see Chaitanya if you go to South W with Krishna buyers party the name of worried people from the gold it is only in the be God and then children are took it to the God because he is the way religion and social just simply taking the name every immediately the seen anyone concerned Oh what I am giving to God the God is always get from me in exchange I am giving only the seen all bad things now I should not do that I should also give love I should also give respect I should also give my humbleness everything that good thing that is within me so you are slowly slowly developing spirituality the spiritual it is nothing but the wonderful qualities so that we are growing how taking the name of hurry and when the hurry means he is taking away all our scene I don't know God unit or D cover and what we will do we will restrain our thoughts and actions when you are controlling our thoughts and actions what is happening we are not anything bad and what are the bad things harming others selfishness ego is a cause of all seen all bad things so here educate the selfishness we eradicate the ego check the Nama probably asking people to come down to on the street no difference between the educated personal uneducated rich or poor and any caste all at the same then from one place they will see it and take the Prasad by that with the unity in the among the people that he brought ceramic is nice mentioning about that mind ruble curtsy he mentioned that he wanted to go pilgrimage and he told see ramakrishna saw master smiling look at it this is also very important we like to go to the pilgrimage then sometimes some people they go to very very difficult places and they go not only once 13 14 times they are going over there now no problem as tourism increasing some people getting the money and you are also becoming the healthy going and traveling but the path to spiritual purpose how it will serve just these words of the ramakrishna Salama vision is telling that mind romaji how is that do you want to go when the sprout of divine love has hardly come up this minor Babu he started visiting see Ramakrishna and then he started liking the discourses of Ramakrishna he was listening to him and slowly important started it is mine he decided to go what will happen long he will forget all the teachings of the physical pain in visiting the faraway places and mixing with different people we'll take her with all the good thoughts that were slowly generating in his mind first comes the sprout then the tree then the fruit we are so happy to have you here to talk he will go so he is telling him indication is when you go to the pilgrimage you must be prepared why I am going over there what happened over there what I am going to get from there as a beautiful the born or the lake is there is okay there are so many lakes are there and Hill so many eels everywhere so what you are going to do after reaching over there if you think that or these are the things happened over here spiritual development you go as a tourist - no problem it wants a please green then you must be prepared your mind in the bedroom water is just in the morning your top if you go to build hundreds of people thousands of people every day they are visiting but majority of them are not aware about that place put off your shoes for the land you were trotting on is a holy place so he said that she said the lady put off your shoes that means to show respect why because this is the path where Shami be bacon on the stroll and at the sight of the Ganga the narrow small walkway that is where our brahmarandra ji Maharaj is to stall over there and this is a place where the mothers the divine body that was cremated and the sharmaji another all that all those things when you were imagining remembering and then only we'll get the benefit otherwise not met the side of Ganga someplace there are so many places are there beautiful places but if you are visiting with all these thoughts so before visiting some place if we read then only it gets the benefit the holy mother's house in the bug badger the small place those who have visited didn't know this very small place and the approach is also oh my god those who are going from America for Dame will be closing their nose and that if possible to close their eyes also but the moment you enter if you believe that the goddess the divine goddess left over here her footsteps in every step then Tareq devotees before placing the foot over there they will touch that and then only they will go otherwise they own so that devotion that is the benefit well friends this this is the place where we'll stop the salam krishna today gave us a wonderful idea that we are god the bad thoughts that we are having is from god the good thoughts that we are having from god but god wants us to be good so his Farah and upper-upper Trudy is a lower priority and the higher profit we should go towards the higher property not the lower so that's again and again the same Oh God Oh goddess show me you've been eyeing fairs not the face by which you are destroying but the Facebook with which you are making though everyone surviving so this is the variance stop and we'll conclude everything that happened that was induction Asia let us conclude Rita big grumble he shall follow me a medium [Music] damn Ramakrishna [Music] [Music] our me retreat is very near so those who have not here to resistor please register your name at the main retreat and in the mediate radius you should think that will happen in the fast to have a Saturday the University students those who are finishing their PhD at the Masters they will have a discussion I should have the debate whether religion can bring peace and progress the some will be in favor some will be in against then they'll be discussing about other things so we want that the younger generation they are very intelligent they are going to be the different and the blesses in the society if they understand what true religion is it will be not only beneficial for them it will be good for the society also this is the approach there please come join encourage them and then the show me who is coming from Brazil Germany development and you speak about the Brazil and all that and this subject is there please register come and stay in a quiet place with all our other devotees and I really wonder who either goes over there with one idea religion so that is when you are leaving with and you have to share your rooms here to share the bathrooms but you are leaving with completely unknown person but you won't feel there no you will feel that they are a member of my family why same ideology so they reach it quickly because we have to go to the shrine it isn't time and chanting time and the at the breakfast time there will be in the key of all the time in that so this way you become a big family that that is also the feeling of oneness thank you thank you very much
