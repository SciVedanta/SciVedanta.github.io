start today's discourse by chanting this mantra the rocket hamakom dr. jay burnham copywritten calm shavon shavon among golem shri mataji go beginning de bourree dodging our tomorrow is a great day particularly those in our in America the Americans because after a long struggle they got freedom so that is in 1774 76 it was going on and exactly at that time the same British were occupying India a deliverer came straight way to attack India so the India could resist but they came under the girl of eight business people the king and slowly slowly they captured the Indian after 200 years then a great philosopher king Salaam o Krishna and if mouthpiece we can say Vivekananda and they gave us once again that strength and the millions of Indians they rose against this operation and got the freedom in 1945 15th August so that we the both nations the great nations they got the freedom from the same type of operations and the default and little salute those people who gave those lives for our betterment so that is a freedom of everything first political economical social and and relevant the speech and religion everything the same type of freedom is necessary again for our spiritual life also and it is exactly what the body wants around krishna will tell us today about how to get that spiritual freedom is a individual struggle when we fight against some people who are oppressing our country and the society we can club together we can plan we can take up the arms and we can fight and there are many other ways but to win you have to fight with yourself to get the complete freedom of the bondages and those bondages are known and so fascinating the desires the day are the bondage is how to get rid of that because he liked those desires we like those things so we want those so that is what Bhavani Ramakrishna is telling and today we will study 434 page of the gospel of Salaam - nah and here the keisha salam o krishna is reporting some business telling the other devotees ki shop conducted a prayer that evening at the bidding card on the river the kiss of gender shame the famous the speaker he came with many people with many ports windows these days to travel reports the game and that is that they have given the description in 1879 October 29 that was the witness T Keisha Kim and they came and decide and there they were all giving the salman and after that i said to them it is god who manifest himself in one aspect as the scriptures when you are reading the scripture the before the scripture reading we always chant the invoke that holiness why and we after or before we touched the book and offer our pronoun why because this is god the scripture is God now this scripture is god and god himself has manifested through these words now we all believe that God has created this universe and he has given but equally the human being a wonderful gift and that is there but the the discriminative faculty so obviously this great creation the human being that is the last and from there they can go back to the source they can know the God so God comes down to help them through the words through the Scriptures the scripture is so important and it's very so holy for the people spiritual people the cinema Christian is telling God who manifest himself in one aspect what is their aspect as the scripture God is manifesting as the scripture therefore one should worship the sacred books the moment he said the worship we think the Hindus are very fond of worshipping immediately they will be throwing the Ganga water and the flower and then afterwards it will all the nature's and the pages that will go because we cannot read that is not the worship worship means with great devotion you must study we're going on studying so many things we read the novels we read the newspapers we need so many other things but when you are reading the scripture one must be very ready attentive and with great devotion and one pointed attention one must study and that is called worship and that ceramic is distilling worship the sacred books such as as a Hindu disobey the purana Tantra you may remember that we are studying here I joined this institution belong to society in 2030 and from the beginning itself we have studied the Vedas all the four Vedas of course not every versus the bird's eye we can say the bird's view we just do include the Vedas all the four Vedas ten ceramic is distilling the Puranas so we have started some of the Punishers also you will study for the game and the Puranas the parable piranha is the best piranha we are studying now and Tundras there's no that we gave a retreat and Tantra in details with respect about the Tundra's so this scripture Surya study why because they are the manifestation of the God and different type of people they like different type of writer knowledge is different type of teachings different type of the paths so for doing all these so those who like the Tantra at the beach never the piranhas or bhagavata is the life of shri krishna to the bush neighbors and also the vedas and upanishads so this way in hindu temple amount we have started the remnants of Vedanta here is all the small small books which in brief and brief to the point giving the idea of the Vedanta so we are studying that remnants of Vedanta we are studying now to be big to Domini the first will of discrimination so this way it is wonderful is happening then he said because the scripture is the manifestation of God second it says another aspect of ease has become the devotee the one who is interested to know that spiritual thing so he is studying that not all people are studying this books only those who are interested they are coming and very few numbers because majority of the people they have taken away with the flow of the world things so many things are going on so mind goes to that and after that they are exhausted and they suffer because the desire is not ending with that then after having those experiences again and again they come back Shankar Acharya said Mohammed God Mohan the delusion and that should be broken down with a mood God that means the hammer a hammer is necessary to break all our delusion and what is that because we think that dara joy so we go we spin and then afterwards we come back getting a hammers blow so like that again and again again and again we come back and here we come that is called the devotees and the moment we start thinking that which you study the scripture we should know the God that very moment God started dwelling within our heart within our body and that devotee is a holy because God is manifesting within some people they'll spit in the name of God my god birthday and that way the expressions they're eating the God how can God with you God is everywhere but he's manifesting the moment that we are entering into this particular Hall this room we come with fold our hands we offer our respect to the gods and then sit quietly pray meditate and prayer but when you go to the market we don't do that do you go and stand before the Mac to the McDonald people will call foolish this something wrong is going on you are supposed to take out your purse or car before the Mac donor but then no choke it is okay but here you are offering the flowers and you are praying so God is everywhere is it McDonald also the manifestation manifestation is here similarly in the heart of the devotees and the vote is the behavior and the wind speak when they think when they act everything is so wonderful they are so ready to serve others help others and they never users of criticize anything they never uses the harsh languages so that is devotee also is the manifestation of God so then that is the reason one should also be very careful when talking with the devotees they should not be hard some people are brief the very sensitive type they're coming with great faith and then they should not be hard thus authorities he is telling the his devotee one worship God if himself so this is the third god god manifestation in the devotees and God manifestation in the scripture so these three now he's telling Keshav and his followers listen to my words with great attention it was a full moon night the sky was flooded with the light we were seated in the open coat at the top of the stairs leading to the river still that room is there but you know that we don't have the historical sense so we don't know we don't read these type of books and description and those who are there and they have made half portion as a shop and another portion so they have forgotten that should be preserved as it is and these words should be written over there whoever will come to visit that they should read and they should feel here in one moonlit night this thing happened what is that trippity veda the teaching of triple-t Veda we will discuss to that the Keshia and his followers listen to my words with great a tradition it was a full moon night and then I say now let us all chant the Keshia he has given the discourse in their own way he was one of the spiritual leader of the Brahmo Samaj and who thinking still they are there members are there they think that God is not having any form there is a Brahmin but with aspect the bidden thing they think that Brahmin without aspect aspect means qualities we cannot say that Brahmin is having these that the qualities know they know guna but they say the Brahmo Samaj there is a so much me in the society that that Brahmin is having some qualities so it is not God in that way but at the same time it is God that Brahman with the qualities this is the only difference now they come and they pray and they explain about that and as usual in the spiritual line spiritual practices morality the love everyone and help or not etc the after that Saddam occasional very excited he was telling now letters all chant ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba and they also repeated their part of our dr. Bhagwat then he said next I said to them say Brahman is very least Shakti Shakti is verily Brahman they also say that and then Salam o Krishna he also said Brahman Atma Bhagavad that Brahma and Atma and Bhagavad Brahman Maya Jeeva jaggerth all these he was asking them to repeat after him then finally he said guru krishna by Schnapp and the moment he said that the case of said you know not that far the brahman is okay but the when you say that guru krishna and which not that goes so close to the Hinduism we should not otherwise our group will break so we like to keep a separate an entity we are in those but we like to keep a separate entity the Guru Krishna Bush now we won't be able to say then said to them at this the case of that we must not go so far sad if we do that then all will take us for Orthodox Bush numbers ice to tell cash up now and then he whom you addressed as Brahman is none other than she whom I call Shakti Saddam efficient is considered by many particularly those who are highly educated and literate this is Samanya devata in this modern age he is the God who is unifying everything now this very moment to the simple world he is unifying a great thing what is that Brahman and Shakti without the shakti without the power nothing can happen that's why he was telling that Brahman then Maya Jeeva and juddered this is just like shooter just like a small capsule in which the whole philosophy has been presented who is the creator Brahma how he created through Maya the power what he created the Jeeva and also the juggled why the Jeeva and jeddah Jeeva is as having the consciousness juddered inert the inert thing has also been created by God and each each and everything is nothing but the manifestation of God or the manifestation of consciousness is so less in that we think that it is inert so he called it stone we call it other things but the consciousness when manifested that slowly slowly goes up to the human being and those who are really good human beings who can think for others and unselfish so that he said Brahman then Maya then Jeeva and then jagat now he is telling again the hoon you call Brahma I called Shakti then is explaining the primal energy it is called Brahman in the Vedas when it transcends speech and thought and in without attributes and actions same thing without attributes and actions and go beyond in a transcendent con condition there is nothing nothing exists in that condition I call Shakti Adi Shakti why when I find it creating preserving destroying the universe [Music] now we have studied the bhagavata if you can remember those were tending the rug about the class now how the creation came Vishnu created to give a name Vishnu how he created it thought and when he thought all creation started creating and then what he thought that I have to create and then he created himself as Brahma and the four headed person and he is going on thinking and when you create you need knowledge without the knowledge you cannot do anything a person came he was cleaning this with the clean machine and he said I don't know how to open this machine and throw the darts that has accumulated over here so that much knowledge he is having other non and the person came no it is easy here suppose to do knowledge the unless and until you don't have the knowledge it is very difficult then the moment you are having the knowledge even more powerful so one man having the smart form he knows how to use it he is calling the cab booking the cab paying them the tag money and access and booking the tickets traveling without any problem and a person like me I don't know how to use that how do we call the cab and I have the habit of calling the cab on the street and there is no cab over here so what we will do like that it goes I have to take the help of some other these and that so many things goes on so this knowledge only when you don't do the you don't feel doing anything you're in a transcendental condition and that time also you are dead and when you come down and then start working you are also dead the that is what's atomic distance telling that Brahman and Shakti I've seen that same brahmanda consciousness the power which is completely transcendent and inactive that is called Brahman at the same power in active I call it Shakti Kali ma Adar 50 and all these that's why when they wrote about Raghavan see Ramakrishna a beautiful stotra they said para brahma / our Shakti jagad guru brahma fish / from porosity Jagadish then it goes on as a big beautiful daughter what is that para brahma inactive and the singing brahman active parashakti and when the porosity active start activity what happens jaggerth jaggerth rubra so how it the creation comes from itself so this jogger then the activity then the creator or the same so we in cinema Krishna is telling huggable dr. Raghavan I wrote an article on these Brahma dr. other one and what is this forgiving this world this says here would put teacher bernard shamsher butanna agar team katene previously also we have discussed this from the Vishnu Purana the Bhagavata Purana that we are studying now in the sundays and there is also another Bishnu puron about the lord vishnu and what is the Vishnu Pavan what is the Raghavan the definition they say put putting cha be now sure what 30 means creation cha and Bernard destruction then bhutanam the created being agar team go team they know how they are moving the one who knows how these beings are moving agar teanga team then damn apathy aamchur in him there is knowledge and all signals in English knowledge and also ignorance the wane some people are ignorant where from the goddess came because of the maya or notice that maya the power of god so everything is coming from him Subodh children of the Huaorani t he is known as the bhagavad so when he called bhagavan nabokov on these raghavan that we don't go you have to prove that person is having all these qualities then only you can call that person as vagabond but now who is bothering about that simply here if some ordinary person without doing anything never have any conception of the scripture he just say Bhagavad and sometimes three three three they will because they're like this is a nice thing that I said the three sometimes they'll say 5/3 when all the 5 Series race is a boring so 5/3 is okay the white thing you are giving that wife I mean hundred so there is no problem but the thing is why these that have to understand and is it really different bhagavata it's a theory says but until that dr. B that one yet Gianna ah - I am button D cut the lead who has realized that that other team beat means knowledge one who has got that knowledge so tucked OA is the truth build who has understood that truth he said at the same what they see judge Gianna Artyom that knowledge which is having no differences only one knowledge of one earth - I am notoya where means to earth Toya no to one drum eighty per mark me t pavani t sub T these are the words they use what are the words drama the drama acne the Atma talabani the Bhagavad sistership that a win in English we say God we mean Bhagavad but otherwise even in the English dictionary they have accepted the other two words all the three words they've accepted Brahmin Artman Raghavan all they are accepted now but usually we translate the Raghavan as God and this is all the three of the same chaitanya charitamrita is a life of sri chaitanya the LHC's add organic dr. Krishna's sorrow or joy a janitor dog Krishna salud so those who are the believers in Krishna worshipers of Krishna we should understand this so all hindus and goes and marches in unto one what is that up doing there is not to the what is Krishna octo air but cut twirl that is the truth there cannot be the figure that cannot be the name so nama Rupa Vegeta but for us so that we can concentrate we can understand we can follow we take this name and tightener the great founder and the mover object which name of movement they said odd Toya Nadia are means- diamines - Gianna knowledge taught world that truth is the Krishna Krishna Shalu he is the embodiment of that tattwa brahma Atma Baba bong ding da goo that truth which is which you know as Krishna in reality is known as Brahma Atma and Agawam and this is a gentle Natura Tom Rita it mentions in this way and again the children naturally Tomita says Dhyana yoga bhakti tinge Rajan are Bashi Brahma art maboob on trevita Prakash she now Gianna those who are following the path of knowledge you go those who are following the path of yoga and the bhakti those who are put in the path of devotion and all the sudden of these austerities are leading to what now the gianni they go to Brahman yogi go to art man and the vagabond is for the devotees and sometimes we mix it up and we confuse all the time and question become Ramakrishna said after the realisation of the art when the Yogi's do not survive ordinary people more than 21 days more than that is the maximum they may die before that also why because they are not going to God remember they are going to Artman the goal is to realize the Hartman and windy realize the Hartman the Martin Artman what happens their body consciousness mind consciousness high consciousness from completely eradicates completely goes away and when the eye consciousness is not there who is going to eat who is going to drink who is going to take care of the body which is necessary so what will happen to the body without the food it cannot why annamaya kosha this body is the only sustaining with the food when there is no food and drink it will automatically drop off so that is the reason now within the 21 days it may be the last 21 days people can survive before that also they can die why do they die now who those who are going to God will they'll also die in the same way no because they are not going to the Hartman they are going to the God we're team which is nothing but the joy so there la will be I should have to cook food for my god I had pluck the flowers to decorate my god and I must do these I can't do that the completely high consciousness is there and the whole eye is dedicated to the god obviously they are very much conscious about their own body their mind and their needs how they can die they want so when you mix this up that creates the problem to the brahmic Gianni's when they realize the brahman what do they realize the knowledge that I am also the same you are also the same all this I see is nothing but the same so their behavior changes but they don't die so we have to understand that when Salaam o Krishna said within 71 days immediately you are applying the same process if he is a drama Kenny why how it is that he students arrive what is your problem if he is surviving the Brahma can is surviving because he's totally I ideas have changed completely what changes when gentlemen came and told ya how I will know that I have realized God then the mother told do you think after realization you will have two horns on your head master of the money baby putting clearly she said you are not going to have anything different same person same way only attitude will change because Drishti Bunge the way we see things now that will completely change whoever comes in whatever forms we always think oh dear my god I must go and appreciate I must go and serve them the God has come in the form of the poor I must go and give the food God has come the form of the illiterate I must go and provide the education God needs these God meet that I am going and serving they are doing and serving not the poor person not illiterate person but the Living God it is exactly what Shawn awakened the same so in the think in that way and if they are acting after the brahmic a know what happens sometimes as a once lamb dish no thought now my purpose is already done and he is giving an example that you need to prepare one statue and for the preparation you made as some arrangement to make their stature when that statue is already done it is there you don't need all those things you can throw it on me you can keep it for the some other people who are interested to make the statue you can give it to them too so that way if it is so we have to understand now the question is why sama Krishna was telling Bhagavad got the other one so let us discuss about that who is the father world Baba what is that bag about bhagavad means scripture not only the bhagavad that we will study the Bhagavad that we study the name has been given to the life of Shri Krishna's the Raghava and there are so many star stories that we are studying and in the next Sunday we will discuss about what one should do before death the parish it is asking his question and the sukadeva is narrating that telling him before date when the date is approaching and I am sure that I am going to die nowadays the people particularly those who are having their cancer those things the doctors can say three months six months and their way and instead of oh my god what will happen and simply at six months very good long time prepare yourself stop all other things so that exactly what the sukadeva will teach how a monk should die that is also there's the process of dying I am NOT going to give this name because I will the other state that they will say you are inspiring people to die no there is the sugar they were telling that why how one should do before death we will study there and that will slowly slowly slowly they will go to the life of the shri krishna particularly the taint Kondo the tenth book of the bhagavata that only tell about the Krishna but Bhagavad means knowledge bhagavata is the scripture and what is the scripture just we read Ramakrishna instilling manifestation of the God that God is giving those knowledge to whom dr. Bhatt is a student but is a devotee doctor is a person who is interested to know whom Raghavan now other people those who like to know about the other Sciences they're not supposed to come and know about this but probable then dr. Dayton Bhagavad the doctor who is bhakta because his mind has been just dies clean purified by the thought of God with the thought of God constant practicing of the reputation of the name of God and that's how I the deeksha they go on repeating the name of God mine become whether you believe it or not whether you understand it or not repetition of the name of the God will purify your mind for sure it's not my words is that great Salameh krishna he is telling taking the name of God and worshiping God a same but if you can concentrate event on that name particular the name that is your guru is giving and can visualize that particular form then it becomes very easy or otherwise just mechanical repetition also will help mrs. barns Ramakrishna is telling that whether you are eating a candy and you're eating the candy in the straight way or maybe you are leaking or you're starting from the back side or from the top whatever way you eat candy sweet you will feel that the sweetness the Lord's name is also like that it's very powerful but only one thing is necessary what is that faith now the father world that knowledge but the one who wants to know the Vagabond now they are in three in one that's called three pootie vada I wanted to know whether anyone has given any oscar explanation and the three pootie in the Google the Google how either someone should write and then the Google picks it up and puts it over there and I found that that they have mentioned three pootie vada then they crossed it no entry that there is no my people have not discussed about this but three pootie vada the Veda Veda means piercing what the three what are the three bhagavad dr. Bhagwat and weand become Veda means of Veda when the bhagavad are acknowledged Bhavan the object of knowledge and the after the no are want to know become one that's called three booty beta 3 means 3 booty means the objects Veda it becomes United pit becomes 1 and 2 given X that those who are the followers of the Shiva immediately utilize this knowledge and say there were three demons and no one they were so terrible people could not control them ultimately all the gods going to the great god Shiva and Shiva came and with his Trident he pierced in such a way because those they were in such a way three brothers the demons and is to float all the time and changing their position it was so difficult to kill them his only Shiva could do and then he threw the Trident and exactly that very moment all the three brothers came in one line and they were all three were killed so three / re the name of the Shiva is dripper re after telling the three teamers now these type of stories we are so fond of and we know and who were that the books will be there and the movies will be there but what is the philosophy behind this this philosophy there is no demons and nothing like that he is only to create the interest for the ordinary people to know about that and that Shiva the yogi and he's trained this what a completely piercing this three bhava doctor and Bhagavad so these three they are becoming one and salam o krishna again explaining that the ship teal and the sheba are also worn and then he says go forward to the other other was a deputy can imagine at that time when the british errs we're ruling an Indian person has become a deputy magistrate who is controlling a whole district looking after the administration of the district a great position so other was very simple though he was in a having a big post usually them the moment the people they go into that post and they are surrounded by many other people they also start thinking we are somebody they cannot behave normally and others are not allowing him or also to behave normally other was at night not like that so other used to come to see Ramakrishna and he used to take to take up all his office twists and and the bear body he will lie down and sleep other devotees is to come and tell whispering what is this man he has come to a holy person and he should be alert to listen to the holy person instead is sleeping surround each to Susan no let him sleep he can't take rest so that is the reason working with the British were very difficult so obviously we we don't know what is days to how this land at the handle that other and how other had to adjust with them the bosses they were all British bosses are so difficult when the boss has given the kick you cannot say I am painting you have to ask the boss I think you are not hard right it's okay sir so that was it's not I don't know but they say in the stories like that it is terrible and when they is to come and used to get sleeve ceramic is needs to do come in just like a baby sleeping very peacefully that author was a great devotee of Rama Krishna and by just by devotion to see Ramakrishna I have come to God I did not to do anything I can sleep well just devotion that in much prayer is to come and sleep what Saddam Edition is telling he is addressing you are a scholar the other is telling the other you're the scholar and Interpol dementia stranger but with all that you are very devoted simple so that is why he is telling go forward you had come agreed traveling a long way here come over here move forward go forward beyond the forest of the sandalwood there are other genes the wood Carter was chopping the wood in the forest the Brahma cherry said to him go forward there's a story's a mister dole we just referred over here go forward Cheerilee be teacher a male teacher a building when we have started practicing the spirituality and we start getting so many things people start coming to you then many of the people they would not have looked at you or noticed about you the moment you have started coming to a holy place doing some voluntary job sitting for meditation taking the name of God reading books other people will come and talk to you they will exchange the telephone number they will also come and tell many things to you thinking that you are a holy man living in this temple and slowly slowly that person you start thinking I am the person over here so I should say these and that and that is the great difficulty in the beginning they attract people why they practice the name of and the what result bainham when they were churning the ocean the venom started coming what is that vena ego terrible ego and then you have to go away from God you got the opportunity but you missed it as they call in English missed the bus it was here but you were late to come so similarly Saddam Tichenor again and again in different places he is giving this assurance God can save you only thing you have to be a devotee what is the devotee loved and failed one who is having the complete faith in the God God is there I don't understand whatever may be but I love God and secondes love for God so faith love equal to devotee so here he says and we will conclude but one need not have to fear if one takes refuge in God God protects his devotees God protects his devotees so many times we get frustrated most of the time the people will ask question those who are good people they suffer those were bad people they are enjoying this life why we are taking the name of God and we are suffering and those who are not caring for God they are enjoying are they truly enjoying you do not know what is going to happen afterwards at this moment you see that they are doing this but what is waiting after that you do not know here's a group of ants they were climbing [Music] an elephant and one and was very smart it was constantly overtaking the others and going in the past and the top and others were thinking was so fast and so good and God is helping him etcetera etcetera then the other stole wait and see and very mature the ones and wait and see don't be so hurry he left the whole hard under that line of the hands and went on the top exactly that moment with the big trunk the elephant sucked that he was that time sucking and the poor hand when entered into and died so when you see that he's having the great fun in this life we do not know what is going to happen next so wait for God dependent God whatever happens I am at your feet I do not know anything so that is called the devotee tremendous faith in the existence of God and complete love then see dankest is giving the assurance but one need not have any fear if one takes refuge in God you have to take the refuge in God God protects his devotees then one gentleman hurry he is asking well why does it take many people such a long time to realize him but he is as if we should go and get that God immediately so he's asking why does it take so much time for one to realize him salam krishna's answer is truth is that a man doesn't feel restless for god the truth is that if man doesn't feel restless for god unless he is finished with his enjoyments and duties he cannot realize god the as long as we are feeling the duties we have to perform so what we should do completely dedicate ourselves at the feet of God and whatever the duties we are having responsibilities I do not know when I am going to complete all this if you want me to do I will do or otherwise I don't like to do what I am going to do completely giving my mind to God and taking his name meditating it may take some time but the revelation of the wonderful the light of God within the heart Dean you will feel one of the things are useless some people are criticizing some people are appreciating sometimes you were successful sometimes you are not successful you don't bother at all that tranquility will come you know who are you so that is the one different way so let us join this name the God who is not having anything any connection but still he comes he takes the human form and he is before us and that's where the Jesus says I am the path and the way why without the Incarnation we cannot proceed towards God if we translate that and mean that Jesus is the only way that is the wrong the Krishna is also telling come to me I will take care of you serve the Dharma on the texture and ceramic history is also telling you need not to do much only remember me that will do who is this me Jesus Ramakrishna Krishna this me the truth the card which nothing but love and unselfishness so that near Anjana who is not having any onion any defect in it perfect Anand aruba in different forms he is taking the human form for us but a number then that is sure that great Lord who has taken the form of ceramic dish now this time I take refuge in him need Anjaneya onon the loop have done gumbo it'll be gone by each of autonomy but Amisha media Tom Ramakrishna sheet asana mama Oh Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry you that said sri ramakrishna our eponymous too
