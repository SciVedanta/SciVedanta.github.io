[204. Panchama Veda 204: The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-XCgW1qfrAc)

this begin with this Tata Java cotton written dr. jeevan KO be rewritten Calma shavon shavon among golem 3 madam go vegan on da hua dodging ama lak drink we were reading and discussing about other wonderful experiences about one sri ramakrishna he practiced different baths and through his absolutely pure and concentrated mind realized the truth of those paths within very short time sometimes some people deceive how it is possible we are practicing all through our lives but still we are not getting the realization how can a person he is practicing different paths different religious paths and realizing with a very short period of time what actually we are going to realize the truth how it is possible to realize by controlling the mind absolutely controlling the mind and what is the mind mind is nothing but the flow of different thoughts and when we can control those different powers is it impossible for anyone to understand the truth which to the truth obviously when the religious truth we are discussing here not discussing about the external thing there is totally different those who have concentrated their mind there is not very difficult for them to understand the truth of one path if you go through the book that we have published many ways to God at the back of it we have given a a one in one page a table where all the religious paths and their practices have been discussed only those practices if you go through you will wonder the Muslim the bootys the Hindus the Christians and juvies all their practices are all the same all of them they are fasting all of them they are visiting the holy places and all of them they are practicing almost all common things the if all those practices are saying the result is supposed to be the same if I am doing the same type of work same type of practice result is supposed to be the same in different places in different time in different situation by different people it doesn't matter if I practice the same thing same result will come there is very easy and similarly Raghavan C Ramakrishna and here we are speaking about the spiritual truth and the spiritual truth is not external it is internal is to the mind and the mind is completely and control of a person he can understand that truth in any way so this is Amish nerdy no doubt about it some people there is in question not understanding how the spiritual practices go what is the main thing in the spiritual practice it is not the the temple of the mosque and the church it is another is the human mind and human mind is nothing but the thoughts and thoughts generates from the external things if I can control that why not so good to see if a person can conquer the whole world but cannot conquer his mind and say no it is not hero he no is he who can control his own mind it's very difficult and that is why the Sri Ramakrishna is really really perilous he is not having any that competitor in this line he was really excellent he practiced and then he saved after experiencing the different metals we declared why should I be one-sided this is a very wonderful statement why should I be one-sided the most of the people even the teachers spiritual teachers they always teach one meter and this is the only thing and you should not learn anything and some of the teachers they go so far to tell go to any other place don't mix with any other don't listen to anything only this much you should know and you should proceed why this is the question as because we are afraid we are afraid that son if I allow my followers to go to other places mixed with others then I may lose them that is the fear but in Hinduism in the true Hinduism the thing is like that you can go to any path you can follow any path you are going to reach to the same call same result but the name of the results are totally different some will be Satan is a Buddha a Jehovah God Allah Ishwara different so Sudama fishness it like that and in increase them you know how always we discuss about two very important words for the development of the spiritual knowledge two things we must try to understand one is Maya Maya is an illusive power of God another is a housing car a Hanukkah is the delusive power of the individual self tezcan ego so because of this too ego is nothing but the Maya is short for an individual form and Maya is big the Hinduism teaches this whole world is nothing but deceptive images of that Maya now itself controlled person can only understand and can become free from the bondage of permanent and temporary good and bad what is good and what is bad are temporary the moment you say one the conception of two comes so how to deny that is a excellent conception in the Hinduism they will never say one even they'll slip up Twitter absence of - absence of - means that the moment you say one conception up - comes so this taper very certain and the questions become and then Raghavan see Ramakrishna he says it is very difficult to break the you see bondage of Miami in different places instead II which act as an individual in the ego as a home Karl hymns we hear the Vagabond see Ramakrishna say and this is very very important for those who are sincere seeker of spirituality you know some of the people there's a ego always within our mind and we satisfy that ego in different ways even sometimes we will find a person who is telling the two teams are playing and someone will say Oh team a is going to win and perchance by chance team a we there is a right the team a will win according to the situation according to the the play that the players could perform they have won that game but this man will take the credit I told as he because of his stealing they were having the success not like that but still the ego is so in every respect he will find there's this ego to come out of the ego is very very difficult and to go to the spiritual path much more difficult a person who is not having any connection in the religion suddenly they will listen to some of the lectures and they will go and both among the frames win they are discussing oh I heard that lecture have you heard that well I will forward that lecture I understood him yeah this is very good I am intelligent person and I am understanding him so that much is the religion for that person this very certain frames is truly truly very subtly that our ego that acts so we have to be very careful now here Raghavan see Ramakrishna is telling one must inherit good tendencies to realize God I must repeat this is so important statement one must inherit good tendencies to realize God those who are not caring about realizing God only for the intellectual the the game this for them is okay but those who are truly interested to realize God must be very very careful why in editing the good qualities one must have done something some form of tapasya or austerity either in this life or in another those who have truly tried to achieve those they will only inherit those good qualities and then only it is possible for them to realize God understand God understand the truth and to go beyond the bondage of Maya I must remind you the Maya is very very strong why it is the power of God the God's power he is deluding us now we have to fight against that how it is possible so that God himself has come forward to help us and in the sixteenth chapter of the bhagavad-gita in three verses he has enlisted all the good qualities in one place so that the people should try to follow those achieve those cultivate those good qualities just good qualities and the beginning he sealed the sixteen chapter first to third verses first verse he says begin with the world of I am endlessness how the boy of the fear has come and the faith in the words of the scripture and guru otherwise feel that fearlessness all come the people with doubt in mind do you think it is alright do you think it is possible they will never be able to achieve anything undoubted faith should be there in the words of the scripture and the good now what is what is the scripture that in the paga bottom we find by a factor of immersion and I am taught were above arsenal you have to uproot the cause of fear how thought on the truth is there what is the truth God alone exists and nothing else that is the truth instead of telling the Grubman the Artman the all-pervading consciousness if we say God it is very easy for us to understand we can conceive that idea God okay the God alone exists and nothing else so in that case if the God alone is existing why should I be afraid of whom I am going to be afraid of what I am going to lose what I am going to gain nothing so the scripture says stuck to a machine in the bird antics picture they will say you are that you are the god now if I am alone existing then Who am I so they will go again shut up the sounds of the pure heart this purity of heart means we are hiding something within in our thought expressing something doing something else and we are thinking that we are going to realize God observed it's very clear now question is am i interested in this God or as the Bhagwan Krishna said I am loving God or worshipping God or going to the temple just to satisfy some of my desires then the question is ability now I am not so much interested to get realization and get Mukti from the bondage of button day but I am interested to get some relief from some of the problems that I am having okay that is a different path that's a different way you can of course you can go to God you can pray you have every right but those who are thinking that they should realize God for them and this is so important maturity of us millions and millions of human being different forms of religion we are practicing and practicing with so much of vitality with so much of force and we are so engrossed in it that if someone says in the name of religion you have to go and kill we are ready to do that thinking God will be happy not utilized in our brain who has created this universe God now what I am going to destroy the creation of God and God will be happy how it is possible absurd God has created this universe he has created bad people good people animals birds reptiles human different problems of languages different forms of worship Who am I to vote criticize if I try to follow one path that is sufficient on me I will do that why should a criticize others and forget about destroying our causing difficulties for them now it is not possible if I do that God will be angry so this is the thing we have to understand so here he sees over young such the sums of the mind should be an heart should be pure but one serum Kareem is Bengali language he said more Mook akhada whatever you were telling and whatever you were thinking should be one today morning we were discussing that at the lunch time we were discussing that if you look at the Asian countries almost all of them they're having some hypocrisy why they will see something they will think something they will do something why about the very deep religious minded people and still then they are doing it why you not because of the historical and social background particularly I can speak about India India was ruled for seven hundred years long years by the Islamic rulers and two hundred years by the Britishers you can imagine its attitude people and when they are going and standing before some other type of people who are the rulers we cannot express the truth before them can he go and stand before Hitler and say hey making the wrong thing that will be the last word and speak because immediately killed who will who will do that Europe has tested this and India has tested for nine and long hundred years so obviously it has become automatic it in our system so hypocrisy almost in the blood they say but it is not the Ford because of the situation slowly it is taking turn after the independence the new children they are coming those who were born in the open independent India they are becoming free they cannot think of hiding something and tell him something as we find in America they don't hide it and it don't say something like that majority of them in this way so this is sucked assumption in the spiritual and you should not say something just to pacify some of the devotees some rich people are coming to satisfy them sometimes we go and say something just false just to satisfy them to get some good donation from them and spiritual life no that cannot be so see Ramakrishna only one sentence he say one must inherit good tendencies to realize God and how the condenses will come this first three words of all the 26 qualities the first three words are day the sample and some of the explanation that we find they say that this first rework was that ohayo then second circuit essence of the purification of the thirties Gyana yoga diversity ghana steady in knowledge and yoga very steady what is the knowledge knowledge is I am NOT this body and mind I am something else what is this something that is the self there's the Hartman and that is nothing but the part of the / Hartman the consciousness now this very moment I cannot think of beyond this body and mind and as because my mind is associated with this body and mind the obviously in the environment in the system I am leaving and connected with death and the family that I say oh they are my families and these and they're all connected with this body and mine but it is not true the truth is something else because I am that consciousness and that consciousness has created a sense within my mind I and when I understand that after reading the holy books particularly the granting books then I must stick to that so Keanu then yoga what is the yoga practice I really understood and then I have to practice otherwise I won't be able to and what is the how it is possible to practice in every day to day life I must practice so this avoid fearlessness Shafter some suti the truthfulness and the heart in heart and also in the speech is an action saying it should be and then Jana you a velocity I heard some people there telling I was animala for 12 years then I saw my past bird it is not necessary to impress some of the devotees it was going on to me why should I unnecessarily it is not true if you had already understood that you would not have come over here and the gentleman came Asami oh I leave very humble way you know my heart is so small when I leave inside the room my legs are outside my room it is so small room but who is it then why you are here in America touring all parts of America how could you come only coming over here means you have to spend nearly 75 or 80 thousand rupees in India with that you could make a big room at least for you unnecessarily so theses sucked the some something only to be exam and an impression among the devotees and so humble and so these am so that while you are not that so this is unnecessarily weird dream for such the sums of the whole life he has spent for religion unfortunate whole life this person has spent for religion but not practicing what one should practice then it comes from the air very easy a person can do Dhanam charity so this is really really very important majority of the people though they are having the money but still they are so closed fist they don't like they can give and when they pass away that money left over here most of the time there is no want so the bank wherever they have kept it they get that old money but still they cannot give it for the good cause so in every religion jihad in Islam they say and donation that say a the Christianity Donham in our Hinduism see the same practice why I have are now I am giving it that means my hunk of my ego which is making me attached to all this a breaking so this Donna this is very very important and they were simple charity donnager cha is an control of the senses the control of the senses we practice we practice austerity how not eating food or drinking water paroled a majority of the people in almost in all religious sects and fails they practice this not today my my first I am doing it all other people are eating and the lady has cooked ladies serving at a same time she won't take a morsel of food tremendous control of the senses by this way come up with your control of the senses young-ji natural performing good work without expecting any result that Scully until the young can you know that there is a beautiful story in Mahabharata when the Yudhisthira he was performing a grade Yong Yong after vanquishing his opponents and conquering the hole he made a good billion to show me that you're guilty and after everything was over suddenly the one first called Windows or is that mangu Jie the Mongoose came and briefly clearly the Mongoose was having half part of the mongooses golden another half no no it came and rolled over there where they have given a lot of things in charity and one person noticed it and for the story's sake we can take it for granted the Mongoose could speak in the the language of the human being so the gentleman lapsed hey what you were doing the Mongoose a I wanted to see which sacrifice is better good look at me the hot part of my body is golden and because I rolled over there where there was a youngin he sacrificed and here also I rolled but look at it he does not transform the hot part again is normal so I cannot say that this is the best damned act and what was that from where he got the golden half golden body a poor Brahmin after fasting for seven days not getting a morsel of food when the Brahmin and his wife and his two children they got a little portion of food and after offering to God when they sad to eat a one a TT one gifts came and told I am hungry then the father the ground he gave his part and say well I know that without this food I will die but I must give it because this is my religion to help the hungry people so he gave the white door that is not sufficient as a wife this is my duty to support your cause - she also gave her food children also join in that so all the fault they gave their portion the whole food - they came to that particular guest and the four of them they passed away they're tired and that @et was none other than the karma himself the god of the righteousness himself so over there this Mongoose it weighed enrolled and got this a portion Gordon and it's say from then onwards I am going to every place wherever they are performing the yuckiest the sacrifices and try to understand are they truly doing it for the good of others but they're doing it for the good of others that is Kali Archaea this eunhye is performing good world but the good of others of course and without expecting any reserve and that is called yoga then it comes what the higher swadhyaya is reading of the holy book with an attentive mind sometimes we read the book casually now some people they say I am reading Gita and he is reading only the english rendering try to understand that this to some extent is of course good but if he wants to understand the bhagavad-gita you have to understand every water field then only you will understand the true meaning of it so this from the ether that we are quoting avoid on the fearlessness the fearlessness where from it comes there are so many people they are fearless they go and face in the war the didi they were performing that the day I was seeing those the returned elderly people after so many years they went over there to see the police of their glory and they came down over there on the sea beach without caring for the bullet that was springing from by the Germans so didi there are so courageous hundreds were laying down their lives and another hundreds begin to cross the active bodies to face these very courageous but here it is not that courage here this courage means a fire fearlessness I am NOT going to die but not in that table war but in understanding as because I'm not the body and mind so I am eternal and from that the fearlessness come so this is the Hawaii and then comes Swat tire and where from me I will learn I will learn from the scripture and women reading the scripture one must be very very attentive the one day I had to read some ocean of the Quran in our balloon not in one function so as because Raghavan C Ramakrishna practice all paths so we also respect all the religious paths and in the birthday of bhagavata-dharma Christian that we celebrate all the religious scriptures are great with great honor right from the Bible and the three Peter and the Quran etc so I got the opportunity to read a few pages from the Quran are you going to purchase the Quran and so that I can read it and when I entered into the shop and asked of the Quran then the some people who are sitting over there today you are a Hindu why you were asking for the Quran you know how to read the Quran there are so many system you have to sit like these you have to be and after that before that you should wash your hand and these do so many systems are there you don't know that how can you purchase the coronal gradient but the shopkeeper and elderly person he told see they are very genuine type of people when they will read they will read truly with great again love and respect and you people are only going over a neighbor opening the pages reading and understanding the import of the spiritual so he sold the book to me I could read a could perform acceptor now dears you have to be very very attentive when you are reading a scripture the Upanishad at the this weekend we are going to have a very good spiritual class with Sammy Sabbath even under and you'd be describing from the hope initial suppose Rico we listen we adjust because in the company and the need for game that is one time but if you go with the book with a pain in your hand and then noting down what is telling asking the question to clarify your doubts that will go within your mind and that is called swap tie and very attentively you are understanding and then this is called scepter and next comes top of the austerity what is this austerity marks are EE baby in a very simple sentence she said austerity means keeping the mind in the presence of God somehow you have to keep the mind in the presence of God - sometimes people are taking the name of God sometime they are sinking some devotional modules sometimes they are sometimes they're reading the scripture somehow they are keeping their mind and then we are working if we can remember that we are actually serving the divine personality in this form the God has come to me in this form I am a teacher I am teaching in the classroom but the children that sitting before me that nothing but the goddamn giving them this education God has come to me in this form and that is called austerity tapa this suffer doesn't mean only physical in the bhagavad-gita again the topper has controlling the tongue one should not speak harsh words even on the temptation some people are going on telling bad words and then I feel like also retaliating now I must control myself that is the question some people are insulting me did something wrong to me I can take revenge but I won't do that so that is called tapasya so physical mental and your thoughts speeches so many capricious and hearsay austerity then come Archbold uprightness the very upright very straight I am doing going to do this and I am NOT going to mix it up with anything nobody straight forward so this is our jabong and we have accepted an ideology of a garage krishna marshal at the hasami Vivekananda now shall we be vehicle on the sate that you should not mix with the politics because being a mom I cannot favor I cannot do any favors and even the good people even then I cannot do that some others did to us that we have to make but in the politics means either you are supporting a and denouncing B so you cannot do that you should not do that once we have accepted this ideology of Vivekananda we are living in his organization and suddenly out of emotionally should not go and cast both know that itís called uprightness so many of the people they cannot control that the sometimes the emotion things comes up and then they go out and do it not knowing actually what they are doing being having the girl of the mom and accepting the both of same sightedness if you are going and casting vote in favor of some group actually you were breaking the vow of sannyasa so this is called uprightness one must be very alert and decisive know once I have taken the oath I am NOT going to break it so this color brightness and ahimsa and injury certain the truth this truth means we have to continue with the thing that has happened ultimately the truth is nothing burnt God but in the practical life also there's some truth and we know the great stories of this truth the father of the van stomm dish now just because he didn't tell one lie he had to give up all his property in overnight and go out of his family without knowing where he is going that challenged it too not only he is wife also supported even if he died on the street it's ok but we are not going to take the support of the falsehood so this is called ahimsa and September this circum we find the truthfulness who can practice it very upright who can practice it who is decisive now I'm not going to say anything because that will be false wrong but again sometimes in our scripture also it says for the safety of others for the sake of others sometime if you tell the lies that is truth but that's in a special cases as we find that say Krishna he is asking Yudhisthira to tell the lie that he has killed the son of an arch area Drona too bad that was a pure lie but still the God was asking to tell that to see the life of the thousands of people so that is the different special cases with in regular practice we must try to tell the truth but when we are telling the truth we should keep in mind harsh truth we should not say the truth that may have heard that person we should not say that and we should put that in such a way that will be beneficial for a mehar not hurting so that is the way certain then up to the absence of anger when the anger comes angle is actually a reaction action is the desire when the desired is not fulfilled then only their anger comes angle is not the action it is only the result of it is a reaction the action is or desire when the desire is not will really become very angry so we have to understand these the moment I am angry there's a many question we see the devotees will be asking people their asking I am ready even the children class eighth ninth grade students they're coming I am very angry how to control the anger I always say can you write down why you are angry if you can write down point by point but this is the reason I am angry I am angry we find most of them and almost all of the points will be I didn't get that so he was angry he didn't listen to me so I was angry so anger is only a reaction of unsatisfied desire then the dagger renunciation what is the actual renunciation Ungaro the ego when I give it to God that is the best way I am the son of God and the daughter of God whatever I am doing because my father my mother wants it and that way only we can do the best renunciation otherwise present confusion is there some people they give up their heart and home and they become the monastics there is a different type of mental condition and because of the Hindus the belief of the past karma they developed that and they feel a strong urge to leave their heart and home that is one thing but majority of us we can do in this way those who are in the household we can all receive government long distance teaching I am the son of God I am the daughter of God we are the children of God so whatever we are doing I do it at the feast of the God that is also great renunciation I do it as best as possible but at the same time I don't hanker for the credit of that work I just do it that is the perfect renunciation if one can do that he would also get the same result as one is leaving the heart and all the same way the moment we can do that what will be the result if you give up the ego if you can leave the ego at the feet of your God tranquility Shanti so that after that he becomes Shanti and then comes operational we feel so much to criticize others almost in every step in everything we have so many things to tell about others or you know that he can't speak in this way you know that he can to stand in this way you can do this way that way almost for everyone we have some water other to criticize and that is very very good that's why mother's stressed on this quality if you want want Shanti the peace don't criticize others if you want to this also orders we say if we don't want bees of course we have the right to criticize others and fight with others to this equation um they are Pradesh you compassion to the pings the compassion is a love and when I feel oneness then only the compassion comes otherwise not sometimes when we read the story that how the people the beating others giving others cheating others the tears comes in the eyes compassion and what we can do we cannot go what their physically to stop it we cannot go and stop all these atrocities as a happening over the whole of the whole world what we can do we can come and pray to God God I saw that I noticed that I heard and learned their suffering please bless them so they let them be happy that is also compassion just I am feeling and doing nothing it's not compassion the compassion means you have the feeling you have your heart you can understand the someone you know there's some emotional things that we do that is not compassion compassion is a true love for that being who is suffering and if I can somehow go out and help is okay all I should pray you sometimes some people to say another I received later email data someone on lady is writing my father took some loan for our education and he kept his a thing his soul his property or the land or keep the whole land in mortgage now he is not any money to get it back is a very typical situation and he's known is going on increasing he took only 15 lakhs and now it has gone to 16 6-0 labs so it is so difficult can you please help us and she's writing if you keep $2,000 that will be sufficiently I felt like singing but then the problem is I do not know whether it is genuine or not I do not know I had to st. and all day so this is the then I prayed to God I don't know whether she is telling the truth or not sometimes all this happened so this compassion means always it have to when you feel for others either you should go forward to support them help them or at least pray for them as the mothers the owners do for their children alone tongue and courageousness and unaffected by the senses a Lulu then martabak gentleness the one of our Swami he was the general secretary Madeleine and the G afterwards he became the president of our Sangha he used to say first become a gentle man then become a monk is to tell the monks who is a gentle man who can control his senses in different situations the temptation comes then sometimes some people will shout out and he used abusive words and this body language will be totally different why if you don't have the control over your senses how you think that you would be able to realize God but that is called that one in the twenty six the good qualities the one is the Marthaville gentleness his form his decisive but at the same time he is very gentle the way of gentleness because of these real real is the modesty we'll never take any credit modesty doesn't mean oh I don't know I cannot not like that we are expecting that it should be given to me the responsibility should be given to me but at the same time oh I do not know can I do it I look like that for confident he would say well I could do it if you give me I try my best to do it but at the same time not eager to get the credit of from this so that is called the the modesty and this watch hopalong and constantly changing the mind flickering mind how do they I am here next year and there are let me go and stay with them for some time how they're that way you won't be able to develop the spiritual life so this our chocolate chocolate ah all the time flickering mine now again I once I have taken the decision I have taken the decision I am going to go through these before accepting the ideology I must try to understand try to realize whether this is good for me or not but once I take the decision I continue with that and then it comes DJ the poorness Raghavan said Rama Krishna say if anyone comes on your path you news and become the hindrance for your spiritual growth just push him aside and go forward that is that only should be there otherwise or some people are coming and crying this and then I cannot become a month he won't be able to become involved that polish and forgiveness this is the Shama who can forgive who has the power to forgive I myself who is in the in the receiving name how can I forgive others no only the powerful who could take the revenge but don't do that even at the complete understanding that is called the Shama the one Swami Vivekanand with the European ladies and the other gentleman he was going to the great pilgrimage in the cache me you know the when reaching over this is on the high hilltop and it takes long day's walk so they'd be camping in different places the weekend also Camden saw the the shuang's not understanding the what is Shama Vivekananda they were putting jokes and abusive languages they were using as because he was travelling with the European ladies the ladies were all great but these people they don't understand so they were Vivekananda became angry he was about to come out of his taint then the elderly mom came stood before him and say they do not know who you are but you know who you are we become these the Shiva himself they were going to have the darshan of the Shiva in that game and they were insulting the Shiva himself in the human form show me the villain and so this is the Shama forgiveness immediately he forgave them drinking fortitude and showed him the purity of true absence of hatred now what Ahmadi the absence of dry we start the self-confidence is the pride absence of pride friends today we only read one line from the Quran serum Krishna and that is one must inherit good tendencies to realize God these are the good tendencies and they are divine tendencies and if we realize we want to realize God we must try to acquire develop these good qualities the first three qualities of I am that fearlessness after some suit the purity of heart and Gyana yoga velocity these are the three sum of the exponents they are telling this is actually these three are the debut son but the divine qualities Salameh business telling either in the past birth on in this birth you must develop these if you are really sincere serious to realize God and that we should try thank you very much let us complete this with this chanting offering the pranaam our respect at the feet of organ saddam krishna ninja are none [Music] ha dong come pretty big drop on by Aisha authorities para mission medium-term Ramakrishna she does indeed shanthi shanthi early you that served three Krishna
