[150: Panchama Veda 150- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vr3eKPZYA4A)

let us begin with this sloka double cut ham written dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten Calma sharp 'him servin among golem three madatha tongue moving green ENT a gory dodging AHA the slow curve that always says that if you were hearing reading whatever way you were getting the information of these words is beneficial why because it has been said by God how it is beneficial because this will give you a complete idea about the spirituality and constantly inspire you to become a spiritual person so that is the way it always stays and is Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna one should not harbour malice towards any person or any opinion so how long back which was told by the Veda that in the present time alabanza Ramakrishna he is manifesting that's why again and again we find that is a server thermos Amman nya the all combination of religion religions of the paths the processes that leads to the goal and goal is purity goal is love which we call as God so if that is so any paths that is leading to God is welcome and that should be the bath should be followed by love purity unselfishness service it cannot be through a great never be that's very Ramakrishna categorically he is mentioning one should not harbor malice toward any person or any opinion so that is the reason you can see how we have mentioned over all the symbols of different religions mentioned over here and also on our altar the Jesus Christ and all the Buddha they are also present and getting our respect because of this world because of this vision because of this instruction we cannot become narrow sometimes some of our own people also ask question this is the teaching of a given C Ramakrishna and why he is sitting like this after realization of God after travelling through different paths after experiencing that every paths are leading to the same goal he is declaring in this way this is the bigger if all religious people can understand only this much at least there won't be any hatred in the name of religion a man can reach God if he follows one path rightly the last time also we were studying and discussing about this any part can lead us to the same goal god if the follows one path rightly that is the main thing we have to understand that rightly properly otherwise not sometimes some people they are confused and always the thing that we are on the right track sometimes I received the letters from different people I have realised God I realized the supreme and now I am searching for a job after the realisation of God at least no one in such fun job after searching the job and satisfied with all the work then people go for God but you have started from below that is now anyway this is the total confusion and most of the time we will love to hypnotize ourselves we think something has happened and nowadays particularly in this country and also in India and other places the people they know that religion is something which people will accept and without any judgment they will accept it and if you can present it in a proper way as they call nowadays marketing is not like that religion is very very personal religion is not for that marketing and they are doing it by giving some a certain thing like within seven days your Kundalini will be arise and now these are the words people they all know Kundalini Yoga these their Kundalini will arise and you will find the light is coming from outside entering into you something is happening and slowly slowly the beautiful way they say and most of the minds and they are busy with so many other things so obviously they love to accept that the if within seven days 15 days try if I can get it and why not and the result is the mental degeneration they lose the self-confidence so this is what religion and that is why one should again and again study that cause Philips Ramakrishna it is not the book of any Hindu sector anything is the guide book of spirituality so here see Ramakrishna is telling that one should now today we will discuss one person that is his name is joy go while he's asking a question how does one receive the grace of God he is asking this question again and again see Rama Krishna a devotee can know everything when God's grace descends on him stamina told everything one devotee can understand if the God's grace descend on him and when it is coming down it is not ascending it is descending that means the higher sphere that grace would the yogam the Dharma hum as Gita Robert Gita Turkish name is telling I will give him the booty the right conception this right conception is called grace immediately one can understand what is this and why this and immediately you can understand that suppose there is a situation if you understand rightly handle that properly there is no problem there is no problem at all if you can handle a situation that a different type of situation coming before us every life and if you can handle it properly how it is possible understanding thing and then dealing properly that is called and you can solve all type of so-called problems and in the spiritual life also only thing that we have to understand that am I having any desire for this worldly life if I am having the desire for this worldly life then supreme spiritual realization is not possible but I can have many other things I can have many other things like the name fame success money health all other things I can get accept the supreme please that is not possible why because the two things are completely to different spare if you go to spirituality but the worldly things won't come with you if you are going for this worldly thing spirituality will not come to you juh haram doneghy come they say in Hindi when there is God Rama means the God there is no desire and when there is desire there is no Rama this is very clear so that is why now one person is asking this question when see ramakrishna told a devotee can know everything when God's grace descends on him he is asking this question how does one receive the grace of God if the grace is necessary how one can get it Sri Ramakrishna's reply is this constantly you have to chant the name and glory of God those who are following the pages of gospel of ceramic isne you must have noticed that again and again ceramic is distilling not only the name glory also you must chant the name of God he is not mentioning that he is telling name and glory of God this is important name and glory of God why the glory of God when you are talking about the glory of God being also you are remembering the qualities that the God is having that grace is will come if you invite those qualities what is God love what is God compassion forgiveness all these qualities when it is there if I also go on getting those qualities then the grace will come so that is he constantly is telling that you have to chant the name and glories of God and give up worldly thoughts as much as you can in our life we need something to support our living the livelihood when everything is near like the monastic life we are here we are missionaries that's why we are not going to be here and there or wondering but we are stationed in one place and devotees are coming we are trying to give them the spiritual knowledge and in our life also we are trying to practice this way it is going and devotees are coming giving donation all these things are maintained such a big house over here and so many other things expenditure all depends on the donation and these things are going on why because the people who are coming over here they are supporting us by giving us some different material donation or or cash donations this way they are helping us but constantly you have to chant the name and glory of God and that's why mantra diksha was introduced in the Hindu the in the beginning it was all be daunting way knowledge then they understood for the ordinary people the constant bechara discrimination this world is illusionary is not possible so what is the simplest way then they say if we introduce the name of God and the glories of God then they give the name of God at the same time for the glories of God Puranas came different stories and when you hear those are read the stories get the inspiration that if we are also going on taking like this everything is possible there's a story they say that one king he was a great devotee of sri krishna and when he used to sit for the puja the meditation whatever happens we'll never get him and that was known to other kings also so one enemy King decided after getting the perfect information when he sits for meditation puja and how long he continues etc and he prepared in such a way exactly within that time we should go attack and capture the king like that they plan and when the King sat for meditation one particular day they attacked when they attacked naturally and it was that information was not there they were surprised now their own people they met King should give the order what to do what not to do then they were thinking in this way the why not we do go and ask the king you must get up because this is a special thing that you today is a special thing that you must have to get up and give us the leadership we have to go and fight we have to stop the enemies they win but King never listened the wind and knock the door and prayed to him nothing happened but today surprise this our enemies are mostly dead a time came when King got up and said what happened this up let us go when they came out they reached to the place they found the enemies could not come inside the city rather on the outside obscured the field most of them they are deal and the enemy King only surviving the dis King went and told what happened then the enemy King told we never knew except you you are the best warrior of your whole kingdom that we knew and we knew that you will never leave the seat before completing the pooja completion of the pooja that's why we plan who is this man all alone he fought with us and killed almost all of our soldiers who is this man this man no one came out then they were thinking can you give us the description of the person who came on our behalf and fought oh here the special thing was this he was this type of complexion this type of dress special is that one Maire butcher that our my peacocks one feather was stuck oh my god that is my god the Krishna because feather that is the special symbol of Krishna he ran back and he saw that his own horse is perspiring as if it has fought a Great War and now it has come back and taking rest first he went to the shrine and he served inside the temple now he's God all over the stream of blood dust he has come out these are the stories naturally that gives their the confidence in the mind of the devotees the if you are getting the protection of God you are protected so see Ramakrishna is telling constantly you have to chant the name and glory of God and give up worldly thoughts as much as you can you will feel restless for God when your heart becomes pure and your mind free from attachment to the things of the world then alone will your prayer reach God this is very difficult completely free from all the last is name and fame for the great spiritual personalities the last barrier is the name majority they cannot cross that and that's why were once Ramakrishna been hundreds of people who are coming trying to touch his feet one day he was complaining to the divine mother why you were playing all this thing to me I never said like this I never wanted and he was spitting on the floor itself oh this is like this I don't want mother I don't want name fame popularity I don't want so this is the last bad year he himself was showing like this and his great disciple Vivekananda only young man of 29 he came he delivered the lecture he mesmerised at 7,000 people and this 11 September that is approaching 1880 93 that day when he completed his only small lecture five to seven minutes 7,000 people they became man they wanted to go and touch him and to shake hands with him to greet him and even even the ladies they were scaling the dis benches over here in the Chicago the Heart Institute still that all is there another lady a little elderly she stood in a corner looking at this madness of the people she was looking at this young man instilling my son he was telling to him ourself and my son now if you can control yourself and I will accept you as God why the emotion of people the appreciation of people is very difficult to overcome so that is the last barrier so patrician arbitration our location our location lokah means the popularity so this when you have to how it is possible if you have complete love for God when Vivekanand after completing all these things went back to India you can imagine and those who have read the biography they know how much he had to do after all that he gave up everything and just like a child of God he was leaving is it really a small thing the great personalities like the Gandhiji Dilek Neelu all they are trying to come and visit him he never care so this is what they call you will feel restless for God when your heart becomes pure and your mind free from attachment to the things of the world no attachment should be there for the things of the world then alone will your prayer reach God so sometimes we say we pray to God we need to reach God when your mind is pure how you can say that your mind has become pure when it is not attracted or bound by anything of this world afterwards Easterling I used to cry for God then he's giving his own example all alone I used to cry for God are all adorned with a longing heart I used to weep Oh God are you weeping does I would lose all consciousness of the world my mind would march in the Mahabharata he's telling muhabba in the muhabba we find in the yoga sutra by you muhabba you they say that there is a divine energy by you means the air that clearly is the divine energy here that we find is the most gross thing the circle thing is energy and the divine energy in the beginning unfolded the becoming the physical object and the first it was arkasha space and then the Bayou and they say step by step acha shot by you by ol Agni Agni Appa advocate Eevee pratip bein OSHA d'ya our system busted the whole creation first is the space and all-pervading space arkasha Akasha then come the bio this by you is the second Yogi's concentrate on maja kasha the old space big space those who are not the devotee not having a personal god or goddess how they concentrate Akasha is all-pervading slowly he forgives that he is a human body human mind he merges with the huge huge thing and in that is unspeakable way is merging and slowly then come back again to the mind concentrate on harsha infinite tranquil all-pervading space that is called mana Akasha then from Akasha come by you the motion the motion evolved a car shot by you by you is the force that manifested it is started changing Akasha no changes then comes the bio bio is the force slowly the changes coming and it manifested the force bio movement are the expressions of the muhabba you the movement at the expressions muhabba you is the source of all forces of nature vital forces operating within our own physical body at the expression of the Mohave what are the vital forces they are punch of prana those who have studied that we have already studied that yoga Sutra we know pancha prana prana apana vyana udana and Samana these are the punch of prana these are the bio is the life power energies of all elements anything that is surviving because of this bio from muhabba you then comes Maha the agent so this is called muhabba when all this flying muhabba you that forces are combined together this calls in Samadhi all the point by a bunch of are you when becomes one that becomes the Samadhi so he is telling I still pray see Ramakrishna giving the hint that only through prayer and prayer and prayer forgetting the whole universe the world then becoming one pointed and all the pancha bio is going and mixing with the maha-baho and his two margin that the mind must be pure and without blemish this is how ceramic isne is teaching one must not cherish any desire whatsoever so that is the difficult most difficult thing you should not cherish any desire anything a little desire after the device of the Bhagwan see Ramakrishna then Mara the money Devi was thinking why I am leaving so she was ready to give up her body but see Rama Krishna told no you have to stay so whatever the mission that I have started you have to support that you have to - as what with that when Sri Ramakrishna is telling but the mother's mind was not ready the she was withdrawing the mind then what happened suddenly one day she was sitting and thinking shall I give up my body and go every what I am going to do in this world I don't have any desire in this world suddenly she saw that one mother her own related she was lost her mind because she lost her husband in the same family giving birth of a child and the mother was walking and the child was somehow crawling behind this mad mother mother never cared for the baby and people was about to die without food who will take care a create compassion came in the mind of Marshall of the money Devi so naturally she went and picked up the baby from that the morning she picked it up that baby immediately see lamentation appeared and told she is Maha Maya and you must keep your mind on that and that is Raju Raju TV so that is a great name in the Ramakrishna family and because of the wrath of the dear she had so many difficulties in her life and mother was always engaged with all that and why because her mind came with a compassion and love for that baby it got stuck and she was keeping her mind down to this world is blame and were surviving living for the betterment of the devotees only through the rato otherwise she was not having any any desire if you don't have any desire then immediate Mukti the body goes away and that is why in the ancient time they said the four stages first is Dharma you all know about this you learn about this then Arthur gamma and along with that for the survival you also know many other things that goes on and on Dharma artha kama and the moksha moksha is the goal how to get the moksha then brahmacarya goddess vanaprastha the in sannyasa in the retired life most of the time one should study Scripture and nice books inspiring lives of the great souls and then sannyasa giving up all that judgment all the desire slowly slowly slowly slowly all this is going and then he becomes completely free so that is what one must not change any desire whatsoever the devotion of a man who has innate desire is selfish unselfishness is God Shami become the same what is this unselfishness without desire no desire and that is the source of karma yoga the work that we do work without any result how it is possible with only one desire the best things of God I must do that this job this work perfectly so that God will bless me I want to attract the attention of God that's why I am doing this work not for anything else that somebody will appreciate me or I will get some benefit nothing like that so that is dust and desireless devotion is love for its own sake desireless devotion is love yesterday only one boy he has written to me what is pure love see today Ramakrishna is giving the the definition desireless love do not know whether he is listening this livestream or not he will get this answer the here is the desireless devotion is love for his own sake and that is called pure love you may love me or not but I love you the God may love me or not that does not matter I love God that is the reason the way this is love for his own sake love for love's sake show me Rebecca and is telling about this that is the way you have to understand and work work for works shake what is the work shake mean I just love God and this is the good thing that I am trying to do I am doing I do not know whether I will get Mukti or not I do not know it that I will get miraculous power or not I don't bother about that also that is called karma yogi and karma yogi is a great lover then cinema Krishna is telling like this one must love God through intense love one attains the vision of him age capital in teens love one attains the vision of God the attraction of the husband for the chaste why is the famous code of ceramic isne the attraction of the husband for the chaste wife Poteet shuttle put it on the the attraction of the child for its mother shintani my body are kirshen and the attention of the worldly positions for the worldly man a worldly person always attracted to the worldly positions every day he will go on counting how much money how much money like this and type of Attraction when this three blend together that is called the real attraction for God not one the tree that might March and then that is called and this is why he said blend this three into one and direct it all to God then he gets the vision of God the vision of God is not so easy some people they're so easily they come and say oh I came over here I saw the see Ramakrishna dancing over there you came and you saw that's another Krishna it's so easy it's not so easy that's why when people tell like this we feel really disturb you tell something else why on this really your unknowingly making yourself a fool that's not necessary whatever you have seen or you have realized that you see this much I can do I have no time I have got many desired so I say I come and pray bow down to God and say God I don't have time but you have lot of time so look at me take care of me okay then I go that's sufficient so the always if you feel that God is my own he is my father you need not about the reward constantly doing so you could just come and say I love you but I don't have time to come to you visit you and taking the name of yours meditating but you have that capacity to take care of me please take care of me wherever I go please look at me take care of me sufficient so this is the way one can have that prayer then see Ramakrishna is talking with the Rock Hall he's telling it is not good to reason too much when you are going on the philosophical speculations calculations and discussions constantly it is not good because you need your wine to concentrate on God and only by discussing on do the people they will go and listen to that type of discussion because most of the people intellectual people an intellectual way they are satisfied that is ok but what after that where is the practice only intellectual understanding on do you have to understand that I have to practice and for the practice what do you need using emotion your mind of course your intellect and but the mind and emotion that's why we see Ramakrishna the god himself is telling it is not good to reason too much DW it's not good to reason too much first comes God and in the world realize God first then you will know all about his world when the people are reasoning this reasoning of course is not the pedantic reasoning pedantic reasonings you are taking your mind upward this reasoning is how this world was created who created these whether Brahma was first or Shiva was fast all this type of useless reasoning and this is what they say first is the God then in the world and if you realize God fast then you will know about it if you if first one is introduced to Judah Mali the demonic again it's a very rich man he was a neighbor of the Dutch nation so the Tucker is to go so they that name came so if you know that you do only rich man you are introduced and then gentlemanly started liking you even know everything about you to wonder how much wealth he is having then you can know everything about him then he is telling about the guru narada advised Valmiki to repeat the word Mara ma means God rah the world so fast comes the God then comes the world Krishna - sure another great pundit and also the an austere a person he mentioned Krishna quiches say that the word Mara is a holy mantra because it was given by given to Valmiki by a rishi narada ma means god and draw the world in the footnote master ma che has given this small way the story of the Ramayana because most of our people they know about Ramayana we need not to read that there for like the Valmiki one should at first renounce everything and cry to God in solitude with a longing heart and I really appreciate sometimes some people they like to go to our Ganges retreat I mean there is nothing the Ganges retreat is so quite so calm leaving a day or two is an austerity because there is nothing so that is the reason if one can go over there there's a bookstore you are reading the book next to the bookstore is the big swine very big shrine then people you can go and sit quietly and whenever you come out and you're walking no one around only that wilderness the trees it's a wonderful place if one can spend a day constantly thinking about God that's the great health cry to God in solitude with a longing heart the first thing necessary is the vision of God then comes reasoning about the scripture and the world so the philosophy and the world and all those things to come afterwards everything can be achieved through bhakti alone here is a special ways Ramakrishna is giving so much of emphasis on the devotion everything can be achieved through bhakti alone so every time in a different situation different type of mood has been introduced by the gods incarnation a time was there when people majority of the people used to think and judge so they were the Rishi is constantly discriminating but the present day people don't have that much time to concentrate and to go on discriminating because they are all bound by so many responsibilities but at the same time another path is their open for them what is that devotion those who want the knowledge of Brahman I repeat this work those who want the knowledge of Brahman will certainly achieve that also by following the trail of bhakti it's not as the revolutionary that statement through the birth of bhakti you are getting the ultimate of knowledge that is Brahman knowledge of Brahman so through the path of bhakti one can reach over there that devotion through the devotion one can reach to the highest goal of knowledge the mother supplies the devotees with the heap of knowledge now here the one's lamentation sailing immediately he is giving an example at kama puku I have seen green dealers measuring body the perhaps in the villages of course in this country I do not know but in our country the people have to purchase five kgs of grains then there whatever in the beginning so he from there he will take and measure and give and the moment that is over from the back people at there they will push the another portion of the grain so next man has come immediately from the air deviltry so he is mentioning about that at common poker is birthplace that is the village he saw so from there he is telling I have seen grain dealers measuring paddy as one hip is measured away another he was pushed forward to be measured the mother the divine mother supplies the devotees with the heap of knowledge Shami be vacant in this life he came over here every day he was delivering 1213 lectures can you imagine in those days there are no microphone just in the voice you have to reach to everyone and to listen to him huge gathering almost wish to shout to tell and everytime new ideas the new way of expressions and he used to pray to God to his guru what I am going to do how I am going to tell people what I will tell and in the night when his to sleep somebody is to tell him all those things which he would be telling next day from the next room people is to hear the conversation mostly these to hear the voice of Vivekananda be wakened is going on telling something this is the morning this to tell Swamiji what happened with whom you were talking in the night come it is mine my guru came he was teaching me what I should say that is the way it goes so that is why ceramic is not mentioning if you are truly a devotee God will go on giving you supplying you everything whatever is necessary that will come you need not to bother only have the failed and with a devoted mind prayer what I am going to do this is the problem things will go on happening so he is telling like this and he said mother supplies the devotees with the heap of knowledge after attaining God one looks on upon deed as a mere straw or dust those who are highly educated people so even when they come the ordinary people also because of the realization whatever they say that is accepted the bound to accept an example is Jesus he never attended any school anywhere but whatever he said all the religious people religious masters they had to accept thousands of people this to get encouragement and solace from that world but he was not an educated person how could he say that because of the realization whatever he's saying that approach that appealed to Swamy Vivekananda whatever he said all great people they started accepting him is true it is true it is true so that is the way we being I prayed to mother now see Ramakrishna stealing everything can be realized simply to the love of God if one is able to love God one does not lack anything whatever he will won't he one warns everything will be given to him the worldly prosperity or spiritual development anything just a few days before we have observed the Durga Puja and those who have read they know that the famous books which reach nd a story Dean sweet one king and one businessman both of them they were deprived by their own people King was a very good king very good administrator very good he was successful but he was betrayed by his own people so out of frustration he came inside the jungle and he was thinking what to do and he found another person a businessman Samadhi and the King the Sioux data and the Samadhi they started conversing between themselves and told why we cannot forget our own people the big traders what is this is the problem not that we are defeated not that we are here not that we have left everything and we are suffering it is not giving us that much pain as the thought of our own people why he betrayed us and we cannot forget them though they have behaved like this but they are not capable how they would survive both of them they are thinking in that way so they made another Rishi inside the jungle they asked this question he explained that this is the Mahamaya this your mind is completely covered with the Maya the who is this mine and then the story goes God is the god first time in the world the image worship image of Goddess Durga was worshipped by these two persons the king and the businessman the three days the worshipped septimius Tomino me and the - made a mother appeared before them both of them they saw that the mother has appeared then the mother asks the King what do you want I want to get that get back my kingdom and also like to conquer the whole world mother told okay that he will get not only that after this life in the next creation you'll be a mano mano means you will be the controller of the each and everything of the world that power he will get you are satisfied yes okay go and then the mother turned to the businessman the boy sure as the Samadhi Vasia and what do you want to the surprise of the king the wife was a businessman he said I want Mukti liberation I want to be at your feet all the time merging with you he got that to the boy everything is possible everything can be realized simply through love of God if one is able to love God one does not lack anything weeping I pray to the divine mother Oh mother revealed to me what is contained in the Vedas and the Vedanta because he he was not able to read and he was not having the time to read as her lifespan were sure so he went and requested the mother please tell me what is there in the Veda and the Vedanta people talked about these books what is there revealed to me what is there in the purana and the Tantra one by one she has revealed all this to me all those knowledge also everything was revealed to him so how now he gave their expression these are all deep mysteries what can you understand through reasoning he will realize everything when God Himself teaches you then he will not lack any knowledge the friends let us stop over here and the next day description will come so today we will stop over here let us change this pranaam mantra and conclude need hunter Papa come Drita become by ish avatar but a mission medium-term Ramakrishna she de sandy Chandi hurry [Music]
