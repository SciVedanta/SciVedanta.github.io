[246: Panchama Veda 246 : How To Destroy Your Desires?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=orWuTPP1nB4)

so last time when sudama krishna was visiting the shitty brahmos homage and this beautiful very interesting questions very good questions they were asking there was one gentleman who was a sub judge he was going on asking different questions last wednesday we have discussed how long should we perform our worldly duties and we have discussed that in our last weekend here we find that the surama krishna is asking that same question how long should he perform see ramakrishna said surely you have duties to perform you must bring up your children support your wife and provide for her in case of your death so this is the way so our traditional system the brahmacharya godhasta then bana presta then afterwards sannyas when it is the godhasta that is the time all our senses become very active and they like to go out to enjoy the worldly objects so one should be very very careful at that time so this is the moment one should be careful so brahmacharya time at the time of a student one should learn what one should do and what one should not on the basis of what on the basis of peace what is the goal peace joy happiness friends we always think that naturally that if we get proper education and if we are properly placed in the society get a good job that is the ideal of life is it when we grow up and we look around we see that people are suffering so much though they have so much of money but they are not happy at all so ultimate thing we understand is the happiness the what should be the goal of our life happiness joy so that keeping in view the happiness how one can become happy that should be the training our education policy those who are making the education policy they should keep this in mind ultimate goal is to get the happiness and how a person can grow up and he can enjoy the world in a in a controlled manner toned down way and at the same time he can become happy ultimately he'll be helping the society to grow he will be also enjoying whatever his desires are there but finally it is the happiness that should be the goal so that is exactly the teachings of the spirituality teachings of religion the people they may mostly talk about the meditation what is the purpose of meditation people don't know the thinking that i will close my eyes and i will forget this world is it so easy it's not those who are offering the 15 days course or one month course and then that i don't know actually what is true and what is not but the main thing is if it is the goal is the happiness then the preparation should be from the day one the child should be said that this is the way and what is the way performing the duties and then forgetting the the all that oh i did it to you so you should also reciprocate most of the people they fight the brothers are fighting with the brothers and all relatives are fighting only on that i did this to you and why you are not reciprocating why you are not giving to us to like this way everywhere in every society bhagavan siram krishna comes up with the wonderful reply wonderful answer to solve this problem you surely perform some duties duties and it is without attachment as we do the duties when i am someone working in the office i perform my duties but i don't get attached to that i am very sincere because i have to perform that i have to be successful but after that i am free the same way in the family life also as a father as a son as a husband or wife so like that the duties we can do then he is again asking how long should one support one's children suramar krishna gave the reply as long as they have not reached their majority so long it should be like that then what is the householder's duty to his wife and then the salama krishna is telling you should give her spiritual advice and support her during your lifetime and provide for her livelihood after your death so clear when a person is taking the responsibility the oath that he is taking the promises that he is taking at the time of marriage what is that the i will protect you the man is telling the the woman i will protect you so he should protect he should keep up his the promises and for that he should prepare the life in that way so this is the slowly slow but question may be in the society there is different type of situation comes how a person but majority of the people can do it sometimes somewhere some people may not be but majority of the people can do it if they are aware about it and if they do it what they will get in return happiness the joy the peace why the people are constantly fighting husband and wife is fighting and making the life of the children miserable why because they have not understood their own responsibilities the marriage is not just a coming close to a man and woman coming close and then not like that it's the responsibilities that is exactly what the ramakrishna is telling then spirituality what is the spirituality understanding the truth what is the truth that this world is temporary anything may happen anytime we do not know so obviously we should try to prepare ourselves for the things that may come we do not understand that we don't know what is going to come we think every all time will be happy all they'll be friendly there may be problems so we should get ready by that also the thinking that what to do if this type of things happen how we are going to manage mentally prepared then they are not going to break down so he is telling the spiritual life should be what's the spiritual life one is mundane life another spiritual life here comes the doubt we can see the mundane life i can touch this book i can touch that person i can smell i can taste i can hear i can see but in spiritual life related to the spirit related to the atman related to the god i can't see my all the senses cannot bring any information about that so i don't believe that is wrong so the faith has to develop through the words of the scripture and also through the words of the guru when the gurus are advising and i know that this person when he is telling this he has already practiced in his own life and he has become contained it that means there must be something in his words let me believe that that is the first step then reading the scripture all the great souls like the buddha the krishna and the jesus sirama krishna all of them they said that there is god there is the the supreme consciousness and you can reach over there that is the ultimate goal everyone so if i believe on that and then slowly slowly prepare my mind on that that's called spiritual life and the spiritual life when we are going towards that what happens all this mundane world this world which is temporary when it is changing i am not very much affected that's why suramar krishna is making us cautious but if you are intoxicated with the knowledge of god then you have no more duties to perform how long will do the duty like this this but if you are intoxicated then god himself will think about your moral god himself will think about your family it's true now the question is the faith and also the proofs if you look at the read the biography of different sages and saints just monks but in their lives there are so many things happen just like this god has taken the responsibility an example you can quote many of you have read the biography of swami vivekananda they were so rich people but suddenly something happened and vivekananda his mother and their brothers and sisters they were not having little food their relatives they were cheating them naturally they became very poor what to do he tried then ultimately came to siram krishna and sirama krishna told you better go and pray to the mother there's a very famous stories and swami vivekananda the young man of 17 18 years he went over there the narendra not but he could not pray for the food or job and money he prayed for completely different thing which is spiritual but when he came back what bhagavan sinama krishna said to him he assured go back mother will take care of your family there will be no problem for food and shelter and clothing motab heart mother kapoor abhor so that is the assurance of the god one who is becoming completely immersed in god in that in his thought he cannot think of his responsibility the discussion was on the responsibility now he cannot because he is forgetting himself he is forgetting the world so what will happen to his family god will take care so that is also we think how to believe it in the life of swami vivekananda and if you see the lives of just ordinary monks so many incidents are there so that proves it is true then bijay god himself carries on he on his shoulders all the responsibilities of a person who thinks of him with a single-minded devotion and is mad with divine love vijay krishna gosvami he was a great not only scholar but at the same time sadhaka he used to practice the australia's spiritual austerities so afterwards he became the leader of the spiritual group this bijay krishna gosvami he could feel so he is telling ah if god is taking the responsibility and what i should have to do only remembering god depending on god god will take the responsibility so there's a wonderful the situation sometimes some people they say they complain we are calling on god we have taken initiation and then doing this and that why so many problems are coming now if you sit to in one place and analyze do we really depend on god no and sometimes we are depending on god majority of the time we are taking the decisions and that is the difference but anyway one who is completely dedicated to god his family would be taken care by the god the family members they have their own karma followers also we have to remember that too so this way it goes now bijay then trilakka is telling is it ever possible sir to have true knowledge of god while living in the world so so many times rama krishna said yes yes yes even then this trilaku was present he heard but it is really very difficult to believe why because the world and the god completely two different things we can say the darkness and light can they be together how it is possible but sirama krishna is a unique teacher on this point majority of our the spiritual leaders they told no it is not possible and you have to give up the world and you have to follow me so most of the people without analyzing their mind without understanding properly how much they love god just they thought oh if i am going to suffer in this world it is better to follow that person so they left the heart and home and they became the monastics then all those hidden desires that one after another came up he not only ruined himself but also brought down the standard of the spiritual life yes so many incidents are there so in the monastic life one should be careful sirama krishna is a wonderful teacher as the god as a teacher so obviously there is no mistake he is telling from any place it is possible from any place not that i have to go into the cave and then only i i will realize god not at all it is only understanding what is that understanding this world is temporary but i see this world i live in this world i cannot deny this world then how to transform this world as a spiritual knowledge this is the technique the cerama krishna is teaching that technique how he says just believe in the words of god whatever the duties that you have got in this life perform that very attentively diligently you should perform that and you should be perfect in performing those duties but at the same time knowing that you cannot do it it all depends on god's will so depend on the god so mentally you are completely depending on god and apparently outwardly you are doing yourself as if so that is the thing suppose the people who are acting on the stage when they are acting do they forget who they really are no in their mind it is there after this thing are over when my turn will be over when i will go out of the stage i will be so and so and here i am king so as a king he is behaving talking but at the same time he knows similarly the sirama krishna many of you have already read i just remind you when you are living in this world live like a made servant isn't it he said so many times live like a med servant who is working in rich man's house and he's she is taking care of everything this is our thing that is our thing she'll be telling and she'll be showing great love and affection for the children of her employer my child my baby she'll be telling but in reality she knows she doesn't belong to that family anytime she'll be fired he she may be and then she has to go back to the village where her own family is there the same thing we have to apply while we are living in this world we have to be very good actor i think we have to be actors and actresses but mind knows that this is a temporary world temporary thing and that is called the knowledge when trilogy said sudama krishna he said why do you worry is it ever possible sad to have true knowledge of god while living in the world can one realize god here living in the world your body physically i am in an astronaut and you are in a house what is the difference physically but mentally if i am going on thinking how to get the name fame money and prosperity these that that means what living in an asthma wearing a geruba girl of sannyasin if i go on thinking about the worldly objects i am a grosthi living in a household if you are going on thinking about the god the spiritual life pure life you are a monk so this is the difference this is not the body it is not the physically where we are or what the clothes we are wearing it is the mind again surama krishna said we may come to those the wonderful words of krishna he said ishar mondeken the god is only observing your mind in mind you have to depend on god you have to have the great faith on god and you should constantly going on thinking no you are there to this moment i cannot see you but i know you are there so like that so sudama krishna why do you worry you are enjoying both you are living in the world with your mind in god isn't that true look at it you are living in the world with your mind in god isn't that true he's asking trey looker the traditional he was a very great devotee and naturally in the mind constantly this to think that if we live in this house we won't be able to realize god the sudama krishna is changing so like the ramachandra or the krishna suramar krishna didn't kill anyone never punished anyone but he himself said he who was rama he who was krishna now in this present body as srama krishna so as rama he had to fight with rabana and he had to kill rabana as sri krishna we know that he had so many things to perform but as sri ramakrishna he is not having any arms only the he is not using anything to kill any people but he is transforming his transformation of the thoughts that is the beauty of sirama krishna salam krishna only changing the mind the thought process he is not changing the place of the person occupation of the person he is there whatever they are doing he is only changing the thought process be there be responsible perform all your duties but keep your mind with god so that's why he's telling why you are enjoying both you are living in the world with your mind in god so living in the world you are enjoying the comfort and all those things at the same time your mind is in god isn't that isn't true why shouldn't a man realize god in the world certainly he can mano eva manusyanam karnam bandham in the scripture it says the reason of bondage and liberation it is only the mind mind is the thought and thought that i am thinking so if i think that i am always with god when i am cooking i am mentally thinking i am preparing it for god you have to come you have to have lunch with me and when i am sitting for the lunch if i just think imagine yes i am offering the food to god then i am eating at the same time thinking god is eating and he is becoming satisfied the constantly remembering god and my life is in the company of god i am living in the world i am having some duties over there and i am aware about my responsibilities but at the same time major portion of my mind is with god sudama krishna gave the example of the toothache the pain that always remind oh i am having a toothache but at the same time he is performing all his duties other things but now and then his mind goes back to that particular point where it is really paining so same way go back to god every moment every time go back to god so that is exactly ramakrishna is telling why shouldn't a man realize god in the world certainly he can then the trailer is asking what are the signs of the householders having attained knowledge they have realized god that trilogy wanted to know the example many of you those who are the students of sri ramakrishna you know perhaps you have read or the books are available you can go through that really interesting very inspiring the life of sri ma the person who has recorded this he never he wanted to leave the house and then become a monk salama krishna said no you are a teacher remain in that post but teach the students the morality along with the other subjects you must inspire you must imprint in the minds of your students the morality the duties that they are going to have in the future life so that was the teacher then ordinary teacher only imparting giving some knowledges of different subjects he become a missionary he is now truly giving the knowledge of reality these are the knowledges that you are learning through this knowledge applying this knowledge utilizing these knowledges you can earn some money but if you want the peace the happiness joy in your life so these are the things you should remember every morning and evening remember god don't forget it always remember that anything may happen anytime so be alert all the time and depend on god that supreme power that supreme knowledge so shri ma's life he never left his job he was all through before retirement he was a teacher a headmaster but through him so many young people came to know about the spiritual life and many of them became very successful and very good people we need good people we need good people in the administrations those who are becoming the ministers the administrators the rulers if they're good people then everything becomes good those who are doctors engineers professionals if they are really good people sensible people aware about their duties whole society will become heaven so that is the only the goal not you leave the whole heart and home whether you are ready or not and then come and follow me no one should not do that we have to understand this is my position from here i like to realize god i don't need to leave like a monk but i will internally i will renounce everything the external renunciation and internal renunciation are for those who are monks and external renunciation is not necessary but internal renunciation necessary for the householders to be happy many of you know sri the writer of the sri ramakrishna putin he was the composer in a bengali very melodious way the puti is a special type ah the way they express this akshay kumar he composed the whole biography of krishna into that fashion so many of the bengalis they read that and really enjoy this is the traditional way of expression this akshay kumar if you leave it read his life at the fair again his wife his children they were not liking him everything he purchased that was his property his house and now as because he became very old they pushed him aside in a small heart he used to live but very happy he was there who remembers the wife of that man or the children but we remember dakshay kumar and his name is always there along with bhagavan sirama krishna ramachandra he was a doctor he gave whole property to make the the fast temple of sri ramakrishna so he kept all the sudama krishna's relics and he helped so many ways ramchandra and if you look at this picture a contended person and sadhu nakamasha he was from the present-day east bengal i visited that place when i visited bangladesh very humble village and he used to be there then one day when he saw his mother because east bengal is far from the ganges to holy river ganges there is padma the that is a different river but his mother was crying that she wanted to have the gang ganga you know all the devout hindus they like to go to take it deep in the ganga and to touch the water and the doing the puja of the river that is a tradition she was crying then his son this nagmashai he prayed to ganga why don't you come over here so that my mother can touch you and suddenly there is still that place is there and that it was like a coat here suddenly water started coming up ganga water the tremendous power was there but how humble that man was when he came to ma sharadamani devi the mother gave him some prasad some sweets and fruits on a leaf you know the devotion as because mother touched that leaf he ate that leaf also how can he throw it because the mother has touched it that is called devotion and he used to live in great joy and happiness sadhu not marsha if possible read their biographies read their lives swami gambhira nandaji the book is there and swami chitanandaji also has written in a modern english book the way so you can read that book and you will get that answer what are the signs of a householder having attained knowledge and what suramar krishna is telling his tears will flow and the here on his body will stand on end no sooner does he hear the sweet name of god sadhu nakma came to the visit the mahasarathamani devi she was in bhagbajar at the time the moment the mother gave him a small piece of cloth as a token of blessing and immediately he took that as a in the indians the way they uh used that pagari at the head cap and immediately he wrapped his head with that and started jumping and dancing in great joy before everyone he forgot where he is the expression of joy so we can understand that sudama krishna is telling here stands on aim that is exactly the householders not only householders whoever has realized god it becomes like that a man cannot get rid of body consciousness as long as he is attached to the worldly things as long as he is attached to the worldly things not that he cannot live with those he can have them but they are not attached and sometimes we make the mistake no taku said ramakrishna said i don't need a car i don't need a house i don't need these i don't need that and like a big uh that if you are on the street there's a great difficulties you won't be able to concentrate and you are becoming a responsibility for the society and like you're homeless you are leaving now that is not the way srama krishna's word should mark you may remain into that but should not attest a man cannot get rid of body consciousness as long as he is attached to worldly things attached to worldly things as he becomes less and less attached to the worldly things he approaches nearer and nearer to the knowledge of self friends only two things are there god and this world the god the creator and this world is creation now as long as we love the creation god's creation and we love his creation we don't know the god so this is very simple the mo the more we are we drawing from the creation we get god so that one mind either we can give it to the world or give it to the god our choice if you give to the world definitely we you are going to suffer but that is also for sure and if you turn it towards god definitely you are going to get the happiness the joy the peace and they call please that is also for sure choice is yours choice is ours and that one side is god another side is creation now how to it becomes so as he becomes less and less attached to the worldly things less and less attached to the worldly things why he said because in a lot of duties that their responsibilities are there so naturally that person he is having that and slowly he is withdrawing a young man who becomes a monk he is not doing all this maybe as a monk in the organization we are purchasing the properties constructing the houses but we know it doesn't belong to me so there is that attachment is not there and should not be there but for a householder he is earning the money by spending lot of time then with that money he is purchasing his own house and he is living over there he is purchasing other things to be comfortable in there into that house so the monks they are belonging to the they are also purchasing the houses they are also purchasing the cars they are also purchasing the many things for the uh to leave what are the necessary things but they are not attached to that householders is my own money so obviously it is a test so these two differences so suramar krishna is telling slowly slowly withdrawing the mind he approaches nearer and nearer to knowledge he also becomes less and less conscious of of his body he attains self-knowledge when his worldly attachment totally disappears this is siram krishna he didn't say that with all your attachment in the world you will realize god no does he know he didn't say that he is telling what the traditional scripture has said he said that you have to detach your mind then only you will realize god sadama krishna is also telling that but don't forcefully detach yourself slowly slowly withdraw and then ultimately you will realize god then he realize that body and the soul are two separate things the ultimate knowledge of the vedanta the body and the soul are two separate things it is very difficult to separate with a knife the cardinal of a coconut from the shell before the milk inside has dried up those who have seen that the dry coconut and dry coconut inside the kernel it becomes completely separate from the shell then you just break the shell and the coconut you can take out but as long as the the juice is there the milk is there it gets attached to it the shell is so difficult to detach similarly the kernel of the coconut as if the self and the shell of the coconut as if the body as long as desire is there the milk of the coconut it that shell and the kernel is attached to each other when the desire is not there then it becomes completely separated it loosen so the main thing is desire and today we are discussing how to destroy our desires this suramar krishna will give the answer the sign of man's having realized god is that he has become like a dry coconut he lives in that he lives in that body but not attached to that he has become utterly free from the consciousness that he is the body so body and the self are different then salama and very apt the the example like the coconut when it become dry the kernel inside the coconut become completely separate he does not feel happy or unhappy with the happiness or unhappiness of the body is this not the teaching of the vedanta the surama krishna gospel is the panchama veda it teaches the vedanta pure vedanta but as swamiji said soaked in the syrup of devotion a person remains over there he's not uprooted he never get confused this is called pure vedanta you have to separate your soul your mind from the body so how by destroying the desires he does not seek the comforts of the body he roams about in the world as a given mukta one liberated in life then he said if the matches are dry you get a spark by striking only one of them again an example if that powder is not the fire powder is not dry it won't spark so that means before giving up the world you should prepare and withdraw the mind just out of emotion some people they give up the world and then come out and then they leave a very unfortunate life and that it is not the desired life one should be careful if the matches are dry you get a spark by striking only one of them if they are dumb you don't get a spark even if you are striking 50 times the damn thing won't do that then the triloka is asking what is the way to dry up the craving for worldly pleasures the craving for worldly pleasures how to destroy the desires i just simplified it how to destroy the desires this is a million dollar question because all the suffering because of the desires and how to destroy that desire if we can destroy the desire then completely free there is a in the capulet it says though desire you are the lowest of the law in the in hindi it says in between had you not been in between god and me i was a shuddha brahma so what is that carton that has separated me desire so that desire how to drive so it says in the kularnaptantra it is also said telling like the same thing as long as your desires are there you have to live in the world and that is a worldly life and there is no question of god god realization so long your indriyas all your senses are very active taking you out chapalim chapalata you're constantly thinking going out to enjoy the all the time the modern people the thing we should go over there we should drink we should dance we should enjoy is this the enjoyment no after some time when you come back the again that old man i really can't understand the people they go and they drink and they come back on the shoulders of somebody else and they do not know where they are putting their legs and lie down somewhere and in the next morning they get up and then becomes over again in the evening they go to that can they feel that insult to i behave very roughly they think no this is the enjoyment and they think uh then sometimes there will be advertisement this city doesn't sleep in the night always and people are also what these so this is called chapaliam chapalata that this chapel chapulata can they give joy happiness peace no excitement it gives and result of the excitement you not only destroy your body your health but at the same time you suffer a lot so that is the way kular nabat tantra is giving caution you should not tunsidasi is telling to me both an ignorant and learned person asim when dear kama krodha madaloba the desire anger ego and greed karma is the desire krodha the anger mother the ego and the lord the greed if that is there in the ma in the mind of an ignorant person and the mind of a learned person tulsida say i consider them both the same because they are the lastly going to suffer but this they say then how to restrain them now comes the manu maharaj manu the law giver sometimes the modern people they go on criticizing manu but the manu maharaja is a great soul and he gave the proper directions some people and when there was some problems with their political problems social problems so some a group of people who knew sanskrit it seems in the name of manu they composed some of the wrong things and tried to impose as a spiritual rule on the main body of the hinduism so that i don't believe that it was actually manus it says how to control your desire very simple and live in a solitude and we draw your mind again and again and also your senses again and again from those objects to which it is attached so that is the way you have to control your desire so if i do not get that slowly slowly it is withdrawn sometimes some people they are addicted to some their drinks or narcotics so they go to the particular places so what do they do they give only other things but not the narcotics that is so slowly slow in the beginning he suffers and those people the doctors and the nurses they help him to control a few days then slowly slowly he becomes all right all his desires are not satisfied the ingrediers all of the energies that is pain to collect those things are not used so what they will do you'll go to something else they need seize the movie enjoys the cinema and then like that slowly slowly he becomes so called normal so we have to withdraw and the spiritual life one should go in a secluded place and sit and pray again and again in a secluded place if you go and sometimes some people they like to go to our retreat a ganges retreat it is welcome but at the same time as because now the the this problem is going on the kovite 19 problem karuna so we have to be careful those who are going over there should take the permission from the authority and then the authority will know that there there not be different type of groups at the same time in the same house so it should be separate that is the appeal we are constantly doing but we appreciate that you go over there stay over there pray to god read the books that is very good spiritual practices at the same time helping the authority to maintain that serenity and to maintain that astrama so that is the way one should so this is very good so what is the way very simple take less food why so you can control your mind and second use your mind in such a way so that it cannot go to get the attachment the things that you were attached the things that you enjoyed from there again and again you have to withdraw but that is the way it is possible to surrender to god that is why suramar krishna said friends that we will be discussing about that there will be two days retreat on the ganges many of you know that is on the 11th september the devotees will remember because it is a 50 years of the ganges so devotees will remember the ganges means the name of the place there is the vivekananda the retreat and it is 100 acres of land people they go as because in person we cannot go it will be online at the 11th september from evening 7 to 8 the the people who were associated they will be remembering so that is the history they will say and next day from morning eleven to one o'clock our senior swamiji is living in america swami chitanandaji swami sarvadevanandaji brahmarupanandaji and also our bharadhanandaji they will be remembering the benefit of retreat very interesting subject caitanya will be speaking the sudama krishna and the spiritual retreat sarvadevananda ji swami vivekananda and spiritual retreat and brahmarupanandaji the the hindu scripture and the spiritual retreat and sir bharadananda ji will be the benefit of the retreat in ganges so that is also if you have not registered you can register if you go to our website so obviously you will get all this retreat is necessary retreat means this spiritual retreat and if we go with some friends then we walk over there and go to the places and then sit and listen and chat with the friends over the telephone now that is not spiritual retreat this is the most humble way you have to live all alone maybe under a tree you are sitting and reading some book closing your eyes try to remember those words of the scripture and then trying to visualize the god or meditating within your heart the again and again and again the one or two days or three days that you are living over there this is really good now let us conclude this part and we will discuss once again in our next discourse the dictums the first he said sadhu-sanga how to realize god and he said first is sadhu-sanga holy campaigning reading the holy books then nirjan bars going to the retreat and living all alone sometimes some people here in america mostly they are so living in the house only two peop person so they are really having the retreat if they make a routine that at least four hours i am going to taking the name of god or meditating that is a wonderful way four hours then four hours i am going to study the scripture sometimes bhagavad-gita sometimes the gospel and sometimes the biography of the great sages so four hours so total eight hours and then other works whatever you are doing and every time remembering that whatever i am doing these are all temporary things so you are not getting attached to that that is the way even living in the household one can realize god one can realize brahman one can have that knowledge that is exactly what suramar krishna is mentioning when the in the question of sirama krishna is giving the answer pray to the divine mother with a longing heart very simple pray to the divine mother with a longing heart her vision dries up all craving for the world and completely destroy all attachment to this world so prayer that is uplifting our soul and the pray to the mother friends suramar krishna is giving a wonderful example he it happens instantly if you think of her as your own mother it happens instantly if you think of her as your own mother then she is repeating she is by no means a godmother own mother she is your own mother with a yearning heart persist in your demand on heart now giving an example and i will read that those lines and we will conclude the child holds the skirt of the mother and begs a penny of heart to buy a kite perhaps the mother is gossiping with her friends at first she refuses to give the penny and says to the child no you can't have it your daddy has asked me not to give you money when he comes home i will ask him about it you will get into trouble if you play with a kite now the child being begins to cry look at it how the child begins to cry and will not give up his demand then the mother says to the friends excuse me for a moment let me pacify the child and immediately she unlocks the cash box and then give a penny to the child so that is the way one should pray to the divine mother and she is our real mother thank you friends and again in the next wednesday we will meet and discuss any question so let us conclude with this pranam mantra niranjanam nityam anantarupam bhaktanu kampa dhrita bigraham is salutations to bhagavan's ramakrishna the perfect embodiment of the eternal truth which manifests itself in various forms to help mankind and the incarnation of the supreme lord who is worshiped by all o foreign
