[89: Panchama Veda 89 :Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8sbEB6gbhDE)

dr. G venom kobe VI ritam calma shop aha me shravana mangalam srimad athim vivekananda a gory dodgin aha last time we were hearing how ceramic is not the god internet in this modern age he is talking with the devotees and in a very simple way friendly way is guiding them to the highest spiritual realization and here the God alone is deur everything happens by the way this is the highest philosophy that one has to realize but you don't believe it actually you don't feel that God if God is the doer then why I have to do all the things so that is the question again and again comes in the mind of people will be asking why then I have to do if God is the doer then whatever I am doing so naturally i can say god has done it Tony so why I should have to do now we asked to that you should perform the austerity you should not tell lies you should help people you should journey we should visit the holy people and the holy places why should I have to so that is the question comes why do they have to do all this is God is being but this is a very very high philosophically the God is the fewer who can understand that whose mind has rolled into that height what is that high we go less mess when the mind has gone up into that stage of regal ousness then only I can feel you that something that God is Greenland and I don't feel the said to think that I have been chosen to do that work of God different type of job different type of work but when I am doing that with a dedicated mind that God has chosen me to perform this work two things happen immediately the moment I am thinking that God has chosen me to do this work millions and millions of people are there but why me why God has chosen me to do this has a very very very important thing to decide and that is a devotee the true devotion he is actually discriminating but if we don't feel that they in drudgery oh if that I am sweeping the floor of the temple and i am doing these all the work that is not getting the attention of the other people people are not talking about me and they are not raising me i am doing some anything then you are performing worldly things not God's to work this is the difference so God is the doer and he is working through me I am the instrument and you are actually playing so that is highest philosophy if one can perform that that is the highest realization one can do same what same thing same thought same lifestyle only thing that changing of the thought how this that the ceramic ish nuh said this and I have total faith and believe in him and when he is telling this that must be true and I am bless it I will wait for the blessings of God sometimes some people not getting the responsibility dear restless not getting the attention of the people they are restless but I have to wait and that is called the patient's the patience is a great achievement in the life patients i am going on waiting and praying for the mercy of god blessings of god and then only transformation comes God alone is the doer everything happens by he's will Hoge lamarche I who always is to be so close to God's again like us he is putting a question no that cannot be but it is difficult to understand that he says take the case of the sadhu off that bouquet large is a place last time we have discussed he went to a deep meditation the buku buku eyelash monk and he was in samadhi and it is said in the Samadhi is so difficult par shonna eva nice chala when the mind is totally absorbed in the ideal and then it becomes partial abortion amines the stone even is chala motionless like a stone the highest kind of meditation and we nearest over there the fools the ordinary people they could not understand that stage they were thinking that he is dead and they were confused so they were sometimes beating him sometimes creating problem for him so that was the news in those days and has remained about that and ceramic ishness aid is because of the karma phala even though he has reached to that higher stage but because of the karma phala he had to suffer in the hands of this poor illiterate ignorant people so that is very interesting even though he has reached into that high stage but sometimes this type of people physically they are suffering why because of the past karma and bye dad see Rama Krishna is hinting he himself on was in that stage those who have Reds ramakrishna's biography they know he was in that stage for last six months continuously six months he was in that stage he was in like a Jerusha body Jeremy's motionless but another monk in all around people they were ignorant about that ayah stage about that Samadhi so somewhere one monk came the divine the one young boy when I told you when you asked how I will know that I am getting the blessings of God this the God will arrange heey ranges everything in such a way as if it is nothing but the arrangement is made and all difficulties suddenly someone come help that is the God's will that is the way that God is guiding and you can become sure that I am on the right track i am the right path because i am getting the gods grace that is the signs ceramic ISNA when he went into the gorge ahmadi all around people who are not aware about the Jura samadhi like a stone used to see it without bathing without eating the outperforming anything physically so people who are not aware what to do 1mon came and he took the responsibility to feed him he used to beat his holy body sometimes he used to beat him bitterly then he still coming to that the consciousness as Eve the physical consciousness coming down from the high estate sale Ramakrishna and immediately his to pour the food so that the body can sustain and that way ceramic ishness body was maintained sustained so it was a lucky for us and who did it at the divine instance mother this mom came and he helped so that is the ramakrishna stealing it is because of the karma phala that shadow couldn't get that ceramic is no God why he himself mentioned the key to others liberation incarnation who is the God Himself coming in the form of human figure to help the human being and we call as incarnation he is holding the key for the liberation of other people so there are some power whom we call divine is always protecting him similarly we are also being protected when we are not we have to go and pray to God have you taken your hands off from my head re I am I not getting your blessings by all these things happening to me one should understand that something has happened something bad is going to happen why because the blessings of God is withdrawn so one should go and pray and pray and pray pray with all tears why this to me God have I done something wrong please put me in the right track I don't know anything so that we when we are once again coming to him the blessings will come the key is in the hands of the Incarnation and this time Marsha rhythm and Davey hinted swami vivekananda he also hinted after analyzing see Ramakrishna bout so many times in so many varieties of ways then show me become the saint he is the god if we don't believe it is bad luck for us those who are not understanding these I don't know it is up to them but hundred-person faith that DC is God and whatever he is telling that is the way for me so if you can understand and you will see in the discourse the Hegira he is going on talking in a different way but instead we will listen to the ceramic ishness words and he is telling will you take me in acreage someday to moti shields garden house at belghariya is a place the neighborhood name belghariya in Calcutta why he is asking a devotee particularly the m/c he is not asking any other only his chosen people whom he liked whom he loved he wanted to give that opportunity to serve him this is also very important and he is asking him will you please take me over there ah I feel so happy when I see the fishes it is a water bond is there fishes are there and he is telling I feel so happy to see them spot in the water that you will awaken your spiritual consciousness to this triple things simple thing or the thing every time we see in the water fishes are playing but you only enjoy sometimes and then we forget but that hint that scenery immediately taking the mind to a higher plane higher consciousness and that you'll awaken you spiritually consciousness to you will feel as Eve the fish of the human soul were playing in the ocean of sachidananda the whole ocean that we see this role universities old world and my life my samsara whatever he I am just playing in there it is like a ocean tsuchida ananda and i am playing in this so take the enjoy in leaving joy in leaving how constantly remembering that and the soul i am eternal i am ever free I am NOT bound but I have taken this body to enjoy in swimming as even like the fishes are doing in the searched on underwater that is there so I Ramakrishna is telling spiritual discipline is necessary in order to see God see how specific those who are interested to see God have the vision of God realize God to reach the higher spiritual life is there anything that he is talking about in a narrow sectarian way I think anyone in any faith in any place in any time this is the truth spiritual discipline is necessary in order to see God then he is referring about his own spiritual discipline I had to pass through very severe discipline they call austerity what is that austerity and fighting fighting with the lower mind with the upper mine lower mind always try to drag the mind to the body and the upper mind upper thought try to take it out of the body and take it to the spirit that is the austerity spiritual discipline constantly going on every moment every time whenever you see anything immediately your mind should be saying back to spirituality sent back to God whatever we see the wonderful sunset sunrise the moon the beautiful scenery some other things as Saddam o Krishna pointed out the fish playing in the water everything of this world immediately we have to have to learn to send it send our mind towards God and that's y mas all the money they be told pupusas Archy baba monta ki char buddha ish are a chore anita what is baba means my dear children the top Ishod austerity what is that only to keep the mind at the feet of Lord that is called austerity and see Rama Krishna is telling I had to pass through this discipline how many austerities I practiced under the bell tree I would lie down under it crying to divine mother o mother revealed I said to me the tears at low intolerance and soak my body with the faith is necessary then there i went to the portland all mungs the gather to remember our brother who has passed away Shan Shan to ruben and edgy and wherever he goes the mongs even in that what we are going to discuss a little bit of remembrance about the Hmong and then spirituality religion spiritual life so the Shah mean jerz now he gave me the topic how to return unshakable faith to these practice practice and practice and to practice a faith is nasally faith in the words of guru faith in the words of shastra Scripture and faith in oneself I am going to get it this is the first and unshakable faith whatever happens how can I unless and until I have someone living before me an ideal whom I can always check oh these he was practicing and these are the things written in the scripture darling I can feel whatever has been written it is true just being practiced it has been tested and the fruits and the result has come so that gives me the encouragement and the unshakable faith in that and ceramic ishness that person he is leaving idea all shots of things again we have read that you have to practice to me differently sama dama Oh karate pratiksha Sardar samad on so all this we have already read in the scripture but can anyone do the head in the life of you see Ramakrishna suppose someone is in the life of householder he is having his wife he is having is related he is having the problems is it possible for a person like that to keep the mind at the feet of God ceramic is an example suppose one is among and how one should leave as a monk in this world surrounded by the society people so many other people Sri Ramakrishna is the example so this is the way we find all shots of different versions before you vines but all this it goes to the knowledge has the compass all it shows the lot it goes all is to as the god wherever you say what he was doing whatever fashion we leave the mind is always to of the god and Serrano Krishna is telling the mass M the master Marcia he is telling you practiced so many austerities but people expect to realize God in no moment to naturally some people they get the initiation and then after Oh to cook so many years I have been initiated in all that but why the God has not come to me is God waiting over there just because he have taken his vision but he come this num needs no precondition that God will come on not the one monk wayne for practicing austerity after one or two years and then he wrote to the mother and practicing for such a long time every day but why I couldn't see God the mother almost educated ask the person who was writing or later right to him do you think God is sitting over there only to show himself as because he were counting some beads no go on doing that you have become known that is the only job left in you do that whether God will come on not real you will get the realization or not don't bother you got the initiation go on practicing having the faith in the words of Guru if you can do that all other things would be taken care of so that is called the failed when the master mush has said you have practice so in your charities but people expect to realize God in a moment kill him and build a wall simply by moving his finger around his house here birthday immediately salam o Krishna told a very unique thing and this is amritha says unwritten is the brother of that our the famous actor girish course I am sorry the grease goes he was the his brother and that he was telling that sir salam o Krishna didn't mentioned that it I am Telling it immediately he refer to that person the Talmud says one man lights a fire and Cain bust in its eighth in our country if you have seen in the village villages also in the cities when it is cold one person will collect some crackers firewoods and he will light the fire and all the four people in a seat around here also they do in other way but they will be all sitting around and taking the hit to the world one person arranging everything he is collecting all the photographer fire roads and arranging them lighting the fire when the fire is like other people what does it mean why is mentioning this it means he is austerity his practices he is the God Himself come here listen to him and a little bit of practices he will get the worms that he was practices all the austerities that he has practiced the benefit of that austerity will also get if you come near him listen to him because the fire is already burning so that is the idea it is good to remain on the plane of the leela after reaching the knitter another statement he is mentioned so he gospel of sadhana Krishna one person has over telephone also used her i have read gospel assalaam o Krishna I liked it so it's not the cursor my king is the question of practicing since meeting if the world of T Ramakrishna's swami vivekananda save any word of cinema busines over that i can write so many philosophies he said that i had to practice a lot of austerities Maximus I said you did it but some people they think without much doing anything they will realize God immediately he mentioned and it is a very clear hint that someone is lighting the fire mainly gives the benefit to similarly the fire of knowledge fire of devotion fire of selfless work fire of the spirituality that i have already lighted burned now it is burning just come to it and get the worms give the benefit you need us to perform so much in other places easily I have 4 400 person you at least do one percent if you practice one person that will be sufficient that door will be open and the floor of spirituality will reach you only do one person what is that one person have faith have faith in the words of cinema Krishna the master of the God who has come in this world in the modern age and why faith faith and faith because this is the age the modern age this is the characteristics of the modern is to doubt every time everything even the Sun will be doubting the father the student will be doubting the teacher the subjects will be doubting the king and each and every one constantly doubting because that is the characteristics of this present age so here he says like this if you have the faith then you will get the worm what is that the wonderful spiritual practices that he has done and then he is immediately mentioning it is good to remain on the plane of the leela after reaching to knit there now these are all separate words know very well connected when you read it seems what he suddenly mentioning he said that I had to practice the severe austerity then when the master Marsh I said you only practiced and you have realized all people cannot do that but they think that they will immediately he said indirectly if they come to me they would also get the same benefit as I have got and thin he is mentioning here it is better to come and leave in the leela after realizing the nick there so two words he is using one is Nietzsche and there is Leela what is nikkia at Doyle dr. is the nikia o Dwyer Dwyer means to aa- there is no 2 there is only one o Dwyer taut taut optum is the truth there is only one truth that is there and not the two if only one can understand these it is called meet their victim is eternal unchanging evil lasting and never getting any changes for any reason so that is the some people they call it God some people in different names and the Vedanta calls at Toyota or the Brahman or the forum admin different names of given who this is the adware that the one without second one has become many without any purpose though again the sunday will be discussing about that the we are searching the route what is our route where from this universe came who we are who made us and by how and what type of things that they use to make us made us is a God Himself is that tucked away himself the one himself is making two then he is telling a story afterwards that one king he wanted to know about it then a magician came and he was showing the king the two fingers and then he started King how many fingers you see two ok now to now to now and he winked on roaming the hand in so fast then the two became one then there he was asking king how many fingers you see now one that is the thing the universe the world and the lela lela miss all this works that goes on there is also belong to God is one but we only see it as if it is too so that is called Nita and Leela and what is Leela action without any purpose that is kalila action without repurpose why he God has made himself so many the one the eternal suddenly he thought I want to be many why there is no why no one can ask there is no answer just wish to bite from there everything came so the material cause the intellectual cause the person who made and the thing with which he made it is only one that is the Hartman and para Bartman what is the indication indication is all that the human being that we see and nothing but the god our selves and not the same we are having all that quality that if God is having their income nation is having Avatara is having the Son of God is having and The Messenger of God is having all those qualities are having each and every human being the moment in know about it they are transforming to that I stage how if they come and who is he he said I have realized that one that do a Tata now I am living in Leela and villa means behaving in a different way as Eve in the different angle is all normal natural like us they in a scripture they say you I am Stano boo manisha you I am Stano home that a tree trunk there is the star know it was there and from distance I taught oh it is a tree trunk only i waned and then again I saw from distance I saw a tree tree trunk when I went near as a node's a human being to me when I was seeing from distance I saw something at the same thing came into a different way when I went close the similarly when I see from distance I see the same God same paramount man same Brahman in many different ways the boys the girls the ladies the gentleman the poor the reach the illiterate and the educated so so so many varieties but when I go near it's the only one how come then I was seeing so many is a one type of light they use the light is only one the bulb inside is one but when it is burning and it is roaming like this so many varieties of color will come and reflect on their bodies and we think oh so many colors are coming from the same now is the same light from distances so many varieties so many colors but when you go near same thing only one so in those days they had no such things to court to explain but we know now so many varieties are there so many different ways but when you go it is only lit Sin City when it's only the burl so this is he says but why is mentioning these because he is having both he was there in the nick there one he has realized and he has come back and living and having there enjoying the play it is nita and Leela the master again master Masha is telling you once said that one comes down to the plane of the leela in order to enjoy the divine play in order to enjoy the divine play one is coming down after realizing immediately master no not exactly that the leela is real too now the example that he gave afterwards the two fingers when rotating very fast it is becoming one but does it mean that the second finger is not there it is there very much there to the leela when you see so many other things is all false and true no it is also there so this is a of explaining the thing most of the time the vedantam will be telling there is no world at all and sadhana Disney is telling why not seeing God he has become so many that means the God is also there but how long it will be there as long as I is there I and me is there as long as this difference is there so long it will be let me tell you something then he is totally taking the mind of the devotee for their betterment in a different way what is that we never you come here bring a trifle with you something you must bring to a holy person to a holy place something you must be perhaps I should not say it it may look like egotism I also told other saying that he should bring a pennyworth of something with him I asked bhavana to bring a pennyworth of betel leaf however you notice Vimanas devotion visible so that is the reason at least I try to tell the devotee is not me the gods ramakrishna's directions when you come over here do something give something and then take something from the astana otherwise there is a word colostrum appear oh the many people the thing that everything should be free many people think that whenever I go I must make the schwa me many people the thing whenever I go whatever I offer should be given to God now there is a system this is a routine that he has to call it and then when he will come over here as a service to God bring something and to American on boy and the girl became and they told that we cannot pay Tommy G but will serve in extreme and both of them early morning the gotta practice meditation would here for at least two hours the city is that so much practice they have already done and then they went down and they were cleaning the pathway very nicely the Dean it looks so nice all the lines of the lights they were fixing they were removing other things so it looks good they gave it all devotion and that was their contribution to God something you must bring at the time of initiation always the Guru will say at least bring one some food we offer it to you so that that I am serving you giving you and you will get the benefit the moment the mind is there I am really going to take you won't get it so that is the idea salam o Krishna is not i but with agitation is telling why people may always misunderstand not that he needs it and asking no it is not he is asking only is very close devotee will not misunderstand to them only he is telling so here he is telling let me tell you something he was talking about the philosophy and suddenly the practice what is the practice of philosophy I understand and I serve let me tell you something whenever you come here bring a triple with you and I told other I told bhavana who is his author with the other the bobbin are very close to some ceramic esna we know so obviously he is telling these people because other people may misunderstand oh he's earning something by killing like this no it is not one should not miss understand when I came that somebody has commented that something about Osama immediately I told him he is a very good person very good person I don't know whether he told them not but he denied notion which I never mentioned like that but whatever the second person came and told so I immediately I told him without any separately alone I told if we have mentioned like this don't bring no problem but Sir they are the young as a our upanishad it says whenever you are approaching a venerable person at least if you cannot bring anything bring a bundle of firewood in those days days to use that at least bring that and in a humble way approach to him and then give it to him tradition and that wonderful tradition tradition to understand to respect the person from whom I am getting the highest knowledge so that is the reason the awesomest some ceramic ich nur is to inquire from the devotees you have visited kashi have you gone there have you gone there then he was asking have you given something to game someone toward either way as a rich man you know yes they were asking I told I will come I will give you and next day I came back I didn't give Salam o Krishna was astounded you have so much money you give the word that you will probably promise that you will give and without giving you came back and you thought that you went to pilgrimage you think you're thinking that you have he will get the blessings the God Himself erupted think of it the God Himself is asking why for the better of that person rectifying his thoughts because so much so I was telling the story here in our fall banquet the three sons of the prajapati that God and the human being and the Donna verse did so they went to the prajapati and he said only one dog and then they understood in a different way the human being told Donna Donna Donna there's charity why because the desire is so strong in the mind of the human they always wants to preserve always want to gate and very gay jewel neighbors ready to pop it with others share it with others that's why the mothers teach the children to share with others they will give two candies in one child and said go and give it to him and share it with your brother or sister why is a teaching for the human kind human being don't like to give when you were born our this both the picture close a homonym at a time of birth the children there with the fist closed they come can we to you that's why the Lord good the you sitting like this when you get up then you can see at the back but good day is sitting like this and show me ranganathan the G said only human being can do like these and no one else dhanam the Saddam occasion is telling try to learn to give so that is and then afterwards he said to his greatest disciple narinder not also some other people who are there the serving the others is the greatest religion and how he can serve in the two ways one who has left the heart and home has become monk they can serve physically is there any national a natural calamity then they can go and serve the the people over there they are not having any money and those who are in the society cannot go like that like the monks they are not free they have the responsibilities they have to attend their duties they can also participate in that by giving Donald by giving donation so that is the both are joining together serving God in living being and let me tell you something whenever you come over here bring something etc knowledge and love both our paths leading to God the ceramic ishness mentioning about narendra not and bhavana the West Plains not in the north was full of knowledge constantly discriminating because he did lot of books he hard and his very very intelligent and the vimana he was devotional type God is there I will pray to God so naturally nor no not used to make jokes from oh you are crying okay cry like a lady like this used to then see Rama Krishna is telling the boy saying don't think just like sometimes the people like thing like that knowledge and love both our paths leading to God those who follow the path of love have to observe little more outer purity those who are following the path of love they have to follow to observe a little more outer purity look when you are coming to the temple we have to change your dress you must be if you are going to touch the photo you must be some people will always ask why this barrier because of that why this is separate why can't we go this other way side it's not the market it's not the shop that anyone can go and touch and do anything this is the place of devotion and devotion needs a little more purity what is that purity preparation to realize God everywhere you go in the mosque in the synagogue in the churches in the temples sanctum sanctorum is there and when you like to go over there you have to prepare in that way so that is the reason this boundary and afterwards when you are ready then you can go so this is the way knowledge and love but those were following the love the path of love should observe a little more outer purity external purity that is necessary because that gives the mind a preparation in the morning if you are bathing and putting on a washed clothes and then you are going to the temple you see your mind is ready to do some puja some other meditation taking the japa like that suppose you went out for a long walk exercise or some practicing the jogging if you come back and immediately with the same grace if you go to the temple your mind will never be ready to practice meditation or prayer why the same mind because it is the preparation so that is this but those who are in the ghana for them it says that it is destroyed in the fire of knowledge but very difficult people may pretend that I a Meganium people may pretend that I don't need all these things i can have many time I can go to God because within me all purity it's not they may pretend and it is more bad because that is not true they are pretending so that is the reason that Y animal Swami Vivekananda was AG animal and his pooja was a different type of Pooja he used to seat his to meditate and he is to take all the flowers together and is to give once why because he sees the God within himself if we follow the same pooja system we are only imitating it is not genuine is not correct so that is why he says the gannys follow the path of discrimination some time it happens that the discrimination between the real and the angle loses his faith in the existence of god that is the difficulty the yani gana margies to see 30 otherwise it is very very difficult most of the people they're very fond of particularly in the modern times those who are educated people oh now I follow that but the following is what you have not basic thing how can you sing them the higher if you have not completed the school education college level then how can you think of doing the research just a laboratory open to you and you think that you can do anything now maybe that you are thinking I am just like any scientist I can do I can perform go inside a laboratory you are nowhere you won't be able to do anything because the preparation is not there you do not know what is what similarly in the spiritual life also in religion also prepare a shin is necessary so here in the gospel of ceramic ISNA is a wonderful way he speaks about the truest and the finest way of religion and that's why the name again and again I say that Pancham amiga the fifth book of knowledge the fifth book of knowledge knowledge about the spirituality even in the way that there are so many varieties way of expression but here it is straight gana Maggie this is the path and this is the probability problems and the bhakti marga the devotional path this is the way then he says but a devotee who sincerely yearns for God does not give up his meditation even though he is invaded by artistic ideas he will go on continuously sometimes the mind become dry and I don't feel like sitting in meditation I don't feel like taking the name of God that is also the same doing traveling these are the things that one is going to all his face when the mind is not at all wanting to meditate we must have to meditate every day the same time we must practice mind don't want to take the name of God must take the name of God if necessary while walking and clapping the both the hands ceramic ISNA is telling so this way you must practice Hindu scriptures command the householder to visit the only man with sweet table presents lets her giving a note when the taco was telling you must bring something is giving the note over here taarak was a young man of 24 taarak means afterwards this hour shivananda ji maharaj to this he was a 24 and he had a wonderful capacity to restrain himself and that's why Shami Vivekananda gave a second name Mahesh is a great person to control the passions attachments is not a matter of job so our swami vivekananda gave that name that is a mahaprabhu's Mara his sannyasin emmys chabon onda primo gnostic name taarak his father was a great tantric he is to perform the young young by lighting the fire on his left hand and doing the performing the proj on right hand and it's not burning the people is to see there's a wonderful thing that used to do so these things are possible who said it is not but only those who can do they can do when that boy came 24 years young man master was so happy ceramic ishness was so happy why his mind is pure and immediately he went and touched his chin and showed his affection never country the motherly affection touching the chain so that way he was showing as if the Sun has come to mother not to father the mother the mother is full of love affection and so that touching the chin up then he was sitting your mind is still attracted towards the world things kedar one person he was practicing spirituality he came to see Ramakrishna and he had a quelle way of spirituality used to go and hold the two of the master as if he is getting the power from that sometimes some people will do this type of thing but salam o Krishna never liked it the wane he went and he was holding his toe and he was sitting like that master went into ecstasy and then coming down from that he announced it pronounced before everyone he saying your mind is still attracted towards the worldly things what is the use of saying you don't care for it he used to say that I don't care but you cannot hide its Ramakrishna can read the mind go forward then he was inspiring beyond the forest of sandalwood there are many more things the minds of silver minds of gold minds of diamonds and other precious stones having a glimpse of spirituality don't think you have attained everything the master was again in that extracting mood he said to the Divine Mother now this just listen he said to the Divine Mother about that person who came to him who is paying respect but then master mother taking heavy he was telling that person he was devoted but he was not belonging to the philosophy ideology of ceramic tishner so those who is having this type of mentality see Ramakrishna level like them like them means they have to wait and those who are coming that's why sometimes I really wonder and we have common the God has accepted us and we are so blessed but at the same time we are so foolish you cannot realize it we cannot think ourselves bless it I have come to this philosophy my mother my father my master please protect me and don't take me away or let me away from your home so that feeling is not there one should and that is the that is the reason one should read gospel of ceramic ISNA why we are reading the gospel of cinema Krishna to solve the teachings of sri ramakrishna no not like that we discuss and we feel and when we are analyzing we can understand how they said we are and one should constantly go and telling the god thank you because either accepted me this Gator he was he is a frightened torn he said to rom rom was a close devotee of sri ramakrishna he was telling rom what is the what is this master saying mother take him away mr. Berg who is the mother mother is God Himself mother is the ramakrishna himself but who taking every means you have to wait so that is the reason and again in next Tuesday we will study the other so this is very very very important that we understand the true spirituality religion and importance of Sri Ramakrishna he has already realized the neat there but he staying in Leela because so many varieties why for us so that we can understand it is possible to see God possible to realize the oneness of God possible to realize that Brahman artman only a few disciplines that we have to follow now let us offer our trenholm and conclude niranjana nityam untrue bak tonneau compa because ye chaahat autumn / amish a medium tamarama krishnam sheer asana mama Shanti Shanti hoodie healing that's a three dom you
