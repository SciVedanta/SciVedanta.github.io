[256: Panchama Veda 256 : Renounce Everything Mentally To Realize God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIlnbRZxGZs)

namaskar good evening they're devotees and friends this wednesday we will study the panchama way that the gospel of sirama krishna but as usual a latest chant from this mantra [Music] a the devotees our topic this evening as the bhagavatam krishna puts it to realize god renounce everything of course he said mentally so we'll come to that to renounce god to renounce everything to realize god you know today is the birthday of a great soul who renounced everything physically and mentally externally and internally and became nibirita of ramakrishna vivekananda today is her birthday 28th october 1867. many of you remember our devotees here in chicago that chicago center organized almost a half year long this celeb program and to celebrate the 150th birth anniversary of sister nibidita and we had the program every month in the hindu temple lemont they very much cooperative with us and also the university of chicago that there also we had the wonderful program the many swamis they came and the scholars from the university they also spoke so all this 15th issue of the chicago calling that here that this is the book many of you may remember here many of the beautiful articles are there on the sister niberita you can go through this book if you go to our website and then if you go in the home page down scroll that our magazine chicago calling and if you go to the eason and the previous issues then the 15th you can read online beautiful articles are there on sister nivedita and i was remembering the days i visited that the birthplace of sister nivedita and where she studied and grew up so i land england i had the great opportunity to visit those places and many of you remember that once swami came swami purnanda and by birth and irish and he has taken the sannyasa and he took so much pain to establish that astra over there and finally when he needed badly some money to establish that astrum and he came here over here and i took him to our uh that annual the fundraising the that year many of you donated nearly 30 000 more than 30 000 we gave to him for his asthma and then afterwards i visited it's a very nice astronomer those small and from there he took me and to that the birthplace of sister nivedita and he drove the all the way we reached over there and in the library now they are in one corner they have dedicated for sister nibirita i sent many books from here to keep in that corner dedicated for assistant debated and they were wondering they were not knowing this after the 150 years of a birth they came to know that a girl from their community from their country and she did so much for india and india still remembering her they were really wondering and i told why you stopped sending your girls only sister nivedita why not other girls so that all we remembered now maybe after the pandemic when everything is over if you are interested you can go and visit this place you know why why we visit these places the particularly the birthplaces of the great souls because this is very rare you will find millions and millions who like to grab we like to keep we like to enjoy there is no dearth of selfishness everywhere you'll find a selfishness all selfish people they like to leave only for themselves and very rare very rare those who live for others so that is one example the sister nibirtha and they also that the local authority and they have given a blue pluck and the sister nibiruta's the place where she lived in the london that is also the wonderful place we went and saw that i was remembering sister nivedita then i thought this is that the topic that we are going to discuss to realize god renounce everything mentally so that but this lady she renounced everything externally and internally and she passed away in darjeeling and that was the villa that was given to her to leave and she used to look at the sunrise and all the time she used to remember that i should be like this she helped so many people in so many different ways she used to inspire the the writers the scientists the painters and the philosophers the patriarchs the students unthinkable this went on and on friends in page 642 we read bhagavan sirama krishna said the hindu religion alone is the sanatana dharma the hindu religion has always existed and will always exist we have already discussed what this bhagavan srirama krishna meant by the sanatana dharma but i like to read out a passage that wrote by arnold joseph tineby a british historian and from his words it will be more clear arnold twenty wrote it is already becoming clear that a chapter that has a western beginning will have to have an indian ending if it is not to end in the self-destruction of the human race at this supreme dangerous moment in human history the only way of salvation is the ancient hindu way here we have the attitude and spirit that can make it possible for the human race to grow together into a single family the beautifully the last words are beautiful is he mentioned grow together into a single family in the family all members are there the brothers different brothers of their different attitude different behavior but then the family they're all together this that same way the whole human community should grow and that is the only way we can survive and we must have to try for that in different parts of the world people are working good people are there they are all working different religious background different philosophy different culture but all they are trying to come together how by understanding others and helping others that is sanatana dharma this spirit of unity in diversity you unity in diversity not the diversity has to give up and all will become one not like that every diversity will be there like the five fingers in one hand different sizes but still this total five can become a palm so like that unity in diversity is very very important in the human society and particularly nowadays when the education has become so widespread and understanding of people knowing to each other becomes so easy now i am sitting over here in chicago talking and all over the world you can hear me see me so this is the time that we should eat and we should try to bring the whole human group in one place and that is called love love that will bind us we'll be as it is i like jesus i like the azrat muhammad i like the buddha i like jehovah i like the sri ramakrishna all that will be there but still we love each other how that secret we learn from bhagavan siram krishna because he lived that life he practiced different religions he lived and he propagated that that is called unity in diversity in one place he said i see rama god in all things i see god in all things this is the unique expression ultimate realization i see god only this image i see god only this theory i see god only in this building and this particular place in this particular symbol of course you can see that but that is a narrow view that's why swami vivekananda said we are developing we are growing not from the error to truth but from lower truth to higher truth and this lower truth is god can be in this book which i like i love i respect god can be in this building which i consider the holiest of the holy but at the same time god can be everywhere in everything and that sudama krishna termed it as a gyana and bigana this is the conception of the big ghana as sirama krishna almost like casually he said i see rama the god in all things in page 646 friends those who are following this gospel of sirama krishna by swami nikhila nandaji the 646 when mahima charon asked by what kind of work can one realize god then sirama krishna he answered it is not that god can be realized by this work and not by that the vision of god depends on his grace still a man can walk a little with longing for god in his heart if he has longing he will receive the grace of god the condition is longing what is this longing a tremendous love love for god and here by this way bhagavan srirama krishna is answering the question purusa kara and kripa always the debate goes if god is giving us the grace then why should i train let's try why should i work the unless the gods grace i am receiving nothing is going to happen the god is doing everything so naturally the question why should i try why should i work but suramar krishna is very clear you have to work you have to strive you have must try then only the kripa will come the self effort and the grace both are necessary to become successful suramar krishna gave the story that we read last time and beautifully he is mentioning a person he wanted to save the life of someone whom he loved so much but the doctor suggested well it needs a special type of thing what is that you know that in astrology and there's just a days to say and the shaati nakshatra this special nakshatra that means the star and it should rain when the star there in the sky at that time it should rain and when it is raining there should be human skull collecting the rain water then a frog and the snake is also necessary the snake should chase the frog and the frog will come at the last moment when the snake has given the bite the frog jump over that human skull and the venom comes out and fall into the water collected into that human skull can you imagine if if if so many but the man was so faithful and he was praying to god and he was going and sitting in a place where the cremation ground there's a possibility to find the human skull and he found it and look at it in the sky the swati the special star is also there and started raining drizzling and he was going on praying to god god so many things have come and lost two things a snake and a frog then he found his a frog is also coming chased by a snake and it should come to these and then everything he got and who took that collected that water and then gave it to the doctor so this is the way through the stories ramakrishna is telling if you truly love truly long truly real believe and pray then everything comes into this this is the way the life goes but friends at the same time we should remember sometimes someone they complain i was praying to god to save the life of my uh the close one the son or the husband or the father mother why the death came why god didn't listen to my prayer we all through our lives we we are the devotees of the god but each and every one as a lifespan and they go they come and they go accordingly this story through this story what happens sudama krishna is telling if you are longing for god and in this way there may be many impossibilities but you can overcome the impossibilities and you can get success that is the story it says do you remember that story of lord buddha when a mother she lost her son and the buddha was passing through that particular area she came running to buddha and said i know that you are a great soul you can do lot of miracle give back the my the life of my son you can imagine and buddha said mother i will do that but can you please bring a little mustard seed a handful of master seed from a house where death has never come she ran because she was thinking it is possible to collect she ran to every house knocked every door and said can you please give a little master seat but before that tell me has anyone passed away in your house yes yes yes yes every house said someone or other died passed away and that is inevitable then she came back and told lord buddha i have understood what you wanted to teach me the death is inevitable at different time different situation according to the one's own karmapala maybe the grandfather is so old people are thinking that he will die instead the young boy of that house so it happens and this is a very the wonderful way of the karmapala that goes on no one can answer to this so purusa kara is necessary to get the success in spiritual life and along with the purusakara the kripa the grace of god is also necessary but first is our tremendous the mental strength that i am going to realize god in this life i am going to be successful and that is called purusha kara swami vivekananda said atma biswas this atma vishwas i can do it is not ego it is the self-confidence atma bishop that is the way we can the 700 verse of the bhagavad-gita says that is my certain decision decision what is that where the first is yogesh krishna god is there and he's graceful at the same time part the one who is striving trying his best hard best to realize the truth this to come together success is sure in everything not only spiritual success in everything so this bhagavan suramar krishna is telling a man cannot cannot realize god until he renounces everything mentally 647 page then a shadow cannot lay things up he was telling for the monks they should not you know that in organization we have to keep some money in the bank we have to keep some food in the freeze but this is obvious but for the individual when wondering monk nothing so that that one should not misunderstand the way we are in an organization this is also necessary so this sometimes something literally they like to see in our life and then they misunderstand it is not possible it is not impossible in that way a man cannot realize god unless he renounces everything mentally renounces everything mentally though you are living in the palace but you know that this doesn't belong to me any day any time any moment i have to go away from here so this is the story that again and again it happened in andaman when it was very tough life but slowly slowly within the eight years by the grace of the divine mother and takur so a lot of money came and then everything was then the then prime minister of india atoll vihari bajpaiji he came to inaugurate then after our general secretary president president swamijin so he also went everything went very well very impressive and then the swamiji called me come we will have a cup of tea then i understood that something he is going to tell me then he said oh you are very successful you have made a beautiful astrum one of the best center of the ramakrishna mission and i am thinking that i should give you a bigger responsibility what do you think i told thinking no thinking is no question once the authority is asking then you have to obey you must obey and i told swamiji when should i have to leave all these years i was sitting on a wooden chair and that was a broken chair and recently one gentleman has given a wheelchair and padded wheelchair and the red color i liked it very much but i didn't open the plastic that covered shall i open the plastic and use it no no keep it for the next man that means within one or two days you have to leave so by that is the way the life should be i didn't open the chair i kept it there but my my next person and that is the way there and then and there you have to leave i am working i am collecting i am planning i am executing all this i am i am but afterwards when the moment the organization the authority comes and says enough moved to someone somewhere else our mind should be ready and that is exactly what bhagavan sirama krishna said a shadow cannot lay things up panchi or darvesh in in hindi they say darwesh means a monk panchi means a bird they don't keep things in a in the store whatever comes used at any time just leave that means no attachment no attachment with the worldly things this way the mind should be kept ready you are a householder now cerama krishna is telling to the mohimacharan therefore you should hold both to these and to that both to the world and to god as a householder he is telling you should not leave that was the wrong message that went at the time of buddhism and it says that there are four the truth what is that this world is miserable full of misery that's true we can understand those who have grown up from from our experience we know a little bit of joy and maximum the trouble so this goes the world is full of misery we can understand and second it has a reason because of karma third you can overcome it and the fourth the process is there to overcome these are the four arya that is the truth that is the buddhist the whole philosophy based on these four vidant also says same thing they say this world is nothing but illusory and it has a reason because it is your karmapala you want to suffer so you are suffering and you can overcome it and the process of overcoming the vedanta is way same thing the bhagavad-gita when these ideology you trash on those people who are not ready don't what happens they will not be able to practice this higher ideology rather they will show as if they are practicing and the whole religion the philosophy will go down and hypocrisy comes in the way of religion the practice this is the dangerous thing i should understand how far i can do otherwise i can climb a little but it doesn't mean i should go and start climbing the himalaya mount everest it is not possible it needs lot of training and experience so that i must understand just because i can climb a little i have little strength and physically well then i should start that no i should stan understand that so this is also same like this those who have understood this world is really fully full of misery for them these four areas are there not for all and not necessary so we have to understand that the wrong message and the whole the society thousands up to thousands they all started leaving the household and just grabbing a the gerua the saffron color and then started becoming a monk and the naan result the religion came down ideology came down practices became came down and there was a lot of adjustment and that ruined the whole philosophy so this is the way we have to understand and sudama krishna is that a very practical you're a householder and what is your sadharma what is your religion to look after both to look after the society look after the family and also take care because you have taken the oath you must have to but at the same time you should not forget the ultimate truth is god so ramakrishna is telling that you should this and that this means this world and that means this god how internally mentally psychologically i know this is not true but at the same time i can feel i cannot overcome this i cannot go beyond this i must have to practice but this is only intellectually i have understood reading vedanta or listening the talks of the swamis this world is a delusion an illusory and full of misery and i can feel yes in many times so many things i tried every time ultimately the result is the suffering so why not then try prepare my mind to go to the truth you have to give the time you have to give time to your mind to get the preparation so intellectually you know but in reality you have to practice that i am a responsible father a responsible husband and i have to take care of my family and at the same time the society everything so this is exactly what suramar krishna said sir can one who holds to that also hold to these is the ultimate truth is it is not possible where there is that god there cannot be any desire these are for the world because the world that is illusory that is the creation of god through his maya and the god himself it is true so muhimacharan as because he used to study the scripture he said from that point of view see he understood mahima charan but here suramar krishna who was perfect in giving the answer an immediate prompt answer now he is not giving that answer why he knew mohimacharan is speaking from quoting from a scripture only but what is the reality so he is telling a story or from his own experience he said one sitting on the bank of the ganges near the panchapati it is giving the description of the dakshinesha holding a rupee in one hand and the clay in the other i discriminated the roof is the clay and clay is verily the rupee and the rupees verily the clay and then threw rupee into the river both into the river that's a famous bengali quotation from sirama krishna rupee and the clay are both same but i was little frightened now here the salama krishna i was little frightened after trying that giving of that how foolish of me to offend the goddess of fortune i thought what shall i do if she doesn't provide me with food anymore then like hazra i sought help in a ruse i say to the goddess mother may you dwell in my heart that means the lakshmi that you should be in my heart then i should get the food and why he is telling this from his own to tell that it is not so easy to renounce and as because you have the responsibility suddenly if the householders they just leave like that what will happen to the family is it not and in in the meantime is he going to realize god just by leaving the family nothing like that it is not so easy because it is all the mind you have to feel that i am not blind by anything so sudama krishna has come to that but at this moment to give the answer to the mahima charan he said this is possible because you are renouncing at the same time the thought of your food will come when you are hungry oh i am going to sleep where i am going to stay where is my food clothing medicine it is not so easy just to simply close your eyes and meditate on god and if you are telling like that saying led like that it is a complete hypocrisy you cannot do that many of the people they do like that there will be if you go to different places the swami is sitting long beard what is your age oh maybe 300 years like that they will say and the simple-minded people they also accept it okay i don't eat anything i only the in the mother ear that is feeding me they'll be telling like that and simple-minded people they accept also but it is not possible that is the hypocrisy unnecessarily they're telling people like this it is not necessary religion means to become pure and what is that purity not accepting these worldly things as it is that is purity so sudama krishna will come to that and this is a unique way he will give the answer what he says and the omaha then he says if you are so pleased with me the one person is praying to the god once the divine mother was pleased with a man's austerity and said to him you may ask a favor of me o mother the person said if you are so pleased with me then grant that i may eat from a gold plate with my grandchildren now in one bone the man got everything grandchildren that means he is going to leave for a long time wealth and the gold plate so that everybody started laughing this is the answer don't be a hypocrite swami vivekananda said very clearly i can stand everything but hypocrisy friends in the religion hypocrisy is too much and that's why the modern people they are not believing in religion many people just to project that i am somebody have something he will close his eyes and then he will do these he will be looking at the sky as if talking with the god it is not it's not and that is the way we are losing faith on the religion religion means you must keep your oath i have taken this vow i am going to keep it that's all that is religion i have become a householder i am going to practice this thing or because i have taken the oath but in a very clear way i should odd i should look after the family i should look after the society i should do this the pancha maha yagya the householders are supposed to do they should do that mind is clear and at the same time inside they know whatever i am doing is not true it's not real it is all illusory but this moment i cannot understand i am thinking it is real to that much so that will be the way and the next that person will be completely separated and that is called purity purity means unselfishness and nothing else purity means not having any attachment to the worldly things it's so easy do you think it is so easy so naturally i should have to understand no still i have these these this krishna himself is telling it krishna is god is he thinking about his food no but he is telling the story to tell people it is not so easy to go beyond the body consciousness and as long as the body consciousness is there food is necessary clothing is necessary everything will be necessary so when can i say like this so hold both i am reading the holy book the what is the practices and the morning sri ramakrishna himself said you have to get up and the first thing we should do to look at god's picture god or goddess and pray to him or her then please now a new day in my life please be with me let everything be well prayed just remember then after the evolution sit for a little prayer then go for your work then in between remember a little read a few pages from a holy book again remember little the god and if you have taken the initiation try to repeat that holy name the guru has given and ultimately when you come back home tired just remember god whatever i have done i offer it to you the good bad i don't know i don't understand but i tried my best i tried not to forget you that will be sufficient by that way slowly slowly slowly when the time will come your time you will understand you are becoming separated from the worldly matters worldly things all the selfish things you won't like to listen even you don't like to read all those trashes and that will give you a satisfaction that you are becoming spiritual don't be hypocrite don't say this and that unnecessarily because by that way we are hypnotizing ourselves the one gentleman told swamiji i have realized brahman now what shall i do and brahman is the ultimate so he doesn't know what is brahman even then he is thinking he has realized brahman and he is telling everyone that i have realized brahman by that way he is making himself in the laughingstock but he doesn't know so it is not necessary perform your duty perfectly and in an unattached way that's all stealing when the mind is freed from lost and gold it can be directed to god and become absorbed in him see the mahima children asked him can one hold these the world and that the god this is the answer if your mind has completely withdrawn from any desire and to fulfill the desire the wealth nothing is there then it can be directed to god and become absorbed in him at that is the time that is the moment not before that it is bound alone who can be freed it is the bound alone who can be freed the one who is thinking that i am bound and then will get the freedom mano eva manusyanam this in the scripture it says mentally we think that we are bound oh we have these we have to do that so many things the moment you think that i am not you are completely free but again not with the hypocritical way but when really really i feel that all the bonds have gone then truly you will be free and what will happen to you the moment the mind turns away from god it is bound what is the bondage attachment to the worldly things craving for the worldly things love for the worldly things and when that has gone you are becoming divine but when the that is not there again to the world so two things are there god and god's creation and the god's creation in the bhagavad-gita two words they were used to what is the knowledge what is the knower who is this knower i know all these individual self and all these things that you see in the world i know that i am the knower and we who is telling this man the brahman so when we can understand that we understand everything so that's why bhagavan sinama krishna is telling when does the lower needle of the pier of a scale move away from the upper one when one pan is pressed down by the weight of last and looker it is the weight now god and mind it is he is giving an example of a scale and the needles are straight that means the god and the self the individual self are united the moment the desire comes desire of what these are worldly things name fame russia all those things all desires are coming the moment the desire comes immediately the one the skill is praised and the pan is praised and naturally the scales are also the needles are also separated why does a child cry on coming out of the mother's womb that sri ramakrishna is giving mahima charan saying you should renounce mentally to mahima suramar krishna not to mahima only to all the householders sirama krishna said you should renounce mentally leave the life of a householder in a spirit of detachment live the life of a householder in a spirit of detachment so that is the ultimate thing friends those who can become monk and true monks you know after becoming a monk and none then spending their time only loitering gossiping eating and somehow spending the life not like that each and every moment should be utilized for the betterment of your not only yours but also the world so that is called thinking the discrimination should be i am not i am not i am how you will know that the person will become completely free from ego he has the confidence she has the confidence self-confidence but free from ego and feeling for others love and concern for others some are very good monks and nuns they can give the clock talks and can mesmerize the people good thing but at the same time if they don't have the feeling for others it is of no use then masha'allah say it it is of no use then it is a dry knowledge like the professors and lecturers and they are all thinking giving that talk only to get the appreciation from the others worldly things apparently they are showing now i am completely free and i my door is closed this is also the subtle way of bondage so so many difficulties are there the gross way of the attachment to the worldly things and the very subtle way of attachment to the worldly things what is that name and fame clappings of the people appreciations of the world very very dangerous but the monks and nuns and for the renouncers and for the householders living in the house living in the family living in the society and saying hello hi to each and everyone but at the same time completely detached but not selfish you are becoming unselfish you have the love but at the same time that love is not binding you so this is the way one should the sannya seems hard they say in the scripture it should be softer than anything and when they the moment they hear about some pain somebody suffering they start crying one swami vivekananda true vedantin and he was giving the class badam the class to the brahmacarians and that time our girish chandra ghoshwas passing many of you know this incident and the swamiji he just to for the fun he said jeezy used to call him as jesus girish all through the life you have only acted as an actor and composed songs and dramas wrote the dramas but you have not read the vedanta oh your life is a west girish goes as good as goes immediately he replied to the narendra not not in i have not read vedanta but can you tell me whether your vedanta can wipe the tears of an widow or an orphan the people who are suffering without food can your vedanta give the martial a food like that he was narrating the the suffering side of the humanity and what happened swami vivekananda couldn't stand that when he was narrating only he stood up and ran to his room and closed it and when he was crying then girish goes turned to his disciples the young monastics and said do you know why i love your guru naren not for his vedantic knowledge but for his heart his feeling that is that way one should feel feel for others feel for others someone is going on talking they'll be calling one should go on listening to them with sympathetic mind and pray for them that is monastic life it's not so easy oh no no i i cannot talk i cannot mix i cannot do that not like that life is for others sacrifice for others but at the same time no judgment whether that person criticizes you or respect you doesn't matter at all any possible way to help swami sirama krishna he was requesting the ordinary people his own disciples for a job for narendra naat because the narendra's father passed away and from from the reaches they came down to the rags and there was no food even to eat the silama krishna was begging to each and everyone can you please help my noren noran himself felt unhappy he came and told sir why you were doing for me and what was his reply i can even beg door to door for you because i love you that is the love without attachment love for each and everyone any suffering one if we can't help them at least we can pray for them and we should not do anything to bring the misery to them so that is called religion friends we mix up all these things there's some of the the magics and some of the you know the power supernatural power and all those things come together no it's a beautiful growth a man is becoming god a person is becoming god how just by love and unselfishness pure love and pure unselfishness and how if you're a householder be a householder true householder and what is a true householder do everything but with the spirit of detachment that is exactly what he said to mahima you should renounce mentally live the life of your householder in a spirit of detachment mahima can a man live in the world if his mind is once directed to god mahima was trying to show that he is feeling to renounce etc but srama krishna knew it very well who is true and who is not when narendra he was searching for the job and sudama krsna's waiting then he came to know a rich man has given the offer if narendra married his daughter then he will say narendra to london to study the uh the study over the etc etc he knew that narendra is a born sannyasi but the situation is so maybe that the maya can bind so he ran to goddess the kali to pray mother don't bind him because he knew narendra nada his spirit was completely free he was not meant for his grihastha and he knew muhimacharan also he knew the muhima though talking about the vedanta and the renouncing and all that but his mind was not of a sannyasi so the both are equal but in their own position places and if we mix it up if a sannyasi becomes a man with a sannyasi mentality marry and become a householder will suffer all through his life because you don't like all those things that a person should love but a person who is having all those attachments if he takes the girl of his mom he will not only suffer but also bring down the ideology so that is the unique teaching of sudama krishna no ambiguity very clear and we should not think oh i have become a householder i cannot realize god nothing like that from that situation also only one thing don't be attached perform everything do everything apparently you are so much attached to that purchasing a house decorating a house purchasing a car enjoying but at the same time mentally you know it doesn't belong to me so with a detached can a man leave and salam krishna's answer why not where he go away from the world if a person try to go away from the world where he will go there the yoga bashist is quoting yoga sister i realized that wherever i live i am always in the ayadha of rama this suramar krishna is feeling his telling this whole world is rama's ayodhya after receiving instruction from his teacher rama said that he would renounce the word dasaratha sent the sage bashist to rama to dissuade him bashishta found him filled with intense renunciation he said to rama first of all reason with me rama then you may leave the world may i ask may ask you if this world is outside god this world outside god if that is so then you may give it up rama found that it is god alone who has become the universe and all its living being [Music] everything in the world appears real on account of god's reality behind it thereupon rama became silent so this is called bikyana in the terminology of krishna language of krishna and this is began and this is the highest position in the spirituality the highest situation in the spirituality the big jana swami vivekananda he wanted to meditate but suramar krishna said i will teach you higher than these why you should become selfish only closing your eyes and sitting and trying to manifest the god within your heart and enjoying that much hey that is called some people they are very much impressed if you are sitting and meditating because that is the normal way particularly in india they always think if the man is on constantly sitting meditating and all that like a very high spiritual person but spirituality is not that only closing the eyes and sitting it is the thought and the thought manifest through the behavior the personality changes completely and that is the love just now as we were discussing the love for each and every one oh this is my community they belong to my church so i love them that is not religion that is not spirituality they belong to my religion they belong to my linguistic group they belong to my country that also not the highest spirituality highest spirituality expressed long long before in the vedic time vasudeva kutumbakam what is this basudha vasudha means this whole world is the kutumba they are my very close relatives that is the feeling friends up to this today and see the unique way suramar krishna is teaching [Music] the when we are thinking this the world is bad in the beginning it is okay when you are beginning the life the spiritual life but then ultimately all that you see is nothing but the god and renouncing the living gods you are searching for god these feeling this realization the ultimate realization and in this modern time sirama krishna martial the vivekanda is giving us that and this is possible when we become pure completely pure and what is that purity again completely unselfish and completely love full of love completely unselfishness

away i am still surviving maybe that sometimes i feel pain but still surviving and everything life is going on and what is proof everything is individual baby dak moon that is the song yeah the next question is from sumit she is asking if i have craving for food would it be called as a desire hmm of course the craving for food is also that is the only weakness i'm having so anyway so a craving
