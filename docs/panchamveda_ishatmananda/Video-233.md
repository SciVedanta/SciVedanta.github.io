[234: Panchama Veda 234 : Samskara: Tendencies Of Previous Births](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adwiHoXkZrY)

let us begin Tabu khatam rhythm dr. G venom Kobi rhythm Cal mashup 'him Serena Mangalam srimad Artem Bovie green on te bhura dodging are in our last class we have discussed on passion and today our focus will be on another very interesting topic that is samskaara tendencies inherited from previous births it was October 11 1884 Raghavan Sri Ramakrishna was discussing about meditation he narrated the sits the cautious which are covering the real self so that is the we have already gone through that so you most of you know he was discussing how the how mind of the Yogi's steadily go upward from different seats on Nemea kosha kosha they that we underway at the gross body through mono Maya pranamaya with Gianna maya ananda maya he also mentioned the levels of the three bodies that is the stool asha reader sukshma sharir karan Ishida the gross body subtle body causal body and in the world cepsa de the finalists it goes to the and as Salam o Krishna stilling last of all the mind loses itself in the great cause in the great cause that is the the beginning and from there only every creation is coming we can call it Saguna brahma we can call it Ishwara from there only it begins it disappears it marches in the great cause what one can experience after that cannot be described in words in the Upanishads also we find again and again this experience of marching into the source cannot be described why because this is not objective anything that is objective anything that is outside anything that we can describe within the boundary of time space and causation that we can describe that you can say we can say something about that but here only only experience or see it is there I have seen it I have realized it that type of experience then we mention one can meditate even with his eyes open friends this is a another see Bhagavan see Ramakrishna when he is talking very casual but if you go deep into it it's a big philosophies that is exactly what Swami Vivekananda mention when he was talking with his brother disciples the every sentence are bhagavata-dharma krishna i can write a big philosophy on that the philosophy judy judy darshan like Ajay he said from the one sentence we can write the so many philosophies when he mentioned that this one it goes to the the cause the great cause and it never comes back it's not by reading the scripture but from his own experience he was the God himself so obviously he knew from where everything is beginning that is the beauty of it when you read every line of the gospel of ceramic isne you start feeling yeah this is truth it can be so then we no doubt about it and sometimes when we read the descriptions explanations of the great expound earth of the Vedanta we tease them are three theism people are confused sometimes they'll what is this what is that lot of explanations are necessary but when you read the gospel of the Ramakrishna if you have the background of little philosophy and of course the sociology and the situation than all that economy a little then you will be able to understand so wonderfully so that is the beauty of it he mentioned one can meditate even with his eyes open this is called karma yoga perfect Karma Yoga means meditation with eyes open Park Karma Yoga can you imagine shall we be waken under that when the ceramic is me was telling it is not Shiva Shiva is not daya compassion he was describing about the some of the points of the vegetables and there the daya the word daya is there and what is this daya compassion and sadhana Krishna said how can this be compassion is the saber you can only serve you cannot do anything else and from here the Karma Yoga Swami Vivekananda took it up and said oh my god if I get an opportunity I will explain it to everyone the when one reaches the perfection of bhakti-yoga Organo yoga one can perfectly practice karma yoga when you are talking about karma yoga guru yoga is this karma yoga just we go and give some food or clothes medicine and healthy person karma yoga no Karma Yoga means we see God in that person whom you are serving and how we can do that after the realization only it is possible of course we do everything as a practice those who are practicing the path of guiana know practicing only pata bhakti they go to temples and the churches synagogues devotionally practicing but true karma yogi guru guru yogi means this this that's well show me Vivekananda give distress on dear Shankar Acharya he stressed on the Gyana yoga Swami Vivekanand ceramic is mr. stern karma yoga and of course of opti and Jana and Jana but the Karma Yoga you have to develop that spirit that you can see God in every being that's why he is telling then one can meditate can imagine the word that he is using one can meditate even with his eyes open what is the purpose of meditation seeing God within seeing the soul of the self within and forgetting your own self that is the purpose of meditation concentrating your whole mind withdrawing your whole mind from all other objects and focusing on one particular thing that is meditation so obviously when he says with open eyes means what in other place he said if you can see God in images by closing your eyes can't you see God it open eyes again and again he is telling and this is the position I think Shankar Acharya said mentioned with the Jeevan Muktha condition they are completely free now a bhakta what is his goal he wants to seek God within his own self and after reaching over there after he written sees that is that the God is within his self within his the temple of his heart then he opens his eyes and sees the same God in everything in every beam he's in every form in every sound that that is the beauty in it's perfect stage doctor sees his beloved God in different forms the God a devotee worship in the temple meditate in the innermost heart manifest in different forms and things before the open eyes of the devotee and that is called karma yogi stand when a person is doing the Karma Shankar Acharya is arguing the Karma and gana cannot be mixed together the Karma only purify the mind some people the thing is a process for the purification of the mind the same when we are reading the scripture purifying the mind when you are worshiping the God purifying the mind when we are trying to meditate and withdrawing all our the senses from the sense objects purifying the mind but when the mind is purified and when you reaches to the ultimate the God you see as a bhakta as a devotee you see God in every being that is the stand of the karma and Raghavan see Ramakrishna said you can meditate with open eyes it is a perfected there in the Gani he sees he goes on negating negating negating not this not this not this these are all inner thing this is not consciousness this is not consciousness like that that is the process he goes and goes and ultimately when he reaches to that consciousness then he is so happy and then he open his eyes what he sees he sees the same consciousness in everything that is exactly what Raghavan see Ramakrishna is telling that when you are going up on the terrace on the roof of a house you are negating all the steps but this is not the roof this is not the roof this is not the roof and when you reaches the roof then you realize all the steps are made of the same stones and dust and cement and all bricks everything which is that roof is also made of this is the beauty this is called beyond industry Bunge there from the beach from the viewpoint as a big Johnny after the realization of that then only it is so Karma Yoga means ultimate realization and seeing God in everything then only the humbleness will come then only the love will come then only the service will automatically generate within you otherwise it's a practice we are doing so two viewpoints about the God the God as the ruler and God as the father we will discuss that the tutor question who is this tutor we have already read in the last day a tutor of the takers entered the room with some boys of the family the one line master ma che has mentioned the mostly as because the taker means the Ruben Jinnah Tigger's family and they were very rich they were landlords they were having two three ships in those days and that used to sell from Calcutta to London and London to Calcutta India so the bringing the different type of particularly the eyes this to take the jute and bring their eyes they were very rich and obviously this to keep the tutors teachers to train their voice instead of sending to the schools in those days school never developed in that way the small small schools were there so the homeschooling sort of thing so this tutor with some of the students their family boys they came to visit diction Asia and the tutor intogen to see Ramakrishna's room and saddam occasional noticed them and he is continuing the talk and here the tutor is conversing with Raghavan ceramic isne a tutor said sir that when C Ramakrishna is telling one can meditate even with eyes open that is giving as his own immediately an example he said one can meditate even while talking take the case of a man with to take when you are talking when you walk working every time you can remember then he give the example of a toothache when that pain is there if all the time feel the pain after all the time working also the tutor then commented yes sir I know that very well that means he had the experience of the toothache all laughed the master smiling yes even when his teeth ache he does all his duties but his mind is on the pain likewise one can meditate with eyes open and while talking to others as well now the tutor this gentleman now he is mentioning a hastily one of the aspect of God is Redeemer of the sinner that is the hope God is compassionate now this is the concept in those days naturally in all over India the British were there and the Christian ideology was very common the people is to know particularly educated people is to know about it and they he mentioned about the Redeemer of the scene and the compassion etc he mentioned cinema Krishna it is of course it is there in all religion they say God is compassionate he is all powerful all merciful etc but they look at the view of the ceramic kitchen that's why I was mentioning the God as a ruler and God as father when the God is a ruler then obviously I'm afraid then even notice that mostly they will say if you every person is a devotee then they will say he's a god-fearing person god-fearing but you ll say why it should be God loving the why should why should he be afraid of God it should be God loving the afraid of God is not a good thing we should be loving God how it is then he is telling like this God sadhana Krishna is telling the sheiks to said that God was compassionate sheikhs means a group of people this to live nearby in the dictionary and the ceramic isne is mentioning about them God was compassionate I asked how is he compassionate why they answered he has begotten us he has created so many things for us he has brought us up to be main and he protects us from danger at every step thereupon I said after be getting us God looks after us and feeds us is there much crediting that suppose a son is born to you do you expect a man from another part of the city to bring him up this is the view I was mentioning God father God has given me birth God has created me and God has given everything for me this is nothing special every father is doing any brothers should do supposed to do the parents are taking the care of the children where is the problem so that is exactly what is happening over here so this ceramic ISNA is telling this is the two viewpoints one is afraid of God and when we are afraid of God we always say thank you sir thank you sir but the son will never and not at least all the time thanking the Father for every gift every food every drink everything that the father is providing for the son it is natural so our attitude to God should be like that God is our clothes if we do something some mistake we should go to God and say I'm sorry a guard guard sorry father I did this mistake I will try to overcome it please help me to so that is the way that conversation that the devotion should be there the otherwise it becomes afraid the people those who are working under God is servants then that is a different thing that this day they also are praying to God but they are afraid this is what is happening and now here cinema Krishna is telling the tutors then giving this question this is very important then tutor he's telling review sir one man quickly succeeds in spiritual life and another doesn't succeed at all how do you explain that there is a question that the tutor is asking the why it is happening one man quickly succeed in spiritual life and another doesn't succeed at all how do you explain that master the truth is that a man succeeds to a great extent because of the tendencies inherited from his previous births try to understand this very clearly so this is a very difficult philosophy the reincarnation theory and the karma theory based on which our Hinduism Jainism Buddhism and many other they they we find that they are having this so we will try to understand this here we find the one gentleman I was reading his the article k RK multi in his article is there life after death he mentioned reincarnation is an ancient belief that the soul survives and returns to the art in another forms after the death of the body he has listed that people of Philippines Central Asia Siberia Australia Africa Aztecs and incres all believed in life after death the mostly credit tribal people they believed because the they loved nature they worshipped nature so believed in the life after death the kills of ancient england and ireland a goal of the france believed in the doctrine of immortality Mesopotamians believed that the status of the date in the other world depends on their deeds in earlier life friends why i mentioning from his article because not only the hindus almost all the tribal people and shared people the or believed in the death and afterlife and Mesopotamians there's a the very advanced civilization and they believe that the afterlife the position of the Dead will be afterlife will be according to their karma Raghavan cinema Krishna mentioned over here he succeed to a great extent because tendencies inherited from his previous births the same way we find in the mesopotamias let us say that Greek philosopher and the Socrates he preached a mortality of the soul and a Plato he believed that human spirit goes through nine cycles of birth and the same way the Judaism he believed in the physical resurrection of the Dead and immortality of the soul our on the basis of the zu diesem from there we can say the Christianity then Islam has come that they believed that the physical resurrection there is a difference between the Hindus the spirit we believe and they think that the belief in the physical resurrection in the Christianity Jesus was crucified but he physically resurrected and he went away so that is a great day for them and there is a very great function on from the basis of that only Christianity has come the physical resurrection that's why they won't burn the dead body they will bury the dead body and it nicely they will keep it so that when the God will give the call they can go and face him talk to him etc in the Torah he said give the sinner a fresh start to purify his soul by acquiring merits that is the belief but what I like to bring home they were here that each and every one is believing all the faiths are believing the old traditional local tribal faiths they're also believing and the organized the religions they're also believing so this is very very important and on the basis of this drama Vivekananda said you are the maker of your own destiny what I am today that depends on this I think I was telling in some of our discourses that our subtle body suksham our dealer and the sukshma sharir there it all occurs and then when we take the bird that is the cause we choose the beauty of our body environment where I should be I should be born and everything in the Torah it is said give the sinner a fresh start to purify his soul by acquiring merits Taoism believe there is a continuity without a starting point and then he says birth is not a beginning and death is not the end it believes in the continuity join ISM believe that salvation is possible by freeing the soul from the matter freeing the soul from the matter is only the expression but in reality the matter means all the five objects so obviously if all my senses goes out five sense organs are there it goes out and enjoy the five sense objects and when the five sense objects are they are acquiring and bringing back to the senses then what is happening naturally it is the desire and the different the desire our mind goes Jainism believed that rip Jenny symbolism Hinduism is from the same stock there obviously they believe in that we believe that salvation is possible by freeing the soul from the matter they believe in the concept of Karma now what is this Karma and when we mentioned about karma and only a few minutes before when I was talking about the Karma Yoga is an even and L difference the Karma means the action then when I am doing the work if I'm having the desire that grinds and desire goes on producing another desire it has no end so it goes on creating creating and creating then no question of salvation when we start thinking all these objects are not going to give me any joy and my I would draw all my senses and they stick my mind and I go back to the source that is called karma yoga but win the karma bandhana so that is the desire and that takes to our objects so this is what we should understand the journeys and believe in that a salvation is possible by freeing the soul from the matter and what is Buddhism is also believe in the concept of karma new birth takes place according to one's karma and the action in the previous parts and in the Hinduism Raghavan C Ramakrishna is mentioning about it and we find over here according to punch Adashi the 17 principles including the consciousness which is the substratum of all the minds projections then the subtle body five sense organs five organs of action vital breeds mind and intellect and the soul the soul miss jivatma desculpe cheetah a Varsha the reflection of the original consciousness on our intellect just called cheetah Varsha she'd means consciousness Hacha reflection which is present in all the 17 principles are derived from the term the self Jeeva this cell transmigrate from body to body according to one's karma so again and again we go back to our own karma so if the karma is good and surely we are going to get the good result and if the karma is bad we are surely going to get the bad result the substratum the consciousness the circle body the soul do not suffer from button death his assumption of suitable body is regarded as birth and it's discarding the body is regarded as death look at it the sentence is the adi shankaracharya I mean one of his article jagadguru shankaracharya swami a Krishna Buddha Shariati maraj he mentioned it I am reading from his article and he mentioned him in this way that the soul that self when he is accepting a body it is a birth when he is discarding the body it is the death who is the master that so the self the Jeeva that sukshma sharir which is having 17 the different the parts the 17 principles that we just least yeah that is why in the bhagavad-gita the second chapter twenty second verse he says Bashan GG Narni yatabe higher no burning naughty nirupa Rani Tatar irani Bihar Jaden Arnie onion is a yachty neva needy he just like the human being discard the old clothes and where's the new clothes the self relinquishes the old body and has used a new body when we remember these do you feel fear about death is only a change and nothing else we are not going suppose we are from India we are coming to America a little bit of anxiety is a new place new people new environment what will happen that much it is there but when you go to America we find again so many friends and the very good enjoyable situation we enjoy we don't like to go back from here it's same like that the bartend it means it is the soul which is choosing it so it says that bar sharm cg narnia Taavi hi this is nicely explained over here there is a principle different from body vital force sense organs which transmigrates from body to body and has birth and birth prince we should remember the real self is not changing at all it is unchanged we should not mix up this that's why I am Telling again the original self is like the Sun that has nothing to do with anything it is giving the light reflection of the Sun on the waves on the water that is a different thing and that reflections the reflected Sun on the waves with exactly like our that consciousness reflecting on our intellect and the intellect again associated with all these total seventeen as we listed over there five organs of action five organs of knowledge then five vital forces etc so this total seventeen when it comes is called sukshma sharir as a jivatma we are talking about that jivatma though it is a reflection but it is a reflection of the consciousness on the intellect the Budi obviously it can take the the what's called that decision so obviously this birth and death and here again i was reading in the Shankara he is telling Shekar Acharya Koshu Tiki brahmana Upanishad it says on their way to the other world after the death what happens on their way to the other world after death people reach the moon if the souls are eligible to take birth soon they come back to the art is the coach to take you Punisher it says after the death they go to the moon but not immediately immediately after the death it is only mind we have to remember it is only mine mine means desired that are we don't like to leave this body because we have loved this you know sometimes people they don't like to leave their old house there's so many traditions that their grandfather was there and the grandfather's father he built that and so obviously not surely all those they go on remembering you don't like today discard that old building when this old building is not discarded the city will be there but then after some time they will think it is ok let us go back and then they leave that Sokoudjou Tiki Brom Upanishad it says on their way to the other world after death people reach the moon and after reaching the moon if the desire to go back to the life again are very strong then they go back otherwise sometimes than there oh it is enough so like the people after the work they go back for vacation and when they go for the vacation then they are waiting over there other extend the vacation for some time same way some people when they're dead they go to the moon and after reaching the moon they are sitting over there for some time or didn't know it is enough now let us go back once again so this mentioning that they come back if the souls are eligible to take birth soon they come back to the art through the rains and reach the bodies which are suitable for their karma and other Upanishads also mentioned they take actually they go that particular soul through the food and water entered into the body of the person and then the birth takes place but he chooses that particular soul that chooses that particular food he knows their soul knows is going to eat by that particular person in that family can you imagine the everything is nothing but our own creation and how you're creating karma fala not that Dean and there we are taking the decision or not this man that particular no he's according to the Karma follow year bound to go over there we we have the right to do the Karma in our own way but after that the result will take his own course the somebody has killed someone now the police arrested him up to whether I will kill or not it was his free decision but when he is arrested the law will take its own course the similar way whatever action we do over here while leaving after that it will take their own course so come back to the art and did reach there that is the Karma they take birth mainly as maybe the worm insect bird lion human being God or celestial the dowel this thing it goes on like this so this is the way all things goes friends this is really very interesting topic Raghavan see Ramakrishna raised today and in a small way we can discuss now let us go back to the original the discussion people think he has attained the goal all of a sudden a man drank a glass of wine in the morning the salawa krishna immediately he will give some example and there's a beautiful example now he is giving and as because a person is doing a small little work getting a big result that is mentioning through this example people think he has attained the goal all of a sudden no a man drunk a glass of wine in the morning it made him completely drunk he began to behave improperly people were amazed to see that he could do so so drunk after only one glass but another man said why he has been drinking all night those who observed him they found that only one glass he has drunk in the morning so they could see but actually his carnal fella all his reserved thing was there that so as Ramakrishna said all whole all night he was drinking you only saw that he drank only one glass now in the morning and one glass the effect should not be that much the people was wondering the same way the karma fella suddenly we see the one person he was just a simple ordinary suddenly he becomes someone and naturally the people they wonder how it is possible he was having all the work or the good or bad that if it comes at that moment at that time the this is what see Ramakrishna said the honeymoon burned down the golden city of Lanka people were amazed that a mere monkey could burn the whole city but then the seed the truth is that the city was burned by the sigh of Sita and the worth of Rama and you know that fortune teller so seanny there was a lady the very famous that scar sana at Bachchan Bachchan means she caught coated the if this is this then the result will be like this if this is the result will be like this he said if you find that it is the fire that is burning and the people are suffering and then the flood is coming and creating havoc in the country then if the that diseases are coming and the millions are dying know for sure that the ruler has committed some scene with the rulers are committing sins and there's old people this suffer there is Shannon Bachchan they say in that way so it is the karma and the result of course the only the ruler who chose the ruler that we choose that ruler we liked him so obviously now that his own thing on his behavior will they affect the other all people will be some had that effect so karma and its result that is what exactly now we are discussing look at Lala Babu there's a gentleman Lala but we will known landlord a Bengal who renounced the world at an early age and lived in Mathura and also a bridge as a bush neva monk there's a famous story of Lala Babu in Bengal he was very rich but suddenly he heard one lady she is asking her daughter to burn the bar sana the boss enemies dried the dry leaves in the in the colloquial term bhishambar Sharna is the dry leaves particularly plantain leaves are called boss Ana's and the lady and she has to warm the water or something she called out to her daughter now it is becoming the Dirk the night is falling you burn the boss Ana's the boss on as the term she used that we and the that landlord was passing he heard it and the boss honest she meant dry leave but this man thought or desires immediately that knowledge dawn and he said oh my god I'm becoming old then what to do now I should leave the heart and home and concentrate my mind meditate on God the dinner dear from there itself he left there is a very famous story so cinema Krishna mentioning about that Lala Babu she had so much wealth could he have renounced it all suddenly without the good tendencies of the previous birth Salaam o Krishna quoting the unless and until you are having the from the previous birth these tendencies you cannot do anything so Lala Babu left that wealth huge wealth just in one blink he heard the world immediately he decided I have to burn my desires because it is the desire that binds and immediately he left everything and went away ceramic is no say it is not that particular word that encouraged him and they didn't and there he took the decision actually his previa in his previous birth he prepared himself to renounce and that was only to ignite so that is way it goes every time so in his last birth a man is endowed with satra his mind is directed to God he longs for God he withdraws his mind from worldly things Krishna Krishna - Paul came here I found him full of Rajas but it must be said that he observed the Hindu customs he left his shoes outside before entering the room after a little conversation I discovered that she had no staff inside I asked him about man's duty he said to do good to the world I said My dear sir who are you what good will you do to the world is the world such a small thing that you think you can help it see the another very important statements Ramakrishna's telling maturity of the people the thing that we should do good to the world and they think that they will take their their plans will change the whole world each and every one you talk to the philosophers you talk to the economists you talk to the politicians each and every one and they are thinking I can change the world I can change the world but in reality no we cannot all these people that we are here in this earth in different parts of the world all of us including the animals the birds and reptiles the insects now after this discussion I think now we know each and every one of us including the trees because of our past karma pala and sometimes it is individual karma that is giving me the effect good and bad and sometimes it is the collective karma is giving the effect of good and bad there's sometimes some people die hard a lunatic a young boy lost his brain is a lunatic he was roaming around then a group of people just for the fun of it they started beating him and he was crying he was trying to save himself he was running here and there and then the new people are also coming they were beating beating all around people they are laughing they were thinking it is a just a game then they beat him so much he passed away now all the people around they're looking at it they didn't call the police and the young men of those streets their thing it is a fun the poor person could not resist himself and so didn't you think that all the people around there those who are doing directly of course they will have the bad karma fella they will also suffer but those who are observing that and enjoying they will also suffer so this is the aphid day complete the accumulative effect is really really very difficult we do not believe that's why the morality in all societies they always try to teach the morality why morality not that I am helping others I'm helping myself xiaomi Vivekananda is asking why should I be moral because being moral I am helping myself you know sometimes just I'm thinking this group of people will be good and India's support I go I'm telling the false thing but I go on try to convince other people no this is good all false propaganda and I support that I'm not doing directly I'm just participating and supporting forwarding nowadays it has become so easy that also creates the bad karma voila the French we should be very very careful about the Karma voila what is this karma there enough physically we do mentally we do and through the words we do the one should be very careful when we are talking about others and circulating some gossips about others apparently that is nothing apparently just the fun sometimes the we mental girls just gossiping about another lady but they don't understand the other lady is suffering because of that the just gossip just fun every society every time you go to see the movie you go to your own family you see in the round these things are happening like that people are discussing about their so one has to be very very careful sometimes I say that God is Kali she's biting the tongue why you know no I should not say anything which about which I am not convinced about which I do not know I should not say anything like that many of you know many of you remember what happened when the Duryodhana Phil because he was thinking that there is a water and the Draupadi she laughed insulting that man and from there the whole thing took turn and duryodhana became very angry the whole mahabharata war because of there should be very careful the Karma voila it's so subtle and that is the reason all the monks they will be constantly tailing before you start the work you should pray to God and you should say I'm going to do this work everyone should do this go to the god you believe pray to him so I am going to do this Oh God if you think that this is going to be beneficial for everyone then make me successful and if you think that it is not going to be good for others then let me not be successful in that work God will guide for every little thing we should depend on that there is someone who is there guiding us Bhagwan see Ramakrishna I concluded this Raghavan see Ramakrishna was narrating this and then the one devotee said oh my god if everything is directed by the karma fella that I have already done in my previous birth that what I should do now and there's no way no it is that today we were having a parliament to religion discussion and everywhere people are dying crying no food the same story everywhere all over the world then one of the members he/she suggested we all know the sad stories let us think about something in a positive way the tick's will pass in history the difficult days that come difficult times have come millions have died but again the new life the new everything came so think about that after the darkness the Sun will rise the same way what about the past karma we have done forget about it forget about the darkness think about the Sun that is to rise and that son will be your good karma all the good deeds that we do all the good thought that we think every morning if we get up immediately after the sleep if we get up and sit and pray service started - guru Ghani sorry bovid rani posture - service at buddha map no - sorry bizarre but redundant to the wonderful prayer let everybody be happy healthy positive and late one and all everywhere every nook and corner of the world happy so that way I am also making myself happy healthy so that is only positive way that is called the good karma I am thinking and also restrain myself consciously that I am NOT going to do any harm to anyone by spreading the wrong information maybe it is political or maybe it is just a fun a social some fun no I am NOT going to take part in that one should be careful because wants own karma fella that will determine is the next birth don't care about the death it is nothing we are going to born a game but that birth which we are going to take should be in a very high condition so that at least in if not in this life from that particular next life we will realize our own self we will see our own God
