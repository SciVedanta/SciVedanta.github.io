[294. Panchama Veda 294 - “I Incarnate Myself In Every Age”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3U_BfIscdTQ)

namaskar dear devotees and friends the wednesday evening this is our time to read and discuss the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavatam [Music] we were reading from the chapter the master and narendra is the english page number 719 719 sri ramakrishna sat with the devotees on the mat on the floor she was smiling he said to the devotees please stroke my feet gently this is very special you know salaam krishna never asked in a very special occasions only when why he asked the devotees particularly the young boys they were sitting over there so he asked them to stroke his feet gently why he will explain they carried out his request he said to him the master masha there is great significance in this placing his hand on his heart the master said if there is anything here then through this service the ignorance and illusion of the devotees will be completely destroyed so that is the reason he was taking his personal service he was asking the devotees to do that only to bless them to grace them and he said if there is anything here then through this service the ignorance and illusion what is the ignorance agayana you know that in hinduism this is called agyana the ignorance that is i am associated with this body and naturally this i this me and mine that goes out and try to get joy from all the objects of this world and why i can't see the truth that is because of the illusion illusion of the power of maya so ignorance and illusion my ignorance that i don't understand i am the divinity myself i am not this body i am not this the the bones and the marrows and the blood and all those shots of things that's called the body i am not that i am that eternal purity i am that love i am the joy people don't understand that they get associated with this body and with that they go on doing so many things why because of the illusion they don't see the right thing rather because of the power of the maya as the vedantin they say the actual right thing is covered and superimposed by something else so that is the reason but if we are serving a great personality spiritual personality then that can go away that is the reason bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning then he said putting the hand on his chest that if there is any there is anything here we will listen to him what is there in the person of sirama krishna who is sadama krishna but before that we will go to that nabodha bhakti in the devotional book they say by nine way you can develop your devotion what are those shrabana by hearing hearing the words of the lord again and again and again and slowly slowly you can develop the devotion for the supreme lord srabana by hearing kirtana then going on talking about him singing about him reciting about him remembering him kirtana with great joy i'm taking the name of god with great joy that is called kirtana then it's marana srabana first day hard then i became very happy with that then i go out and tell my known people friends and relatives have you heard about this it's a beautiful thing that i have heard from there so fast i hear then i become happy i feel attracted to god then i go out and go on telling about that to the other people that is called the kirtana then smarana then instead of going out and telling people and talking i go inside the mind and go on thinking about it and when i'm thinking smaranas marana means thinking remembering pondering then i get great joy what is the attraction the joy when i heard about god what attracted me when i say many people millions they'll be reading the gospel of sirama krishna so many times they have but every time anywhere any monk they are reading and explaining all these devotees they will be listening why the srabana that is also the joy and that joy they like to have and that is strabana and then after that when they talk to the friends they talk about that the kiritana then slowly slowly they become more more mature they don't don't listen or talk they only ponder over that they remember that and that gives them the great joy then the fourth comes pada savanam father savannah father means the feet and they are going and serving that means if you can serve physically you know that sometimes if you go and you'll see the devotees are bathing the god and the great the yatra day that's a special day that is the special day that lord jagannath they he'll they will be pouring the water and they'll be bathing him and the many of the the temples if they have the deity they perform that that they will be pouring the water and the bathing that is also sheba then they will cook for the god and they'll offer it they will purchase clothings and then offer it they will go and sometimes they will go even the god the picture or maybe the stone image they will go and touch and slowly slowly they will try to serve and in the if you go to the north india whenever they meet a monk they will press a little the feet of that monk that is father's evanna i am bowing down i am humble i am surrendering at your feet that is called pada savannah and by that one can develop the devotion the father's even lord bhagavan sirama krishna himself today asking those devotees who are there to serve him the moment you are touching that holy man the moment you are serving him the moment he is feeling happy all your ignorance attachment with the body and your ego the all will go away because of the touch that is the devotion archanam they will be offering the puja and all those that is called archana bandhana bandhan means again singing praising darsha very humble shakya very close to god i talked to god i you know keeping god in confidence you know i did it today and i'm going to plan planning this way they'll be talking with the god and that is also the shakya shakka means a friendly way as a friend he's always sharing many things with his friend that way the devotee will share his thought with the god then finally comes then there is no ego at all i am yours the vedantin will say i am that the i am that supreme consciousness and the devotee will say i am god's i don't have anything in me he sees that god within him whatever he is talking as if god is speaking whatever he is thinking whatever he is doing everything is nothing but god yet karushi yadasi then whatever you do give it to me and you'll be free so vedanam dedicate yourself at the feet of god god everything is yours all the money all everything i don't have anything except this body and mind which i think it is mine though wrongly even then whatever i think it is mine i now offer it at your feet when i first came to join as a monastic member of this great order ramakrishna mission the senior swamiji under whom i joined this order he said what you are going to offer to god today that was the ramakrishnas the celebration birthday puja celebration i told because i was not very young so i was wondering what to say i told uh i don't have anything maybe i will pluck a few flowers and give oh no that is from the astra garden you are plucking what is yours ah i don't know because i have al left everything that i've come that is your body and mind and ego your thought everything you go and prostrate before the god and say god this we are what i am having i give it to you so by that way you lie down at the feet of god and give yourself to god that is called atmo of course externally internally never thinking that i so that's why bhagavan suramar krishna we notice that he didn't say if i am having something he didn't say that he placed his hand on his chest then he said if there is anything here so there is no i conception that is the uniqueness now we will listen to that master masha is writing suddenly sri ramakrishna became serious as if about to reveal a secret master to aim master suramar krishna to there is no outsider here why he was he was telling like this because the suddenly some people without knowing the background if they listen to this they may feel oh this is the proudness that he is expressing that's why he was careful that outsiders are not there that means some people who know him all those close devotees regularly visiting talking with him spending time and listening listen to him so they know about him so now he is telling to them the other day when harish was with me i was i saw shachidananda came out of this sith satchida ananda came out that means it is the brahmana that came out in a form human form satchit ananda that is the epithet of the brahman it is very difficult to explain or give any definition of the brahman but the rishis those who realized they could feel that is existence knowledge and bliss these are the three things there and that is why they proved that because of the existence source is existence we also like to exist we don't like to die and because the source is knowledge we like to know many things and because the source is the bliss we also want happiness joy pleasure so this is the reason sat cheat ananda existence knowledge and beliefs and they say it came out as if in a form it took a form it said i incarnate myself in every age that satcheed ananda that brahman it took the form came out and declared that i become the incarnation i thought that i myself was saying these these words out of mere fancy i kept quiet and watched the something came out from the person of bhagavan sinama krishna and that is sachidananda sarupa the brahman it declared the i that supreme consciousness i take the form and i become incarnate at different time and different places suramar krishna first thought is this my imagination then he was watching it came out of him so he was watching suramar krishna was watching quietly again saccidananda itself spoke and saying caitanya too worshipped shakti as because bhagavan sirama krishna worshiped shakti mahakali induction asia he was in dakshinesha so naturally he was thinking if it is the brahman then why we should worship the shakti then to refer that caitanya who was almost 400 450 years before sirama krishna taking his name that who took the form the caitanya sachitananda said that the devas devotees listen to these words in amazement some wondered whether god himself was seated before them in the form of sri ramakrishna this psalm wondered is one of them is master marshay the master mashay he could feel that the god himself taking the form of bhagavan si ramakrishna sitting before him the master paused a moment then he said addressing him i saw that it is the fullest manifestation of saccidananda it's not the part amsa no sirama krishna is the fullest manifestation but this time the divine power is manifested through the glory of sattva bhagavan sramaki krishna himself just before his death his beloved disciple swami vivekananda he was thinking this moment when a man is dying if he can say that he is god then i will believe he was just thinking immediately sudama krishna who could read their minds immediately replied oh not in not addressing others very particularly to swami vivekananda that didn't narin o naren he who was rama he who was krishna now at present in this body that is sirama krishna but here he said in the swathwa you know the sattva rajyathama in the quality in the sattva they can't work they're full of love and unselfishness but to work to command to ask people you need little rajah and that is completely absent and forget about tama no tama and all those bad qualities it was not there in sudamaki at all and even that little ego who will say i am asking you to do it go and do it no that is absent so pure sattva and pure satya cannot work the pure gold with the pure gold you cannot make any the jewelry you have to add something with that then only it is possible it's a pure gold so he said this time it is the sattva why this time because at the time of sri ramachandra he took up the bow and arrow fought with ravana so that raja was there at the time of sri krishna raja was there but at the same because he was working though detached but still performing and this time in surama krishna it is only love it is only unselfishness that manifested in his words in his work all through his life so this is ramakrishna is mentioning you know in the bhagava bhagavatam the other day i was reading it says at the first skanda the third chapter the first verse is mentioned jagrihai that means he is creating how desirous of creating the universe desirous of see sriksha he thought that he will create let there be light and there was light sometimes we read in the bible just thinking and there it is there the all-powerful god whatever he thinks immediately it happens so sis desire of creating the universe the omnipotent and omniscient lord assumed by his creative will his own this the in his own power what he did a cosmic form biraat he became that is the birat is a term in the sanskrit that is where cosmic form it took not again manifested in a subtle way the 16 the creative categories like the mahat tattwa the cosmic mind total mind the cosmic mind that is called mohat tattwa mahatma is great tattwa means the truth what is that great truth the total mind if the mind is not there the thought is not there the activity won't be there so fast is the thought the mind who crea of his own power why he is creating he just wished to create that he wanted so that much we cannot go and ask why you have wanted it no that is completely blasphemy it is not possible and then ahamkara came what is that arm god the ego the i sense that everyone is having i i i me and mine this is mine that is yours this is the ego i am an educated person i am a great rich person i am this i am that this is the ego where from came from god itself he created that otherwise there won't be any program there for function activities so he is creating that also and the rest that is all other things in the subtle way he first created the birarder the cosmic thing everything and then slowly the sixteen creative categories like the mahat and the the cosmic mind and so on and then the ahamkara and the rest then the supreme lord described his 23 abu tahara forms this is in the bhagavata in the beginning the first skanda and the third chapter and from the one he goes on telling up to the 24 25th the slokas the verses giving the description of 23 times in different forms he became the incarnation of taran he came down out of his own will not like us we are taking birth because of our karma because of our desire and according to our desire we are then in this if you if you read that bhagavata this part you will find that all each and every one he created and four different types of beings are there so that he created then he entered into them that means he reflected the consciousness in each and every one and they enjoyed all the objects objects were also his creation then the subject the person he will go and enjoy that also his creation then he is the whole universe why he created like this so many because just to enjoy but he is not in it that is the unique thing how it is possible then the ibadan then will tell why you are also creating the world in your dream when you are dreaming you are also creating the so many things whatever you want you create whatever the impression is there in your mind that through that you are creating you that is the wonderful creation that you are the creator in your dream sometimes you enjoy sometimes you don't that is your because it is your creation god also created like that but in our dream when we create we get involved into it we cannot separate ourselves but here the uniqueness the god creates and then he separates himself and through his own power that is maya that works so this is the way and bhagavan siddharma krishna is the creator he created this whole universe but this time he said i manifested myself but it is the pure sattva that's why i am working through two other people that is swami vivekananda and maha sharadamani devi mainly you know he gave his rosary to maha sharadamani devi and mashara damani devi was his wife but even then their relation was completely divine and after the worshipping that mother the shorushi puja then he offered the rosary that offered his salutation pranam to mother and as he gave the god gave all power to her and pray to the almighty god as if externally give heart the purity what is the purity unselfishness and love through that she will help others to understand the truth so that they go out of this miracle that is going on again and again constantly so many just like the functions going on we are into that and we are thinking this is the original thing and so we are sometimes enjoying sometimes suffering go beyond that who will help mother and again he gave the power to that young boy his disciple swami vivekananda for another group of people so these two that's why in ramakrishna mission where you come you'll find bhagavan's ramakrishna in the middle left hand side his shakti masada mani devi and right hand side another swami vivekananda three together always is that complete god who came in the form of bhagavan sirama krishna to help us to go out of his own maya of his own bondage he came to help us and then he gave all this through his talk and that was recorded by one of his the householder devotee mahindra nada and presented and now we are reading that understanding the truth slowly and developing the devotion so this is how sirama krishna speaks the master to him just now i was saying to the mother think of it he was talking with the divine mother that divine power suramar krishna has taken the human form but at the same time he is as if connected with that supreme being whom he called as mother he said whom you call brahman the consciousness i call mother so he said over here just now i was saying to the mother i cannot talk much i also said to her may people's inner consciousness be awakened by only one touch friends those who were you know the biography of bhagavan si this prayer and the way that he did in the 1st january 1886 we are reading the february 1885 exactly one year afterwards the 1st january 1886 suramar krishna touched just prayed he didn't touch other people came and touched these holy feet and immediately whatever was there within their mind all the prayers and wishes the dreams everything was fulfilled the great power that really came and generated over here that is bhagavan sri ramakrishna this sudama krishna here he is mentioning one year before to one of his disciples which he recorded he is mentioning just now i was saying to the mother i cannot talk much i also said to her many people's inner consciousness be awakened by only one touch you see such is the power of yoga maya yoga maya it is binding and it can also lift the bondage and immediately you are free what is the freedom and bondage the notion when we are thinking that we are humble human being i have a name i have before i have a family i have a society i have a religion i have a language then you are becoming a small and within the cocoon that you made you live into that and that is the bondage and over there again and again every time you are taking the form may be different form and different times you are either suffering or enjoying a little again it going it's going on then a time comes because of the repetition repetition repetition then you feel oh it is enough that one of the direct disciples of bhagavan sirama krishna the raja maharaja swami brahmanandaji he mentioned like this see the repetition repetition repetition and then a time comes when people understand no enough is enough now i must go and get myself free from all this and that is called mumuksuta the desire to be free that is mokshuta and when we get that the desire then we must be sincere and try our best how just by repeating the name of god the more we are repeating as i was mentioning archanam bandhanam dasya shakyam atmoni vedanam the nine different ways are there all or one or two if we apply slowly our mind is also become completely pure it is already pure only thing some dust are there we have to clean those dots that is desired gospel of sriram krishna that is why we always listen to that ponder of our dad meditate on that and sudama krishna is mentioning that by his touch it will be free that means whose words we are reading bhagavan himself the god himself and he is giving us the assurance so this is the way we have to understand many people's inner consciousness be awakened by only one touch you see such is the power of yoga maya that she can cast a spell she did so in sbrindaban and that is yogamaya the primal power has a power of attraction now another sentence is mentioning i applied that power myself so that power myself who can control maya god only because it is god's power in indirectly sadama krishna is revealing himself and he is so clear those who are regularly visiting sirama krishna listening to him they can understand he is nothing but the god just sitting before the one person the two three of them they came and they were brahmin and very methodical you know they they bodhi bhakti evening i have to take them do perform meditation take the name of god etc they call sandha puja they came to sirama krishna they were sitting before him they were talking with him the moment in the temple the consul blow and that is the announcement that the evening arathi of the god or goddess will begin immediately being the brahmana so they took out their japa mala the counting beads and started counting the name of god closing their eyes then suramar krishna was talking to them he asked hey what you are doing now we are doing our sandhavandana the evening prayer we are supposed to do you know sudama krishna very soft voice he said you need not to do that here when you have come to god you are sitting before god you are talking with god now you need not to do that here but those poor people couldn't understand it needs the purity otherwise it is very difficult to understand the even if you are in the company of the god in the incarnation or the son of god if you your mind is not pure you won't be able to see the one of the disciples of lord jesus he asked jesus can you show us god then the jesus said you have seen him he couldn't understand that then he said he who has seen the son has seen the father that means you don't have the idea what is god and he are thinking it should be a miraculous power that suddenly he will stand before me and now full the room will be filled with light and there will be conscious blowing there will be music there will be all the divine damsels will come and dance and that all imagination you are thinking god is love god is purity god is unfair unselfishness when you see that manifested within a person infinite love can't you understand that he is god so that sudama krishna also is mentioning that here he mentioned with that that i applied that power by myself applied that power myself just now we were mentioning that supreme lord jack graham out of his own will purusam rupam he took a form and that form he is residing within the heart of each and every one so that purusa purusham rupam it took that form and when we imagine that god is goddess durga now from today is devi will begin and after seven days the the great festival of the hindus the goddess durga will be worshipped and we want to see the goddess durga in four hands sometimes six hands sometimes ten hands same hindus they're worshipping durga but they make the image sitting on a tiger the goddess durga with four hands but if you go to the eastern part the southern part it is like that in hyderabad other places and if you go to the eastern pearl the goddess durga standing on the on the lion and it is not tiger it is the lion and she is fighting with the mahashira a demon and she is having ten hands that is different but all of durga and if you go to the the western part and the gujarat and all others and northern part also number r3 nine different images of the same goddess durga and they will be worshipping same durga same power in different form why the forms are different i wanted to see mother in that form i wanted to see the god's power in that form so i made it so what is god the wind that disciple came to jesus and said can you show me god he immediately replied you have seen god the one of the direct disciples of damani devi and he took sannyasa from swami vivekananda a great swami swami biru jananda maharaj a great name in the ramakrishna order so when he took initiation from the mother and he was talking the young boy he was talking with the mother and he was telling oh i am so unfortunate if i could come a few days before i could see bhagavan sirama krishna because he passed away 16 august 1886 and maybe after a few years he came so he was again and again mentioning that oh if i could come a few years before i could see bhagavan sirama then mother as the mother was very softly gently she replied you have seen him he couldn't understand have i seen him how can i no i was not there i didn't come that time the mother again if you have seen him then finally it is a form where you are seeing him the mother said you are seeing him in the person of the divine mother ma sharadamani devi as jesus said those who have seen the son has seen the father same way same manifestation those beauty wonderful qualities shwathi qualities pure qualities manifested the same god so friends we have to understand this particularly hindus should understand these because we have developed so many crowds of gods and goddesses are we truly having so many quotes of gods and goddesses no hindus are very very intelligent and about the religion they are very open all freedoms are there and they say only develop those qualities within yourself and for that if you want to take any form any name any method no problem but you should reach to that point where within you there will be pure unselfishness there will be love for each and every one and there will be no ego that is spirituality now let us continue bhagavan sirama krishna he is mentioning i applied that power myself and the power of god is maya one who can apply that is god himself so this is god to aim well do you think that those who come here are realizing anything he's asking the more master mashay in many ways the he used to ask master masha master mashay was really a very holy soul and immediately say yes sir it must be so surama krishna again how do you know then the master merch is smiling because as a as a child and that guideless young boy he is asking the god is asking about himself does it matter but no he is just curious so the master master is smiling and he said everyone says whoever goes to him doesn't return to the world whoever goes to him to suramar krishna doesn't return to the world that means their mind get detached and that is the spirituality so when our minds are attached with the worldly things and that is because of the ego we are attached because of the ego i want to do it i want to have it i want to say it and if somebody is not agreeing with you then you are my enemy you go away like that everything for ego so master mashay answered those who goes to him does not return to the world people say everyone return to the world means they are getting liberation they are not bound the masters smiling sudama krishna is smiling and giving an example of a guru to the young devotees read bhakti caitanya charitamrita by tilak trilock you know that the devotee many times we have read the trailer visiting he wrote a book on bhagavata caitanya mahaprabhu as because he wrote sirama krishna is asking he wrote nicely but to understand caitanya mahaprabhu many people they write without understanding you know just for the the writing in that way many people just get the popularity so the book will be sold and he will get some money and his popularity but they are not that way sadhakas reading their book you get the information and it is a very you know nice reading because they are writers they put the words in nice way and you that nice reading but those truly they have did the sadhana and then they have expressed that like sardananda ji maharaj he wrote the biography of bhagavan si rama krishna this is the teachings of bhagavan si rama krishna gospel of sirama krishna and kathamrita and saradananda ji maharaj a direct disciple of srirama krishna he was the first general secretary of the ramakrishna order he wrote explaining everything the biography of suramar krishna so many philosophical doubts are there how can a person be an avatar he was born here everything just like normal how can he say abu tara so he explained what is avatara so if you are interested to know this great personality you must read that the great master by swami saradananda jimaraj the great master maybe the english is little old but the writer is swami saradananda why he himself mentioned i have not written anything [Music] here in that book which i have not realized myself so that is the shadaka's way of explaining so and this book the when the master masha is recording and then afterwards he expressed and that was maha sharadamani devi shami vivekananda all the direct disciples and the monastics and lay all were alive by that time when this was published and their activities their names their presence as mentioned with the day time and the place they all collaborated and said yes it is all true this krishna talked to me in this way it's correct so we can understand the historicity and the genuineness of the gospel of krishna the kathamrita so when the master is laughing then he's telling he wrote a book then since he has written a book and he is a devotee he comes over here you are known to him go and ask for a copy you need not to purchase see ramakrishna is mentioning as because he has written he will give it to you and why not immediately he is giving an example he said see sometimes a farmer has a good crop of melons he can easily give away two or three as a watermelon there is a many in number it grow if you go and pluck one or two the farmer won't say anything you can in the kashmir when you went and we are visiting an apple orchard and we told that suppose we take 10 or 12 apple how much it will cost and then the owner that muslim gentleman he laughed and allowed and said oh man you need not to pay anything you cannot carry from here anything any any apple as maximum as possible you can eat whichever you like go and pluck and eat so we were a big number and the students we went but still he was so happy a lot of the apple everywhere how much we can eat one or two apples so suppose 50 boys how many apples it's nothing silana krishna observed that and he's telling if the production is more then there is no problem we can go he is feeling then he talked to the pultu they pulled to that young boy a very pure mind come here now and then pultu said i shall come whenever i can surrama will you see me in calcutta when i go there so this is way the missionary way the keeping in touch and it needs the young minds they come they listen they like but if they are detached for a long time then they will forget again they will go to is the worldly things so that is why suramar krishna because the young minds they are not attached with many things they don't have this bad experience of these worldly things so if they can turn it towards god they will realize god very easily so that's why he wanted to pull two i shall try when he said i shall try the sudama question that is the answer of a calculating mind i shall try i will go why not that then the but the young boy he doesn't know so he said immediately pultu is replying if i don't say i shall try i may be a liar maybe i won't be able to keep the word sirama krishna i don't mind the lies of these boys they are not free and two haripatha why hasn't mahendra mukherjee come here lately he is now inquiring about the devotees so even today we have seen and our senior swamis and the bellermore and even we also though when a devotee is coming we keep touch with the devotee we inquire about him and that is the the ministerial way that we should keep touch with them pray for them talk to them and that is the way slowly slowly otherwise what is why this life they are giving us food clothing shelter they are all the donations that they are giving for what for these only and when they need us to pray shall we not if we talk to them if we pray for them and that is good by this way only the masaradha mani devi said to the pray to the bhagavan si ramakrishna please help these young boys whom you have trained up to be together and develop an organization where they all will be leaving as a monks and the householder devotees will come they will contribute a little so that they can maintain the monks can maintain their lives livelihood and in exchange the householders will get the benefit of spirituality so this is the way it goes but we are not going the sucking the all money not like that a little little everyone is whatever the capacity they are having they will pay so this is the modern way of establishing dharma if you find you'll see that all the time in our the very olden days when the king was there there was a rishi as the family guru or a guide or a minister in the ramachandra's father dasharatha was having the great rishi with him and the bashist muni why now when you are having the power the king is having the power he is having the money power is having the muscle power the manpower so naturally ego may grow and if somebody is opposing immediately go and cut his head it could do then there should be someone and very respectable even the king will never go against his word and he is completely neutral that religious person will guide this so nistriasia and also nisriya the spirituality the prosperity that was wonderful balance in the religious life that was the unique balance when this was breaking then the lord himself took an abathara and in the bhagavata you'll find lord took the abhotara and he killed 21 times those kings who are trying to break this balance because they became very eager to control everything and naturally it was impossible for them to listen and also to accept any criticism so who will give the punishment to the king the lord himself came and he took up that parasurama name and form and he punished them not that he killed all the shattriyas that is the wrong way not all the shattriyas ramachandra's father he himself was there and the parushuram made him and also the shita mashita's father janaka he was also a great sage at the same time a king parasuram met him but he didn't do anything so only those kings who were trying to disturb this balance the two all the time maintaining these two spirituality at the same time the power of the king the wealth administration this two should go side by side in the modern world in the modern countries now the administration and judiciary they are doing the same thing the judiciary is maintaining trying to maintain that balance not in the spiritual way but through the law but trying to control if somebody in the administration the top man does something wrong then who is going to control him the check and balance that is the system they always say this is and in an olden days days to do like that and the time came because of different things that broke then afterwards only once again it is coming back and bhagavan sirama krishna is trying to bring it back so all the rich people they are there sarama krishna keeping touch with them he never wanted to touch even a coin but he wanted to influence those rich people guide those people so that they with their power money money power muscle power and their contact in the society do good things for their spiritual development and for the development of the society so he is asking to what happened to him the mahendra mukharji why hasn't come then haribada said i'm not quite sure why master mashay aims smiling he is practicing gyana yoga when those who are practicing gana yoga naturally they stop going visiting the shrine temple holy people it's not necessary is there going on so he smiled and said ghana yoga salaam krishna no it is not that the other day he promised to send me in his carriage to the theater to see a play about the life of pralada but he didn't send the carriage perhaps that is why he doesn't come because he promised he couldn't keep the world so maybe by that master mashup one day i saw muhima chakravarti and i saw muhima chakravadin had a talk with him it seems that mahendra visits him master but muhima talks about bhakti he loves to recite the him what need is there to penance if god is worshipped with love the master is smiling and telling he says that because you make him say it even though he has memorized many slokas the suramar krishna whenever that person is visit before others he will say can you please recite that to give him the respect and he will also feel good that i have memorized all this that people are listening that is the reason then the haripatha is mentioning girish chandra ghosh was always talking to the devotees about the master haripatha says girish goes sees many visions nowadays after going home from here he remains absorbed in spiritual moods and sees many things here means from the nature from the company of bhagavan srirama krishna then the sudama krishna is mentioning that may be true coming to the ganges one sees many things boats sheeps and whatnot if the more you are closing to the god and slowly slowly your mind is becoming pure any devotee they will see many wonderful things the divine things that that girish goes is having says from now on i shall occupy myself only with my work and like that he is telling so he talks about you friends thank you friends who will stop over here and in the next time we will uh discuss right from here a page number 721 so about the girish we were reading is there any question so akshay is asking the first question are incarnations constantly aware of their divinity or sometimes they forget it willingly yeah yeah very correct this all the time they remember that they are divine but sometimes they forget willingly so that they can behave like a human being then if you read the the biography of bhagavan srirama krishna and in the gospel also you will find some places suramar krishna himself is praying to the divine mother as if he is praying oh mother i like to talk to them i like to visit these people i like to see those places please don't make me jada they don't make me to go into that samadhi i like to enjoy so all this is his will only so as you are mentioning willingly they like to forget that willingly correct thank you devashish is asking the second question there are many people who will not remain happy neither will allow others to stay happy always a sense of dissatisfaction they are not ready to listen to god's work how do you deal with such people persons oh that is another afterwards here i couldn't reach to that bhagavan sinam krishna is very clear about that so this is your life and you have to a time is also very short we do not know so you have to utilize every moment of your life for the pursuit of god realization and if something like these it comes try to pursue them talk to them and whatever the responsibility that you are supposed to do perform that too but then don't take that in your mind and disturb your routine so the first and foremost importance for the god realization whether others are doing it or not and what they are doing and keep little distance say hello and whatever responsibility that you are supposed to perform perform but within yourself always pray to god for him or her and at the same time you go on carrying on your spiritual practices thank you bhapa is asking the second question the joy we get in dhyana and japa after reading the gospel and and leela prasanga is it helpful or deterrent in god realization no no no this is very very helpful very helpful savannah kirtana etc that's we say it like that that you are listening you are remembering and you are getting the joy that shows that your mind is becoming pure otherwise if you ask any one of your friends those who are not interested the mind is more into the world ask them to read a page from the great master they won't be able to read that oh this is so boring no no it is all right so it seems you are getting that it is evident that you are slowly becoming pure thank you vishvaru ghosh is asking the last question nila prasanga is so difficult to understand the spiritual meaning of this book can we read the book i think he's saying can we can you have a class or something now this is uh you know that vishal that is slowly if you read as because you are attending different classes of the different swamis and then getting things explained by this way slowly you will understand there are other books also there the biography of bhagavan's rama krishna that also that you can read and then when you know about suramar krishna about the philosophy then you can go to that book that will also help thank you friends let us pray to the master and then we conclude niranjanam nityam [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] friends today yesterday it was there in india today it is here that is all people they are remembering their uh previous another those who have passed away and those ancestors this is a great thing and a human is nothing but the sraddha and krita gata the sratta the faith the on in the words of the scripture and the faith in oneself and krita gata anyone any way help me i should not forget that so these two qualities makes a human a human so in our society through a religion as if they are slowly slowly in giving this to into the minds of the human being sometimes we don't understand we think it is the ritual but through the ritual if you sincerely do it slowly your mind will develop and that mind will be ready to understand spirituality the srata and krita gata these are as if the two legs of a human being standing on that if we don't have the sraddha if we don't have the krita gata our ancestors because of our ancestors we are so we should be grateful to them at least once in a year if we are remembering them offering them a little water only and nothing else not much of expenditure but by doing that we are purifying ourselves so now after a few days the goddess durga puja the power of god manifested and destroying the demon all the bad qualities that we are having that should be removed and all the good qualities that we we should manifest within ourselves and make our life blissful that is my prayer to the divine mother may you all be happy and enjoy durga puja and develop your spiritual power thank you you
