[289. Panchama Veda 289 - Sri Ramakrishna and Narendra](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TDpBgTyc2BM)

dear devotees and friends today the wednesday evening we'll be studying the panchama veda gospel of krishna let us begin with the [Music] [Music] narendra was singing and it was the they were celebrating the birthday of bhagavan siram krishna narendra singing and narendra's song as he used to sing not only is a very wonderful the vocalist and because their song was wonderful but at the same time the words of those song and singing with great emotion that gave an upsurge in the pure mind of bhagavan sri ramakrishna the surama krishna was the link then once more in the great communion all are merged all are mars you know the hinduism constantly take us towards the unity the one all is in that unity so we are always moving towards the unity that unity and diversity that is what the hinduism teaches all through here the bhagavad-gita the moment he heard those words in that song he went into that deep meditation then afterwards it said one realizes this after attaining the knowledge of brahman after attaining the knowledge of the knowledge what is that brahman all pervading consciousness when one realizes that all pervading consciousness then only it is and then all is bitty these are the two words sirama krishna used to use this very frequently biddya means everything that we see is nothing but that consciousness manifested in different names and forms when we cannot understand that and thing it is completely a separate identity so this is the two thing now here after the song sriram krishna resumed the conversation and girish was talking about the devindra bashu who has not come he says in a mood of wounded pride we haven't any stuff inside us uh no feeling of thickened milk that devendra bashu he was telling perhaps he has said that he didn't come to bhagavan sriram krishna this is the very unfortunate for that person he couldn't understand he couldn't realize that what is that krishna coming to him listening to him looking at looking at him that gives us that great joy that purify our minds but you know the ego that sometimes some people they always think in a different way so sirama krishna when the girish told that he has not come that devendra babu has not come because of this his heart thinking that there is no staff inside us so why to go the srama krishna surprised does he say that he never said it so before now sudama krishna took some refreshments and handed assam to narendra now he so many others were there the sudama krishna part took some and then he shared that prasad we should say to narendra with narendra modi he said to the master you always say narend eat these eat that are the rest of us fools are we like straw washed ashore by flood tide in bengali they say barnet jolie beshe so why you are constantly giving all attention to narendra all the time every day and not giving an attention to us he was in the almost the same age so he was telling like that not angrily jokingly the surama krishna lobbed jatin dearly jatin visited the master now and then at dakshinesha and occasionally spent the night there he belonged to an aristocratic family of shobha bhajar the shobha bhaja dev the this you know the bhagavad gita these are the places in the they call it north calcutta is a in those days the it was very very important places now it is also the shobha bhajar rajabadi they were raj means they were not kings they were like the landlords very rich landlords and this shobha bhajar raj badi was a huge palatial building there they organized the celebration that when swami vivekananda came back from the waste and there in the calcutta reception that was held over there in the shubhavajar we call it rajbadi the people they call it rajabari so he belonged to that family the various togetic family of the shohabajar master said that laughingly and with the jokingly he said to the narendra he's talking about you though the the master and all they were sitting he told to suramar krishna siram krishna told naren see he is talking about you sudama krishna laughed and showed his affection to jatin by touching his chin he said to jatin come to dakshinesha i will give you plenty to eat so we can understand how this young generation young people they are coming to bhagavan si rama krishna and they are getting the affection and the love and guidance from bhagavan si rama krishna slowly slowly things are changing now we will find the bhagavad-gita his mood is also changing then the master went into the auditorium to see efforts he sat in a box he laughed at the conversation of the met servant after a while he became absent-minded and whispered a few words to aim in means the master masha the graphic the full picture is there they were in others in the in the restroom they are in the place where the people they were taking the different type of refreshments and after that they are going back to the hall sirama krishna the ordinary things were going on something he enjoyed that but at the same time became absent-minded and whispering so that mood is changing master he said to well is that girish go says true grishko says true here immediately master masha understood girish had lately been speaking of sudama krishna as an incarnation of god master mashay was a very constant company of sirama krishna first second master mashay was noting down everything and bhagavan sriram krishna knew that it will be published and the future generation afterwards the people will know about bhagavan's ramakrishna from those writings so srama krishna wanted to give the correct picture when the girish gosh used to say to declare that sadama krishna is the incarnation of god we can imagine in those days when sudama krishna is there all so many people are the how they will think the incarnation of god means is showing the miracles is lifting the even today people they believe in that way at that time when sadama krishna was present not showing any miracle just ordinary person can't talk even in the the bengali also the chest bengali that also he couldn't say that that person is an incarnation of god no education and no family background even then so girish was going on telling because girl giris felt in that way and he was a very good speaker and he was convincing people sirama krishna was inquiring not that how people are reacting he wanted to know about master mashay the aim himself who was constantly with him so look at it some people they don't know once in a while only they are listening or seeing and they're appreciating that is a different thing they don't know that person but the person who is constantly with sudama krishna spending the whole day so many days after days he is there in the company of surama krishna he is seeing sudama krishna every movement of the person how he thinks that is very important the surama krishna was taking the asking aim yes sir it must be true this is very important there is no doubt in the mind of the master masha he never said oh well the girish is talking like that he's he says in that way he's he uses this type of language to impress people no master masha himself is also convinced and this is important because master masha used to spend a long time with suramar krishna that is my point that i like to say this master masha he when he is telling he said it must be true what is that sudama krishna incarnation of god girish is telling master masha is also yes must be true otherwise why should it appeal to our minds if you are not god incarnate how that we are so much attracted to you sirama krishna you see a change is coming over me the old mood has changed i am not able to touch any metal now so s master listen to these words in wonder there is a very deep meaning in this new mood this is the 1885 so 1886 bhagavan sirama krishna august of 16 he left his body so not much time left so that's the mood is changing he is going to a express himself the god in human form the master there is a deep meaning was the master hinting that a god man cannot bear any association with the worldly treasure master mashup very hard that the sudama krishna can't touch any metal and when sudama krishna told it and other devotees also came to know this young devotee narendra he wanted to test so we all know that story the master to him well do you notice any change in me master machine what respect said in my activities master mashay your activities are increasing as more people come to know about you really it is very appreciating the master master every answer whenever the sudama krishna wanted to know we can call it as a feedback so by that way master mashed was very perfect exactly what is happening he is reporting to that he's telling so many people are coming do you see what i said before is now coming true after a few moments he said can you tell me why pultu can't meditate well pulled to another voice ramakrishna is to love him as a young person suramar krishna was eager that one should meditate meditate properly what is this meditation meditation means concentration on one particular object or maybe without any object so now in the beginning one particular object forgetting all others when the mind is scattered and the different things they're thinking it's very difficult to concentrate so if one can develop concentration can meditate for a long time that means his mind is becoming pure that concentration you know one may be on in whatever it may be any object the people are concentrating on the scientist is concentrating on something and like that the concentration is the main thing the moment that concentration develops one can control the mind and thoughts of the mind then what happens then slowly slowly that mind concentrated mind focused mind can be given to god so that is the idea when the pultu whom he liked a lot can't meditate sirama krishna is little concerned why pultu can't meditate sudama krishna was ready to leave for dakshinesha he had remarked to a devotee about girish you may wash a thousand times a cup that has hailed a solution of garlic but it is easily possible to get rid of the smell all together girish was offended by this remark when the master was about to leave girish spoke the girish chandra ghosh we know his character he was a worldly person he used to drink a lot and many other things associated with that used to do so sadama krishna told us a good person but those who are young minds those who doesn't know about anything about those things it is worldly things it is better not to go to those people so he gave the example of the garlic if you keep that the solution of the garlic in any container it is very difficult to get rid of the smell the girish understood it and he was hurt and he came to suramar krishna he is asking will this male of girly go so this is the very wonderful question he is asking i did some mistake but now is it possible for me to go beyond that answer of sudama krishna this is hinduism we never say eternal damnation once you have done something wrong and you are now you have to leave eternally in a in hell no it is not like that we did the mistake and we can rectify it so ramakrishna is telling yes it will girish so you say it will suramar krishna said it will girish he believed siram krishna as the incarnation of god and the god in the living human body so he is you said see look at it the faith then the cerama krishna is telling all smell disappears when a blazing fire is lighted so the wonderful answer when the knowledge dawn [Music] then there remains nothing what is the bad karma that is all in our mind in our subconscious mind all that we have done attached with the worldly things sometimes we became greedy sometimes when there's some cunningness that we have applied to get some benefits so many things we do in the worldly life now obviously slowly slowly we go away from god the god is pure purity means without any worldly things but when we are attached to the worldly things worldly objects and name fame money property all power then what the worldly things that you are doing and there is no god god is away from that as all the time they say when the child is busy with the toys the mother never picked up the child but when he give up those toys and say that i like to go to mother then only the mother will take him on the on her lap so same way the god is also when we are busy and we are happy with the heart creation his creation this world so that's ramakrishna to impress on our mind that the worldly things are not good and once you go to that is very difficult to come out of that so he mentioned the garlic and a smell it's very difficult to go but again he said knowledge knowledge is fire and when you are burning then everything will go away if you heat the cups mailing up garlic you get rid of the smell it becomes a new cup the man who says he will not succeed will never succeed he who feels he is liberated is indeed liberated this is knowledge well i did some mistake i was not aware of it now i have learned now from now onwards i am not going to do that so no repetition and moreover i am going to understanding the whole thing that the world and the god i like to go to god no no more the worldly things and that is called vana prastha manasi kata the mentality is growing to bana prasti the brahmacharya goddess the sannyas the bana prasa means preparation after the grahe is the banana prasti in that the preparation in the preparation they're trying to understand the reality and giving up all those for each for which they were very much at test and now obviously moment to step into that condition of the sannyasa you give up everything the friends so many people are there in this world are so good today only i made i knew them for a long time after coming over here in chicago today they came and they i made them so whatever the excess money that they are having now that they're donating giving away back to the society and very planned way wonderfully there that is not necessary for us how many people can think about it our children we have given them education we have given them all support now they can help themselves so whatever the money now we are having the property now we are having it's not necessary and they don't also want they are also good children now these two couple they are constantly thinking of god reading about the script reading the scriptures meditating and slowly slowly they are preparing and preparing with a great plan and they say that whatever they access slowly we will give to in charity majority of the people those who are having that money don't never think in that way they more and more and more as maximum as possible and what happened afterwards one day suddenly knowingly or unknowingly they will oh they are not in that body and what will happen to their property even they don't want that they will see if all the property is distributed government has taken it society has taken it so many things are happening and maybe their relatives are crawling over their children are calling over that so many things so this is called banana presidential bhagavatama krishna said about the girish kosh that is true girish realized that he was hard at the same time he realized what he has done is not good that was not good so now he wants to make himself rectified how suramar krishna indicated ghana the god is only there and nothing else that is ghana so that he is under understanding and sadama krishna is telling i am free is suddenly free and he who says day and night i am bound is certainly bound that is vedanta a lot of inquiries coming about the vedanta and what is vedanta in one word this is vedanta each and every soul is nothing but the manifestation of that pure divinity we are all pure on what is impurity our mystic our ignorance wrong knowledge about the worldly things when we think the world is real and we anchor for that as long as we are living we need food we need clothing we need all of the support there is nothing wrong in it for that we have to earn that is okay but the attachment to those things thinking those are the things which will give me joy eternal joy that is the wrong thing and when we are putting our mind and soul into that again and again we have to come back into life and in different situations we may suffer so that is the main problem those who understand that they go towards god how just by turning the mind the mind was going towards the world the same mind will go towards the god so that much so every week we are studying the panchama way the gospel of sudama krishna every week why only to get this idea again and again and again that god is real and we must turn our mind towards that those who are not forget about them it is up to them they are free they can whatever they like but those who have realized the futility of this world temporariness of this world we should be very careful and we must diligently we must try to go over there because all these habits are there constantly pushing us back dragging us back dragging towards the world that is telling make a strong resolution i am free i am going to be free i am not bound with this all these worldly things whatever is necessary till my life it's okay for me after that i'm not going to linger anchor for that now friends we will start the another chapter today that is 37th and the name of the chapter is the master and narendra the sudama krishna and narendra the date is sunday march 1st 1885. sirama krishna was seated on the small couch in his room absorbed in deep samadhi this is so simple way the master masha is writing absorbed in deep samadhi because master masha observed what is samadhi as because he used to be with the cerama krishna otherwise many people they're closing their eyes and sitting it doesn't mean that they're in samadhi they're thinking many other things maybe they are not opening their eyes and i have seen many people they they can sit for a long period of time closing their eyes but that is different samadhi no body consciousness as because master mashay was acquainted with suramar krishna he could understand that the sirama krishna in samadhi but at the same time in that room other people are entering seating he's giving the name mahima charan ram mano mohan nabai caitanya aim and other devotees were sitting on a mat sprayed on the floor they were watching the master intently master mashay the aim he used to you know the sudo name is to take so the people cannot recognize and why he used to give the names because that particular date and time and that year and but that particular day who were there mastermind is giving the account but just his imagination he wrote whatever he thought not like that these people were there they were present they were also observing sirama krishna so much authenticity historicity says master marsha is writing it was the day of the dolo yatra a hindu religious festival sri krishna and radha are the central figures of the celebration their is being placed on the swing which is rocked now and then a red powder is showered on the images later friends and relatives throw the powder at one another this vegetable is celebrated when winter passes into spring on a full moon day rendered double is scared by its association with the birth of sri chaitanya or sacred sorry i'm sorry so the secret by its association with the birth of sri chaitanya so this is that on that particular day it was the birthday of sri caitanya mahaprabhu he was almost 500 years before sri ramakrishna he is also considered the one of the the very high soul in avatara he was also initiated by the tsunami sampradaya sannyasi he was also a vedantin but he took up the duality for the sake of the the people at that time the islamic aggression islam was ruling the but particularly the western and eastern part of india and the society was in turmoil what is going to happen the hindu society their traditions their religion their culture it was in a tough situation so caitanya mahaprabhu came and he went on giving the only you need not to do anything you need not to convert yourself to any other religion if you like to continue into hinduism only take the name of god and he developed the wonderful conception of radha and krishna as if two lovers and rather a lady and she is going to love sri krishna who is human but the god so that is the story and then people naturally liked it and very simple in the language only one or two lines that's called kirtana repetition of the same thing and the caitanya mahaprabhu told if you repeat in this way your mind will be purified by that way a great number of people they could retain their own religion he was a great personality so this caitanya mahaprabhu was also born in this particular day that not in 1885 he was 500 years before sri ramakrishna naturally so but it's master masha is mentioning on the dula yatra day caitanya mahaprabhu was born the master said to mahima charan the surama krishna came down from that deep meditation samadhi and he told to mahima charan my dear sir please tell us something about love of god so look at it caitanya mahaprabhu was born on that particular day dulu yatra day dulu yatra is a festival of love and sudama krishna is requesting that why this he himself could say but muhimacharan used to study a lot so sirama krishna is giving respect to his study of the scripture and he told mahima charan can you please tell us something from the scripture the mohimacharan narada pancharatra from there he recited and this is very interesting he recited what need is there opinions if god is worshiped with love second line what is the use of penance if god is not worshipped with love so that is the way one has to think that means the love for god is essential and if there is a love for god is there other penance not not necessary getting up in the very early morning and that bathing in the water and go for these gopher are not necessary because the love for god means you are constantly thinking about that god your mind is constantly thinking the god so naturally all other things only to concentrate only to think it's not necessary but suppose that love is not there and you are going on mechanically practicing what is that so narada pancharatra he says like that what need is there a penance if god is seen within and without that means every time every moment when you are awake god is there sleeping god is there every moment then no other penances are necessary what is the goal of this penance spiritual finances that is to realization of the god when the god has been realized god is constantly present but this is not necessary again what is the use of penance if god is not seen within and without that means you have to develop that attitude that i am with god every moment the love of god and the presence of god o brahman o my child sees from practicing father penance hassan to shankara the ocean of heavenly wisdom obtained from him the love of god the pure love praised by devotees which snaps in between the cycles that bind you to the world so this is the way you have to understand so majority of the people in all religion they practice religion mechanically i'm sorry to say this that is the problem why we are going to temple we are not very clear about it who is this god what is going to happen to us we are not very clear about it we go to god because we are afraid afraid of losing the worldly objects or we are craving to get that so the blessings of god we are trying of course in our own way at the same time we go to temple pray to god to get his blessing blessings to be successful in achieving some worldly objects is this the purpose of devotion no that is what the narada panchayat is saying and that what the mahindra babu is repeating and he is mentioning the main purpose is to develop love for god and what is the love of god remembering him constantly all through and if that is not there it is of no use and when it is there you need not to bother about practicing any other penances the goal is to realize the god and that god is nothing but love the love that surprises everything there is no boundary oh those people are not speaking in our own language so we should not love them if they are thinking they are not at all devotee very very worldly type minded people we were wherever i was wondering some people i received a phone call and someone he was telling i am not a hindu but i wanted to know about the hinduism and some of the hindu friends whom i know when i inquired they said no unless you are a born hindu you cannot become a hindu that is not the question how can you say that even a born hindu does he know what is hinduism hinduism is all compassion all embracing love hinduism goal is to develop the compassion so that he can say vasudeva kutumbakam the whole universe is my everyone my my relative my friend can embrace that is hinduism no you are not born in hindu so you cannot this is ignorance even though they were born in this do not know so narada pancharatra is so important just by telling in this way if you have not developed love for god then what is the penances for and if you have already developed the love for god you need not to bother about the penances go for the goal you have achieved the goal bhagavan sirama krishna in many other places also he said we need the map to reach to the particular place and after reaching there we don't need that map we can keep it back for the future generation to use or you can throw it so that is the purpose of the scripture is nothing but to help us to realize the truth and when we have realized the truth other things are not necessary so one should not that's why it says o brahman o my child cease from practicing father penances hastened to shankara that is the lord siva know from him what is the love of god that is very very important my friends we all are spending so much of time and all our energy our money and we are so devoted we want to realize god we go to temple almost every day many are there in america have seen the regular visitor of the temple and they'll be doing some voluntary job over there giving the donations to support the temple everything they are doing but at the same time i am so i noticed that they are not very happy constantly comparing other devotees who are there and then they are very jealous of those people very eager to get some of the control some of the authority of those temple why so this is the question please be careful because time is very short you are on the track but you are not aware about the goal goal is to develop the love and that love that surpasses everything so go to the brahmana means those who have realized the futility of these worldly things and they are coming to the god that they are brahmana not by birth but by karma so these brahmanas those who are already there mumok shoes if they miss the goal that is very sad so we have to develop the true knowledge mahima said once while the great sage narada was practicing austerity he suddenly heard a heavenly voice repeating those lines it happened in the life of narada we all know about the narada the great devotee of the god this narada he was having tremendous love but at the same time the knowledge and what is god only love that the emotion that is there and i am feeding the god and this is good nothing wrong and dressing up the god and making these making there so many devotees they sent the photos and wrote that we have celebrated by this way john masternui janmastami is the krsna's birthday so that affection of the motherly affection for the baby krishna is very good but who is krishna that also that knowledge also should be there otherwise all the penances will go in vain so narada himself realized it and narada was guided by the god himself and he guided him go and learn what is true love master there are two classes of devotees bhagavan sirama krishna mentioning one is g bhakti the ordinary main and another is ishwara kathy the divine messengers the jivocati's devotion to god is called bodhi for means formal the bodhi means that this ramakrishna is mentioning over here is a it comes from the scriptural laws he worships god with a fixed number of articles the pancha prachada puja the dasha prachada puja puja prachanda means the articles them five different articles they'll use they're very normal that's the minimum thing then the dashaprachar they will add a few more things shorosha prachara means 16 different items that is the the max they'll they will have so by that way the items only they're increasing and offering to god sometimes they will give the clothings the food and these so they are increasing the items and up to 16 that is okay items are items only what is love so that is called bohedi puja that is bidibat puja it has been in the scripture it is there so they will be following that and when you are offering the flower to the god you have to say the ganesha your nama also because the garnish is the fast god and you should then you have to shoo jayanama then the so many other things are there so they go on doing that regularly they are doing millions of people maybe they are the pujaris or just in the practicing in the in their houses also but that is all right the main thing is love for god if the love has not come so telling they are all jivacotis they're good trying practicing but if i am aware that i am practicing i am doing this puja for such a long time but i have not developed love for god then that voice that the not of the heart he will say what is the use of it like this we have to understand and he says he worships god with fixed number of articles repeats god's holy name a specified number of times and so on and so forth this kind of devotion like the path of knowledge leads to the knowledge of god and to samadhi the jeevathi does not return from samadhi to the relative plane so not that they won't get they will also get out some up to samadhi but but the case of the ishwarakati is different he follows the process of negation and affirmation first he negates the world realizing that it is not brahman that means path of knowledge not this not this not this and then he affirms the same world seeing it as the manifestation of brahman to give an illustration a man wanting to climb to the roof first negates the stairs as not being the roof when we step up the step we are going up we are negating though this is not the roof this is not the roof then ultimately when we are reaching the roof he finds that the stairs are made of the same materials as the roof the very excellent example this world that we see and when we are practicing when we are going towards the god what we do we negate negate negate it is necessary if not knowing what is truth if we think this world and all the objects of this world are true then that is the ignorance but when we reach to that truth and we realize that everything is nothing but the manifestation of the same god there's a complete different thing completely different thing that is srama krishna is mentioning step by step he is going up towards the roof to reach to the top and when he reached over there he saw the same material has been used to build those steps so both are the same and when one realizes the brahman he finds that everything is nothing but the manifestation of that consciousness only on that consciousness the frames have come so that is the difference otherwise everything is that consciousness different type of right so many examples they have been given with the sweets they have in the confectionary the shop if we go the varieties of sweets are there some are black some are yellow some are white all made of the same thing only colors are different sizes are different names are different maybe test may be a little different because the addition of difference sit up and all that but the base is the main thing is the same and similarly in this world when you see different types of human beings animals birds reptiles the vegetation so many different things but all are nothing but the manifestation of the same consciousness the first negation and then affirmation so this he said and he said then he can either move up and down the stairs or remain on the roof as he pleases up and down of the stair means he can go to the world and explain those things that the truth to the world people or you can just merge into samadhi that is also possible it's up to him now he's giving the example of sukadeva those who are following the vedanta they all know about the sukadeva the great soul he was the son of the vyasa and when he was born he was born with that knowledge that everything is brahmana so that was the very special so this sukadeva was observed in samadhi nirvikalpa samadhi friends many of you are accustomed to this type of terminologies the niribi kalpa and swabi kalpa a sanskrit word ni bikalpa there is no support name is negative means support and object so there is no support still he is in the concentration one then how it is possible suppose there is a there is a picture and i concentrate on that particular picture the photo or the image or a symbol and whatever it may be when i am having an object on which i can concentrate my mind that is called sa bikalpa saw means with vikalpa means the object and knee negative there is no then on which he is meditating on himself that means the consciousness he has forgotten forgotten that he has a body he has a personality he marches into that consciousness so here sirama krishna's examples are unique i will read it from here in the jala samadhi jada means not moving jada means that like the stone so that way he is meditating since shukra was to recite the bhagavata to king pariksit the lord sent the sage narada to him narada saw him seated like an inner thing absolutely unconscious of the world around him thereupon narada sang four couplets on the beauty of hari hari means the god to the accompaniment of the beena when is the musical instrument the beena while the first couplet was being sung they hear on suka's body stood on end the sukha started imagining the image of god and the beauty for excellence that gave the haripulation all his body the year stood and in that horrible nation comes when you you are greatly enjoying something within that harry potion next he shade tears for this for he saw the form of god the embodiment of spirit within himself in his heart thus sukadeva saw the form of god even after jarash ahmadi he was ishara koti but this but here bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning that the narada went and sang and the god himself sent him to do that in the bhagavata it says that his father the shukha's father he wanted to teach the bhagavata to sukhadeva why the bhagavata is the pure knowledge and soaked in devotion that is the beauty of the bhagavata the some of the people they say this is a scripture of devotion of love of course it is true but that devotion is purely based on knowledge so from the first chapter to ninth chapter of the bhagavata there is no image of god it is only the description of that supreme being and afterwards when the brahma particularly with all other gods they prayed to the lord vishnu vishnu took that form that chakra padma dhari that is the form of the lord vishnu only brahma and shiva could see and that is another way into uh their basha and told the bashar the why don't you write about the lord who is taking the form human form the basher wrote so many things but his mind as if the bashar himself is telling to narada i'm not getting joy within i know the truth that is okay but not getting the joy the naruto told because you have not given the form of god so the devotees so then he wrote the bhagavata is the main major part is nothing but knowledge the conversation between the krishna and his friend there is also the knowledge and like that like that now the suka was meditating and biasha wanted his son to come back to learn so that he can go to parikshit to say that she shukar's memory was very sharp so one or two days he can memorize the whole thing and can explain the whole thing to the king so that is the story basha engaged some of the uh the wood carters this to go inside the the jungle to collect some dry dry woods he taught them this song the four lines and told you must go and sing before every cave we don't know where he is meditating and when a sage will come out and he's stuck naked and his body may be covered with dust and because he is not eating anything so it will be completely different type don't get afraid go to him and say do you like to learn this song then follow us and he will follow you bring him to me the son is coming to father but the sun was not aware that is sukadeva then other part is the same he came he learned the bhagavata and his harry potion came when he was listening to that though he was a man of knowledge but he became a devotee and he went and narrated the story to the pariksit who was waiting for the death friend again that man who is
