[263. Panchama Veda 263 : Devotion- Different Stages](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nhnro5IX1iU)

good evening dear devotees and friends let us begin our regular discourse on the panchama veda we were discussing about the last time in the last wednesday the bhagavan sirama krishna is talking about the guru the importance of the guru and we were quoting sadhguru pave so that is a beautiful the hindi couplet and if you go to a real guru then he will teach you the discrimination between the real and the unreal what is real that is god that is permanent and everything else are unreal because they are temporary so sadhguru the proper guru the real guru the preceptor who is the representative of god or the god himself that he will teach you only this much then how by gana kare upadesh by giving you the teaching of knowledge and this is called knowledge knowledge means the knowledge of one everything is nothing but that one so that is the knowledge then afterwards bhagavan si ramakrishna he was discussing about the brahman and what is that brahman be the speaks of the seven plains we studied those seven planes shuvecha bhicharana the new manasa then sattva apathy these are the seven planes of the vedanta and in the last week we have discussed and he was telling about veda speaks of sachiran and the brahman brahman is neither one nor two very wonderfully he was mentioning in this way neither one nor two it is between one and two it cannot be described either as existence or as non-existence it is between existence and non-existence so that way he spoke about the brahman and the the moment we say one it becomes the conception comes about the two the one means two at two we cannot say like that so in between one and two so here we we have to understand when you say one the odd waiter it is not telling a come so this is the way we have to think and it's so subtle so perfect too specific bhagavan siram krishna he is giving the example if you remove and open an onion one after another slowly slowly you removing the cover of the onions and slowly the onion will you will reach to one place where you'll find nothing so what is the onion then all those covers no it is there the existence so he is giving the example of the onion the brahman is like that after removing all these slowly slowly when we reach over there we find only existence sat existence and it is there after that he is taking another the viewpoint and that is called the devotion now friends in in the hinduism they are giving scope for all different type of people in the bhagavad-gita also you will find sometimes it is telling tasma gyani bhava arjuna therefore you must become a gyani agani this is the gyana sachi dhananda sarupa brahman except that there is nothing and it is only the existence you cannot say this is one and you cannot say this is true so that is the way the path of the knowledge and suppose you can't then tasma and you must become a yogi who is a yogi withdrawing all the sense senses from the saints objects and this our eye the ear the nose the tongue and the skin it is going on collecting information of the five five different type of objects and giving the information to the mind mind is going on working on that stop that we draw that why because those objects that you are thinking they are good in reality they are all so temporary it is of no use having those so they we have to withdraw that that's called the yogi then the about the karma the third chapter of the bhagavad-gita completely dedicated to the karma and what type of karma you do any sorts of karma you like and you your profession but don't get access to that those things that is the teaching that is the teaching so karma and then the devotion bhakti you have to dedicate everything to me so four different types of emotions the people are having some are very intellectuals and they like to analyze everything and then like to proceed some are emotional some are active some some are contemplative they meditate so those who are emotional type they have the devotion if you give only one path one idea god is only this much and this is the only way you have to follow it's very difficult to accommodate all different types of people the hinduism that's why accommodating all varieties the same god sometimes those who are following the path of discrimination which are a path of knowledge called brahman and those who are following the path of devotion emotion they call it god and those who are withdrawing the senses call it atman like this goal is the same name is different but we are our process are different bhagavan sirama is eunuch because he came for the modern age so he is telling there is a pawn and from the four different approaches different four different people going to the same pond and then fetching the water and telling this is water this is aqua this is pani this is jal and four different names and if the fight on that that water it will be just funny the same thing because of the different name you are doing like this so this is the way we have to understand bhagavan sirama krishna now he is talking about the devotion the guru he spoke this is essential to teach you these things and then according to your capacity your aptitude he will guide you to follow one path and then come the bhakti he is telling the vedas when the devotee develops raga bhakti and the passionate love of god he realizes him now he takes the mind to the highest devotion [Applause] tremendous attachment that's called raga here he is telling if the devotion to god becomes that type of attached then it's good then it is good he's healing when the devotee it is page 659 659 when the devotee develops raga bhakti passionate love of god he realizes him but one loses bhaiti bhakti formal devotion as easily as one gains it so he is mentioning another bhakti it's called according to the system so it goes that is called majority of the people all over the world indifferent religion they are following the bhai bhakti vidhivat bhakti the do's and don'ts that has been given to them they follow that and they think that is ultimately sufficient we need not to do anything else but that is nothing when the people they come to us for spiritual instructions we give them mantra diksa the god's name and asked them well 108 times in the morning 108 times in the evening at least these two times you must take the name of god and then you sit like this and meditate like this and this is the way you should count the name of god etc etc these are called bds the rules the system and it is given to you please follow that majority of the people the thing that is sufficient no that is the beginning just beginning and from there slowly slowly when you are going on taking the name of god and then listening to the name the glory of god and thinking about god in different times slowly you are developing love for god then comes the attachment for god there's a growth it begins from that by the bhakti but srirama krishna is telling it is nothing don't give so much of importance on the vedic you have to grow swami vivekananda very nicely said it is better to born in a church but not to die there so we are we have got some guidances suppose i am a hindu i was born in a pious family my father mother they were doing that i thought that is the only way one should do i suppose i stop over there and can't accept anything else it is like it is better to born in a church that much i cannot open up i cannot learn i cannot develop my devotion so that is the problem majority of the people why there are so much of bloodshed hatred fighting in the name of religion because we do not understand these one group of people going and attacking and killing other group of people when they're praying can you imagine what type of religious people they are and they are thinking they are doing the best thing for their own god and their god will be very happy nonsense god is only one god cannot be many you think that this is my god that is no problem but you think and you love and you follow that is okay so here we must have to understand this much 21st century now people are thinking to go to the moon to settle over there and now we are thinking in this way and if you are not following my religion my god then i will go and kill you and that too when you are praying in your own temple that is terrible so this is called ignorance and this has come from not only from ignorance that is also ego those people in the name of that religion the so-called teachers so egoistic so ignorant about true religion they are inspiring others to go and utilizing their devotion utilizing their softness for the religion and ultimately bringing bad name about religion people are doubting young people are doubting about religion but religion is nothing but love religion is nothing but unselfishness friends that's why i always suggest not that i am a follower of ramakrishna those who have read the gospel of bhagavan sirama krishna all these narrowness all this wrong conception will go away but if you are don't like to open your window if you don't like to allow the fresh air to calm then of course that type of people are always it will be there in this world so sudama krishna is giving the idea of devotion and he is telling one loses vadi bhakti formal devotion as easily as one gains it after some time they will forget it this is formal devotion so much japa so much meditation so much sacrifice and homa so many articles of worship and recitation of so many mantras before the deity so that is the way they always goes articles of worship means if you go to a hindu temple any hindu worship they call pancha upochara 16 increasing the items that they are going to offer to god or goddess that much it's nothing to do with the devotion devotion is different i like to give this many things to god and i like to give a clothe and then i like to offer these i like to give the the coin gold coin and silver coin so many things they go on adding they can do it because i like someone is coming to me i like to feed him or her with so many items now the 24th december is coming people will be inviting of course nowadays it is not allowed but when they go they carry the candies and they'll be carrying the different type of gift and that is that is the joy it is not that you must have to do that because 24th december they they are thinking on that particular day the jesus was born not very sure so they're thinking so all over the world the christians they celebrate the birthday of jesus and the god has sent his beloved son for us so celebrating that and when celebrating their exchanging gift different type of things the gift jesus never saw those are the gifts we are giving and the socks and these the the beautiful shoes and the sweaters all those things jesus never saw that but in the name of jesus love of jesus out of devotion to that we are exchanging what is the difficulty no problem you cannot do this because jesus only did this we have that is terrible thing in the name of religion it is the love it is the compassion it is the attachment to god this is the main point we are forgetting and external things we are taking that this is the religion and this orthodoxy is always there in every religion and some people they are very boastful actually they are very egoistic they don't know anything about religion but because of their muscle power they are thinking they will do like this so those who are truly devoted should try to understand it is the love for god and nothing else and the best thing that god loves as a gift from us is our tears nothing else everything god has created what you are going to give to god it is our tear tear of love i can see you god i can't hear you god now every day my i am growing older and older we do not know when i am going to die the sun is setting please come before me give your darshan let me talk to you let me touch your feet let me get your blessings in this very life here and now you must get the blessings you must guess that realization what is the realization the god is everything i cannot hate i cannot do any harm to anyone because each and everything everyone is nothing but the manifestation of the same god the lord whom i call by this name this is the path of devotion and sudama krishna is taking us to the highest devotional condition he's telling bhakti this is like this such devotion comes in a moment and goes in a moment in the beginning many people say well friend we have lived in a vision on sunnah for so many days shanna means they will be cooking only rice and they will pit put a mix with that habi means the ghee the clarified butter and little salt and that they will eat that is the simplest food so that is the way they survive the many almost all the hindus they do like that at the time of the brahmacharya and different than obisanna so i have lived on that so they'll be posting how many times we have worshiped the deity at our home and what have we achieved but there is no failing away from raga bhakti the bidi bhakti i have visited that holy place i met that holy person i listened to him i cooked for him he visited my house people love to say like that the devotees but that is only the outer even if the holy person is visiting your home what is there oh yes the presence of a holy person changed the atmosphere but do you understand that do you benefit out of that when we are going to a holy place do we really concentrate our mind and remember that if not then it's all mockery is of no use then the main thing that we have to within our mind understand that and concentrate our whole mind on that particular thing forgetting all other things so this is telling those who have performed many meritorious deeds in their past birth or those who are eternally perfect they only get this that it says the raga bhakti and who get this passionate love for god the raga means the attachment the passion the passionate love for god then sunama krishna is telling those who have performed many meritorious deeds in their past births and those who are eternally perfect what is this perfection what is this meritorious deeds it is only those who are helping others thinking that they are serving the living gods and goddesses there are many organizations social organizations helping many people in many different ways but those who are doing that if they are thinking that we are helping this wretched people they can't help themselves so we are helping we are helping they are helping but not getting any spiritual benefit those who are helping with that idea i am blessed that i have got the opportunity to help this god in distress they get the benefit the giver should kneel down that is the teaching of swami vivekananda these givers should be humble god you have given me the opportunity you have come in the form of this person who needs medicine who needs some warm clothes who needs some guidance who needs some money food clothings i got the opportunity because you have given me some money you have given me the thoughts to donate that is the way when one person is thinking then he will get the spiritual benefit this live previous live previous life those who are going on doing always the good work they're going on accumulating the good result accumulating automatically whether they want it or not then ultimately their mind will be purified and there will be only love and there will be unselfishness god love and unselfishness is nothing but the purity we talk about purity purity and purity we talk about the divinity what is this purity what is this divinity these two qualities love and unselfishness i say this again and again and when these two are they are manifested completely this is pure this purity we can see in the life of maha sharadamani devi no differences she is loving each and everyone equally whether is an educated uneducated well-established person or not what is the problem profession of that man or the lady neighbor no discrimination that is the law that is the beauty and that is called god realization so here bhagavan sirama krishna is telling friends you know the bhakti is a vast subject but in brief we can say the devotion the what type of devotion in the bhagavad-gita sri krishna says there are four types of people they are having the devotion to god what what the arthur arthur and gyani arthur is afflicted he's suffering mentally physically economically then social different problems then they come to god and say god please help me accept their love for god or their devotion for god their prayer for god only for to save them at from that particular problem they are called arthur this is one group then curious person sometimes the children students nowadays they are not coming previously from different schools students used to come and we had to write an article on hinduism can you please guide me what is this hinduism what they do they're curious about their devotion to god their curiosity about god is that much they are selfish people they go to god go to church go to temple synagogue mosque only to satisfy their personal need they will go and then they'll say god i have a business if you're increasing me this profit i'm going to have give you this thing so like that they are another type of devotion but their devotion their faith to god they are visiting to god and calling on god only for that particular purpose the fast is arthur afflicted then jigyasu the curious person arthur they they need the support from god for their own economical benefit and then finally comes gyani gyani means he has understood this world is futile i don't need this world constantly changing i used to love that person so much now that person wants to kill me he has become so much against me he is now is an enemy previously i still long for his company or her company now i am hiding myself from him or her why this this change is constantly changing relation is changing behavior changing society is changing everything changing the knowledge some people used to be so boastful when they were discovering one after another some scientific truth saying they wish to go and where are those people have forgotten them on the basis of that some people have developed or sometimes they have discarded their discoveries everything changing then why unnecessarily i will go and cry for those things which are not going to stay there with me so that way we have to understand so that is called ghani the moment a person has developed that it turns to see the permanent thing and he get the idea of god so these are four types of devotion and four type of people they are going towards it this is called general way to understand the devotee and their devotion to god so the best is the gyani now the gyani this person when he is starting his journey it's called bhaidi bhakti the many they write to me the i like to know about the spiritual life i ask them to call me then i discuss try to understand what is their idea why suddenly he's asking like this for many different reasons they do so the affliction and these and that so accordingly we talk those who are sincere they like to know about god we ask them can you please come we can sit and discuss so they then we say this is the god and how to develop my devotion so morning you must repeat the name of god in this way and then a burn one or two incense sticks look at the photo of the god or goddess when the moment you get up from a bed don't see anything not even your own face just see that god and pray to god god this is your life that you have given to me please help me and please be with me all the time when you are working remember god when you are returning again remember god by the bhakti vidhi bhakti the listed bhakti these are the things you should do this many times you should take the name of god and uh i don't believe god you need not to believe god you just go on doing if you have faith on me then go on doing that so that is the way the doll is do sometimes we inquire are you doing are you practicing that and then you should read those who are very sincere and they have the time they have the dedication we say four hours we should you should take the name of god and meditate that is the four hours in a day four hours you should read the scripture so these are the eight hours then eight hours you should work what to earn because you have to maintain or if you are a completely dedicated a monk a brahmacari are dedicated in the convent you are a nun then the whatever the work that they will give you should do that that is also for eight hours then balance eight hours is yours for sleeping and doing eating and doing that and that so this is the way the routine one must be i must be having lot of patience then only growing developing slowly the mind become trained up but after a few days they'll oh the i am not getting the glimpses of god this is all worthless let me try in the buddhism then after a few days from there let me try over there so they go on doing like that and ultimately they find nothing and they write a nice book against god and religion so that is the way it goes so bhaiti bhatti is this that's why bhagavatam krishna says it comes and it goes then come prema bhakti the prema means love when we are going on practicing the bhi bhakti which is the basis of the religion we should not stop over there we should not think that this is the ultimate i have to chant the mantra like this then i have to sing like this i have to do like this this is the basic only as you are going to the primary school then the middle school then the higher school then the college then the university and one day you should say i know what to say and what to write and what to do so you must get the knowledge within yourselves constantly you cannot go on attending the classes and taking the notes you should have to develop that so from the bhaiti bhakti seriously you're developing and coming to the prema prema means love and we know as a person in love remembers the beloved constantly every time if he likes to go for eating something immediately you'll think oh if he or she was with me or purchasing something oh i should and constantly those are in love they constantly go on thinking about that sometimes they'll be seeing oh somebody's coming oh is it he or is she then oh no constantly going on thinking that's called prima they are doing everything working but at the same time some percentage of his mind is constantly on the beloved that is called prima bhagavatam krishna gives a very practical example suppose you are having the toothache and doctor gave you the appointment after seven days the seven days you are going on feeling that pain is going on bumping and you are doing everything but at the same time your mind is there and the tooth that pain that is there in the truth so that is the way if our mind is on god thinking of god constantly every time when you are closing our eyes immediately that the god's picture is coming before our eyes when we are reading when we are moving when you are doing this when you are doing that every time as i love god so much i like to see god all the time if somebody is singing about god i feel so happy if somebody is talking about god or reading a good book i feel happy that is called prema bhakti the love was generated but then finally about which the bhagavan sirama krishna is telling this is the last is devotion has different stages it will only say devotional path of devotion what is that path of devotion different stages are there and it says finally oh he no he to no cause no reason but i just love you that's called love for love's sake they'll be going from the distance they'll be looking at the beloved many of you know caitanya mahaprabhu is a great sage and he used to leave in the jagannath he was a very great devotee of jagannath and he used to go and he'll be in the last person in the main gate he'll be standing in the near the gate there's a big hall then the sanctum sancturam then there the jagannatha prabhu that the image of the lord caitanya mahaprabhu will never come in the front he was so famous even the king of that state they used to worship him if he said that i like to go they would have arranged the first seat for him but no he'll be in the end and nobody will notice at the back of all the devotees and standing on the on his toe he will be somehow looking at the lord and then forgetting everything you will be looking at the lord and that is called aurituki i don't have any reason to love you but i love you and the love for love's sake i don't need your blessings i don't need anything no protection let me suffer let me do whatever is happening oh god i only want to see you when they are doing the arathi the beautifully decorated lord and the wonderful fragrance of the flower and the incense sticks i feel joy lord and from the distance you should not be disturbed seeing my presence and my prison should not disturb anyone so that is the love if you go over there this they say he used to stand over there his body is to become so heated even the stone on which he used to keep his the palm has made a mark on that so that is the way complete devotion bhakti and then raga means i cannot survive i cannot live without you so much of attachment so much of attachment i cannot leave without you so that is called the love so this raga bhaktis ramakrishna is telling when the raga bhakti who get the raga bhakti only those that have performed many meritorious deeds in their past baths and are those who are eternally perfect eternally pure they have no other thought but god eternally their only purity and impurity what is the impurity thoughts about the worldly object and what is purity thought about the god the eternally perfect means they are eternally thinking about god only and nothing else devotee sorry the great devotee of god the prahlada his father never liked the god but the son was a great devotee many of you must be knowing that this beautiful story hiranyakashipu was his father and he was against god and he told no one should remember that god who uttered the name of that god but look at this his son was a great devotee the son was born in a rishi's cottage his mother was passing through that and then she went to that and gave the birth of the child and grew up over there and by that way he developed the love and it was as swamp krishna is mentioning from the previous birth and the perfect person so his love was raga attachment tremendous attachment to that god and he could never leave without that the father told if you if you are doing like that i'm going to punish you are going to kill you he don't no problem father you kill me please but because i don't like to live without god so if you are interested you can purchase that book prahlada in the very small form the before the children with the picture they have given so that illustrious that book that is there the prahlada story very famous this prahlada he's praying to the god and how he's [Music] [Music] free translation we can say the power of attachment of the ignorant people that they have for their worldly object oh lord oh god let me have that attachment for you do not remove my attachment love for you don't give me anything else i only want that love and nothing else so that is called raga bhakti i don't need anything but god bhagavan sirama krishna giving another example when a child he was playing the mother gave these and that a little doll and that something to play and then something to eat the child was happy for some time suddenly notice that mother is not around other people are there but immediately this child started crying and crying the top of his voice and oh mother please come please come then the people will give the child some other things but it's not okay that is called raga i want my mother bhagavan sirama krishna at the end of his sadhana he reached to that raga bhakti and he went to the goddess kali and because he was the devotee of goddess khalid dakshinesha and you have seen there is a sword that the mother holds he took that sword from the hand of the mother that image and started telling mother one second separation from you is impossible for me and i think you are not going to reveal thyself before me the only thing that i can to just to give me uh the satisfaction you can say by killing myself because it is unbearable physically and mentally unbearable i am going to cut my head and put that at your at your feet when he took that sword the mother revealed that is called raga bhakti unbearable separation that is not possible krishna said the raga bhakti in other places he said also so friends this way sirama krishna he is giving the teaching to his devotees those who have passionate love for god do not say such thing that i have done this i have done that oh brother how strict i have been about food but what have i achieved you'll never see no doubt about the existence of god and love of god no doubt should be there i have got so many things lord so many people are dying every day but i am leaving is it not that your blessings so many people are suffering but at least i am not in that so many people are not having the families not having a place to lay their head but you have given me gave me so much so this is the way he has so the concrete faith for god he will never ever complain he is selling like that new farmers give up cultivating if their fields do not yield any crops but hereditary farmers will continue to cultivate their field their fathers and grandfathers were farmers they know that they too must accept farming as their means of livelihood only those who have developed raga bhakti or god may be called his sincere devotees the true devotees sincere devotees who are those only those who have developed raga bhakti god may be called his sincere devotees god becomes responsible for them if you enter your name in a hospital register the doctor will not discharge you until you are cured those who are held by god they have nothing to fear the son who holds to his father while walking along the narrow ridge of a paddy field may sleep if he absent-mindedly let his father's hand go but if the father holds the sun by the hand there is no such things so that is the way sirama krishna in different example he is giving to make us understand the what is the raga bhakti is completely depending on god and the god is also taking care of that person is there anything that is impossible for faith the majority of the people they don't have the faith faith in the existence of god they have faith for many things now some people told oh here is a vaccine if you take that you will be cured we are not doubting we are not going to see what the result but simply someone told that this is the vaccine that we are going to give you and we are going and receiving isn't it we are having the faith and the words of those people they are capable people and they are supposed to give us so we accept that each and every step of our life depending on the faith all the important people those who are having their armed bodyguards they're having the faith on those young people they don't know their names they don't know where from they are coming but then they only know the agency who have employed them who have hired them they must be all right so he's so free and fearless in the company in the protection of the bodyguards with those who are also having the arms and accident may happen the one of the ex-president prime minister of india she was killed by the bodyguard so that may happen but we are failed having the belief having the faith plane crashes but the next flight is full without it may happen the crash it doesn't mean all the flights all the planes are going to crash nothing like that so when we have so much of faith in everything why not on god that is the question is there anything that is impossible for faith now the sudama krishna the god himself is telling if you have the faith in god dependency on god and the true devotee has faith in everything the formless reality god with form and all different gods and goddesses the formless and with form the true devotee will have the faith on both so i think friends we should stop over here so let us if there is any question we'll try to give the answer and then we will discuss about this the god is one in the in our next class so let us have that it's okay so the first question is from sanheeta banerjee she is asking how we should eliminate our desires in life how we should eliminate is a very good question the see when we were children we were having so many desires like so many desires we are having now as we are grown up are those desires are there still to go and sit with the friend and play with the dolls and exchanging the dolls all the children boys they used to have the uh the marbles they'll actually exchange those so many things we did when we were young we have given up how because when we have grown up we have realized those things are not necessary at all they're the children's thing so similarly when you are listening the words of bhagavan si rama krishna reading the gospel of sirama krishna understanding that these worldly things this name fame property money is sufficient if we are having only to maintain ourselves that will be all right so by that way when we grow in our maturity in spiritual life we'll be able to give up so that is the way we can and slowly slowly we can have that so thank you friend so today we have learned from bhagavan's rama krishna that the devotion so the last wednesday we discussed about the guru and about the brahman he gave what is that brahman now about the bhakti he said the bhakti are so many different types but stress was given under raga bhakti his teachings that we should develop the raga bhakti a complete attachment to god unseparable the feeling of that i cannot survive without god so after that and today let us conclude by saying this mantra bhaktanu is [Music] namaste foreign
