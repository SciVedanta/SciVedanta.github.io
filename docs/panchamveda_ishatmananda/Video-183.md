in this one speciality separated which is not mentioning in fact I think both the meter reader Nita means the absolute there is no modification and neither is a modification but the same thing again anything those who are reading the gospel of Ramakrishna we know the surround each dimension about the water when the water just in created it is that no form but the seen water with the devotion Expo so that is the reason Ramakrishnan all these green or green teas and sometimes he's mentioning you can see carpet using your eyes can't you see God with your openers meter and even in Theogony we are closing the eyes and completely forgiven the taking anything around and then going and marching in the absolute that is a part and at the same time the same experience we need open up our eyes and you see varieties of beings good bad whatever still need respect for their that is called I accept both meter and either both absolute and relative sacred and secular and sometimes some of the things that we do we think that it is a separate and most of our time this painting second lifting that is worth things the only meaning heart in an hour or so we see before the God I go to the shrine that is a sacred thing when we need when we proceed the devotees also say - please come immediately come to our shrine and with great joy this is our shrine this is my god and this burning incense sticks and the same daddies what's in Amish new speech both us in the kitchen and in the meeting with the people discussing and the simply going and sitting and meditating ensuring the light sing and we are in meditation that is exactly what is teaching when his disciple he wanted to go deep down in meditation many many times we did this he wanted to go in meditation and sometimes coming out technically food and the moms everlasting closing the eyes and going deep down in meditation every strong words he said I was thinking that you and me [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Selam initiative or stealing you want me to be less card if you have the desire for things now players so notice that this moment we see Nita and give them water see the income is absolute drama literally these worldly things constantly changing if you put your mind to this work then you are going to lose your spiritual progress the Phoenicians it says he shall shut me down Selvam you have to cover everything with the consciousness of God everything that you see so this is nothing but the God and when we do like that we do not see that these are all warning things we do not do that with for me feel satisfaction now the Swiss Adamo is not that we have to read the gospel very carefully in the first line the page 418 is the I accept port meter and visa Oh the absolute and delayed didn't say next Bell begins with I say to a shop chain she would not be able to realize God without renouncing the bishops I said in that case I should not be able to keep my organization together so that is more important my organization then god this is the difference the cinema Tichenor the God himself when you say that you must transform these worldly things as you think as worthy things as God manifestation of God the same way you have to meditate on the absolute here also disruption he was asking him to do that but the personality Location Location understand we see what happened my organization I have to have a separate ego this is my organization our organization these are our paths we are different from others without the Y you are going to do that what is the reason it is virtualization then the goal is the joy the happiness the please but we are separate from others at the same thing I don't realize God the God is nothing but happiness please now I think no other different I won't and this is the reason in the name of religion so many fighting so many blood shapes because of these misunderstanding it goddess did this whole world whether you believe in God if you are just for any religion all regions are doing this way God has created this world thing within hesitated use it that is now so he has to be each and every one with different feature language culture and we said to you what is your problem you will belong to the same family we don't think why exactly here is pointing out these and saying that is I should not be able to keep my organization there are I seem to mean I am asking you to give up the arrival special wording is using and right into our lives in any Scripture and some additional yes is unbreakable why because you have nothing but God with an anointed not believe it - no it is true so this is truth we do not know about us but the truth is we are cars and why nozzle efficiency because of you people who give me your God but what happened with that ego I super you know some some god ego just with me and me and my god so I'm ready cinema business a unripe the man is very good but the same industry man go [Music] but the joy of the bamboo meeting you won't get so unlike me and say we do some business and but there is no Jesus right people and the child of Giant Eagle completely depending on God child you I the consciousness is the air separation is the earth but at the same time dependence on God in all spheres there's called child Negro and sovereignty and ego of knowledge the Shankar Acharya check that the mother who they were all having the ego of knowledge why because they were taking the responsibility to spread this holy message to others and unless you have that little ego I had to do it you won't survive you will see the difference in my hand when he's working in the office every day coming back doing everything but see man the moment and then all the time all those people are busy around return like their while you continue to be like that I'm Richard I don't have any occupation so that is wrong I right this moment I was knowledge that I am going to give back to the society in different forms I can get the service to the society completely I have seen the bombs is our our destination house they have some responsibilities but those who are completely free not within the organization don't asado just alone they are going I have seen that people mom is so busy why it was a routine I had together I have to read five pages of this book then I have to go and paint in the camera then have to go for bathing then I have to do this after today and finally [Music] he's had to complete and who really means he imposed on his mind to take these the reason a man if he thinks that I can do in this way and yet and we mind is completely detest with worldly things where the being vain and the struggle all the gun but still you are PC you are helping others maybe that physically you are not going somewhere to help or distributing food and ease and otherwise you were just sitting and praying and green four hours four hours four hours 16 hours a day morning and then [Music] in the evening just routine [Music] the responsibilities and I must do all these things minute 16 hours and working I cannot listen to the strategies routine and okay but we may go to the office before they bring to God I am going to my office as well as well smithy and in the lobby she played the cover I am going to worship you this they mean between I do it to that then before evening then I come back and slowly this way if the life goes in this way you see and also many people tension these that the tension comes this not supposed to and some of the challenging jobs are there and the tension will be there but after that well this is the part of the job what is there no problem so this way you live your life happily and the end of your life because you very I enjoy if there is no tension if there is no other things [Music] [Music] [Music] the absolute the because there is nothing else to do everything that I see is nothing but the God then again you see one question that does godless prayers why should I have to leave in this body because absolute responsibility the that is the main thing I must have to go because I know the way what is government when I use it or not reproduce those some of the people to understand what the culture of course the way that also was not trivial but anyway I should take the people sometimes they where not knowing how to
