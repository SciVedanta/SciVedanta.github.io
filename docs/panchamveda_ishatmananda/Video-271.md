[272: Panchama Veda 272 : The Meaning Of Bhakti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHsaoKH6-2c)

good evening they are devotees friends before you start this our panchama way that is codes the class i used to wish happy new year to many of our the indian brothers and sisters and the different parts of india are they are in their own way they are observing the new year the bengali new year payload shock they say and the punjabis also and andhra and many other person asham all they are celebrating their new years this is the new year they start counting from today and mainly as a land of cultivation so there is to celebrate this after all everything is over winter is over and the good days are coming bright days are coming rainy it will be rain and they will cultivate and that is the celebration the society they always develop in this way as a action they mix it with some celebration so congratulation may the new year be happy prosperous and fear free the whole year even today and now also we are so much of afraid because we do not know what is going to happen but we cannot stop we have to move on we have to go on and so many different type of challenges came before the human society we overcome and after that once again we make the progress now we try we do we do our best but at the same time we pray to god with the god's blessings and our own effort we are going to be successful everywhere every time thank you friends let us begin with this mantra [Music] and we have many times explained this verse in english this is from the gopigeeta and the words of the god the lord that gives us the solace now we have just recently concluded our and almost in the part of the conclusion the kumbh mela there's another thing for the hindus they all go over to the source of ganga we can say almost the source dwar and they will be taking the deep and they feel that they are completely free from all scenes and that is the time they come concentrate their mind on god and to get the blessings of god the kumbh mela is also there and another thing is navarre three we are passing through the r3 and this is also the durga puja time and the actual durga puja time so nine the devils the shakti of the god in nine different names manifested and the hindus will be worshiping this is a great time for the hindus and at this time if we are utilizing particularly this navaratri sometimes the closed devotees when i talk to them i tell them try to increase your japa maybe if possible if you have time thousand every day and you reach to the nine thousand complete it in ten thousand then slowly come down again from nine thousand ten to nine nine to eight eight to seven like that come down so by that way you are purifying our mind we are purifying our mind we should try so this is exactly what the lord is telling and we are hearing we are listening we are reading and by that way our mind is becoming purified what is the purification taking the birth or just listening the words no purification means detaching from the worldly things mundane things and attaching with the divine things so when we are thinking about the god and his divine functions and this is called purity purity that is slowly slowly when constantly we are thinking and we cannot do it 24 hours so obviously we are trying as maximum as possible and the more we are trying to put the mind thinking about god it is becoming purified because that time that particular time we are thinking of god our mind is on god we are detached from the worldly things and what are the worldly things anything that is associated with the nama and rupa nama and rupa these are all temporary things that is worldly things friends last wednesday we discussed about the divinity is everywhere bhagavan si ramakrishna said that divinity is everywhere witnessing girish drama pallad bhagavan sirama krishna commented i found that it was god himself who was acting the different parts so so many people hundreds they observed that and no one thought in this way they were thinking oh this is the actor this is the actress he is acting in this way but bhagavan sirama krishna he saw god in different names and forms and that is called the god's realization only after god realization one can think in this way and this is the ultimate truth of hinduism it is one who has become many that's why hindus are always mild hindus are always broad-minded hindus are always accepted different types of faiths they don't hesitate why the basis is everything is nothing but the one the god and sometimes some people not understanding this and moreover in the in this in the social life political life and economical condition the people react that is natural that is different but when you talk about the spirituality when we talk about the religion and we when we talk about the hindu religion what is the ultimate of hindu religion realization of the one who has become many the ultimate knowledge of hinduism is this the realization of the one who has become many the god is one the brahman is one whatever name we give it is one and it is not having any other part also but at the same time this world is also his creation he created out of his own and then entered into it and all those things those who are the students of vedanta you all know this so god is one and he has become this universe this world that is the ultimate truth of the hinduism now man cannot see god on account of his ego the question if this is the ultimate truth then why we okay no other other faith hindus do us practicing hinduism why they can't feel like that why they don't see that even among the hindus there are people who are worshiping the vishnu will never visit the kali temple all those who are worshiping kali will never go to any other that narrowness is also there but that is actually it happens in the beginning in the beginning of the spiritual life it happens and slowly slowly it evolves it is better to born in a church but not to die there swami vivekananda said we can explain in this way in some ideology some ideology some thoughts some practices are good but that way we are growing up then slowly slowly the more we understand religion more we can feel that everything that we see is nothing but the god that is exactly what bhagavan suramar krishna said and when did he say that after observing a theater a drama an act look at it anywhere there is no difference between this worldly thing and the spiritual thing anywhere anything it can be we can think about that way that is the highest now the question why we can't see bhagavatam krishna says we can't see because we have the ego man cannot see god on account of his ego i'm reading from the gospel of sirama krishna the page the 679680 like that and because of the ego and what is this ego this is very peculiar many times you have heard i am telling if we try to analyze what is this ego we won't be able to explain what is this ego i i i i consciousness is there but what is this i suppose i say i means this body the body is changing what is this i at the when i was very young i was a small little boy now i am grown up a person so who is this i the small one or this one confusion if it is i is the mind and my thoughts the same thing the mind is also changing thought is also changing which is this i but everything all the bloodsheds in the world the human being killing human being because of this eye but they do not know what is this i is it not funny so if we can understand these immediately the whole mind will go and focus on something else which is called spirituality and that is why the gospel of sudama krishna is nothing but the veda the book of knowledge wisdom so this bhagavan sri ramakrishna says now how do we get eradicate the ego the ego is the problem we cannot realize god because of the ego and how to eradicate the ego then hinduism the traditionally they say traditionally means from the very beginning and hinduism to trust it is very difficult to trace out when hinduism was created because there is no creator of the hinduism so obviously this is very difficult when hinduism was created but that from the beginning of that we can see the rishis the seers and they realize the truth and from then onwards so we go back to the rig veda and rigbada realize that oneness that is only one the truth is one the sages call it by many different names that's all that was realized so far back now coming down that they have understood the four different types of people because of their temperaments and they said the gyana karma dhyana and bhakti these are the four paths that leads to god seeing divinity everywhere in everything that is the path of gyana bhagavan si ramakrishna said i found that it was god himself who was acting the different parts and the last week we discussed divinity is everywhere the seeing the divinity everywhere in everything is the path of knowledge gyana how it is by discrimination by analysis analyzing the thing all the time and if you are studying that the path of gyana the you will find that slowly slowly the vedantin will take you to that portion where they'll say jahal lakshana ajahal jahal ajahal lakshana these are the system by which they come to the conclusion it is not just someone told right this is this and everybody should follow no not like that this is very systematic and very scientific and they will go on telling you that now you discriminate and if the word discrimination is nowadays people don't like well you analyze in when you are analyzing then what do you find i am not going to go to that that is that we have already discussed maybe some other time we will discuss so this is the path of knowledge constantly analyzing things then we find yes it is only that divinity which is the source which is the creator and it created out of its own it is the material cause and the efficient cause that is the path of knowledge where they reach one that divinity that purity that consciousness is nothing but one the path the and the words of bhagavan krishna this is i saw everything the god himself second is the work bhagavan sadama krishna when the girish was thinking we have already read those part i am just referring when the girish chandra ghosh the great dramatist and he was telling that i don't like to work anymore enough is enough i like to renounce all the work and go and he never mentioned that he inclined to meditate etc but sudama krishna said no because he could understand the girish mentality's activity he is though he is thinking that he can become calm and quiet and meditative but his nature is different the sudama krishna advised him no no through work you can reach to the same goal and what type of works in the words of bhagavan si ramakrishna work is good but one should work without any personal motive this is important everybody is doing the work but the work with personal motive when you are doing the work with personal motive you have something at the back of your mind that i am helping you because afterwards you have to help me or support me in this this way that is not helping you to realize god though you are doing good work people are benefited it's good but if you want to realize god or the spiritual benefit that work is completely different swami vivekananda introduced this work unselfish work selfless work by the monks that is a revelation revolution in the hindu body completely the many of you know and he said this is the practical vedanta if you can see god because you are analyzing and you see god everywhere won't you go to help those gods and goddesses who needs at this moment your help feed them and help them to get knowledge so that they can help themselves but that is only in the attitude of a devotion i am serving living gods and goddesses as i serve the god in the temple and the stone image i give the hindus they offer the food the catholics also do the same they saw all the sacrileges the pure food that we are offering that should be given the same way to the poor people hungry people illiterate people you have to go and help them in the way they get the benefit they can stand on their own feet that is the practical vedanta of swami pibaya kananda and that is called unselfish work and karma yoga it is also said in this way so that also will help you to realize god then third comes if a devotee one can realize god through intense renunciation i am quoting bhagavan sriram krishna from the gospel of sudama krishna one can realize god through intense renunciation what we are renouncing this material thing what are the material things five we can say only the hindus are very subtle in that way and so many varieties millions and millions of varieties are there but they have only shortlisted five what is that rupa you can see the beauty gandha the smell rasa the taste and you can touch so this is the way the five organs are there five objects are there rupa russia shabda these are the five objects and five organs the eye the nose the ear the tongue and the skin you are feeling this that's all that this is only five you won't get six so that is the beauty this in the so far that in those days how they could analyze everything and brought it so this is called the word now you have to renounce that how you're renouncing because when you see some object you get attracted to that and you like to grab that you like to get that and when you are not getting that you become mad you become angry and you disturb your mind when you smell something the same way you are reacting when you are touching something or tasting something and hearing some words if you react in that way either you like to get it or you like to give that up because you don't like so attachment and aversion these are the two words we always use attachment and aversion if these two are there your mind is always on turmoil i like this i don't like that so this is the way you are disturbing your own mind you will never realize god so they say you withdraw your all your senses what is meditation people come to learn meditation what is meditation the system to withdraw the senses sends organs from the saints objects though you are looking but you are not noticing no reaction is coming because you see something the same way with smelling or hearing or touching tasting you can do that but no reaction is coming i don't like this oh i like it no reaction in that way so that's bhagavan sirama intense renunciation absolute renunciation renounce the world and that is a process you are giving up but we need something positive what is that accepting god you only can renounce when you accept god otherwise you cannot you cannot keep the mind completely vacant in that way you have to give something to the mind you give god and push out the world or accept the world and you don't get god and when you accept the world what happens suffering and when you realize god and give up the world what happened peace joy happiness which has been termed in sanskrit as amrit nectar so this we have to understand and this is called dhyana then fourth it comes bhagavatama krishna is telling i am quoting it from the page 680 of the gospel of sirama krishna if a devotee prays to god with real longing god cannot help revealing himself to him it's a promise it's a promise god will reveal himself before the devotee who is truly longing for god wanting god accepting god praying to god i cannot stand without talking to you seeing you please reveal thyself to me so if a devotee prays to god with real longing god cannot help revealing himself to him this is called bhakti and bhagavan si ramakrishna says bhakti is to adore god with body mind and words bhakti is to adore god this is the definition of bhakti according to bhagavan and he is telling this i will read from the book here the other day i told you is telling to giddish the meaning of bhakti what is the meaning of bhakti it is to adore god with body mind and words look at it just adore god and he didn't stop there he said with body mind and words why the karma what is the action three different way we do but we consider the physical action as action but we never consider the thoughts when we are hearting others with words what happened that is also himsah when you are thinking bad about others that is also himsa that is a supreme religion but sudama krishna said body mind and words now he is explaining with body means to serve and worship god with one's hands go to the holy places with one's feet hear the chanting of the name with the ear and glories of god with one's ears hold the divine image with one's eyes behold behold the divine image with one's eyes so this is called the body how the body the gross body what the gross body is doing is going to the pilgrimage holy places what are the holy places where we remember the divine place divine things oh here so and so lived and he practiced austerity he used to walk on these he used to lie on these like that like that we remember when we are remembering the holy person our mind is also becoming pure so sometimes the hindus have many many places so they always they go you will find the christianities uh the the jewish people and the islam the islam muhammadans they also go to their holy places and the same way they will be remembering so bhagavan sirama krishna is telling with the bhakti first is the body and the body serves and worship god with one's hand we are cooking for god cleaning the temple and cleaning the image of god that is the work go to holy places with one's own feet and he's going over there walking taking the trouble to go to the and then going on remembering at the time of working for god when i'm helping with the hands i am remembering god when i am visiting the holy places i am remembering god the remembering god is common if we miss that then visiting the holy place will become just a tourism you are going over there taking the photo and then coming back and having some that is all tourism you are not getting the spiritual benefit here the chanting of the name and glories of god with one ears we are having the five sense organs and we must utilize these five sense organs chakshu karna nashika jiva and talk for remembering god and behold the divine image when you go to the temples when you see the images and we look at that of the pictures of the divinity the gods and goddesses we remember them that that is the way and once with one's own eyes now with the mind with mind means to contemplate and meditate on god constantly and to remember and think of his leelah so these two go and when we go to the birthplace of bhagavan sri ramakrishna in kamarpukur in the west bengal do we go to that place till it is as it is when sirama krishna leaped into that humble cottage it's as it is can you imagine the salaam krishna lived over there when you enter the monks are allowed to go inside is such a small place i know you wonder how you used to leave just one small wooden door same door and very humble one bed is there that's all nothing is there and that also made of the earth no tiles and no bricks and nothing there so that is the place where suramar krishna lived when you go over there we become so humble lord we take your name and we are getting so much just we take your name and try to spread your philosophy your message that's all and we are trying to practice that and trying to spread that that is the whole thing that we are doing and we are getting so much from the society just because of you and you oh god you lived in this way now in the name of lord jesus if you go to the churches huge huge churches so much of property and how the lord himself lived he was not having any place to lay on he was not having proper clothings too no food so that is the god who comes and then he lives in that very humble way because it is not the world comforts that matters the name fame power comforts if you want that you are not with god god don't come but if you want god you have to renounce those things mentally and don't get attached to that that is the teaching with mind means to contemplate and meditate on god constantly and to remember and think of he is leela lila means divine play the supreme god all-powerful lived in this humble house a humble cottage i used to sit over here used to go over there in this village think of it so lila means the divine play then he used to sing he used to walk he used to so we all follow and go on because now the biographies are there we read the biography and follow the steps of bhagavan's ramakrishna he went to visit to this devotee and by that way you are constantly remembering the god when you are remembering god your mind is becoming purified with words means to sing hymns to him and chant his name and glories that's the reason the hindus they have so much of satotras and they will all memorize those and they will chant that shiva's totra visnu stotra in the name of lord krishna the kali bhagavan sirama krishna everyday morning they will be chanting in that way and they remember god because we are utilizing the our tongue also with the words the tongue i am utilizing for that reading the books discussing about him chanting the name of god i'm utilizing this particular organ and purifying my mind so friends in these three four lines bhagavan srirama krishna is giving the clear idea how to purify the mind if you go to the vibe churamani bhagavan is shankaracharya he very clearly said that you have to purify the mind how to purify the mind and sudama krishna here is telling utilize all the five organs it is so difficult to control them sometimes we are practicing meditation it is okay we cannot practice meditation for 24 hours so we are utilizing our feet our hands our eyes our ear our nose our tongue and we should go on utilizing them to remember god so that is called yoga karma sukushalam this is called yoga yoga means unification union union with god when we are becoming united with god every time everything that we are doing are transforming changing that to godhead we are going towards god whatever we do so that is the way we are purifying devotion is described by narada is suited to the kali yuga the narada bhakti sutra we are studying now the because every first saturday morning i give a discourse previously i was to go physically to the hindu temple of lemont and a series is going on and the fragrance of vedanta and in that now we are starting narada bhakti sutra it is all different sutras and wonderfully narada is explaining sirama krishna mentioned about it and what is the definition of the bhakti the devotion given by the narada the great devotee he said just two lines anyone can remember tada means that he's not telling he or she it is the devotion but along with the devotion it is the knowledge it is not he or she it is thought means that is consciousness and that consciousness which is termed as the brahman by the yogis narada is mentioning that the god is everywhere and it is so difficult for the ordinary people to concentrate on that everywhere god okay now we think as the lord is vishnu and the lord is in this form in this name he loves to eat he loves to play with me he loves this type of color we have so my concentration is going to that supreme god but the narada is telling third that consciousness whom we are thinking as krishna or rama or vishnu or kali or durga or ganesha is the consciousness all pervading urbita you have to give arpan urban means voluntarily happily i am giving what aquila all my actions and how i act in three different ways physically mentally and also through words and how i will give it to god just sadama krishna in the previous para he has explained we also discussed so this is the way you have to give to god everything oh god you have given me the tongue and i go on criticizing others and also thinking the bad about others constantly thinking that they should be abolished from the world and i love you no you can get some the other benefits in the world benefits by that way it may be i don't know but spiritual benefit no no it's not possible the spiritual benefit only through love and what is why i should love because god is everything so that is a complete demon spiritually some people the thing we are not religious but we are spiritual this is spirituality are you ready to accept this then you are welcome so this is the spirituality so how i am working through three different ways and all those i am giving to you o lord and when i forget you o lord i feel pain unbearable the the the bang that i feel within my heart unbearable sometimes when the beloved son passed away the mother and the father they behave now just like the mad people because the unbearable pain in the heart only mother can understand that only very close one who has passed away that person can understand unbearable when one feel that pain unbearable pain for love for god because i have forgotten god how it is possible that is called so once again when i forget vishwaran means completely forget paramob means the tremendous pain and restlessness for god the sudama krishna said in the previous days we have read restlessness for god we feel restless for so many things now feel restless for god that's why the hindus they developed the different attitude towards god sometimes mother's attitude to her beloved son so the krishna become the baby krishna and the rama also rama lala they call in hindi lala means baby and they will be going here there and mother chasing the baby playing with the baby feeding the baby baby don't like to eat the mother will be singing songs so this that way that is the love of mother towards her child so that is called the one way to be united with god the friends we then many different ways we can go here bhagavan si ramakrishna is telling it is better to follow the definition that narada has given friends i will quote from the bhagavata in the bhagavata also he says the what is this devotion and we are studying the uddhava gita uddhava gita we have already completed in english it is going in a regional language this uddhava gita where the sri krishna is disclosing many wonderful things to his friend and devotee uddhava here it says in the 11th uh the kind of book the four in chapter 19 verse sadhayati mam yogina na samkhyam and it says you cannot realize me by studying the holy scripture or practicing the spiritual austerity or renouncing or meditating or practicing the discrimination all the things that you you can do but you will own gate me realize me the way it devotee realize a devotee realizes and he realized with urjita bhakti urjita bhakti the word that he is using he cannot think anything else but god the complete love a divine love means complete love you cannot think anything else so that is called urjita bhakti unflinching devotion and the devotion there is nothing but the love sometimes they give the example pouring the oil from one container to another container there is not even a bubble no ear bubble it can be present that is pouring like that whole mind will go to god and that is the way it is possible ram prasad we all know that he was a great devotee of goddess kali and he said the root is the devotion what is that that people used to ask him how is it that you can talk to god you can see god you can go and play with goddess mother kali but we can't then the ram prasad is telling the root is the bhakti and the mukti liberation that is just so easy if you have the devotion he says means the maid servant and you can any time call the med servant and she will come the mukti means liberation means spiritual liberation is just like that just give a call and liberation is present before you but what is the source devotion devotion to god i will quote from arudha pancharatram this is a beautiful book narada pancharatram it is also on the devotion different type of definitions are there and it says this is the the definition of the bhakti bhakti is said so it this is bhakti who said the lord the great bhubhishma he was a great devotee bhisma vishma he was he wanted to die when he is lord krishna is present they didn't disclose to anyone but he used to worship he used to meditate on krishna krishna what is was his god and vishma wanted that i should give up the body when my lord is present krishna understood that so when the yudhisthira because judiciary was a very pure mind and yudhisthira again and again used to think we have killed so many people only for this the kingdom what we are going to do with this kingdom whom we are going to rule so he was constantly tormenting on that the krishna told si you have pra followed the raja dharma that was necessary etc etc but now then the krishna said if you you better go to the bhisma is a very wise person any question you ask he'll be able to guide you not only in the political the teachings how to a rule a king should behave a rule that bhishma can teach at the same time the highest spiritual truth also you can learn from him so naturally he became eager and he wanted to come and the king when the that time he was the king yudhisthira when he was coming many other people also accompanied him all the panchapandava five brothers and they all came krishna also came and krishna was standing just in front of the bhishma vishma was looking at the krishna and whatever the question the yudhisthira was asking he was giving the answer and with a smile you are asking me you don't know he's standing by your side the krishna the god but these people couldn't understand the krishna is that supreme god only arjuna knew the bhisma as because the krishna told him if krishna were thinking in a different way the people should appreciate bhisma this is the beauty of the lord the god they don't want anything but they want to give the name fame and everything to his beloved devotee bhagavan srama krishna gave all that power to swami vivekananda majority of the people they know of swami vivekananda but many they don't know bhagavan siram krishna this is the beauty of the god they don't want this they are very happy that my devotee is being respected by so many people so this is vishnu nanya there should not be anything else and momota means love so the love nothing no other thing should be there only love ananya mamata vishnu means the supreme lord all pervading that god vista visna that which is everywhere so that is the supreme lord they gave the name vishnu the one pointed love to that vishnu mamata prima sangata again the devotion the love prema sangata that should flow with the prema prema means i only give you need not to bother about me oh lord that way one way love that is called prayima the prema is the highest momota is love but the prema is one pointed love without any expectation that is called bhakti that is the definition of bhakti bhishma told pralhada has a great devotee if you read the life of prahlada they're so wonderful and it is full as if full of miracle it is not miracle because it is possible for god and the god can save his devotee in many different ways anywhere everywhere if the god wishes the prahlada's life demonstrate that we know the love of the lord for the uddhava and also narada so that is the devotion it is said by these great personalities bhagavan sri ramakrishna says it means to chant constantly the name and glories of god let those who have no leisure worship god at least morning and evening by wholeheartedly chanting his name and clapping their hands the srama krishna is teaching of giving the hints those who are sincere they can understand what the narada said narada way of devotion we explain whatever we do we think we say everything should be given to god how it is possible to constantly remember god chant the name of god when i am doing when i am working mentally i can go on repeating the name of god and then are also working sometimes the people they'll be driving for hours and naturally they are thinking so many things or chatting with the friends and that may create the difficulty while driving they always say but you can go on remembering the name of god because it is a thought only you cannot stop the thought you are not meditating the thoughts are crossing your mind instead of thinking these and that you just go on taking the name of god that is exactly what bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling that is constantly we are remembering when the mothers when the ladies are cooking instead of chatting and talking and laughing and doing this and that constantly quietly you are cooking and remembering the god you are getting the spiritual benefit while cooking the same way is everywhere the bhagavatam krishna is telling whatever you do go on many people i know when they are walking they are going on taking the name of god so that is the these are the secrets spiritual secrets so this is the way always we can follow sirama krishna is giving these advices the ego of a devotee begets no pride ego of a devotee i love this krishna and i am his servant i am a devotee of the krishna do you think this is the ego of course i love krishna there's the ego but this ego it is not a pride it's very humble we become very humble when we are praying to that god it does not create ignorance this is also the beauty the ignorance means we forget god and we get actors to the worldly things that is called ignorance friends we have to remember again and again the knowledge and ignorance knowledge here when you were talking particularly we are listening from bhagavan sri ramakrishna and also the hindu hindu scripture every time the knowledge means knowledge about the truth that is the one the god is one all-pervading consciousness and ignorance to understand these as that is that so bhagavan sirama krishna is telling the ego of a devotee be gets no pride it does not create ignorance on the contrary it helps one realize god this ego is no more like the ordinary ego is no more like the ordinary ego friends now it is time we should stop and we will start from here in the next class so afterwards and now i will request the volunteer if there is any question so please say that we'll try to answer the first question is from uh she is asking pranam maharaj how should we develop true bhakti towards god himself is telling and we were discussing that the three types of work we do the with the physically we do mentally and through the words so all the time we have to think about god as bhagavan suramar krishna say if you listen this lecture once again the when we're doing when we're working all the time we'll think of we'll never say any harsh words to others because the tongue it should go on talking about god taking the holy name of god and the thought also we should think about the holy people and holy other things so through this we can purify and develop the pure love for god the second it's more of a comment is asking we would like to visit the ashram tomorrow is it possible to visit um you can write to me you know this is a different uh platform and all over the world people are listening so well you can come of course you can come we are open for a few people but i would request the devotees not to put questions on this platform because if you know all over the world the devotees are listening they will be listening so this type of question they may not like of course you can comprehend the next question is from devashish he's saying work is good without any personal motive how can we train our mind to do any work selflessly quite often exception expectation comes in our mind when we do something good for others please advice so devas that this is again and again the practice this is very natural because by nature we are selfish we are egoistic by nature and because that only we have taken the birth this body now we have to overcome that where is our ego in our mind and how to eradicate our ego purifying the mind who is going to purify the mind my mind i am going to do that so you can understand so what we should do even if we make mistake immediately we will rectify oh sorry god i forgot this time i felt that ego next time i'll be more cautious more cautious more cautious by availing that way one day you will find that this type of egocentric thoughts are not at all coming in your mind so the prayer to god for his blessings and your own effort it can overcome our own effort i should say the next question from srimad biswas she's saying love calm of pain everything comes from god how can we control it see love is also coming and pain pain means the the misery is also coming god the only way to pray to god the god that dakshina mukham that sometimes there they say oh lord please show me your the benign face not that angry face that's why the god is creating sustaining and also dissolving so all the gods are doing that dissolving is dissolving that is the time is a the furious conde that situation he creates that time we should not go so we should go to god pray to god please always be happy and loving towards me go on praying and that will be answered the next question is from radha she's saying what is good choice listening to songs about god
