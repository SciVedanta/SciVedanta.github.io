[213: Panchama Veda 213 : Final Realization Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogsSnVKy4gQ)

today we are going to discuss the final realization of the one scientist was a very interesting topic but as usual start with this mantra Tahoe Kadam written the jeevan KO v militant calm asha shravana Mangalam srimad Adam Bree green and de buried Arjun ha we find that in the Gospel accounts along vishna page 572 he's mentioning to the devotees very close devotees he's mentioning over here no one else is here and you are my own people this is because the as Bhagavad Gita Krishna is telling the people don't understand me as God about John until mam mudha manusim tanum ours return param bhavam an entire practice this I the God in this human form but the moral deluded minds cannot understand me the Vagabond saddam krishna was very careful about it the he never disclosed his spirituality and divinity before others the masses only when his people who could understand him properly he is telling to them let me tell you something I have gone to the final the realization that God is the whole and I am the part of him I have come to the final realization God is the whole and the part of him that God is the master and I am his servant furthermore I think every now and then that he is he is I and I am he so this is he said the final realization now here the Avadhuta we are studying the bhagavata mean Sundays we have already come to this particular the chapter job chapter 1 verse number 72 here the Buddha also said my firm conviction from realization that the concluding one part now I wouldn't recede neither I perform nor I enjoy the past present and future actions I need them worked now what is the by far because the action and his result the pollutant is telling I never perform I never did anything and naturally I am NOT going to have that result of the action of the past present and future oh Tita the past Anagha the future caliber tomaron and the present world totally watcher Nakuru me I never did I have not done it not read and will not do it not one Yami I will not enjoy yourself et me ma'sha'allah mati he this is my firm conviction et me mr. Doherty the firm conviction he is telling about the Advaita Vedanta and the Vedanta it always says the Karma and is wizard work and his reserve and if you were clean work with desire to naturally the result will be bound you and for that you have to take it in and again the different efforts so that he is denying while Deva Katta Tata trailer he said while living I didn't do anything in the past I am not doing anything present but how is living he's roaming around he is eating talking to people and usually the spiritual people they used to do like that he was also doing like that he keeps so many teachings that was recorded and about Auto Geeta was a each chapter that the book is there and he said I didn't do anything I am not doing anything I am NOT going to do anything in the future - how can you see that he is not associated with the work so in a different way he is telling that I am NOT associated with the work hymns this world this karma is not binding me and completely free jeevan mukta hasta about autos jeevan muktha basta free by leaving now frames here we need to get some kills their clarity what is this jeevan mukta Makaha we are also free we are not bound by anything but at the same time we are bound by our own Karma suppose I have saved something when I became angry I shouted and naturally to us I felt no I should not upset like that so that is also the Karma and the reaction then someone who might loved his gonna be is not paying proper attention to me that also the pain I feel and somewhere I am getting the respect and somewhere not so all these things are going on so Tequesta bondages we always suffer it is always there we cannot go beyond that that is the line that the opportunity leaves no reaction at all it was not completely detached from that so Neil no reaction at all so he is telling a tilde negative karma birth to man madam temperature Nakuru me the boon yummy et me mr. Yarmuth ee the last Saturday so we had a wonderful discussion on another great personality Street Shankar he made Lord Shiva in Kashi where Shiva was in the form of a lowborn person and the conversation that took place after that conversation when the question of the Sheba and the form of a lowborn person the Shankara could reply so then he started telling to himself and that begins in the five slow curve y versus he mentioned that even a lowborn uncultured uneducated if realize Brahman can be accepted as guru this is my firm conviction so now we find the difference here the other tutor he is telling this is my firm conviction what that if you are not attached with the action then you're completely free this is my god convention and Shankar says and completely different perspective he says anyone from any walks of life if he has realized Brahman God he has every right to become good so we can remember when Shamim awaken the came to this country and he was not having any credential to represent Hinduism and he was not doing in our country the shadows the monks wherever they go the people are accepting them and they're giving the discourses here you need the credential that he never knew and the followers over there in India also couldn't give so they are saying after coming over he understood they met the professor harvard university and the professor wrote a beautiful later the ad mentioned here is a person who has the right to speak spirituality and if you are asking him the credential about giving and talking about the spirituality it would be like asking the Sun the credential to shine was given in the permission to shine is not to be like that so this is the realization of the Professor John Wright and here Shankar Acharya is telling anyone can be guru because in those times in India the caste system was so strong so dear Shankara he learned it he was a prom again even in the subconscious mind the distances were there differences were there so that is why this conversation took place friends I will remind you another person a great spiritual personality again and he is our shangela Sanjaya is the dita thing it allows us of the bhagavad-gita 700 the beta's local 700 verse and he is here also he saved your trap Yashiro krishna yet reported Anantara Tatra 3bj booty true Barney Dimity mama when whenever is Krishna the Lord of yoga Etra Yoga Yoga is shall the lord of the yoga Krishna yet report to neutral that vary with the barter the will durable venomous is taking action performing there our prosperity sri vidhyaa victory booty the development and the sound policy through Barney T sound policy that is the perfect ideal condition so this is my true Ghana T this is my foreign conviction who say now Sanjay the why Sunday is telling like this because he has seen that the Krishna and the Arjuna this duo they perform the wonderful things unthinkable things now his conviction is different we can understand Shankara this sanjaya's conviction and our our tutors conviction different isn't it the sunday is telling God's grace is necessary wherever the combination of God's blessings and the human effort sure little bit success so that he sees and I would do to say if I am NOT attached to the result of the karma and completely free not bother about the God he's convinced about his own discipline that I am NOT going to be attached or hankering for the result of the work that I am performing so obviously am free see here no question of God if someone will come and help but Sanjay I said no this is also necessary and shankara's conviction that is different what is that Shankar's conviction is the social country in the social condition higher level and lower level and all those things educated uneducated ethical unethical all these things are there is if anything it may be but if the man is a realized soul he has the capacity to become a guru that is his conviction and sadhana business conviction before I go to the rankest again we remember that another person also that is from the Mahabharata that is what the Ramayana and this our Mohave anumana he saved and when he was asked what is your attitude towards freedom he said wonderful way he said when I feel the body is a body attached to the body body consciousness then I am the servant of the Rama I am separate it's real Amma separate He is God and servant when my body mind it goes together in that condition that I am his part then when I himself comes when I realized the self the art then I am sridama are one as a revolution his statement I and my god whom I worship er1 he said they hope you are docile jiva-bhutah the dumb chikara dijo good day when the body is there then I am his servant but when I see no and ji I am NOT this body and not this mind but I'm also consciousness a small separate consciousness Jeeva then he says that unshackle heart mantra when I realized that Brahma Deva I am he so this exactly what we find in Provence Ramakrishna see Ramakrishna he is actually the prophet of the inter nation of the unity in diversity she also expressed the same conviction but in a different level where he said the same way as the maharajah stealing I am his servant when to enter the dwellest idea relished and qualified or tweeting and on Twitter they were fighting and 400 years the treating mr. Drayton and Advaitic constantly writing sadaqa stuck in he combined his three and he said all these three are the same the here is telling to interview sister Rita at Twitter seeing so sometimes I feel I am he sometimes I feel and part of me sometimes I feel I am separate from him so this is the conviction so in cinema Krishna say that this is my firm convictions the devotees listen to these words in deep silence so these are the realizations different people at different times realizing expressing with great confidence but this realization according to the situation Shan Jaya Jaya Shankara then about hota hands the ceramic fish 'no and maja BG see all their have written have had a beautiful poem is old this is he said no intermediate because we know there is an evil the whole this is on the river no it becomes frozen that becomes no again Odin river guns no again the snow is melting becoming deeper recurring water it goes on and on and on there is no angel wings now feasting still increases my conviction this is my realization he is unifying the three different ideologies those who are practicing that waiting they look down upon the treaty those who are practicing the Twitter they never care for that waiting they all always criticize them and if you read the postures ramanuja russia shankar raja you will find all the time they are calling and going on resizing each other and cutting giving the strong their own ideas and defeating the others but saddam business why not in different conditions different mentality all the same as Marvel DC now he comes to this one person he is asking that I feel disturbed if higher a misunderstanding with someone is a very practical ways daily spiritual practices where we do in mind the mind is the only place where we are practicing spirituality religion or whatever this person is asking is abana he is humbly asking the SAP I feel disturbed if I have a misunderstanding with someone I feel that in that case I am not able to love all so when is the heart of our journey in the spiritual life it always happened then someone who is very close to me and asked me doesn't like the religion or the philosophy that I follow I like to follow so obviously I always will know who this is the difference is okay let me adjust with him than a sadhana business answer then Salaam try at the outset to talk to him and stablish a friendly relationship with him if you fail to fail despite of your efforts they don't give it another thought in spite ofor effort if you fail to get the relationship developed the relationship then don't get the second part take refuge in God meditate on him that is no use in giving up God and feeling depressed from thinking about others now there is a beautiful example excellent example Meera buys like the Meera by the young Queen she was she was humiliated by her own people the mother-in-law sister-in-laws and all of those people they were usually and then her husband misunderstood her and after to go away she was thrown on the street and she was walking and singing never ever thought about things that have happened in our life see these people they misbehave with me and I never did anything wrong but they liked the name no complain at all no complain nothing only constantly singing and constantly meditating on God's state the songs where her prayers her system was style worse or the practices worst only singing and true songs she's to pour out her prayer her mind hers God and when she was going on during like that after so many hundred years now we remember those people who insulted Vida by because of a robbery we never care to know their lives her husband the King and the mother-in-law and the sister-in-law who don't get to know we win we read the Bible of the media why because we are interested to know hard biography how she practiced and what is this austerity they always say things spiritual life austerity is a must this is austerity sometimes we do not eat many of the ladies they're fond of fasting and almost three days in a week or four days in a week they'll be fasting this is good saving some food for others but along with that they also should think what I am thinking am I thinking positively am i criticizing others feeling pain because of the misbehavior of the others feeling jealousy these are the things we should observe straight we go and sit for meditation and now we don't do because well how will when they meditate through mind and what is your mind we cannot do so many things now you have to take that in a washing machine and you have to wash it wash and wash that all the color will go it will become white and then only you can meditate so you know that in India the Brahma chalice those who are novices in the spiritual life there are always wear white clothes the question is why because of these this color will remind him that I have to make my mind free from all other thoughts so it has been say like that different color we can save on saddam additional as a simile instilling color so great color is rajo-guna many of the parents of their spiritual practitioners of the earth they will never take anything black not even the pain if it is a black color normal take and then the trees and the other thing no no black color white tongue so they like to give it up so this is the way they always remind themselves mostly they like this saffron and white the saffron color is the highest that will all symbolism and it says always remind you that you are a dedicated one and you are completely free from the bondages of this worldly life so that is always whenever you see look at this color or these birthdays one of our Swamiji used to make fun the human he was in gold program whenever we'll meet a monk you say and this way was like funny you say hey why you are wearing this type of peculiar color your dad and your shirt and you Duty all and same color wife and we are monks yes that you should remember that you're a monk that you should remember that you are a monk so one of the Sharma T's he was a secretary one of the secretaries of the 10th president of the middle bar from going to the initiation I was then young and planning to join this monastic order and he called me as a young man are you planning to become a mom at what yes what do you do or do it like this then you said look you are having everything in the society for what all people are striving and now you are trying to draw into at your back and come and join in this life remember this all the time the mean free money physical comfort everything I was having I threw it at my bag so don't turn back don't leak then ebuddy strong already used don't leave the speed that you know what it is bad don't do that so that strong words delivery mind your orders fill conscious so this is the weight gustavo vishnu stilling frames are good relatives are good but when the Christian coming that shall I put my whole mind and soul at the feet of the God meditate tried to understand him then one after another different type of thoughts are coming because my friend is having suffering you try to be friendly okay but then you say okay no problem whole minding you to the god never cared for anything thence a great source of a Bernard these also the disciple of sri ramakrishna but you don't give up history trade souls such as Christ and Chaitanya have admonished us to love all beings so naturally if I have to love all beings how can you say that I don't care about nothing must love now you must listen to the actress answer of sadhana Krishna love you must because God dwells in all beings because of that love you must because God dwells in all beings what does it mean I love that particular person because is related with me I care for that particular person because he is interested in me serving me giving me gifts and saying hello all the time taking care of me I should love him because of this no wrong because the God dwells in that so bad salute a wicked person from a distance you speak of Chaitanya then his telling he also used to restrain spiritual feeling in the presence of the unsympathetic people in heaven express that chaitanya mahaprabhu he was a devotee and it was a mistake and his expression was different the misunderstand they will criticize so used to restrain this and Sreenivas house three bars house he puts reverse mother-in-law out of the room to sometimes some people they don't understand because in the spiritual life the first and foremost thing those who are sincere is driving first and foremost thing is to completely control your senses so obviously of all the things organs that attraction to each other different sex it is dangerous for the spiritual person but others it is something but what person who has already left his heart and home and hundred percent dedicated to God the male or female they must restrain and control in this way now suppose a diabetic patient and you keep all has already sweets before him what will you do when what is there is that let me try a little I won't take much it appears so that is why they will never talk about sweets before God diabetic person so the Lord is a no see we are also eating this thing so you also can then here you feel so is that all of peopleand so this is the way we must avoid but some people don't understand that so one person came I think last year he told how everything is there but you don't have the ladies over here all men I said this is actually I'm on a straight so naturally no no no this is not it's a modern society you should have their ladies also ladies children they should also be allowed and they are allowed when the program's up there they're coming Martha should stay here what is the problem and then it will be like yours you are having the ladies you are having that you will renew and evening in the home why you are coming and visiting us now for peace and holiness and that is the reason if we also leave with the ladies and you also having the children then you will never visit me maybe you will visit and I will also return visit a social thing so the holiness the spirituality you also understand it requires that is the first thing you have to understand that no emotion no question of Western and Eastern system and we are not 18 others the sluggishness telling you must love and then we come to this buna it was not he but others in any addition other question the ceramic distance study when I attained God I shall attain everything ceremonies needs come to these because most of the people that misunderstand there in the mosque they leave their heart and on the neighbor developed a hatred for the dailies now Nancy also there they never develop hatred for the males if they do they are not in the powered way their practices sound wrong things of the earth so this is no hypocrite but we have to understand how far it should go see Ramakrishna stealing my condition just like a B b-plus Stan I considered him as mother and son Kristen sitting about the relationship when I attained God I shall attain everything I denounced gold and silver saying rupee is clay and clay is rupee gorgeous gray and glazed gold he threw that and now we are searching with that because we have so many projects so we get we need money it's cooked sometimes some of the Xiaomi is able to make fun the ceramic is not through it so now we are searching in the Ganga it through that in the Conda and his poem who you are baby he said hey what you are doing and that's bathing no no no you must be searching gold right Saddam National threw it over the year me like this only the fun the provenance is smiling and he is telling that you must be praying to God sincerely Hofstra is sitting in the bar under master he is telling do you know what hosta wants he wants money his family is in distress he has debts he thinks that God will give him money because he devotes himself to Jabbar and meditation look at it God will give him money because he is devoted to God and he is doing the Japan meditation the God will give me the money can't God fulfill a devotees desire the very pertinent questions that interesting questions Shirley Island yeah I don't want God I don't want to realize God but I want to be successful in life is it not possible for me to get the blessings of God sure there are many other instances are there there was a wrestler in the Dutch nation you know in those days that was the norm that each people is to keep the wrestlers and the other wrestlers will come they will have the challenge and they will do that rather the wrestling and they'll be successful is the pride of the rich people this man staying in the temple and seeing hard people pray and the meditating he also started praying that he forgot to do the physical practices for a long time then suddenly a strong wrestler came from other part and he challenged this man so naturally became a prestige issue for the owner the owner tonight will have to fight and you have to defeat him this is my prestige he must be he became afraid what to do he came to sanam Krishna said I have not practiced this resting for a long time and I always do the meditation and prayer so what will happen simply shoot will you go to mother and tell her I love you and for that I have forgotten the practices now I only meditate on him pre-interview but my job is to show the strength and to save the face of my owner of my employ the Oh mother please help me this man truly went and prayed the other one he was going on practicing the physical exercises eating at least 50 eggs like that you were going on but he was beginning every stone and this man was going on fasting and praying the time came and you know ultimately just in one touch this temple wrestler one so these also happen if you are truly praying to mother and completely if you are depending on the mother the ceramic Krishna steady so can't God fulfill a devotees desire if it is he sweet will we will do but God doesn't take an entire responsibility for a devotee unless the devotee is completely intoxicated with extracted love for him if you are completely depending on God I don't know anything except God God will take care of you everything another this our ceramic business direct disciple that is a brahmana and the G and to the unknown the G both of them they were practicing meditation on the band of Utah and we do a practicing that well food was very bigger where to go and get the food he won't get up this Brahmin under so 300 used to go out and get some food and both up there wish to share one day a brahmana the she was telling who if I could get lucci and very good and Hollow is a kind of sweets and he was telling the truth yellow we forget even something tried to eat now anyway no problem say they were all 90 meditated next day morning one person came and he was telling you said you have to come to my house - why because the Rantala I worship the Sri Ramachandra what you've done that you reach the place of lama so i worship and yesterday night three times he appeared in my dream and he said hey my children are sitting over there they're hungry you must be pure Luciana you about them and feed them in the first opportunity you must done how do you know that he was telling about us he said no I thought you both over here sitting it was very easy for me to recognize so I have come this always happened oh so this is what Saddam honestly this is new it will he may but if you're completely depending on him he will take care of it sir it feels he is giving an example only a child who one takes by the hand and sits at his place who does that we have older people if a child is coming to a party to a player then there's someone will help him to take to it but what the person is supposed to take care of instead we will go and hold his hand and get there he won't like it also so this is the difference is a mother to be trifled with now he is talking this is talking about the the mother and the son before becoming a sannyasi Chayton a diva what hard to persuade his mother to let him renounce home so the human life mattered is the only one who gives her everything for the baby so this is the the slowest slowly the child should invite this idea create respect for the mother any sacrifice for the mother is nothing and if you live to become a sannyasi and give up this life you must go and take permission from your mother and then if you get shaken the mother went on crying to his mother Shankar Acharya of course it did little tricky so to persuade his mother the shankara's mother was never a cream for that he was the only child that two eight years old and his father passed away the widowed mother as she was she could not think of parting the son so naturally she was telling no it is not possible Shankar event on first in the one day of course this is a trait tickity he was bathing in the panda it in the river nearby river if you go to that place in the Kerala still the river is there he went and suddenly all people are shouting control of the crocodile so in the coconut I came in this morning aware from the cocoon I came but anyway the crocodile so the mother she was also very much worried about the tion there are the small little boy waiting over there Shankar told mother I cannot come up criminal holding me and now it is the last opportunity for me to get that sannyasa after the sannyasa just before death I had to take the sannyasa bow so that I am completely free from all bondage and desires of this world please permit me to become a monk her mother then isn't naturally what she will do this is the last wish of the son and she cannot help so she said okay my son whatever you like you can to shandur was a great scholar even in that eight years old immediately he too started chanting the sannyasa mantra and crooked I left him and common elementary the Shankara came up mother was happy action character mother I have already taken the vows of sanyasa I cannot go to the home sunicena not supposed to so I will for a few days leave in the outside of the home of our house and then I believe Shankar that is the permission but anyway he took the parameter each and every one of us we take the permission then and it is possible so this is the way it goes mother said she persuaded when I went to Brindavan I also felt the same ramakrishna went to brindaban and he was strongly willing to continue his life over there there is something and there was the woman's the saint lady sing and she also wanted to serve Ramakrishna there because within Saddam additional Krishna was there so she could feel that and she wanted to serve Ramakrishna's Ramakrishna also like that but then suddenly he remembered his own mother and he could not because Saddam additionals mother had no one so obviously she was depending on ceramic is not if serum gives to stay back we'll look after the map so he came back I didn't remember my mother that completely changed everything she was warned I said to myself my devotion to God will take two - its wings if I have to worry about my mother I would rather leave with her then I shall have peace of mind and be able to meditate on God Tenten are in his day why don't you say a few words to her about going home Phil huzzah the Pratap has done his wife told requested the Shawnee brahmananda rahul mahajan please go and tell my son pratap pratap as well as the name Pratap to come at least for once I like to see an a become very old I'd like to see this photographer status enhancing he used to sit outside the room of the Ramakrishna all day and who evil will come to visit Ramakrishna he will call them and say where they were going to visit this man never read anything doesn't know anything come and sit with me we'll have a discussion on the phoenician and like the head this is the hostel see Ramakrishna is giving this example why he was for sincere having new things here I think the Amish notice it completely different because the Weaver is sincerely dedicating himself for the God the God takes care of his family mother father everything everything the one half ashram II is our friend in the same year so he was the only son and when he decided after his education when he decided to become a monk and secretly came to Bolivar his father passed away then naturally is mother came the boy wingback and everyone start they don't even possible for him to come back again he persuaded the mother I should go as a coalition girl then ultimately mother brought him to the middle Martin told I give my son to you so the mother and mother became very happy and then all the other moms of the same age group they started calling her mother whenever she used to visit then we had minimum twenty mother what you have brought for us what you cooked for us and she brought something for our son not that at twenty surrounding then she slowly slowly the motherhood and receiving the love and also giving love to all that developed so that is there and she was only all alone she was a rich lady but she was all and on who will take care of the properties God took care of that we have in balloon water we have the law department there are many lawyers at the air or etc so naturally any problem balloon what is to help sending the lawyers and taking care so this is the way it goes recently I was so happy when I learned that a provision they have slowly slowly as the money is coming and the system is changing now we have developed we had constructed a huge place where the father and the mother of a monk and steam and the love lost him and end of their life the tech provision developed previously the mother could come and stay in kashi and because it is they separated and for the fathers is separate then they understood the father and the mother living for so long to be there at the end of the line we should not separate them so they had kept the permission and now it is there and I heard it is imperishable and Calcutta where is Calcutta so it is a little so there they have developed so create respect for the mother anyone's mother or father visiting the mounts of the Ramakrishna mission which immediately stand up and with older and said please come that respect all this they became so mathematician is telling and Krishna felt very bad and in one place he is stealing I was crying it brought me to tears in my eyes when a heart has not told that they will go back as the son requested wife requested mother requested but Hara is sitting over here comfort is there in the Dutch nation was better than that village so obviously he was spending time for there and apparently showing that he is a devotee but in reality it is not so Saddam Krishna never liked it and he is now finally telling Norah Ingram why not if there was very close to that man both of them entities to see it in a love discussion about whether the Brahmin is there or not God is the air or not the narrator was 18 years old and ashram was very senior but not Indus to daily my friend oh not completely framed friend over this that may failure so this portal thing they were friends and why didn't you say a few words to Rostov about going home the other day he said to me yes I shall go home and stayed here three days but now he has forgotten all about it he promised to see Ramakrishna the Living God but the poor man so this is the responsibility once you have become a householder it is your third mom it is your responsibility it is your religion to take care of your family and to maintain the family in the best possible way that you can afford so that is you see that very clearly but if you have accepted the monastic life then there is no question of thinking about any other thing except God now the people may ask why do you st. appeal for donation not money for us we never do like that the very close very close then we can say a cap will you please bring this thing for being that thing for me they also directly bring that is a separate thing but give me money so that I will do this under noon why will it bring for the benefit of the society for the benefit of the other people now we are trying to acquire a property in the Chicago's Worth where we are planning the five different things will be there meditation yoga Omaha D school of world religion all these things nothing for me maybe that when the project will really stop I won't be here and maybe somebody else will take up that this is nothing for me so one must be very very clear about it so it should be like this we are not asking money for ourselves for myself of course sadhu Seva fund reserve separate fund is there some people that we're giving money only for that but the maintenance of the monks and the nuns and particularly here we have four monks food clothing medicine and many other things are necessary so we're from the money will come so this sometimes we always say we do like to give it to the receiver or and if you say no I'd like to give it only for the feeding to the devotees or for the puja whatever you can say we would maintain that will this possible one gentleman told I can give you some good amount as a donation if you take up the work of feeding the poor people but no we don't have the mechanism we can't do it right now maybe in future sometime thank you for that is it now a lot of things that you are telling I am NOT interested only I like to feed the poor people do that so we will see in the future so if it is possible the here the devotees which we have talked about fill the teen drama business daily sometimes in different questions and answer and laters govinda govinda govinda the weenie discuss about the worldly matters or worldly things then islamist aesthetic naturally the mind becomes contaminated polluted and so now you have to change it how do you do that you have to take the name of Govinda Govinda and he said Govinda Govinda Govinda not John the name of Adi let them be a dish of rice and when the rice pudding so that is the best thing the further in Indians they always say gracefully the best thing enlarged the something different type of our taste that will be served in the beginning and rice pudding is the leaven launched because of in a particularly in Bengal that is the custom the switch should be lost this is the rice pudding so let us have the rice pudding then narendra started singing and that song completely the pedantic sound the one who is all-pervading or laterz meditate on him that is the song Thank You friends in our next discussion will read the occurrence of the October 1st 1884 please repeat after me need and y'know media on the loop of dong compa little bit grumpy he shall bottom but a Mischa medium tongue Ramakrishna [Music] [Music] hurry you wish Nirvana must do
