[236: PanchamaVeda 236: Why Don't I see God?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3fbbUHiE6c)

our Pancham evader the glasses with this stotra Tabaka thumb rhythm top TG Bonham Kobe be rewritten Calma shop 'him sravana Mangalam sorry madam go vegan on de bourree dodging aha so we are studying the account that master ma che has given that is Saturday October 11 1884 and today's topic to some extent and then other thing why don't I see God one person asks to see Ramakrishna why don't they see God but before we go to that let us recapitulate and the last time the master see Ramakrishna when someone was asking him said what do you think of tears avi we discussed the Theosophical society about what the founders and all those things now we find in industry see ramakrishna is giving the answer the essential thing is bhakti loving devotion to God do the thoose officed seek bhakti they are good if they do if Joseph he makes the realization of God the goal of life then it is good and this is Bhagavan serum Krishna he will never say anything or give the attention to anything except God why God is the only essential thing as in the Vedanta we say the Brahmin so from the bhakti point of view we say God is the only essential thing only thing so obviously when you think of something else the Theosophical society as we were discussing this to think god but at the same time in a mystical way that some people will come and they are very powerful they will do these so not like that pure love pure love for God that is the essential thing if anyone in any way loving God and trying to realize God ceramic Krishna is supporting him whatever the maybe the path so ceramic Krishna supporting them here is telling if the God then he mentioned at sang a song and through the song we can understand his mentioning is so difficult to realize God and he is the English translation of the song how are you trying on my mind to know the nature of God how are you trying all my mind in Bengal it says mon coeur Akita totally genuine not to add our guru how are you trying oh my mind to know the nature of God you are groping like a madman locked in a dark room now just close your eyes and imagine and that difficulty to realize God what is God we do not know as some of the idea that comes through the scripture sometimes some people will say in different way and mayority of the people not understanding the God without the realization just by reading and hearing and they will say this is the thing you should do and that's why the conflict between the religions why ignorance ask them can you say that you have realized God majority of them who are fighting for realization fighting for God will say I have not realized God they don't know what is God and if did Allah is God they will never fight why there is only one the conception of two is not there then what to do so this is the Ramakrishna's telling that love is the only thing before love you can love something or someone when you know so before love you should know some idea should be there and then second if you don't have that idea complete faith should be there the complete faith without the faith then there is nothing faith should be there and how the faith will come that's why it says the Sirdar in sanskrit this is Red Dog now I am trying to realize God but I don't know anything about God and I am getting some idea about God from where from the scripture or from the realized soul of the Guru's and what should I have to do I have to depend on those whatever they have saved and then I have to start my journey it's for everything those who are going for the climbing they have read description after that this place would be dangerous this is the time the weather will change all these things the map is there sailing by seeing the map by that way and it is most difficult million times difficult than all those things got realization why because you have to fight with your own mind a part of mind wants to God realize and the most of the major part of the mind doesn't want to fight is within the person so that's when he is telling you are groping in the dark like a madman continuing the master said you must speak of the scriptures of philosophy Abaddon 'te but he will not find God in any of these he will never succeed in realizing God unless your soul become restless for him - this is the mean the idea to realize God restlessness friends again if we don't know anything how can I become Restless to get that I don't know anything of something and I am trying I am becoming Restless to get that how it is possible again we have to go back to Sardar the faith in the words of the Guru in the scripture that's why in Hinduism the Sanskrit word Shraddha again and again it has been stressed on that ceramic Christian is telling you must have love for it then he is telling that you must be hankering for it okay but unless I have some idea and then the log will generate then the I will develop the 1.8 devotion for that and then I will forget all other things and and utilize my whole energy to realize God isn't it so it goes back to strata and what is that strata faith faith in the words of the Masters no problem see Ramakrishna himself the God in the human forms Ramakrishna he said I promise God is there and you can realize God now let us have the faith on that unless and until we are having the faith on that reading this gospel of the ramakrishna futile it's not it useful so on the basis of that cinema krishna is telling the scripture the philosophy the vedanta all those things will be of no use unless you done you have that restlessness you will never realize god on this your soul become restless so restlessness is the ultimate and then we jump to that infinite but the beginning is the faith faith in the word of bhagavati ramakrishna and what is that war God is there now one man is asking vagabond see Ramakrishna why don't I see God someone asked him why don't they see God there is really very good question so you say the God is everything you say the God is everywhere all scripture all religion a same thing they will say God is everywhere then they will fight with each other my religion is the best and not yours my God is the only God and not yours why this isn't it contradictory when we say the God has created this universe and then I say my God is the only God and your God is not how do you know the God manifested himself in different places in different form in different names what is your problem in there so unity in diversity comes through discrimination what is the discrimination this now this question why don't they see God the very valid question if God is everywhere if God has made everything then I am supposed to feel that it is God why can't I now sadhana Krishna is telling that one must practice intense spiritual discipline one can obtain the vision of God can one obtain the vision of God all of a sudden without any preparation at this point as they say in in the inner that in the court of judgement is they always say this point should be noted my lord at this in that this point should be noted are you prepared what is the preparation now we will see that in pancha the she it says that in the preparation means who portion are sasame thought we did Patti Bobby Taha according to the nature of the practices the knowledge will come knowledge you lead on OD call enum are Shasti follow ctbc Satara oppaya the Ishikawa dia Santas means ocarina and Shankar Acharya he said OD carry Adhikari means the person who is trying to realize God that is the OD car here the Hickory means that but then there is a description of the Adhikari but Balanta those who wants to study Vedanta they have these these these dis quality should be there then you work Adhikari and suppose you apply for some job then you have to submit your resumee and the air you have to mentioned I am capable to do this job whatever the responsibility because I am trained in this way if your singer goes and says oh I have learned them different type of songs this classical and these that I can handle the hospital without having any capacity of medicine and anything is it possible or I can handle their their soldiers know the capacity should be there and we are talking about the God realization so you have to have the capacity to understand about the God realization or you should do trained in that and that is called spiritual practice that that is called in sanskrit sadhana in there is a hindi song sodden karna chahiye manhwa they were mine manhwa mine you should practice austerity should practice spiritual austerities the sadhana and if the sadhana is practice in intense realization also will be very quick if the practice it not that okay we will see God all the long life only he have started we will see that you cannot do that from the day that's a Bhagwan see Ramakrishna said and all the time used to give that example a tip he came to a room any hard in the next room that a lot of money is there tip so naturally his brain started working who only the wall and if I can make a hole in the wall I am I can reach it to the next room and there's lot of money so what he will do he would sleep no he cannot he will go on searching for something by which he can make a hole without making the sound without alerting up any people so his activities would be thinking and he will do all those things to reach to the next room now the same way when you I we are studying the gospel of ceramic isne we have come to know that God is just over there only thing we have to control our mind how can you sleep how can you spend our time in other things and that is ceramic richness telling you have to be eager OD Cardinal our trustee follow City mishit raha it depends on the or decree the person how intense he is how sincere he is a genuine he is millions and millions they go to church and the synagogue and the mosque and the temple are the all religious people apparently but if you go down to the core what is that God only exists and nothing else is there there they will go then and never come back never turn back but no they don't do that why they go to that because from the birth itself we grow in an idea in a philosophy one should go to a holy place and pray to God so that God will protect that in this life and then afterlife also that is a that way but realization of God that is a completely different idea that's why many people they go to holy people they will touch their feet but they'll never allow their children to become Monk or nun no they won't why that faith is not there so this is the reasons Ramakrishna again and again telling I will prepare so he is telling over here when he asked why don't I see God one must practice intense spiritual discipline then he is as usual as his aunt he is giving the description you want to catch a big fish first make arrangements for it throw spies bait into the water get a line and a rod at the smell of the bait the fish will come from the deep water by the movement of the water we will know that a big fish has come that is then you have to catch the fish that means you have to make the preparation to catch the fish the bait and the line and the rod necessary and then your attention and your knowledge and when you see the water movement but then you have to understand a big fish has come again is giving another example you want to eat water but what will you achieve by simply repeating that there is a barter in the milk everybody knows that butter is in the milk but simply what looking at the milk and going on uttering a butter butter the butter will come up you had to work hard for it only does can use separate bottle from milk can one see God by merely repeating God exists it needed sadhana that is exactly what see Ramakrishna still it see very clear some people simply they will come and so don't believe in existence of God the head you can see a free country free opinion no problem but have you tried if you have not tried then this better not to say like that I don't know whether God is there or not that is ok but then you give a statement oh there is no God no it is not your foolish unscientific try and then sincerely if you try you realize God but depends on so many conditions it is on the mind only what is sadhana making the mind ready and what is the mind full thought with the worldly things and what is God realization exactly opposed it going to the exact opposite position of these worldly things the same mind which is already stooped in the worldly ideas and things and cravings and all that now if you have to prepare that mind for God realization you have to understand that yoga Vasishta it suggested very nicely and in a simple way every famous book yoga vasishta bunch of the sheet there all pedantic book yoga vasishta says moxuan wari to our pas de chat tuara but he gives theta it is said but he gives data there are four people the doorman protecting the four doors and well what are the doors moksha and after crossing them satisfying them you can enter it into the chamber chamber of liberation so if you like to enter into the Palace of liberation you have to face this for there guarding the door so what are those so how nice it is booting what are those there girls first is the Shama cleanliness physically and mentally one must be clean what is the physical I know we know that you go and bathe and choke you can use and the fresh the washed clothes you can wear you feel fresh so that is physical but that is nothing you have to prepare your mind also you have to clean the mind how you can clean the mind there is no stroke the people may try to find out this soap which you can one can eat and clean the I'm joking don't do that sir that you if you are thinking that how to clean the mind what is my thoughts now two types of thoughts are there what won the worldly thoughts while heaters come on the basis of me and mine are me Ammar that generates from the ego the I that sense associated with this body and mind and then I want this I want that I am happy all this this is worldly idea now we're going for spiritual idea so what we should do to clean that worldly thoughts spiritual thoughts so you have to read wonderful book spiritual books that you will get the inspiration so many souls they practiced and they realized God that's why the the books we should read that can give me the inspiration and proper guidance there are so many millions and millions of books everyone someone was doing something after retirement what to do he write a thousand page book how to realize God and if you go and say have you no know that I am NOT but I know I can guide you so this type of guidance says if we read those books the natural is a wastage of time they'll be cutting from here they're cutting from there go to those who have realized it so they will specifically tell you that these are the things one should do if you'd like to learn the mathematics you have to go to a mathematic teacher otherwise how can you learn that so go to a monk one who has already given up the heart and home because he understood that this worldly thinks the worldly bondages there's all temporary I should not the first Italian second he is only loving people he's sitting and talking to them only because of the love and thirdly he is completely unselfish these are the characteristics of a holy man go and sit with him learn from him and then only you will understand meditation meditation people are going on talking about that and what is meditation meditation is nothing but concentration on one subject and when why should I have to meditate on and so many different varieties names they have given and people that thing it is so easy they will try to do that as self satisfaction comes I have nothing to say about that but the Ramakrishna mission you will find the gurus the neighbor gives trace on the meditation but they always say you should develop at the total the personality how it is through work unselfish work then prayer puja devotion then maybe you have to go for the study Scripture so the bhakti karma Gianna and Diana and when you are meditating what you are meditating when you are uttering the name of the god that you have received from your guru the initiation as it call deeksha that mantra is burning like a golden the color it is coming out from your heart and traveling towards your Easter that is meditation you forget yourself he fork a doll around and then you see all the mantra all golden color just burning you can see clearly whatever the guru water each and every word you can see that is meditation why you have to go for all so many other things so that is the main things the ramakrishna is telling and here the juga burgesses ishyama they just one word Shama Shama dama purity titi casa da Samad on all been antic student didn't know these are the six things that one must have and here you go VAR sister he mentioned only Shama he mentioned all those so the physical cleanliness and mental cleanliness and naturally many qualities will also come be Chara the second girl he is bechara what is bechara understoo understanding that is called bechara true understanding what is it true understanding that I am giving so much of energy to achieve this and after that what happens or no it is not the final thing say again your to try to achieve these these it goes on on and on but when you are young if you understand this then you say no my energy I'd like to spend it this but it is very difficult because they associated with your past karma your past karma will force you you cannot do anything else we think we are taking the decision we are doing it we are achieving it we are suffering know everything the past karma whatever we did that is on our neck is forcing us this suppose you have done very good work in the past life then the good thought will come this world is not for me this worldly objects not for me I should make a straight path towards the god that is called a true understanding of this worldly nature anything that you see in this world is very very temporary I was just watching and nowadays different type of things come in the computer suddenly popped up the where the the before the Second World War the German fara he made that the bunka my god and it is so thick and all protected and three lines of protection everything was there then ultimately is a ring now they were showing and in the in that short film their room so what is there that man who was thinking that will rule the whole world know where had he been satisfied with some power that he got and then concentrated to develop all those people whole Germany I should make the Germany developed give education to the people and the brotherhood among the people who were living in Germany good at you and all other things no that would be a great thing for him as an administrator and people who remember through in the his pages of history go on telling it was a wonderful leader instead you are thinking I will conquer the whole world when ultimately vanquished end date this is called true understanding when you go and seek the ruin see the winds of the historical things to remember that understand that the Roman Emperor can imagine the terrible and then you go to the room you see all those places where these two asked to mean to fight each other till death or they'll be throwing a person before a hungry there tiger and you have to fight with the tiger can you imagine just go and imagine that Oh terrible thing those people did but why that is called true understanding whatever we go and see we have to understand truly if you have read the biography of ceramic resna wherever he went that was his bechara a bechara he went to see the Asiatic Society and see saw a skeleton and he took all these devotees and showed see this is exactly what is there inside every human being why you were so boastful so egoistic people what you are when you are looking and sometimes people will be proud see this is me what is there that much only some bones some arrows and flesh and blood and that much skin covered so that is the thing to understanding truly you'll become humble and that is the first thing in spiritual life the Shama cleanliness then be Chara true understanding temporary and permanent what is the permanent that is the consciousness which is in every being when that consciousness is not there even an elephant the huge beast is just lying down on and no no not it can do nothing so only that consciousness is important the beach are then satisfaction shunt oh sure the shunt oh sure the satisfaction comes when I am traveling in the path of the spirituality and giving up the worldly things you don't get all the things the people are enjoying in the world your friends are having very costly curves and and then the beautiful wife and the nice family and they are visiting so many places in the world enjoying the nice food and drinks and if you think oh my god what I have done I've spend in this monastery for so many years for nothing then there is no santosha there is no contentment you should be contented that I am very happy and I am trying to realize God and on the process I am trying to help people also to love them and to serve them I'm fine whatever comes to me that is all right let's call containment and finally come sadhu sanga forth the last person who is standing is the sadhu Sanga and if you don't have the sadhu sanga sadhu sanga means the realized person and his company why the fourth one here yoga Vasishta says the last doorman is a sudden because just after him you are meeting the spirituality or the liberation entering into the closed chamber chamber of the liberation of the King you can say so obviously sadhu sanga is the final and tear you are learning everything saddam krishna put it in the beginning first other sangha holy company or otherwise how you will learn when you see a man carefree in this world though he is not having anything then only you can say oh my god what type of person is this as the Siddharth the prince when he was traveling and moving around in the city when he saw the last person that is a monk the immediately within him it goes samskara told him this is the goal never gave her anything because it doesn't want the name fame or anything he is free why this world is nothing for him this sadhu sanga friends the four that is one is Shama vichara santosha chatter sadhu sanga Maha moksha dois read warble chitara chitara shamova Chara santosha chatter - sadhu sanga Maha now if we practice this for then we are ready for God realization so when this person asked why don't they see god Raghavan see Ramakrishna said this one must practice intense spiritual discipline as a human being standing on the threshold of world and God just once tape outside you go to world and one step inside you go to God very peculiar just standing in between one step outside you go two young people came today to meet me and I told them that never ever do anything wrong because that is the age they are both are teenagers so obvious that I told them if the frame say that come have some smoke or little drug that you will enjoy the bill the in life now don't ever do that never ever one step you give and you go forever our Shankar Acharya said giving the example of a ball which started dropping from the top and then the more it it was dropping down more it became forceful and he became impossible to control them that ball and it went on on on ultimately this to the the down below the mind is also like that don't allow it to go down always control it so this is the way we go God's grace is coming down to us through scripture and holy people and now what we should do the scripture any scripture in your book will open so good wonderful ideas high moral values all scriptures are full of moral values and then the big anta is goes one step ahead of the moral values and it says spirituality and what is spirituality knowledge about the consciousness and it is the Brahman so that spirituality how we will know in in one Sluka one words in the issue pony chariot says he shall become Adams album yet King jr. got Tom yeah got it never says don't tell lies don't hurt others love everyone it's because that is all beginning it is already done and all after those morality when you are completely prepared you were going for the university there each and everything that you see is nothing but the manifestation of God he Shama Shama Damansara bomb it is covered saturated with the spirituality the God so that is the idea now the question was why don't I see God answer of siddhaloka sneh prepared yourself how we will prepare we have to face the four people as if dois Rapala Shama then bechara then santosha then sadhu sanga you are prepared and it says Shri Krishna is the purusa and Radha is the prakruti it goes to that philosophy Radha and Krishna shiva and shakhty just it shows that a lady for mother form because it is the mother the creation comes so that's why the Krishna and the Radha he is talking about Krishna and Radha Radha is the prakruti Radha is the chit Shakti the Appetit that is mentioning about the Radha Radha is the cheat Shakti chit means knowledge and Shakti means power the power of the knowledge and this rather is having again the three qualities embodiment of the three gunas sattva Raja and Tama last few classes again and again we discussed about the SATA Raja and Tama those who are following regularly you all know it these are the three qualities that remains in the prakruti the nature the Maya different words have been used and that is the power of God who is rather the power of God and what is that and say adishakti Adi Adi means the Rd the beginning in the beginning from the beginning it is there because it is from the god the god has no beginning so our D our Shakti it is also from the guard resolves eternal and what this Shakti shutter Raja Tama and along with that two other power is there you all know one is it can cover and it can throw something else which is not true an example snake and the rope it is where rope was there and people thought it is a snake so what happened they covered the rope and then threw a snake on that snake was not there is an imagination where on the rope who did it I did it why because of that power compelled and at the power so these are the two power that cover and then throw something else which is not true and satureja Tama this is prakruti and a whole creation is because of this the cinema Krishna is telling Radha is the prakruti embodiment of the three gunas as you remove the layers of the onion it goes on like that in the British novel Scripture he speaks like this comma Radha prema Radha nick.com or other desire where from the desire came the Kama the desire where for the desire came from the Radha from that prakruti from the power of god that means from now if we were not having the desire desires we were free to wear from the desire cream and some of the philosophies they say they develop another conception they say it is all devil Satan devil conception the Hindu velocity Ashura but where from surah surah will come from the same God and God is doing nothing so what is doing God's power so like that here the bush never see Kimora da the Rada is so pure but that same Rada is having the power of Tama also the Kama the desire then come pre Mirada this is a beautiful conception loving God as my own so the loving God that conception love for God has the purest of the pure love without any expectation I love God only for love's sake and I am not having any other expectation that God will also love me I don't expect that I love him that's all and then Nick ta-da this Niki Radha is eternal Radha is eternal Brahma Brahman of the Vedanta and chit shakti are identical see ramakrishna is telling like water and his wetness you cannot differentiate you cannot make it separate the movement you think of water you must also think of the witness the moment you think of the water you must think of the witness unlike the snake the wriggling motion of the snake and the motion motionless neck and then it says there is poison in the snake but it doesn't harm the snake it's not harming the snake so that explained everything this creation is made of God God has created days in the creation we see lot of bad things as it comes down from God yes it has generated from God only but Dean the God is also bad no the extra magician is giving the example as the venom the poison is there in the snake but snake is not affected by that but when it bites then that person is affected to die so this thing we have to understand God is having good and bad power what I should do I should go to the good one so that is the prayer all the time constantly people the Hindus they always play when the benign face Oh God with your benign face look at me the goddess Kali in different form when she is destroying the bad thing that is called the Shoshanna Kali did one should not worship that Shoshanna college that is different aspect a mother that time the Prakriti the power of God is destroying the when I go we go to bhagavata Ramakrishna seduction our Kali this is a benign face of the same power of God we go and pray to God because that time the mother is there the very happy mode to help and to listen and to bless so this same aspect that we should not misunderstand that Oh Kali is bad because Kali is doing this destruction it is the power of God creating sustaining and destroying when the aspect of destruction comes why you have to enter into that at the time of prayer a meditation you need not you better go to the the first one when she is creating our second when she's holding a sustaining you go to that aspect of mother so this is the idea understanding the true understanding that is called bechara names and forms and nothing but the manifestations of the power of prakruti shita said to hanuman my child in one form I am Sita in another form I am Rama look at it Rama and Sita the old story goes in India if you go in the in different villages they will have the drama on that but who is Sita the Rama himself who is Rama Sita herself so there is no difference the Hanuman was little confused then mother Sita is telling I am in one form I am Indra in another form I am in Ronnie in one form am Brahma in another form I am brahmani in one form I am Rudra in another form I'm Ruth Rani whatever names and forms you see are nothing but the manifestations of the power of cheat Shakti the cheat Shakti that means the power of the consciousness everything is the power of cheat Shakti even meditation and he who meditates as long as I feel that I am meditating I am within the jurisdiction of prakruti I am meditating the eye is there as long as the eye is there you are the holding bite in the realm of the prakruti so you have to forgive that I then it becomes Dao you it becomes God or it becomes a consciousness that Brahman to aim to master ma che try to assimilate what I have saved slum Krishna when he's talking there are many other people but he is giving the special attention to master Varsha why because master ma she is going to be there is a main and the expounder he's going to explain everything through this book the he should understand first what Salam Krishna meant by all these so he is telling try to assimilate what I have saved one should hear what the Vedas and the Puranas see and carry it out in life what is the assimilation the teachings that we gate in the scripture or from the mouth of the Guru we should try to put that into practice that's called assimilation the one of our great leaders there he is aravinda then afterwards famous as rishi aravinda to talk about the Hinduism he said the Hinduism is not a religion is a way of life the many people quote it and misunderstand it Hinduism is not a religion Christianity is a religion Buddhism is a religion in the ISM is not a religion not like that of course it is a religion it has their and the do's and dont's it has the practices it has the systems it has the institution's but Hinduism it gives importance on assimilation assimilation means the practices so that is the reason Hinduism is a way of life the whatever we do we say we think is nothing but their spirituality nothing part the religion the way of life here is in as if we are breathing everyone is breathing and no one is conscious in that way so like that we are practicing spirituality but almost unconscious about it so that is a way of life the Hinduism is a way of life then he turned to the pundit with whom he was talking it is good to live in the company of holy men now and then the disease of worldliness has become chronic in man it is mitigated to get it to a great extent in holy company that is true the holy company means they talk about God but you have to understand the holy company those who are talking about God do they practice it then only is the holy person if he is not practicing in his own life hankering for name fame and many other things then is better to recheck and double-check to get the company otherwise so that is the reason one should the second their second door man is the bechara the understanding through understanding you are cleaning your mind you are cleaning your body and at the same time you should have the clear idea and what is you are going to do and with the help of whom the otherwise after spending a long time then you find oh my god this man is not true this person from whom I am learning is a truth they are learning from see Ramakrishna you are learning from March out-of-the-money Devi you are listening or learning from Swami Vivekananda you'll never find people like this and the host of spirit chill joints like Brahman and the tree Ananda so many so they're all together they have formed the Ramakrishna mission so if you come to the fall of the Ramakrishna mission read their biographies lead their teachings so wonderful and then you will get the proper guidance so that's why he said holy company I and mine that is ignorance it is very clear I and mine that is ignorance true knowledge makes one feel oh God you alone do everything you alone are my own and to you alone belong two houses building family relative frames and the whole world one couple they have decided to purchase a new house at a condo so they asked me what is my opinion I always say good if you feel that it will be useful go and then first you take the picture of Sri Ramakrishna Mar Sarada and before you enter into this officially we're entering take that photograph first and tell to mother and to tackle this is your place we are only going to stay with you over here that humbleness should be there then ultimate just taught and nothing else but if you are sincerely praying you will find that very homely and happy house the family life if it is not happy then it's a really really measurable life the people they can't believe each other they can't help each other what is that life so you have to understand this I am in a family life okay but the family life should be full of joy happiness me understanding each other and then it is possible this understanding this happiness possible when you have an eye to lagea faith both of you believe in that so that is exactly what C Ramakrishna said eye and mind that is ignorance anyone having those eye and mind this sufferer be kings big administrators big heroes they all suffer true knowledge make one feel oh God you alone do everything you alone are my own once a teacher was explaining all this to a disciple who will conclude with this beautiful story the ceramic is no saint he said God alone and no one else's your own the disciple said but remains revered sir my mother my wife and my other relatives take very good care of me they see nothing but darkness when I am not present how much they loved me the teacher said there you are mistaken I shall show you presently that nobody is your own take these few pills with you when you go home then shallow them and lie down in bed people will think you are dead but he will remain consciousness of the outside world and will see and hear everything then I shall visit your house so that was the planning the disciple took those pills and he ate and he followed that instruction and he laid on unconscious in his bed his mother wife other relatives began to cry just then the teacher came in in the guise of a physician acts that cause of the grief when they had told him everything he said to them here is a medicine for him it will bring him back to life but I must tell you one thing this medicine must first be taken by one of his relatives and then given to him but the relative would take it fast will die I see his mother his wife and other here certainly one of you will volunteer to take the medicine then the young man will come back to life the disciple heard all this first a physician called his mother who who was weeping and rolling on the ground in grief he said to her mother you don't need to weep anymore take this medicine and your son will come back to life but I am sorry you will die the mother took the medicine in her hand and began to think after much reflection she said to the physician with tears in her eyes my child I have a few more children I had to think about them too I am wondering what will happen to them if I die who will feed them and look after them the physician next called the wife and handed the
