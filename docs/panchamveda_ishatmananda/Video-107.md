[108: Panchama Veda 108: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L03SckjjycE)

calm Asha a poem stubborn among golem shrimad otha thumb booby grinning de barriga jana this gospel of sayama krishna is the conversation that was noted and at the same time when all the guided disciples including maschera Domini Davy was present it was published and they not only appreciated it they confirm that these was all the words were true master dominates that's why this is very very important most of the scriptures that we read we do not know whether it is exactly those words that has been altered by the great personality or not but here the gospel it is really that way excellent history was jaganath nana yatra jerin Mathew know is the lord of the universe jagannatha the lord of the universe in different way the hindus constantly trying to give this idea to the all people that it is all brahman and that brahman it has come in the form of goddess Kali and Sheba that same Brahman all-pervading Brahman in the form of jagannatha in the form of radha and krishna today when you will read the pages from the gospel of sri ramakrishna and we will see how see ramakrishna is describing this jagannatha particularly it was Nana yatra we take the god in such a way as he he is leaving and they take the juggernaut to the sea and he will bathe in the sea and after that he will catch cold and then they will give medicine and 14 days he'll be taking rest and all this but at the same time the idea is excellent the abstract idea it has been given in this form so the ordinary people can understand the jagannatha is having a very peculiar very special type of image the god is not having any legs the god is not having the hands God is not having the eye leaves but at the same time he is the jagannatha he is the master of the whole universe why because in the Upanishad which speaks only about the brahman again and again in a different way there we get the description tada a jetty toh nahi aati that do ray Todd anti-gay Todd intarsia sarvasya the do suruba Sasha beata is not telling he or she but thought that because it is consciousness and that is here there in distance in near inside outside everywhere and that is why the God is not having the legs we need the league's to go the feet is necessary to go from one place to another place but God is already present it doesn't need it to make people aware about that and he the moment he is thinking immediately everything is done so he is not having that hands also but he is the shark sheesh aruba constantly observing that is why he is not having the eyelids that is jagannatha here we also find the same way today friends those who are regularly attending today's the 108 offering of Kedarnath we have already completed 107 lectures discourses on the gospel em has reached only up to 267 267 pages still so big a left it goes on is just like a huge book in different way in different locations different ways Ramakrishna the moment he is getting some of the people nearby understanding their the capacity he is guiding them directing them we will read again from air and the hundred up two hundred in four CDs it has come each series containing twenty five lectures it is and then again after another 25 another CD will come today I am really very happy because when we do the jabba we do 108 they're usually the Hindus the count 108 so today is the under the 108 one and three more the master moisture to who wrote the Gospel he is mentioning it is a sunday july twenty second 1883 and here taking the advantage of the holiday many householder devotees visited sri ramakrishna in his room at the dictionary temple garden master Masha is using the word devotee householder devotees not that they all of them days to subscribe to the ideas of ceramic ISNA but they were believers so they are coming to see Ramakrishna to have to listen to him to converse with him that was the way to the dictionary temple garden the young devotees mostly students generally come weekdays sometimes the master asked his intimate disciples to come on on Tuesday or on Saturday now three categories we find one there is a householder devotees then young devotees the morn mainly students and third intimate devotees this is the almost like a inner circle intimate devotees the inner circle why intimate because they are coming in close contact with ceramic esna trying to understand his way of teaching the discipline that he is introducing for the realization of God they are appreciating it trying to realize it understanding it that is called intimate salam o Krishna in one place said he who has called on God sincerely at least once will come to this place that means in the present day the God has taken the form of ceramic Krishna and now he is giving the directions to the people how to reach to the God and that is the way it's a intimate and the very special is he is telling that they should come on Tuesday and Saturday today's the Tuesday why to use the insularity because consider very auspicious for spatial religious instructions so this is very very special we do not understand we cannot explain also why tuesday why Saturday why not other days it was the sea Ramakrishna and he used to say the tuesday and saturday is very auspicious people if they come and pray to god and you eat say to Narendra not his young disciple he was in difficulty and he said on Saturday and tea stay whatever you pray to divine mother mother Kali that is answered so go and pray to mother Kali so dis Tuesday and Saturday ceramic ISNA he was talking with the devotees and one devotee money Malik is giving the name and we know the different type of their about them also some of the descriptions are there this Monument Lee he was a Brahma devotee he was asking and he was telling to see Ramakrishna a monk who my mate in Banaras said that no religious experience is possible weed out the control of the saints organs nothing could be achieved by merely crying God God and he is telling that that was the the teaching of the mom now see Ramakrishna is telling do you understand the views of teachers like him according to them one must first practice spiritual discipline that his cell restrain self-control for beer rains and alike their aim is to attain nirvana Nirvana means Mukti they are the followers of began to see Ramakrishna immediately understanding the little confusion in the through the questions of the monomer League that is what we will do we are householders we cannot rest self-restraint in that way and when we are practicing sellers train and went over we don't have time so obviously that little confusion there what will happen to us immediately sir am Krishna stealing this is the path path for the Barrentine and here he is telling and extremely difficult path beyond the reach of the ordinary man and this is the speciality of ceramic dish nuh he is understanding the condition of the people sometimes the teachers they will of course they are telling the truth but not understanding the condition of the student are they able to accept it so that is the question so this way ceramic ISNA he is giving the reply this is possible then he is telling there was a pundit who was tremendously vain he did not believe in the forms of God but who can understand the inscrutable way of the divine God revealed himself to him as the primal power this vision of Goddess Kali in the vision of mother made the pundit unconscious for a long time after regaining partial consciousness he uttered only the sound kakaka he could not fully pronounced golly so through this the Salam o Krishna's experience about a pundit who was not accepting the form of God and in those days particularly 200 years the Britishers were ruling and naturally the rulers they were having lot of power so they were going on criticizing the Hinduism particularly pointing out that how can you worship God in the image how the all-pervading God who is covering the whole universe creating the whole universe all pervading all powerful how can you enter into an image of stone made of stone or wood or like that so that was the confusion most of the people couldn't understand that they could not reply so called Hindu lately years they could not on the reply Hindus were confused educated people they were trying to follow the Britishers they are converting many of them converting themselves into Christianity and some were trying to protect themselves removing the part of this image worship which is the major part of the Hindu religion the one lady came after visiting this Hindu temple in lemon and he was telling which is the real God there are so many images obviously they are confused they do not understand one God we can understand the God has created mind is also fixed that when there are so many to whom shall I choose that is the confusion they always think and in those days knowingly they were removing in the Veda both are there the Rig Veda begins with the worship of the gods and goddess ate so many lists of gods and goddesses then afterwards slowly they were propagating that only the fire is the god then again without that because people don't be able to accept it so this different type of revolutions and we can say the researchers if we do we'll find at different time different type of Todd scheme but all we are guiding to one goal that God is one and all pervading Hindu they accepted thought is only one but that God can take different form because he is all-powerful and at the same time is full of compassion he can understand I cannot conceive meditate concentrate without fall so oh god please I know that you are formless for me except this form so that i can see you in the bhagavad-gita when arjuna was listening to krishna and he was thinking is it really God he's telling that he has taught the yoga to Beaver shotta and all those when he was telling can you please show me your that figure by which you were creating sustaining and destroying out of compassion and love for Arjuna the God took that form in the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita bisha rupa gharshana he gave that darshan the form before the arjuna and then in the same chapter at the end of the chapter we find our tuna is trembling a man like him a hero he was trembling and telling please take this that form with which I am familiar Krishna once again took this so that proves that he is all-powerful and he can and Hawk tanem on you comparten brahmana rupa kalpana this is very important dr. Nam for the compassion for the devotees oh no comparto mcdonough manuka brahmana that Brahman which is all-pervading rupa kalpana here the master see ramakrishna is telling in this way and he said another devotee sailed said you made pundit badar sugar what did you think of him when did with da shower was very famous in those days not that everyone could go to him ceramic is not waned and he had his good followers so they owe someone wanted to know his reaction ceramic ish na was very very clear about his idea he said victor sugar has both scholarship and charity not spirituality he never mentioned that spirituality he is telling me the sugar has both scholarship and charity but he lacks in a region and he said afterwards the activities that badash agar is engaged is a good in charity is very noble there is a great deal of difference between daya compassion and Maya attachment these are the two words he used daya and Maya and what is daya now some people are coming and trying to help those whom they don't know at all they are not the Keaton keen or not even there as the same faith or in this same country that can partisan neighbor not nothing just out of the compassion the love they are trying to help them that is daya and without any expectation but the Maya the wheat attachment so we can say in this way compassion without attachment is daya compassion with attachment is my arm now see Ramakrishna say the Maya the is there also a bondage more in the master Mahad the writer he is asking yes it is salam Krishna said bought that concept is something far beyond the ordinary man but Toya is to be practiced not Maya Maya only concern for the Keith and gain his frames his own relatives own people and not for others and that is called Maya is for bondage and but the DIA the compassion for each and every one without any discrimination that gives mukthi but when we have practice daya helping people and at the same time not expecting anything for the love of god what is happening the mind is becoming unselfish when the mind become unselfish and it takes us leaders to the god and boxed ramirovic on the gift categorically the definition of God unselfishness is God when one can become completely one hundred percent unselfish he becomes God himself because unselfishness means complete unselfishness means forgetting even his own self that is called God when his look at these great people the great teachers ritual teachers we find that they are constantly thinking for the betterment of others how they will get this happiness the joy when during the wrong way just like the parents they'll be feeling how can I help them ma please help me ceramic ish knees praying to the divine mahakali please give me little helps strong health so that I can go to house to house to tell people to guide them otherwise they will suffer why the more they are attached to the world things the more the suffering will come physically they will be in comfort but mentally they will be burning day and night so I want to help them guiding them so this is called they are they are voltage alone look tomorrow vemuri a chopped alam teacher shamma the t show jamaat drone a team anita in the 16th chapter of the bhagavad-gita the first three sloka they're all so that they are they are both the issue the compassion for the beings without attachment see this ceramic is kneeling is good but even then big de sugar is doing out of simple compassion some time over that man is suffering let me go in here behind there is no philosophy the spiritual that is Ramakrishna mission the introduction of the work serving the people through the monk was the very first time introduced by swami vivekananda into hinduism the Dozen emission pradesh and Nia we are the decimation program Sonia she began things on yes but still Asami we become the seed go and serve the poor the downtrodden the illiterate now you must learn how to help them so they were giving their training also to the young show nations but traditionally thousands of years what was the practice for the Hindu shamea she go to your God guru sit at his feet learn this thing discrimination Vedanta then you go when guru is leaving that time also you can leave with his permission or after his demise after his passing away although his devotees will go scattered and they will see here and there and they will practice practice for their own liberation swami vivekananda said whom you are meditating and on brahman and the same brahmin has taken the human form and they are suffering they want your worship this moment why closing your eyes to see God within why don't you open your eyes and help them so that all comes from this but at the same time without attachment if I go to a good person and at the same time becoming a test with that particular person then there is a bondage so constantly alert i am going to serve the god in this body in this form so constant consciousness gives a wonderful force to reach God that is what trauma Vivek on the same through unselfish work through unselfish work one can reach the same goal where Buddha reached by his knowledge Christ by his prayer serve up to yoga and Jana yoga both are leading to that goal where one can reach by performing unselfish work and that was necessary at that time in the society then here ramakrishna mission is named vedanta society Shami Vivekananda he stablished the first began to society on the soil of America in New York in 1894 at that time he didn't give the name ramakrishna mission he gave the name vedanta society because the aiding the society you need not to go and do that type of philanthropy got here the people need the knowledge of the self they are constantly thinking that this body and the comfort of the body and this world it has to make so comfortable and like that we again they're suffering and so you have to go and tell them this is temporary make it good but for your stay that's all right but don't think that it is the permanent so that way practical Vedanta here in the West and in India and Indian Peninsula we go to different they don't need the religion they need food clothing shelter health care education so that is the reason there we are doing so ceramic ISNA is giving this idea they are and maya all true years together it was considered as the maya and naturally the bondages so they never touched the work but it's not the work and this is also again supported in the bhagavad-gita Sri Krishna is telling no one can even leave for a second without work you are doing constantly the work may be mentally psychologically in your thoughts constantly you're working physically you may not so you are bound to do work because the nature will force it to work portrait atrium on Arnie guna harmony silvassa so prakruthi nature will force you to work the one gentleman came today in your selling strategy I always feel like doing something so I was thinking if we could do here they could do in the air and you were the far away place how can I do it here so you have to come then only his fertility he is coming and trying to do wherever he goes he wants to do something so that is called bracketing Saddam o Krishna is giving you are doing good work very good many people I have seen and from America they always think about their native village from where they have gone they like to do something for that village either they are sending money or their why to that particular village so it is my village why to that group of people my people I know them why you were there because when I go back they will recognize me is it daya or Maya and if this is a Maha then it is what is again then after spending your hard-earned dollars of course you are doing something good but only a little mistake and that is again taking you people will praise you they will all the moment you are reaching over there they will honor you there's a great joy of course and your progeny your family will say the school building was done by my uncle or father or grandfather and maybe that you will be having a statue over there of course no one there to clean but statute be there you may have the statue over there all these things will happen but the ultimate so the gospel that will show you so you have to ask yourself am i doing the work of the air Maya that Sri Ramakrishna indirectly giving the end with the shall go was a great philanthropist but the problem was though he was a highly educated person but this spiritual insight was not there hence he was not moving towards God so here he says and then ceramic is not giving the answer to the question of aim is there also a bonded yes but that concept is something far beyond the ordinary man daya springs from shutup sattva-guna you know the three gunas sattva gin tama and these three gunas from here only everything is coming sat us at the reserves Rogers create and Thomas destroy but Brahman is beyond the three gunas it is beyond the prakruti none of the three gunas can reach truth listen to a story then again it is a speciality he understood SATA Roger Tama he is explaining now it is difficult to understand immediately is telling a story so that people can remember and once a man was going through a forest when three Roberts fell upon him rob him off all his positions one of the rubber sage what is the use of keeping this man alive so saying he was about to kill him with his sword when the second rubber interrupted him saying oh no what is the use of killing him tie him hand and foot and leave him there the robbers bound his hands and feet and went away after a while the third robber returned and said to the man ah I am sorry are you hard I release you from your bonds after setting the man free the thief say come with me I will take you to the public highway after a long time there is the road then the robber said follow this road over there is your house at these the man say it's sad you have been so good to me come with me come with me to my house then the that man also said oh no the robber replied I cannot go there the police will know it he is also a robber even the citta guna cannot take you to Brahman because it is also beyond the moment you are having this guna so we have to go when you pray about the ceramic ish na nila guna guna muy needy guna guna boy again and again the evening the prayer if you have attained it and if you are doing that this is the word has been used needa guna he is beyond satrajit ama again is guna muy why because he is performing the leela he is performing over here as an incarnation this world itself is the forest the three robbers here are shut the Rajas and Tamas the rabi man of the knowledge of truth Thomas wants to destroy him Raja's bind him to the world but satwa rescues him under the protection of satwa now under the protection of satwa man is eschewed from anger passion and the other evil tension other evil if it's Optimus now what is the what is how the Chateau is helping us by controlling our this anger and passion comma Asia crow the isha raj Oguna samad Bubba maharana maja pop mom Bettina Yabba Edina the Krishna he is giving that guy's to Arjuna who are the enemies of a human being only two gamma and closer the moment the comma the desire comes and if the desire is not fulfilled comes the crow de Gama ish crow the Asia where from the come at this dear Raju guna that is the special quality Raju guna somewhat Bubba from there they are born maha hashanah and ma popma that is the greatest enemies for the human being the comma and without meeting the desired think Rhoda and what happens when I am angry and other what happens then I forget everything what are the things they forget all the impressions that I am having within me growth odd Parvati some more some more Hart Smith a big drama when the croutha comes when I'm angry I'm literally forgetting everything and some people when they're angry they like to see I was if you open the newspapers they've lost everywhere the stories of these comma cruda and thumb shock these three things are coming one maternal uncle is suppose I don't know it's not proved appolicious arrested the maternal uncle has killed the two nieces why to get some property or deezer nobody knows now he is arrested he'll be hanged what is there is only for the desire desire to grab some property the poor little girls one is 13 and another is five they never knew anything they believed it uncle now this is the thing now this way the person who was thinking nobody will know so these always happen every time it happens but still we go on doing like this the history is the proof but still we do why Raju guna Sabbath baba first is the comma and then comes the Roger the desire but we never go to the and the protection of the sattva-guna so we have to take the hand of the sub through guna when it goes on like this and it says rescue from the clutches of the Rajas and Tamas under the protection of Satwa man is rescued from the anger and passion and other evil now here sattva cannot give him the ultimate knowledge of truth though it shows him the road leading to the supreme abode of god this is ceramic ashna never studied in Scripture but whatever he said no even the greatest scholars could contradict why because this knowledge came from within his revelations and that is called beta beta is not that someone is creating out up from his intellect he is sitting and then imagining and then writing all the great writers on the imagining some stories background is there over that they will be all developing and through the different type of using the wonderful words they are becoming very popular and then bestseller but be hidden is not like that is the revelation the knowledge we Dean that's why I have given the name Pancham aveda this is the fifth day that because already we are having four rickshaw Maj Trevor the Gospel of salama fischner khatam Rita in Hindi it's called bachan Amrith the fifth because this knowledge didn't come from any intellectual way is from the revelation what Brahman is cannot be described even he who knows it cannot talk about it there is a saying that he bought once reaching the black waters of the ocean cannot come back in the olden days people is to talk like that so he is just using that but no one can express what is Brahman because he is beyond time space and causation anything that we like to explain should come within this and that is why the sage is like jariv hirata and dr. 30 after realizing Brahman could not describe it a man's eye completely disappears when he goes into Samadhi after attaining the knowledge of Brahman now he goes on telling about the Brahman the mind must completely Marge itself in this that knowledge and that is called Brahman here when you see the theory of ownership we find a briga the son of a famous arisia baruna the brig ooh the son he is also the student and the bruna is a father at the same time he's the teacher so the Sun is going to his father not as a son to his father but as a student to his master and asking what is Brahman please explain then his father the master is giving this way yah toba imani bhutani jayanti ena jatani ji won t yet priyantha obesum basanti of his ambition t-that bgg associa that brahma t that is grandma ceramic is nadir it is impossible to describe Brahman and here the father is giving in a roundabout way you ask he selling try to know well that from which all these beings taken birth yeah to buy Imani these boot on it being giant a taken birth from which again that by which they live in a jetton eg1 tea and that by which they leave that towards which they move and into which they march that is Brahman yet priyanka obesum basanti t to the bgg haces hear about that you ask ask yourself that means you have to find out you have to inquire you have to go deep and then you have to find out that is the answer so Brahman cannot be described and here sri ramakrishna going on describing this about telling this that no one can say but we should try to understand because one can understand it how by following the instructions that has been given by the realized Souls and slow lead I said to kesha you should accept the Divine Mother the primal energy Brahman is not different from its of tea see this is the way very simple way very special way very attractive way one can reach to the brahmana so that is why salam o Krishna is introducing it the kisha was the leader of the Brahmo Samaj many of you know the Brahmo Samaj that time it was in the eastern India very powerful spiritual movement religious movement they accepted Brahman they accepted in vism the Veda weed out the any form particularly they were against image worships and macaulay they could not think of it even this ravine Donna taker who was also the member of the Brahmo Samaj and the leader of the Brahmo Samaj he couldn't accept that he could not help or shake hand with swami vivekananda because he was the follower of Macaulay so ceramic ISNA here is giving you should accept he is asking own ketchup gin and Keisha was so famous the primal energy brahman is not different from its shakti its lofty brahman and shakti what is Brahman is also Shakti Brahma and Shakti are totally one and there is no second so this he is telling again and again as long as a man remains conscious of the body he is conscious of the duality the moment I'm thinking this body I consciousness of course residue ality I am different from you the moment I am thinking I I am different from you duality then how can i say that i am not going to accept that duality so this is the argument of ceramic krishna it is only when a man tries to describe what he sees that his finds difficulty kashyap latter recognized kali this is very important the statement of ceramic ich nur tisha the leader of the brahma samaj latter recognized golly he accepted goddess Kali ha maybe wauconda when he was a young boy he was on also under the influence of the Brahmo Samaj we also refused to accept goddess Kali and those who have studied the biography of Saddam three Arab Shami vivekananda you know when he was in difficulty then see Ramakrishna helped him how he said you better go and pray to goddess Kali all through the life he was refusing but when he was in great difficulty his mother and the brothers they were starving there was not a moisture love food then what to do and cinema Krishna told that i am not going to pray for you you have to play yourself and heater I don't believe golly I am that's why I'm asking you to pray on my vehicle no you go under that circumstances when he went what he saw is not that image in dutch nature still the same image is there till now and it he saw not that stone image but the Divine Mother leaving and she's standing that was the realization of not in the nut once tries in the same day he came back again see Rama Krishna told a bitter again go again go three times he realized that and he was full of joy it says that when you realize God what happens tremendous joy excellent wonderful joy and to express that he told ceramic ich nur can you please teach me a song that I can sing so he taught him that song and here he says that Keyshia also accepted one day when Keyshia came here with his disciples i said to him i would like to hear him preach he delivered a lecture in the chin Johnny you know the chant knee is a place from where usually people they go down to touch the water of the Ganges there is a small room people is to see them that in those days it's still there the Chandni then we all SAT by the bathing heart and had a long conversation and these statement is very important I said to him it is pavan alone God alone who is one form appears as a raptor and in another as bhagavata the book and that is why bogof on dr. Bergman and he said please repeat bhagavath that is the scripture dr. the student and da gabon get the same the same God taking three different form in the form of a scripture the revelation of the Rishi's is teaching the doctor the disciple the spirent the minutia the student who is trying to realize God the same God taking the form of a student taking the form of a guru Scripture and then ultimately the Vagabond the Bhagavad dr. Bhagavad this is ceramic ISNA unparallel the way he explained things so critical things complicated things very simple all these three things I am also the same God at this moment I do not know the one boy is going over there I heard one person he was arrested wrongly with the Polish and then he understood if I know the law I can fight I can keep the argument before the judge he started studying the law there in the in the jail itself and then 10 to another he graduated then he told that i am going to once again you have to open my file and i am going to plead on my behalf he pleaded he proved that he was innocent so that is the knowledge when he went inside there Bob behind the bar what he was ignored but he had that capacity to gain the knowledge and he took the help of the law books and he realized those accommodate those and then are good on his way up the same way when you come to God we are all at free and shall I cross this or shall I not some people they are very fond of crossing it when nobody is here they will come and touch at least inside and they feel oh this white place is the most holy place than this carpeted so this way we always think know each and every place is only earlier than it everything and that is me I am earlier than that is a ceramic ishness telling it is extremely difficult to go beyond the three gunas one cannot reach that state without having realized God man dwells in the realm of Maya Maya does not permit him to see God it has made him a victim of ignorance so ceramic ISNA is mentioning the word Maya which is very very difficult to explain he's using the word the terminology Maya very difficult to explain and according to monier Williams there is a dictionary and it says from the Vedic period this Maya word has been used and the meaning of the Maya is illusion unreality deception trick magic etc but the Indian scholars do not agree to this definition this a note is not it's totally different we can feel Maya we can understand this is Maya what I am seeing what I am thinking I am trying to accept it in this form but it is not really that is called Maya but I saw I felt I touched it is my realization we can say but it is not in reality that is called Maya sometimes they will give the example of the Mirage the people who are there in the desert they are thirsty they want water suddenly they see the water over there a pond full of water not only what are the camels tains people dead trees everything is there then they go and when they try to jump into the water the poor fellow realize that it is all his own mental creation and that is called Maya Maya is like that it is not there but we feel it is there so that is called Maya and Maya it has been explained by the Vedanta is having to power covering power hour on a shakti then again throwing something else on that bhikshapathi a Verona and big favor so we're from this come this called again the power of God it is with the power but if it is coming from the God is God also like us under the spell of Maya no that is why they say ashura the god is my initial is the Isha ischia means the master master of the Maya his controlling Maya is ruling the Maya mais all only under his control but giba Maya Athena we are under that so that is only difference he's controlling Maya and mine is controlling us his elusive all this power that he is having easy using on us what we should have to do then again who can remove these in the bhagavad-gita again it says if you are becoming my devotee coming to me trying to understand me listening my words following my words then I will remove that Maya mayam etam turin today i will help you to cross this Mayan because i have created this Maya how I know how to remove it so that is all Maya and this septum or 11 we are going to every year with we observe these and we call it as a special function was called a fall banquet the fall banquet that again this time also we are going to do that it will be meadows club is a beautiful place at the big all one gentleman is coming from far in from America is the son of a famous magician and he will be showing will be depicting all the that happened in the 11 sep tember here the chamois be back on this life that through light so laser show will be there or come whole thing as if the vehicle is the air standing giving the lecture etcetera etcetera but it is not there so that is called Maya if a child looks at that and when we were all very young kids used to go to observe the same movies and the Turgeon movies in our time it was very premise and the Turgeon is standing like these and the lion is slowly coming and wish to shout Arjun tiger is behind you forgetting that it is a movie that is called Maya so we take that thing as so real so Maya this is Maya and then see Ramakrishna will be mentioning about the yogamaya I do not know whether we'll be able to reach up to that so that which is shamma is also Brahman why does the Divine Mother happy black complexion one person is asking this question and before we go to that I think it is already 8 30 so we will conclude over here to master Marsh I see Rama Krishna is telling one must accept forms of God master Mercia he was very close to see Amish and mastered Marcia salam Krishna understood the he will not misunderstand him so he was always careful to guide him once master Marseille came to see Ramakrishna and told yesterday I saw a dream in that dream I saw that I am inside water I am drowning suddenly found the Brahman is crossing walking on the water then I told how come that you were walking then he said there is a breach inside the water you can see that so you follow me and then you will reach to me and i am going to Bhavani pool pavani the goddess the pure means that city town so I am going to the place where the goddess leave you also follow me and then I will meet you over there the mastermind sheikh followed see ramakrishna now true master Mercia he is asking the all human being this is very important one must accept the forms of God do you know the meaning of the image of jagadhari the symbolism only he took the name jagged are three Durga cali jagadhari ganesha bishnu these are all symbols and if we can understand the symbols of God we find is nothing but the Brahman itself to Jakarta three she's the barrier of the universe superior of the universe the Divine Mother jagadhari revealed South's herself in the heart of one who can control the mind so he's holding what is the only what is therma the room is darin holding what the human qualities when he human falls down means what he goes down to the level of the animals his mind only goes to the level of the body and he is always trying to find out joy for the body so that is
