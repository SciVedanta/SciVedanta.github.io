[295. Panchama Veda 295 - “Pure Souls Are Veritable Manifestations Of God.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaTXFNu19DA)

good evening dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening we'll be studying the panchama veda the gospel of bhagavan siram krishna [Music] last week we couldn't do because there was some puja celebration was there and we completed one chapter that is the master and narendra and the wonderfully the so many different type of discussions that was going on the master was telling there is no harm in disowning your elders for the sake of god so when the we are going towards god going to try to realize god sometimes the parents they say no you should not go that is the time one can say no to the mother of the father or the senior people because this is a greater thing that we are going to achieve so this is the injunctions of the scripture and injunctions of the avatars also so he was doing like this after saying this he gave some example now today we will begin another chapter chapter 38 with the devotees in calcutta that is page 724 we are beginning it was march 11 1885 on the morning of wednesday march 11 sri ramakrishna and some of his disciples visited baloram bush balarama was indeed blessed among the householder disciples of the master sri ramakrishna often described him as a rashad dar or the supplier of store appointed by the divine mother to take care of his physical needs balarama's house in calcutta had been sanctified many times by the master's presence there he frequently lost himself in samadhi dancing singing or talking about god those of the master's disciples and devotees who could not go to dakshinesha visited him there and received his instruction he often often asked balarama to invite young disciples such as rakhal bhabhanath narendra on his to his house saying these pure souls are the veritable manifestations of god to feed them is to feed god himself they are born with special divine attitudes attributes by serving them you will be serving god so friends when we are reading this those who have already visited that particular house which is now a one of the centers of the ramakrishna mission the family of the balaram bush they have donated that house to the ramakrishna mission and it is a in a very a very important place and bhagavad-gita and that is the area anyone nearby can go and visit the and there it is written on the wall in a plug that it has been sanctified visited by bhagavan sirama krishna more than 100 times you can imagine that the old type of the jaminder's house the moment you enter the little courtyard and the office rooms and all that then the inside you have to go where the people used to reside the families they could reside there so still it is everything as it is and a open big space where now it is a shrine so that dear srama krishna is to go and take rest sometimes used to sleep over there and the devotees used to meet him there still it is there everything and there sri bhagavan si rama krishna went into samadhi for so many times so obviously if the after reading this and when you go over there we can imagine these are the places bhagavan's ramakrishna used to sit sriram krishna used to talk srama krishna to go is to go into samadhi and this is the place where he danced and so many things associated to the holy companion that this is the holy the word that has been used the pure souls the who are the pure souls that is the question always people they think that sometimes people they don't tell lies and they're not harming others and they say call it pure souls of course they are very good people moral people but at the same time you know in the bhagavad-gita we find in the 13th chapter in the 10th verse bhagavan sri krishna he is mentioning who is a pure soul the first quality of a holy person is is devoted to god is completely devoted to god and all the time bringing back his mind which is is naturally going out to the different objects of this world it is we are rolling it back bringing it back and giving it to god so that is the second bibita deisha sevitam is a love to live in a quiet place of course with some holy company why quiet place because when the other people are there different type of things are going on and that naturally influence the mind of the person who is trying to develop the spirituality so it is better those who are trying to develop the spirituality it is better to go to a secluded place with some same minds those will be also and make a routine that morning we will get up and after the evolutions we will go to the shrine we will sit over there for this one hour or so and then we'll come out read some books do some of these that are routine so that is the astonic routine sometimes some people they like to come to the astroma of course here we don't give that much another stress that you must follow but slowly slowly it is better to understand the astrama leaving means to follow those things to calm and utilize that shrine atmosphere the company of the worldly people the world people will be talking about different type of things with the politics and the social thing that is all arathiyana samsadhi so that one should always give up they should not be with them why because mind is one mind it comes on the surface of the mind and it impresses there will be something with be there in the mind so that is the main thing we should shun so this is the way we at bhagavan krishna is mentioning in the 13th chapter and he is telling one should completely dedicate to god second he always loves to live all alone living in a solitude or in the company of the holy people other other holy people and thirdly shunning the company of the worldly minded people these are the three so how we will know that we are becoming pure by this so our love for god hankering for god to know god that will be the first thing swami vivekananda in his bhakti yoga he has mentioned the who should can be the student the conditions necessary for the thought are purity a real thirst after knowledge and perseverance no impure soul can be really religious what is the impurity thought about the world thought about the selfishness for the colonel desires and all this that is impurity anything except the divine except the god is impure what is this impurities because it is temporary it attracts but then ultimately it gives us misery pain so that is the impurity we have to the purity in thought speech and act is absolutely necessary for anyone to be religious so we try a lot so many people are trying constantly in different religion in different faiths and different paths people are trying as because we do not understand whether we are making any progress in spiritual life or not this is very very important to understand am i making any progress otherwise years after years we are in this and we are listening to the discussions we are singing the devotional songs we are visiting holy places reading holy books but how i will know that i am really progressing so these are the main friends that balarambo's house where these devotees used to go not only that with sadama krishna of course the wayne srama krishna was not there when he passed away balarambo's house door was open for the disciples of sirama krishna as ramakrishna said that you must invite the disciples like the rakal bhabhanath narendra he mentioned to one or two mostly in those days those who came out and they were they were ready to dedicate themselves in the name of bhagavan suramar krishna there was no organization of the ramakrishna mission for the disciples of suramar krishna this balaram bush was a great help and sometimes some rich people they will help but at the same time they'll dictate they will watch okay you can come and stay in our house but at the same time they will go on dictating those holy people that oh you should not do this you should do that you should behave like this you should eat this constantly they'll be nudging they'll be dictating that is not the way one should serve the holy people they are free you are rather feeling that i am really blessed that i am serving god through them why because they are constantly thinking of god they are meditating on god they are they have dedicated their life for god so that is the reason that one should be humble balarama was very very humble he never we can never find anywhere that he boasted that this many shadows came and they stayed and even mahasaratha manidevi used to come sometimes and majority of the direct disciples of bhagavad-gita so we should read the life of balaram bush also very interesting so humble so capable and that's why srama krishna mentioned the mother the divine mother he instructed balarama to become the supplier the the helper you know in the bhagavata we find that the brahma he summoned all the gods and goddesses and the holy people that the holy souls they were there in the heaven now get ready you have to go down and take the human form and different forms to help the avatar the god is going to take the human form and he will perform some divine activities over there to establish the religion to make people aware about the righteousness so you should also go take different form and help him in that work in the bhagavata it is there when the lord vishnu decided to become the krishna at the time of ramachandra also all the other the banners this is not the monkeys that we find they were a group of people a sort of a tribal people they were educated they were cultured they were wealthy they were powerful that now we think i don't know why people by mistake that it is the monkeys no the animals no they are a human being but they used to have their symbol as a monkey now also so many people in the modern time also when there is a game there will be a mascot will be a dog a puppy and these and that so many so different table now afterwards if the people say oh they were all the puppies no it is not like that the mascot was that monkey why the mind is so restless so they wanted to control their mind they were yogis and they used to rule so many places so naturally we have to understand it clearly not the monkeys are the trees they're animals they cannot control their mind so they the people those who are there they used to worship the they they used to accept the monkey as their mascot and they used to think in that way they used to practice yoga they were very strong people similarly same way krishna they came and when bhagavan krishna came same way all these people they came they took birth and they were supporting bhagavan sri ramakrishna and this is balarama was one of them whose duty was to support sri ramakrishna whenever he will come to calcutta he can stay over there he can get food over there and that food bhagavan sri ramakrishna accepted it was very difficult for him to accept food anywhere because of the swathika quality the but balarama's food he used to take why big balarama was not having any ego the when the person is ego free completely then it becomes the purity pure person the surama krishna is mentioning and about the purity when he say talk about the pure soul we find that guru bashishta in the yogavashishta the guru bashista while talking with sri ramachandra he said how you will understand a holy person and very clearly he mentioned a pure soul and who fast is lower there is no greed there is no hankering why satisfied with god he is meditating on god he is praying to god and he is talking with god he is worshiping god mentally the naturally his lover the greed was not there should not be there so how we will know that a person is holy this is really very difficult so many holy people will be there all around different type of dresses different type of attires then how he will know he's a holy person it's not the dress it's not the place he's living maybe in a high altitude in a cave he's leaving maybe this good that he can do that but it is not the place it is not the dress it is not the food but very important his behavior his character what is that lover there is no greed there should not be any greed how we will know that we are making progress in spiritual life that is the very very frequently asked question the first thing we are free from greed and not that in one day the whole greed will go all desire will go greed means the desire strong desire not in one day he's telling the number slowly slowly it is becoming lesser and lesser then the young man he used to feel that i should have these i should have that like they're slowly slowly understood it is of no use i was thinking that if i can study medicine i will become a doctor i will become very happy i will earn a lot of money a lot of respect in the society then i studied and then and then afterwards i became a doctor i established then now i feel oh it is nothing the the joy the happiness that i i expecting it is not i am not getting from this and the sometimes some positions sometimes are people they will be killing others to become the king after being king he understand they won't know it is nothing like that administrators is so terrible thing so after seeing it understanding it knowing about them those clever people they give up the desires so lobo then mohawk the delusion delusion is this wrong thinking so if i become a king i will be very happy then after becoming a king why i have to all the time experience that i can understand by seeing others by hearing about them by reading about them the history book is constantly teaching us that everything is so temporary so that delusion will go slowly slowly about this the worldly attractions and means anger the loba moha russia so we are getting free from the desire free from delusion free from anger why anger dimension guru bashist because when we are not fulfilling our desire we become angry anger comes from that anger suddenly many people they say how to control anger so sometimes we say that it is you must inquire dissatisfied desire that makes a person angry dissatisfied desire so that one should be very very careful i am why i am angry there was a hidden and very subtle type of desire that was not fulfilled is not becoming fulfilled so i am feeling irritated becoming angry so these three are related the lover moha rusam the greed the delusion the anger when becoming less and less that means we are making progress towards the spiritual life the god realization then the second it says he is leaving surviving according to the injunction of the scripture what the scripture says the bhagavad-gita is the scripture and there are other scriptures also then you should leave according to these and what is that swadharma nidhanam sriya para dharma here also he says guru vashi stays telling karmasu swa karma what whatever is my duty it's my responsibility as a doctor as an engineer as a professor as a scientist as an administrator as a business command whatever that responsibility that i have taken genuinely i should perform that and happily i should do that why this i like it i have done obviously i'm doing so after that i'm completely free i'm charging my fees i'm charging some also having some profit after the business of course it is necessary and when i am working somewhere i am getting the salary so that is to maintain myself and my family nothing wrong in it i am not doing harm to anyone so from there i am progressing so karmasu but sometimes some people will be unnecessarily they are not but they will be showing that they are religious people after the retirement nothing to do so they will read some book they're intelligent they'll write a book they will then publish that and they will try to give some spiritual instructions wrong that is not his swadharma that is not his karma so one must be careful about that have you lived that life that you are talking about giving instructions if you have not then you should not just what is the injunction of the scripture the you whatever responsibility that you have accepted you must follow that diligently perform that without any attachment again and again whatever you do without any attachment do it perfectly as perfect as possible for you and then wash your hand offer it to god that's all so this way if you do sadjana then the bashi stays telling he is the pure soul bhagavan sarama krishna said that if you feed narendra who became vivekananda afterwards we became very famous by that name so if you bring him and feed him it will be like serving the god why he's a sadjana he's a pure soul how could he know that he's a pure soul he was having these qualities and thirdly i will conclude about this when according to shankaracharya shankara had a very wonderful method he will be asking a question and giving the answer himself so he asked a question santa means the pure soul sant means a monk recluse a holy person santa the key santi santo he is asking that question who is a pure soul then he is giving the answer himself first aquila be the raga look at it akilah means entirely beta gan raga desire one who is completely free from desire this desire is the main thing so when we have a desire for name fame wealth popularity all this progeny the desire after desire the whole world is nothing but the desire the wind that any desire is there that those who give up the heart and home most love the cases they can overcome the the last and gold lust and look like that so they can overcome but the great difficulty for those people is the appreciation that is the desire loko man in sanskrit the people are appreciating that is dangerous for a pure soul so you should be capable to expound the scripture give the answer this spiritual answer you should be able to understand the intricacies of the philosophy and because of your realization so that is one thing but when you are giving the talk or talking with the people or giving the sermon or giving the discourses when you are getting the appreciation you become very popular it doesn't mean that you are a santa it doesn't mean you may be a very popular person there are many people professors they're very popular it doesn't mean they're santa they're pure soul no they have a great desire they always keep the record and they'll be mentioning i attended that college i attended this lecture i gave this book i have written so many books and go on advertising why because of the desire so this is they say akila bhitaraga there is no desire at all aquila aquila means complete beta means gan raga and apost delusion the desire because we don't understand the reality of this world reality of this life so we are diluted oh that is a beautiful car if i could get that oh that is a sometimes when you read in the newspaper the the horrible type of the news's informations that a boy he is torturing the mother for an iphone for an advanced phone the poor mother how she can pay so much money but this boy is deluded because advertisement you must have to have this type of phone and these and that so slowly slowly people start thinking these are the things one must have i must have or otherwise i am going to suffer so that is called muha the delusion a pastor it should go the one is completely free from that this is we are giving up okay then what do we see there's some negation is there but what is the positive thing what we are going to accept shiva tattanishta then the third line the shankara says shiva tattanista nishta means a complete dedication to understand the truth a pure soul is he who has understood the futility of this world and living accordingly adjusting that whatever the work that he has to do he will do but without any attachment and then afterwards he is dedicating his mind to the truth shiva shiva means auspiciousness the purity the shiva tattwa it is not the shiva only it is the tattwa that means the truth what is the truth the eternal consciousness all-pervading consciousness which is brahman and that consciousness sometimes takes the form and sometimes without form it may be so this is the way one can so when the bhagavan sri ramakrishna mentioned they are pure souls how we will know who what is that purity how we will know those who are genuinely trying to make the progress in spiritual life we should know that these are the things spirituality means developing qualities and clearing the complete clear idea about the truth and all these doubts will go so two things are always repeated by the guru vashishta bhagavan sirama krishna shankaracharya and other scriptures what are two things first is moha a sanskrit word that means delusion why delusion because of the maya and what is the maya that is covering the truth and imposing something else on that that is the maya so that we are always deluded by that oh it's so beautiful so these so that now we are constantly running after that and thinking if we get that we'll be happy but the happiness goes again and again and again like the mirages like the miracles that happen sometimes you know that they will be showing oh this is the thing you will get and we jump on that and find it is nothing so by that we constantly we are cheated by the maya but still we feel oh some other time we'll be successful we will get the joy that is called more if that mohawk then the desire also goes away and desire for this worldly thing no i understood all this thing futility all this futile all this temporary i don't need that these two things when they go away from the mind and a positive thing entered into that because the mind is cannot remain backend so that when we give up the moha and raga that delusion and desire when you give up then mind become empty ain't that there it desired to understand the truth devotion for god that enter that fulfills that is a pure mind so suramar krishna is asking and so it happened that whenever the master was at balarama's house the devotees would gather there it was the master's chief pioneered in calcutta it was here that the devotees came to know each other intimately bhagavan sirama krishna he was slowly slowly developing a group of devotees whose ideas are very clear of course the rituals are necessary but why ritual that is also is necessary to understand that we are very fond of ritual because why because that it gives the lot of engagement when some rituals are going on some of the priests will come they will be chanting the mantra and the other people are there cutting the vegetables cooking and bringing the the flowers everybody is very busy and they are thinking they are doing some religious thing of course they are doing but after the completion of all those things what is the result whether my delusion moha has gone whether my understanding is very clear about this world whether my devotion for god has increased these are the questions every devotee must ask after the ritual ritual is always good it is necessary but after the ritual we should unders try to gaze ourselves examine ourselves the am i a better person today after this ritual otherwise just engagement just passing some time so that is why bhagavan sirama krishna is very very clear when he used to come and visit there will be no yagya there'll be no these no that only discussion and to encourage people some devotional songs sometimes they'll be dancing because of the joy to express the joy of devotion this is the physical expression the dance aim taught in a school in the neighborhood he often brought his young students to visit the master at balarama's house on this day having learned of sudama krishna's arrival aim went there at noon during the recess hour of the school he found the master resting in the drawing room after his mid-day meal several young boys were in the room aim prostrated himself before the master and sat by his side master tenderly how could you come now have you know school work so sirama krishna was careful why swadharmang the as because this master masha you know he wanted to become a monk he wanted to give up his family and all that renounce we can say but sudama krishna said no way you should not do that as a teacher you must teach the young people the students not only the subject but also the morality and the truth about life so if that is your sadharma by that way also you can serve god balarama in one way serving god master masha a teacher and he should serve the god in by performing his duty so when he is there the school naturally rama krishna is asking but not rudely or hey why you are here he very tenderly he is asking he could understand the master mahashaya was very much attracted to him he had a very pure mind all the time he wanted to listen to the different type of discourses spiritual discourses he has come have you know school work the master master i have come directly from the school just now i have no important work to do the recess period the people will be taking dress students will be taking some snacks so that is the time he has come then a devotee jokingly he is mentioning because they are all there he said no sir he's playing turran today so that means he's maybe he's adjusting his class with someone and that is that is the way so he is just joking with that all laughing sometimes students will do that sometimes the in the colleges also they'll i don't know in this country but in our country they used to have the roll calls sometimes the friends will adjust is a big class so that one will say hey when the teacher will ask my name that he will call my roll number you just say yes present he's not going to see who said that so that is the way they are true that is the he must have done that truant today aim said to himself he is solidarizing allah it is indeed as if some invisible power had drawn me here so when we were discussing who is a pure soul his mind is always attracted towards god sometimes i see the young ladies young mothers after performing their duties they come and meditate in our shrine i am so much impressed seeing their genuine the sincere attitude and hours together sitting over there meditating taking the name of god is the genuine love for god genuine desire to become pure so this is there at the same time if the other two are there so otherwise they are doing but there's no desire for the worldly objects in that way and they have clearly understood the temporariness of these worldly objects then the mind is pure as swami vivekananda said it is necessary to become a pure person how in thought in action and also in speech in three way one should be pure the master looking a little aim had a secret desire to renounce the hearth and home but sudama krishna never wanted that because he was having the children he was having his elderly mother and wife if suddenly if that person goes away what will happen suramar krishna of course he wanted that the young mind should renounce the world instead of getting entangled in the worldly things so he used to encourage young people but when one has already become a householder having children wife and household and if he suddenly leaves that responsibility we look after that family so sirama krishna looking a little thoughtful asked aim to come nearer he said please wring out my wet towel and put my coat in the sun see sometimes the holy people they ask for personal services why by personal services the man the person who is doing is receiving some the good effect because the holy person is constantly practicing the holiness by serving him they also get the benefit of that so that is the reason we go to the shrine we serve in the shrine we serve the god what the that is we get some good result out of that of course same way if someone is serving a really good holy person getting bhagavan sriram krishna wanted to help master the teacher he had a strong desire the surama krishna himself the god himself is giving the opportunity to serve when the people are reading oh why this why they should be they don't understand this by this type of services they become benefited we i remember one at the story that one of the direct disciples of bhagavad-gita he was sitting as those who have visited the bellarmore they can understand it's called old balurbar the old temple in front of that just by the side of that there is the double-storage building where swami vivekananda is to stay and below in the ground floor there's a big chair the bench is there still it is there the same binge the direct disciples is to seat on that sometimes after the morning the prayer and all that swami turiyan and the jew are sitting over there then one of the brahmacharyans those who used to attain them personally so cleaning his other what's called the clothes and all that serving him personally he was coming down from the shrine suddenly turian and the g got up and started rebuking him and he started scolding him then the brahmachary was perplexed he was confused i didn't do anything i'm just coming down from the shrine why the swami is so angry so anyway he somehow came down and he almost ran away from there another senior monk was there seating when the swami came back and sat he said i can understand why suddenly you are scolding him then turian ananda ji maharaj told i didn't scold him i was scolding and trying to drive away a bad soul who was trying to influence that brahmacharya this pure soul could see this now it's a mystical thing it is not possible to prove but these are truth that he saw as a bad soul trying to enter the mind or to impress the mind of the young brahmachari the young novice so so there these swamis are coming out to help them so this is the way the suramar krishna he felt concerned he called him and he was telling my legs and feet ache please rob them gently aim felt very happy it is not that the oe they asked for the personal service as a egoistic person and not like that and as because the master masha he was becoming pure he immediately understood why for what purpose suramar krishna asking him to do it aim felt very happy to be given the privilege of rendering these services to the master sri ramakrishna said to him can you tell me why i have been feeling like this the past few days it is impossible for me to touch any metal and that sudama krishna it is very special in his characteristic he couldn't touch the metal and in those days the the coins that were made of metals obviously so he couldn't touch that when the young noreen came to know those who have read the biography that you know this incident when young naren came to know the salaam krishna can't touch those coins he wanted to examine suramar krishna went out in that room the dakshinesha is always open all people are coming this young boy he kept some coins under his bed without the notice of anyone now sudama krishna came back after paying the homage to the goddess kali and other gods and goddesses there when he came back he just wanted to sit on his bed the moment he touched the bed he sprang there stood up and as if something strung over there he couldn't touch the bead then noreen saw that he felt ashamed he went from there went out he understood the sudama krishna is very very truthful he didn't notice something that those coins even those coins that was under the bed even then also srama krishna could not touch the bait friends you are free to believe it or not to believe it but sudama krishna the god himself he was completely that way he taught us what this metals forget about the coins these metals these are the main thing the people always anchor for the money the gold and jewelries and these and that the ramakrishna he shun that in shan when he gave that up it was in such a condition even the just mere touch of that was painful for him can we imagine that purity so that is cerama krishna he is asking and he is telling that to the master mahasha that i have given up and given up means hundred percent i cannot even be at the touch of it then he is telling that i sometimes told the mother mother please allow me what to do i have to touch the metal for some other thing like the drinking glass the glass is there i have to touch it and all but no nothing like that so it said mother i shall never do it again please forgive me this time then what he did he covered the metal some jar the water jar with a towel and that he was holding somehow he touched the metal and immediately that unbearable pain so he's praying to the mother i'm sorry so i will never do it again the younger norton often visits me do you think his people at home will object he's asking the master master and master moshe was a teacher used to handle the students he knew most of the families also in those days the teachers were like that very well connected with the students connected with the family of the students and so they used to go even talk to the parents so so it's ramakrishna asking master marsha about that young boy who is to come to him his old name was not in he is a large receptacle master mashay they said that the he can accept he can understand the spirituality that he meant by that then the master ramakrishna said that is true further he says he remembers spiritual things after hearing them once only the spiritual thing means there's a very subtle most of the time you will find even a very intelligent person he understands so many things but when you talk about the spirituality he can't understand that because of the dhi shakti the intelligence is there but these there he is intellect is very sharp we can understand many other things of the worldly things he can understand science he can solve the mathematical problems but the spiritual understanding that is it needs the the the sanskrit word that is a very subtle type of intellect that gives the clear understanding about the spiritual life suramar krishna mentioning about that young boy who used to come to him whose name was naren that not only that he can understand he can accept the spiritual teaching not only that he said he remembers spiritual teachings after hearing them once only he told me i used to weep in my boyhood because i couldn't see god that means that simplicity and the belief that the god is there and if i pray to god i can see god and that way he used to cry the master and aim were thus talking about the young devotee when someone reminded aim of his school the sudama krishna what is the time now a devotee it is ten minutes to one the salama krishna to aim you had better go now it is getting late for you you have left your duties to latu where is zakal he's asking friends when you talk about the swa dharma the one should be very careful about his own duty whatever the responsibility that i have received i have accepted i must perform that and truly i should do that willingly i should do that and as best possible way i should do that and i should not regret for that but at the same time i want to go to a holy company and i like to listen to the discourses of the holy people is good to do that if i go to the office and say i am present and then i am coming secretly without attending the duties to listen to the holy words no that is not good that there should not be any falsehood that is exactly what the bhagavatam krishna is telling that you may get laid you better go so because this is your duties after school hours master mashay returned to balarama's house and found a master sitting in the drawing room surrounded by his devotees and disciples among them were girish suresh balarama lattu and chunilal friends many of you now are acquainted with these names so they were nearby those who are living in calcutta they know those who have visited those places these are holy places now the girish ghost house was very close to the balram bosch house so he came it was the afternoon after the all of his duties they could come and sudama krishna was he came in the morning from the dakshinesha he took lunch he was taking rest he was talking to the devotees and now that all these devotees calcutta devotees they have come and sudama krishna the master marshall noticed and he's telling master's face was beaming with sweet smile because all these devotees have come and they are eager to listen to the to hear the surama krishna's words and ready to follow that then slowly they they are all well-established people if they are accepting it it will percolate in the society and that is the whole purpose of an avatar dharma sthabana re-establishing the putting the righteousness on the right track people they do follow that again and again as we are mentioning they do follow the rituals but without understanding why we are doing it they go to temple without having the goal what is the purpose of my visiting temple or holy places understanding is the very first thing one should have so when they all came they were listening ready to listen to the suramar krishna he was happy the master to girish sadama you had better argue this point with narendra and see what he has to say the girish was pointing something the girish narendra says that god is infinite we cannot even so much as say that things or persons or we perceive our parts of god how can infinite aparts it cannot this narendra was not in the means swami vivekananda afterwards he was not ready to accept the abutar reincarnation theory the god can become a human in human form he was not ready to accept that so he used to argue with the girish girish believed that god is all-powerful so obviously god can take the human form when girish mentioned that sirama krishna was amused to see that the young boy hardly it was 17 18 years old so naturally he was amused to hear the narendra debated friends we will stop over here the time is up now we will listen to this bhagavan sirama krishna what he wanted to say about this debate thank you this is any question the the first question is from virender majumdar he is asking whenever i bow down whenever i bow down to any deity of god takur and shrimah come in my mind is it wrong no but in the bible it cannot be that if your love for bhagavan srirama krishna and maharada though they are so close not having four hands or ten hands like the durga or kali but still they are god they are goddess why because the manifestation of the unique quality which is impossible in human life so they are gods so god and goddesses it's good that you are remembering them is always good thank you kamal chaudhary is asking if god has become everyone and everything in the world are all desires people have actually desires of god god has manifested in this way that that is the answers bhagavan's ramakrishna will give and we will discuss about the abu tahara in next class and we'll go a little deeper into that the incarnation theory in our next wednesday discourse the god has manifested but how he has manifested just by power of god so all that we see is nothing but the creation of god but they are not god so they this we will discuss in our next class in a clear way thank you sanita banerjee is asking how should we overcome how should we overcome unknown fear in our lives which sometimes appears in our mind so nita this is really really difficult to go beyond the unknown fear you know why because um naturally the human mind we are always afraid of unknown things but here only one thing we can have that is the faith in the existence of god and god is all powerful and when we are praying to god god will save us so by that way only we can have see how when in the pandemic how these people they were working the nurses the doctors and the health workers when everybody was shunning everybody was protecting themselves this courageous people they are going and not only meeting those patients they are touching them giving them whatever they needed not the courageous but many of them they mentioned that because of the faith first is i have to do this is my duty second the faith they're just courageous like the soldiers when the soldiers they go to the war they know anything may happen but with the courage they go and with the faith the god is there god will protect me so just like that we have to face unknown fear may be there but god is also there god will protect me i have that faith have faith and face the fear thank you savashish is asking can you please repeat the story of swami turyanandaji again that will be the long story so he was a great yogi he could see that's anything that is going to harm so he saw that a a bad soul is trying to harm that brahmacari that novice so being a monk of that immediately he tried to save him so that is the story in short thank you there is one more question jeff is asking americans work longer hours than those in many other countries to maintain our living our standard of living can we work too much and hurt our attention to spiritual focus jeff another sadharma as because you have accepted some of the responsibilities some duties so at this moment since you have accepted that work you must perform and then whatever little time is there you just remember god and if when you are remembering sincerely god i don't have time so only maybe 10 minutes 15 minutes i can take your name but whenever there is a possibility like you are bathing you are cooking you are doing some other thing errands driving go on taking the name of god that will be sufficient and when you are very sincerely asking god praying to god god i like to dedicate more time in meditation in prayer please reduce my responsibility know it for sure time will come you your responsibilities will be as bhagavan krishna himself promised that will be adjusted reduced in a very wonderful way everything that you want will be there at the same time you will get lot of time to spain for god have faith thank you very much friends let us chant this mantra and we conclude [Music] is [Music] [Music] namaste [Music]
