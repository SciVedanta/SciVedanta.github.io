[147. Panchama Veda 147- The Gospel of Sri RamaKrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lAwSn6ruGE)

let us begin the Bukit Hamlet um dr. jay burnham kobe be really dumb Calma sharp seven among golem srimad artem booby green and de bourree dodging aha here the ceramic is now in the new garden house of ROM ROM he is talking with people and very clearly he mentioned but it is easy to meditate on an incarnation of God God born as man so this way the last time we discussed about it the God he is born as man and is the incarnation and this conception is present almost in every religion and that gives us a very simple way to meditate what we want the spiritual development why should we have to always practice different difficult type of things when it is very easy at our hand so ceramic Isha is indicating at the same time the ceramic is not mentioning but there is another state in which God reveals to his devotees that Brahman is beyond both knowledge and ignorance here he didn't mentioned God here he is mentioning Brahman Brahman is beyond both and that is what one is knowledge another is ignorance this behind these knowledge how far we can understand how far we can conceive is impossible to conceive God who is all-pervading all-powerful like that and Brahman is all consciousness how a human mind human brain can conceive rahman so it is beyond knowledge knowledge means always within this time space and causation this framework so we want our capacity only up goes up to that so beyond knowledge it is not possible and ignorance also when it is ignorant too naturally it cannot understand anything about the God so it is beyond both at the same time we can say when we are talking about the religious thing and at the same time the worldly thing beyond both it is everything so that is way he is telling it cannot be dis described in words the Brahman cannot be described in words it is beyond the time space and causation the moment we have the capacity to describe anything it comes and comes within the purview of time space and causation and that very moment we can describe it it is finite anything finite is going to be destroyed anything going to be destroyed is temporary so this is what actually goes on the ceramic Krishna you look at this how I really wonder when always I read this book how sadhana Krishna who never attended in his school college or anything whenever we are assessing anyone we always try to assess according to his certificates that I have been invited in some place to talk and they're asking me can you please submit your all certificates that that you have studied I told 40 years before that made into a little more like not know whether they're keeping or not but I am not keeping the anyway always assessing whether that man is a knowledgeable person or not that goes on these bases are you having any certificate from anyone the wonderful sentence that Professor John Wright wrote about Swami Vivekananda asking him the credential to speak in religion will be like asking the Sun the credential to shine who has given the permission to shine as his own the BBA calendar is also like that about the religion that is ease so this what see ramakrishna when he speaks about the backand of course he was the student of Calcutta University and all this modern nothing and this sadhana Krishna without any fail and no philosopher can find out any mistake in this he is giving two idea one it is easy for the people to concentrate if they take the life of an incarnation how he was born how he grew up what are the things he did and how his life manifested all the spirituality so easy to follow that's why he mentioned at the same time he said okay if you like to know what truly it is then he is telling it is Brahman is beyond knowledge and ignorance it cannot be described in words then he said what exists exists that is in the catawba Nisha refine and the second chapter it says neighbor Bachar nominees are propped on shakuhachi shisha ah sweetie brew gato Anitra Gautham Olimpia T or C et that's all it is there suppose the teacher says it is there a steal a steal a steal and then just to give an idea a steve harty briam custom is existence it never a time will come when it will not be there was never a time when it was not there so in future in past in present it is continuing so obviously a sthiti bravado without other thing you cannot explain neighbor barcha the words cannot express the manasa the mind cannot conceive prop to shakuhachi xuxa and i cannot see it cannot reach over there it cannot understand anything so how can we have the idea ass tea tea brew bottle or net rocket inaudible of beauty how can it be known to anyone apart from him who speaks of it not he or she it as existing it is existing now this is the ultimate of the expression how many people will understand it only those who have really a pure mind the understands and that is the reason thousands will go for the celebrations very few will understand the pure philosophy it's very difficult because the conception so what we do idea of different gods and goddesses that that's why the Hinduism introduced this and that has helped thousands of people to develop morality if not spirituality at least a lot of morality and concentration their engagement I have to cook for God I have to worship God I have - and now planning is going on how many flowers you should purchase to make the girl and because Durga Puja is coming all the engagement is going on centering around God and someone someone is writing I like to prepare the lot 208 ladoos so I like to offer it so this way centering around God things are going on that is the beautiful thing and see ramakrishna is mentioning like this I know you wonder in the Old Testament also the God said unto Moses I am that I am go and tell to the people that I am that I am a CD so that is the reason even in other religions also when you read la ilaha illa-llah ha in the islam it says God is one and it is not - no comparison it is only one because if there is anything with which we can compare so naturally it will be limited but when we are keeping our mind into that soxhlet thing it is very difficult for the majority of the people to concentrate to develop the spirituality and without concentration without the conception clear conception how you will develop now I don't have any clear conception about the place where I am going and if I go on searching for that place it will take long long time unless and until I get a proper guide a guru who will take me and who is really capable knows each and every road he will take me otherwise it is not possible but in Hinduism they always say like that and there's a beautiful story she Janak she was roaming inside a forest suddenly he heard because he could not see and inside the jungle some people they were whispering they were chanting and in the yoga Vasishta it is mentioning in this way oh she does come o- Shira Shira means the head oh she does come Oh Cara Academy is the forum or negative no form no hate at the same thing or shisha occurred some stem but the same thing is present in millions and millions and forms names and forms it actually not having any form at the same time it is having all different forms and at the same time oh just some Tarentum swamp some had himself that itself is with Charenton is pronouncing to UM atmanam OOP asthma hey Dad Atma we worship now when Saddam Oh Krishna say now we can compare when it says it is that which is not having any head or any form but that which is present in every being and then constantly say I am I am we are worshiping dad how many people will be able to understand it not even intellectually and when you listen to these when you we don't carry anything with this and that is the reason it says the yoga vasishta that is the reason serrano krishna is telling this endure ism is God Concepcion immanent and transcendent it is transcendent it goes beyond at the same time it is imminent it is each in everything but at the same time beyond this so this is the conception Salameh krishna was telling and then he mentioned a man is able to see God as soon as he gets rid of ego look at it why should I have to read many other things I get the complete direction in just in one line a man is able to see God as soon as he gets rid of ego now what I should do I should rather concentrate to find out where my ego is working what is this ego and how it is working almost in everything ego is coming so much in a everything unconsciously the ego is coming no no no no I don't eat these I don't do these I am I am a very pure man I don't care that is also ego so we come here on that he was telling about bigger he said what do you think I am a bigger I don't care anybody bigger means you are caring that's why you're going to house to house and begging but I don't care anybody means what even then a bigger which depending and naturally caring for each and every one otherwise you won't be able to survive he is also telling I don't care anybody but he is a bigger so this also is the expression of the ego is so certain and so difficult to uproot so ceramic Disney is giving us the disc careful and so many people are doing so many other things going and meditating for one month turning 15 days turning this be persona these days so many other things are going on for what one gentleman came I want to sit in on one place for three hours that is his object good but Dean what suppose you practice for three hours afterwards what not very clear but he wants to do that okay go ahead without harming anyone if you are trying to practice that practice there no problem but unless we are having a guided goal clear goal where you have to go that's why I always say unless and until we read the Gospel of C Ramakrishna those were very sincere about making progress in the spiritual life for them only those who wants to have the idea about the Hinduism that is a different thing those who like to know and being to express something about Hinduism a different thing but those were various things here how we know that who is a sincere who is thinking that time is not there imagine I I have to go because the time is limited it is not infinite time I am having so that constantly it is coming to the mine oh-hoh today one day is over again the night has come that means one day is minus from my life and that pain and the fear coming in the mind every day I am stepping towards the grave I have to achieve something that is called the real spiritual aspirant and for him he doesn't bother who has written the book and where it has been written and what is can I get some idea how to deal eyes God because that is my goal I must have to achieve God that is the speciality and Ramakrishna is the best guide and he is telling in this way a man is able to see God as soon as he gets rid of ego and then he said the more you advanced was God the less he will give you worldly duties to perform there is also the indication the desire to do the worldly duties will be less than not that just I am giving up and then I am thinking I am spiritual no that is also some lazy people the thinking that way Oh Abner I'm not doing anything I am sitting outside constantly smoking observing people or the vehicles passing and that was spending time or talking with the friends and playing cards they are not spiritual aspirant they're lazy people and really those people who are eager they will never ever spend a moment without this what is that goes on remembering God that is three he is telling it is extremely difficult to proceed towards God while leading the life of a householder ceramic is an immediately telling why so what about the yoga our practice most of the time we think it is really impossible to practice spiritual life while we are working but see Ramakrishna is telling what about the yoga practice then he is giving an example from the his own life what he observed in the kimitaka his birthplace I have seen the women of the carpenter families sailing flattened rice let me tell you how alert they are while doing their business the best of the husking machine that flattens the paddy constantly falls into the hole the mortar I don't know how many of you have seen it but in the olden times is to come like this all the husking machine that is two ladies they used to pressurize at the back of it is to go up then there's to release and used to come down on the particular part and one lady will be sitting over there constantly changing that no machine is all by hand now that pert lady who is sitting over there and she's so careful that she is not getting the heart and particularly hand she is going on using into that particular hole where it is coming and falling if the timing is little this side of that side it'll bound her hand so that carefulness ceramic is not mentioning that the hole of the mortar the woman turns the paddy in the hole with one hand and with the other holds a baby on her lap machine narses it in the meantime customers arrive the machine goes on pounding the paddy and she carries on our bargain with the customers she says to them be the few pennies you owe me before you take anything more they're going on selling the things you see she has all these things to do at the same time not the baby turned the paddy as the that that is pounding on that take the flatten rise out of the hole talked to the buyers this called yoga practice 15 parts of her mind out of 16 are fixed on the pistol of the husking machine least it should pound her hand with only one part of her mind she nursed as the baby talks to the buyers likewise he who leads the life of a householder should devote 15 parts of his mind to God otherwise he will face rain and fall into the clutches debt he should perform the duties of the world with only one part of his mind imagine the way the cinema Krishna is describing it a man may lead the life of a householder after attaining knowledge but he must attain knowledge fast there was a friend and companion of chaitanya mahaprabhu nityananda he was also a realized soul but the chaitanya mahaprabhu asked him nityananda you better go marry cirtl as a householder and live a life of a pure real household showing that how to live as in a household at the same time leading a spiritual life so that was why Newton and OMA Prabhu came back it was an a Battuta no rule for him so he used to live in the household Mary but his life was full with spirituality so this is where we see we see here the martial a domani Devi mother wanted to give up her body because she already realized and widened continued ceramic is not old no you have to carry on and living among the householders you have to talk to them understand them inspire them guide them and that's why it is so approach she so approachable so easy a cinema Krishna is unique it is very very difficult to approach him only very pure soul like those Vivekananda Brahman and the to Dion and they could go otherwise it was very difficult intellectual people who can understand things and can come out and work they could approach to show me Vivekananda but the ordinary people who is all the time thinking about their own house'll at the same time they are hankering to realize God where they will go so see Ramakrishna kept mother for him so this is the way it goes a man may lead to the life of a householder after attaining knowledge but he must attain knowledge fast marshal Adam on ETV are two brothers they were quarreling on a small batch of field and mother wind and wind both of them they were shouting angry wanted to fight then mother went in between and was asking one brother you are involved you should not talk and then turning to other brother you should not talk you know we can understand that in the villages variation then suddenly he stopped everything came back and started laughing and the devotees they were worried about her why she is going over there because the excitement is not good for our health so they they were happy that mother has come back sitting but they he she was smiling and laughing then they asked mother what happened they look at these fools the hope the old thing belongs to God and now they are demanding this is mine and that is his immediately without any forgetfulness that is called spirituality after attending the knowledge if one goes like that then only it is possible at the same time she was so perfect in talking with the people different type of people are coming and she is handling them indent all different ways he must attend knowledge fast then he is giving an example ceramic isne if the milk in the mind is kept in the water of the world they get mixed and that is therefore he should turn the milk into yogurt and extract butter from it by churning it in solitude then he we keep the bottle in the water of the world spiritual discipline is necessary and what is the spiritual discipline constantly taking out the mind from these worldly things and putting it at the feet of God how it is possible just by taking the name of God that's why the initiation process was introduced so all these things have come after a lot of experimentation how to help an ordinary person who is involved in these at the same time he wants to keep his mind and he should keep his mind at the feet of God how it is possible he cannot read books at that time he cannot meditate at that time when he's working so how it is possible take the name of God so when you are repeating the name of God received from your guru so obviously you are thinking about your guru and his instructions and naturally your mind will go to a very high standard otherwise just read some name and then read we think that would work so that's why they are mentioning like this and see Ramakrishna so she is telling the this way the spiritual discipline is necessary spiritual discipline necessary again he is mentioning in the beginning the aspirant should go into solitude now and then totally lonely when one comes and seat and sit for sometime first 10-15 minutes the mind is always roaming here and there naturally we are coming from the outside world then I am sitting over here and slowly slowly the mind comes down when you are looking at the face of your God see Ramakrishna perhaps over here and then constantly looking at that photo trying to imagine that he is also looking at you pray to God I have come from outside many other things have happened my mind is in turmoil please come in down quite it so that I can think of you I can think of you I can think of you that is the practical way that's called spiritual practices every morning when you are getting up keep the photo of God so that the moment you gets up you can see the photo of God the moment you later and immediately offer pranaam we see in the life of ceramic is now master master giving the description and that's why a Bottari is always so helpful we observed that avatar the great spiritual personality the God himself has taken the form of human being and how he is behaving daily getting up from the sleep immediately looking at the photo and then going on taking the name of God going out and offering pranaam to the sky offering pranaam to the nature offering pranaam to the sun rising sun and then getting ready go and sit in a corner try to meditate concentrate your mind for some time after that start your work that is exactly what the Ramakrishna is telling now and then go into solitude just your mind that will help you I really feel really happy sometimes some people they write to me I like to go or to Ganges to spend some time all alone I always say it please go so when they are going I don't know of course or how they are spending the time but I believe that they go they read books and they try to meditate all maybe talking a little with the person living over there all the taking little walking and all that some people they come and of all the way they have gone to develop the spiritual practices instead they will come out come and with all the complaint say I saw another group of people they said that you have cheated them and in the whole history you have to go on repeat and it isn't really used for them as a dad that is past I also don't know much of it you also don't try to know it it is past it is all over what is the purpose of going over there and suppose you were thinking in this way nothing is going to change you change your mind that is the opportunity that is exactly what see Ramakrishna say spiritual discipline is necessary wherever you go our mind is such it immediately tried to go and get a shape all the worldly things that is present all the things will be there all the time wherever you go the holiest of the holy place even if you go all the things would be there and if we go and only think about that and give that to our mind is a wastage of time so that is the reason one must be very very careful I have come here to spend only one hour so I must paint every moment to develop the spirituality whatever the good things are there that must encourage me and he says wood contains fire and fire cooks rice can saying it cooked rice no inside the mind purity is there each soul is potentially divine Swamiji say our Upanishad says each soul is potentially divine no doubt but does it mean oh I only shall say I am also divine and then I sleep with that No so that is the reason he says you have to rub them together to bring the fire in those days in the olden days just to rob to hooves to bring the fire you have to do that you may learn a great deal from books but it is all futile if you have no love for God and no desire to realize him well understanding from books most of the people they spend a lot of time reading books different type of books that's good but after that what what is the purpose then they themselves would write in their own way some book maybe they are having some money they will publish it also then the problem then they will ask us we have to sell in the first place who asked you to write the book and ignorance like that why should I have to sell your book no you have to sell it now that is the problem now what is the part first thing I always feel like that what is the purpose purpose is to get the realization and what is that so simple I am God our next step I am the son of God I am the child of God this is the conception and if I am the child of God son of God daughter of God then what I am going to have the quality of God what is that quality of God love quality of God is unselfishness priority those are the things I must develop within me and automatically other things will come all pervading all-powerful that belongs to God if he gives is okay it doesn't give this okay I want to be free from this bondage of neurone a small thing so selfish I cannot imagine small small thing they cannot go beyond that so that is why I see Ramakrishna when sometimes some people is to come and touch his feet he's to say poor Ganga water I cannot be at the touch and he's to wash his feet with them because so selfish what is the difference between a good man and a bad man selfish unselfish that so so this is what they say he they only live who live for others rest are more dead than alive sharmaji says like that each soul is potentially divine then he says the only who live for others think about them pray for them your mind is becoming broad and the conception of God everywhere so that is exactly what he says that alone is knowledge through which one is able to know God all else is futile that alone is knowledge and by which I can realize God all else is futile three she's telling because ceramic is name is asking him what is your idea about God he wants to know from that young man this reach was very very intelligent person he never stood second he always stood fast all through his life and in those days the covetous the profession was to become a lawyer now it is also they can earn a lot of money but Saddam kiss me never liked that a person being a doctor or a lawyer he's he can solve the thing but without that is belonging and taking going on taking money from an ignorant person who is in difficulty and that is seen so he is to say no I am NOT going to take food from your hand because if you have done like this of course he could understand but about this man he said he's a nice man bring him to the shisha though he was an advocate so sir I feel that there is an all-knowing person we get an indication of his knowledge by looking at his creation which is telling the way and intellectually will give the hunt looking at these errand things all the time everywhere but something or other is going on who is controlling it like every day the Sun is coming if any day Sun misses to come then what will happen we saw in recently everything will be dark so obviously so these things it promotes it says that something is there which can be called as God see Ramakrishna is telling that God exists may be known by looking at the universe that is true but it is one thing to hear of God another thing to see God and still another thing to talk to God so no Krishna is always one step all the time putting on that you must realize God in this very life itself time is short time is short you must realize God in this very life so he watch it away did Atta Septimus T notch it AHA obviated mati Venus T you must have to realize God in this very life itself Upanishad says or otherwise very wrong thing is going to happen to you because no whether you will get the opportunity or not this opportunity is a human being we have come and we have got a very good family which is helping us to continue in this thought and we have got an opportunity to come and listen and discuss about these with a group of people who are just of my own heart group so obviously all these good facilities have come now if we are not utilizing it is a great loss for us so cinema kitchen is telling it is God is God exists that's all but what about it only you have an idea one it is one thing to hear of God somebody said another thing to see God that's also not much some people they see in the dream God came Carly Krishna and someone told that someone came and robbed these chaste exit he is rubbing your chest that is good but the afterwards what you have to see the character after the god has come in your dream are you changed person loving others understanding others caring for others feeling peace within then it is alright you are making the progress so that is why he says goes on telling still another thing to talk to him that means knowing intimately you will get peace of mind only when you have seen God what will happen if we see God answer is this what will happen when you realize God answer is this there will not be a single moment when we will be feeling unhappy constant happiness knit tooth sabapathy Shaam knit three knit the Mangalam it says like this me too utsuha baba the shanties I'm in the mind dear Deshawn Nick dude Sawa in the wood server means the most happy moment there will be all the time happy things happy moments will be there knit the three everything will be perfect meet the Mangalam all auspicious thing will happen every time every moment so that is the realization of God you will get peace of mind when you have seen God you will enjoy bliss and gain strength only when you have talked to him when some people are trying to kill Swami Vivekananda over here it's a foreign land for him and not a single friend all around but still only a handful they were with him and they were worried about him because a big group was going against him he became so popular so all the rich people were coming to him so obviously the jealousy they tried to kill him they were planning to kill a small handful of friends they were worried and then they were telling Swamiji Shani Vivekananda what will happen his answer proves this if we have talked to God there's no fear at all he said don't worry about me no power under the Sun can crash me because a power beyond the Sun and below the Sun is protecting me all over the power that is creating preserving that God Himself is protecting me so you need not worry about so that confidence comes only from them there's the one beautiful incident in the life of Xiaomi become the he was in London that time and he was strolling with another British gentleman and the British lady and it was British tower the outside the county is so beautiful suddenly a bull charged from distance not knowing why but maybe the lady who was wearing in those days a peculiar dress and almost the half of the body was covered with the iron that this thing so it was difficult for her to run and the British gentleman usually the British are very famous about showing the courage etc but this gentleman the first chance first opportunity we climbed a tree and he was asking Xiaomi vivekananda also do come up forget about that lady what will happen to our little but lady fell down Xiaomi ji went and stood covering dust that lady and waiting for the bull to come and church and it came close to this and turned back and went away then this gentleman it came down mr. sturdy and he utter ammiji my god how could you do it must be you have applied the yogic power to stop the pool and go away maybe because sharmaji himself was Shiva so the bull is cannot do anything to him so anyway that was the practical situation going on he saw and he came down and then he was asking what thought was crossing your mind when the bull was charging he was thinking that sharmaji will tell I was thinking of my guru or the God Rama she said I was calculating what is my weight and how much speed that the bull is coming and when he will hit how far my body will go so that calculation was going on so he jokingly Hansard but the power that was protecting him in this Detroit some people invited him and put the very strong that to kill him in the coffee and when he was about to drink that see Ramakrishna appeared over there don't drink this cup it is poisoned don't drink it so someone was protecting him these are the proofs these are the proofs that is true and then the master verse 3 says Rishi was telling we do not have time to pray to God this fellow he is telling we do not have time to pray to God Sudama krishna with a smile that is true nothing comes to pass except at the right time look at it after when the God is sitting before him he is advising him he could not inspire this young man was so intelligent never stood second in his life truth and that is the reason when we feel oh we are going and meeting people talking to them but why they are not getting inspired we even the Godwin is it's trying the people are not understanding is really very very difficult and that's why those who are regularly coming we feel at least personally I feel we are blessed at least something must have happened we must have done something good in the past that's why we have this got this opportunity we just continue we should give it out whatever happen happened we should all over here and continue that is the main thing some good thing we must have done but now some people will come you will see some people they come they continue for some time and suddenly they break and go somewhere else they cannot continue this is the pure core the see Ramakrishna and there is nothing and the Dhanteras he will get lot of money nothing like that cinema Krishna when people are coming like this they're telling you not here not somewhere else I don't give all those things but I keep Mukti I give bhakti I give liberation I give devotion the best thing that's why in the first January 1886 the year he passed away he blessed those who came close to him and also those who are wholly pure hearted I pray that you get consciousness Joey Danny oak you didn't say you become healthy wealthy happy we didn't say that he said let the consciousness arise within you and that is the Amish now and that's why it is not see when the 1892 93 chamois vacant the came he was the only in the first Hindu in the soil of America and then followed by the gray Souls is direct disciples of the Ramakrishna they took him Avedon and the Saladin and the three gunas eaten and the 2d run and they all came into this land and now after so many years how many centers we are having how many followers we are having very few handful nobody knows but recently someone came and then thousands of following him within no time they're having the temples almost everywhere but why not see Ramakrishna how it is the because the pure thing is always very rare very very rare it's very difficult that is the reason he says it is all decided beforehand by God Salameh Krishna is mentioning to him when he said you don't have any time after hearing all those things no change in his mind to see ramakrishna smiling God is smiling you are happy with these worldly things continue and he is telling that is true nothing comes to pass except at the right time and then he is mentioning it is all decided beforehand by God what each one shall receive that is the thing each one shall receive there are some people who was so eager to listen to these please do not stop and they'll be in credit you are not happy having that so when someone rang yesterday and their inquiry why you are not showing this today's Monday only Tuesday the class will happen and those who are living here so close by no time may be that I'm not a good speaker may be that I cannot attract or explain things and improperly but at the same time at least coming and listening that is also helping and it's a very pure place and that's why Ravana also we chant every time thus robbing our hearing also a creating in different places some of the devotees they like to come together and other monks are very less so we say you continue began to study circle I give the name study what is that began that first and foremost studied this gospel of the Ramakrishna someone should read a few pages and then close your eyes and think what see Rama Krishna is really mentioning and then you sing a song on Salaam o Krishna continue you may be for one hour so it is all decided beforehand by God that each one shall what each one shall receive then to that boy he is telling surrender everything at the feet of God he's a very good doctor and and see now Krishna himself said there are three types of doctors first one will give only medicine go and will never enquire whether he's surviving or dead already and second will enquire that much heart will go and sit on his chest and force the medicine you must have to drink the medicine and get well cinema Krishna is the third type would tumble to and he is telling to death should Shirish City she was not interested young Krishna won't leave and again he is telling surrender everything at the feet of God what else can you do give him the power of attorney let him do whatever he thinks best if you rely on a great man he will never injure you so this is the way sometimes some people they're really busy or how what we can do but I have seen some of the great people they will never come out without finishing some tremendous busyness we cannot imagine even then they will have the prayer always everything what will be very much by and Pranab Mukherjee III knew them so these are the people without practicing spirituality they will never do anything it always used to have that and many of the people the leaders so much of pressure and so much of controversy so much our life is nothing comparing with them so much things are going on every moment but they will always practice meditation I heart Netaji Subash Chandra Bose you when the Second World War was going on and he was having nothing except some dedicated soldiers they were ready to give their lives but how to make India free so that was his thought things were going on in this way support from the Japan government only was the resource for him that was constantly depending on them that moment also used to come to our Singapore Ramakrishna mission in the in a very different time when nobody's nearby used to entered into the shrine meditate for over an hour then used to go I have seen one in one or two places our Indra Gandhi she was so busy thousands of people are following our but she is to enter into the shrine of cinema Krishna in balloon mud before our eyes we saw she is quietly sitting and meditating forgetting everything that happened constantly going on praying naturally these people are listen until the God's blessings at the air you cannot make progress so Easterling after all the job sometimes some people are so busy it is really very difficult for them is suggesting when he is advising this rich who is also based busy man being a lawyer he is telling surrender everything at the veto how just before going to bed just till within your mind god whatever I have done good bad I give it at your feet please do not forget for forget me and forgive if I have done anything wrong please do not give my hand off from yours hold it all the time all through that's called surrender just like a small baby goes to sleep with great faith the mother is near har she'll be putting the hand and the person of mother and that very touch gives her all solace and makes her courageous to go to sleep so that way if we also do the God is with us and we are going to sleep forgetting whatever has happened in the old day that is called surrender there is no doubt necessary to practice spiritual discipline Salaam o Krishna is concluding here thank you friends for coming and let us conclude with this prana mantra Rita Bikram by Aisha guitar [Music] para mission medium Tama Ramakrishnan sheer asana Oh Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry you that said Sri Ramakrishna our panda must do
