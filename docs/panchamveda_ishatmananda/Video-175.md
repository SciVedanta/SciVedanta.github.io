[176: Panchama Veda 176 - The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nOA4O-EC88)

begin with this mantra even copywritten calm assured sir burhan Mangalam shreemant Arterton who began on te rotate the Arjun our Salaam additional most of the time is to top it the house of the devotees that's the reason he used to talk about the spirituality everything all the time on the spirituality but in a mind at home so that the devotees worth the air in that way different type of responsibilities should not feel that we are laid out what you are doing so he is to slowly slowly but afterwards when to date in the discussion will find how emphatically he is giving the stress on spiritual practices that is very very important when you listen to the spiritual talks or read the spiritual books or visit the holy places or do some problems there is good but what about the personal practices otherwise our mind is not getting totally cleaned so that is very very important the last time when you we are reading we read that to stage four fifty five today will be reading one devotee said using the action the aim of life karma that we should do the world and even the businessman also have for I have seen some of the places the business houses in India they are mentioned karma Dharma but what we make our Madonna the Karma is Salma but what type of Dharma is not so easy karma action without attachment is of course Dharma or religion it's not so easy for the business when I am doing I am doing for some profit so obviously there are many attachments competitions simply quoting from Xiaomi Vivekananda is not solving the problem so the majority of hours unnecessarily giving our solace in our mind or we are doing the third month but yesterday Ramakrishna he very clearly mentioned the aim of life is the attainment of God even life is that invented God then he talked about the Sangamon League if the God appears before you what you were going to ask who give me some money so that I can do these are there no then he find he is giving the stress therefore I see him that war is only the first step but with this the work that we do the social work is only the faster this is for the seniors spiritual seekers we know that in the bhagavad-gita it is very clearly it says there are four different types and only very very very few are there who are very serious so that is why therefore I say in that what is only the first step it can never be the goal of life devotee devotee or serve the spiritual practice and go forward devote yourself to spiritual practice here there is a question what are the spiritual practices the most of the time if you go majority of the people and particularly in India anything that we do in the name of God whatever we do so many temples everywhere the temples the churches and mosque and everywhere wherever you go big big churches big big mosque big big temples and is that religion is that the spiritual practices so that we have to understand very clearly devote yourself to spiritual practice and go forward that means deeper into the spiritual life through practice he will advance more and more God why he didn't again the kostina practices coming the part of God this whole world is nothing but the manifestation of the guard not only the Vedanta even the property they are also telling God because last time we were reading in the Bhagavata at the guard he is making himself to one man and one woman attained all these things from him even daddy so this world is also the same manifestation of God of course - we are nothing but that the or being but we don't understand that why again the Lord's Mayan gods Mayan we are thinking who yes when you listen to that then you think yes it must be so then after something again river gate I am me and mine all these things come back again and again so he's that's why the spiritual practice and practice and practice are necessary and what are those spiritual practices we will discuss quoting from different scriptures and cinema Krishna as his speciality whenever he says practice go forward at last he will come to know that God alone is real and all else is illusion and that goal of life is attainment of God then just to make it very easy to understand he go gives a beautiful illustration to a story he would Carter used to go inside the forest to collect some records so that he used to come bring it back to the market and sell and then one brahmacari made him in that forest he said why you were just here go deeper go deeper go forward go forward then one day woodcutter was thinking the prematurely is a holy man he has to be to move forward let me try then he went inside the forest and he found that his all santalune so costly only ordinary wood that used to cart and sell now he gets the sandalwood and naturally he was richer and afterwards again it hard but Rama Jerry told wants to go inside again move forward let me go little people he found the silver mines then the gold mines that the precious gems so many things so the idea is the more we go towards God the more the spiritual things come up and after now the one after hundreds waste Amish now after the story he is telling that therefore exceed that whatever you may do he will find better and better things if only you go forward if only you go further friends he now this humble life many of us we have noticed in my life also I have noticed a little the name of God that we take in the name of God that he work so many great people they come forward the helpers and with great respect the recently mortal we had ever spared you who passed away he went to Andaman and he inaugurated our two buildings cardamom indeed and Ganim indeed there on the tires before everyone gallery he touched my feet and he said the Shawnee is the main don't see it'll be a hot red show me the chamois when Swamiji he meant not me but he never hesitated to touch the field a very humble person like me I have no comparable with him in knowledge and the things that he has done the achievement nothing why he did that because the name of God that I take that's all nothing else not that the personal so this is the way we saw the so many places people count the deep respect and they help and they do so many things why the name of God just name of god when you read the lives of this great Saints the direct disciples of Salama vishna and particularly recently we were discussing about Ramakrishna and the G his Island his joy was salam o Krishna Shashi Maharaj she was very good in mathematics he was a brilliant student then he became his his disciple and so dedicated that he always used to wait for his command and that is the way we found there he is getting so much of help so much of all the time every time that that is really unique and that proves that God is there and when the problems are cropping up sometimes we read in the life that our history of the Ramakrishna movement that some people the complaint against the Ramakrishna mission they were not very happy with the Lama this new mission because Romney became very popular and we the slowly-slowly organization well naturally now the some jealousy you know that they complain to the British government didn't they Lord he declared the ramakrishna mission is a asylum of the anti-government people that is dangerous so obviously the devotees will never come and never help us what will happen marshal of the body to be seen what did you go to that person and say we are monks we are practicing spirituality and helping them she told to our the shaman he was jonathan de sarand√≠ third mother doesn't know to get an environment with that lord is so difficult but anyway since mother has said let me go healing and he told I like to meet immediately appointment was fixed and he went and met that gentleman and say exactly what the mother's we are monks practicing spirituality and teaching that brought my business love service to others we had a no connection in the politics immediately next day he changed the his statement can imagine the power of God is it possible just with the effort of the human being the power of God every time everywhere we find that even in my personal life in Ahmedabad the small plot of land we got the didn't governor he wanted to take that land and I was bewildered I was thinking what to do because he was the person the he was the executive and also judiciary there is no other thing so what to do and what not to do in that way suddenly one person came and he that particularly his wife and she your strategy how can I serve you I don't know not to but can you since you were going for the dinner with that governor can you tell him that we are ramakrishna mission this is this she knew us from next day again whole thing changed and like this so many incidents I can go on coding and that gives the tool yes if you go one step you find so many thing so we should not stop over here we have to know not to get this recognition from this world but to get the B's happiness joy everything that we usually try to get from this world the Salaam additionally what is by no means the goal of life go forward and then you'll be able to perform unselfish work this is important unless and until you go on practicing spirituality unselfish work is very difficult so when Swami Vivekananda is introducing what history unser labeled in the Karma Yoga in the first chapter itself he is telling through unselfish work you can reach to the same goal where butchered by knowledge and Christ by his devotion reached unselfish work unselfish work is possible when you were practicing spirituality because you are not attached to this name and fame some cappings of the people appreciation of the people sack efficient of the people you don't bother about that then this unselfish work is possible but again I say that it is most difficult to perform unselfish work therefore with love and longing in your heart pray to God now that God is teaching how to pray to God this is very interesting God is teaching how to pray to God and how - oh god grant me devotion at dieters feet this is the player grant devotion that died lotus feet even the devotion we cannot generate unless the God gives it to us feed and reduce my worldly duties please grant me the boon that the few duties I must do may be done in a detached spirit whatever the duties I do I should be able to do it with a detached spirit otherwise suffering sometimes some people are praising their happiness sometimes it's not the end the suffering so this detached degree we should do it rather but also we found that when the Lord created the supreme lord created the Brahma the firstborn and say you go and start creation I want to enjoy but the first thing the monied he bowed down then he went down that holy being and prayed please grant me that I can work with a detached spirit there's a first teaching of the Parramatta the detest spirit if you go still further in you realize God he will see him in time he will converse with him because the devotee they like to have the devotion and this so that you can converse with God then the conversation went in different and then he was talking with the Pratap Chandra Majumdar a very famous person in those days the production the version that was also the representative have the Brahmo Samaj in this Parliament of religion as we began the game as a representative of the Hindus Pratap Chanda Matilda King as a representative of the Brahmo Samaj for anyway it could not make that much impression as we become the code but protect children he was very senior to not under not that dinner and oneth was a stool he never even took their sannyasa so the cinema Krishna was talking with him why the top Chandra Majumdar keshavjee under general brahmanas they are not the followers of the disciples of Saddam official but Saddam additional always wanted to help these people to understand what spirituality among so many people at least a few handful they have come to understand or to practice religion sama Tichenor all the time used to go to him or to invite them to him tried to without hurting them not changing their path he wanted to direct them towards a spirituality so here we can understand the religion and spirituality the difference winning trying this Salama business talking he is telling to Pratap let me tell you something he would learn an intelligent and serious minded soul I am telling because of this t-shirt and you are like two brothers go and die you have had enough lectures arguments corals discussions tensions can such things interest you anymore now gather your whole mind and direct it to God plunge deep into God so this is the thing so many things already we have done again wide the plunge deep into God but the majority of us we cannot understand that still we go on going and for those things which we have done so many times so many times visiting places meeting people doing these doing that young minds maybe but now it is all over all those experiences we have already done so strongest is the branch deep into God Pratap he says he said you are right that is surely my only duty now but I am doing all these things only to perpetuate the shop's name the keshavrao story so he is telling and to keep that name alive and Saddam hawkish not like a father God Himself is teaching but you know that you have to have the mind to understand that now we are teaching a new people are listening just think of who's teaching the earth giving province around kishna when that person in person is telling even when the people are not impressed how many people are here just something some musician some other things but immediately to be completely full and when the God was speaking even then very hand people because that is the rarest of the reacting god gives the Mayans such of a majority of the people that we were dirt with that oh so many things are going on we should do this we should do that even at the age of seventy eighty they've been going into the gathering they'll be having the talk and chatting and all that they even under that not understanding them the days are limited every day you want to remember death is approaching a pretty step-by-step end is coming and what will happen at the end unless we understand what we are actually in reality so cinema Krishna those who are sincere about the spirituality those who are walking about spirituality criticizing spirituality for the damaged okay and let them continue but those who are trying a little for themes damaged is telling that when he is telling to that prettau he is saying like this with a smile is it no doubt you see now that you are doing all this to keep his name alive his name is tisha but in a few days you will feel that that we listen to story then he is giving a story a man built a house and then there's a gusting beam and he was going on praying to God oh this is the house interesting we that means his son is an imam see if i see that this house is belongs to only one the wing guard the by you own disturbs oh this Bogardus is the house of the annuity please don't break it then to Indra then - then ultimately he left out of that let the building go to hell I don't care so like that we get through the story you can read afterwards so the story he wants to say sometimes we think we must have to do these otherwise we is going to do nobody's doing I must do that so that we always think then afterwards that the economy we can understand that I have to go and I don't bother before me also it continued after me also it will continue we we don't bother about anyone it will grow in its own way sasame Tichenor then afterwards is telling you don't have to perpetuate - of sleep remember that he achieved all his success through the will of God sometimes some people become very successful it's the will of God and slowly the ahamkara comes that is the difficult thing in individual mind win that round god of an ego can't he is destroyed in the mind of the society again the society is also destroyed the same way the woman disarmed car Adams to the Divine Will is what was stablished to the divine will that will be disintegrating what can you do about it now which is your bounden duty to give your entire mind to God look at it God again and again advising him inviting him to plunge deep into the ocean of his love but no Keisha abruptly left then he is giving ceramic is not even that sometime he himself is to sing and he was a very good singer now this time his singing doo doo doo Roop Shagari Mr Bond is a beautiful sound dydy oh my mind dive deep in the ocean of God's beauty if you descend to the uttermost depths then refine the chill of Terlato part are you chilly poppy the dream there's a chain of love for God devotion so that way is continuing but when Saddam Krishna is staring at reserve you must gather your mind and directing to it to God plunge deep into God what does it mean let us discuss it a little this thing is people to the god Vishnu Parshin are in a Sanskrit they say it is partially positive beyond the personal what is that a personal and then deep and sincere practice for the God realization to prepare our mind sincere practices what are the practices then so we see the hope arsenal that we have to practice spiritual what is the spiritual practice just you come opening into the temple and then only see it and then pray that will be fast enough that much time one hour and then afterwards suppose we are and we are moving here and there for 12 hours out of 12 hours we if you are spending two hours even is that salvation what about the tape hours so that personal means completely different one can not just way we start practice that is also another thing just to think that time to practice the spiritually different today that is also not possible to try if we think that we are going to practice the so you know stop all work and let us practice that also is not possible very difficult that also means God stays otherwise means sometimes some people are doing the practices and also they give some dry time when they are practicing after something or what we are doing or something some important work will come and the practice were slowly going on suddenly to be disrupted that is all Maya that God is giving us that type of thought that we should practice again that God is giving us all the hindrances and here we had to pursue God to move away all those hindrances no you should remove those things then only those hardens we like to overcome it's possible by the grace of God punch is Rishi is a spoke in the Constitution it says Hannity / he says who person ASEA Sam or God to par Silesia summer thought we didn't but the public data due to the vasana only be dealt with there is the knowledge due to the personal only the knowledge that gives liberation dad Don's that is very important to pass on us there some more thought when we are doing the practice in the personal so why we should practice spirituality that means only to give her strength so that we can break that ignorance and can enter into the realm of knowledge cinema vishna mainly launched into the deep into God in bhagavad-gita we find that the Lord Krishna is also giving the same type of instruction 10th chapter 10 verse there the Christians telling the Sean suffered to youth on our budget on priti-purvakam dadami would do you come down in a mom we on didi de Xiang 2d satata-yuktanam say Tata evil steadfast continuously with God friends we have to remember these things what is that in personal the personal means giving the mind at the feet of God there are only two things again and again I feel and I say one is this world another is God there is not a third one only these two the God is one and this word the Java though it is only one but in many many many varieties when we go to the confectionary shops we find so many varieties of slaves all amid half million mostly milk and some other things of the utmost limit the one minute it has taken so many forms but God is only one now I can give the mind to the world I can give the mind to the God that is the mind the body has nothing to do with this whatever you say the body will do whatever the mind thinks the body will do but now at this moment what the mind will do that is my decision but who is this me again I am the composition of all my karma fellows and from the cargo Paris the thoughts are coming and the thoughts are imposing on me that you should do this that you should not do this so obviously there are so many varieties of complications of the air who can solve this problem that's why the grants long-distance telling you must go to God and pray please solve this problem so that I can get the arch the devotion attachment love for you teach on Saturday you kana when the is giving that power to us the one it is possible for us to get attached to God otherwise it is impossible so try just a picture or an image nothing is there now sometimes when you go to the temple we find so many crowd and so difficult to even the see the image but if you go to the end of time when there is no one not even the priest what will do with that image we go and stand before the image and we don't feel that emotion not the devotion so what is that white is not having devotion to the main flaw within me now when a baby is coming to you if it is related with you maybe your own grandson the love attachment affection that you will feel other Saund there is not the baby is okay the child is coming so that much but unitized went to that particular child completely different because you're attached to that so when our mind really get attached to God that is called Saturday yoga that is constantly yuktah because God is mine I cannot forget God no morning God must have got up now the God is doing this now the God constantly we are going on thinking and rajasam people become not as a I have to do am dream with lately love am serving budget on when I am worshipping God serving God and serving God with great love these are the two things constantly pairing God and serving or remembering or working for God with love with these two are they're subtle to yuktah pretty food worker but you know these are the two things if it is there then what happens god helps how girls would be Ugandan guitar me either God gives them that particular internet the thought by which they can understand what is correct and what is incorrect Tina mom oh boy yonder T this book do you go by which they realize me otherwise it is impossible to the eyes God is not a matter of you it's not a child's game just till we go and do that and immediately realize no not like that is very very very difficult why the goddess when our mind completely opposite way towards the world and what is there with all these marketing things all wonderful things so the mind is more comfortable with these worldly things than to God so that he is telling women how one can do this personal if we ask twin and how we understand about the cleanliness of the body they say always between people taking the name of God we can understand the cleanliness of the body but what about the cleanliness of the mind how could you clean or purify the mind the palawan she'd the Great Lord he will talking to Parvati he's dealing in that way Bachchan come poppy mana son but Giamatti orogeny perishes you orogeny Mauritius yeah Vava Bhatia t-money 101 even controvery wonderfully explained Bochy come we are discussing about God this moment we are getting our mind purified if I am sincerely reading and discussing my mind is getting if you were sincerely attentively listening your mind is getting purified bar chica Kai come sometimes we come one of my disciples she comes every once in a week either Monday or Tuesday and she'll be cleaning the whole the shrine room very nice that she's cleaning and also cleaning my room and then she is going and some people they come and very diligently becoming offering prana and a very nice way they will either cooking or cleaning the trashes and all diddums of the - this is called Chi eekum I'm reading for Swami shoutmon under how am I going to impress the Swami I am doing it for God this is very very important otherwise we go to that particular champion when he is not there we don't go you spiritual progress goes stop over there and you cannot make it right you have taken only the person but not the I - logic this I - knology is very very important that person through who I am getting this ideology I have respect and love that soon of course it is necessary but if it stopped over there then you are not making any progress so that is why they say Xiaomi new bacon the came over here he never talked about table occasion his own guru he was here for four five years in a the world selamat is not only one lecture he gave in Europe my master when you went back usually other people were asking why you have not talked about our master he said the person but his principle but his ideals are to Logies back and given to them and what is the ideology of Ramakrishna love and unselfishness just love pure love and answer whoever comes for the initiation I always say these two things if you're accepting sadhana pistol and ceramic dish reason I'll tell what is that pure love and unselfishness although you like this will be the goal to achieve these two qualities without discrimination learn and not patterning for anything in this world because I'm sure that is all temporary and we mean to the all same whatever things I have achieved subtly if I die what will happen to those things not medically some people will take why should I bother about that so that is the shuttle to you Madonna constant remembering God and here bar chika when you were talking about sometimes all our devotees when they are talking dollars code for Salaam o Krishna God they will discuss about the gospel are reading the Bhagavad Gita so chicken guy come I come helping physically even I've seen in the middle part the hill Turkish armies they can't even do anything still they will come out and they will try to pick up some of the dry leaves that has fallen over there they will and even possible whatever possible they will always do why even in the afternoon they'd be going and sitting in some corner when the devotees are coming talking to them telling them about the God some stories in spelling words there's also he comes Ava through the body and healthy Baba P or mana son and going on remembering God constantly going on remembering God that is very very very important he's all the time within your mind when you look at the sky oh my god is sitting over there I forgot immediately you are remembering God you see some lights you see the sunset you see the sunrise you see the ocean you see the black cloud all over enjoy the nature at the same time think the Creator the Great Creator that has created all these beauties that is God my love so immediately try to go and repeat the name of that god japp Ahmadi for anyway I just singing when you were singing you were a very good singer or you loved singing just put on the song and then try to concentrate on the words and then listen to that but keep your mind at the feet or you are going on singing in the morning that's also I have seen one of our Swami who developed the hand he was sure that he is going to die shunted open and that you know him on the Shanta empanada he never stopped taking the name of God the moment he understood that these are limited every moment every time the moment he will get up from the sleep will go on chanting the name of God sinking sinking sinking it away how are you could you get a good sleep go for the brick bus and then again he will go on see he is doing and plucking the flowers and arranging the puja continuously absolutely Swami do you on taking the name of bodies go hand was weak on counting the name of God constant we don't stop so these are the things your trauma team are singing or dancing or whatever we feel you're promoting the freedom liberty the Shiva is giving it back I Iike Bachchan Manasa Giamatti the way you were talking or discussing or reading everything that is called Radha Nam mashallah domani Devi this is I am quoting from model one nothing I don't think that in mass alimony day we could read this book but through her spiritual through her realization this village lady she told somehow you have to keep the mind at the feet of God that and nothing else when we are having a small garden and giving the water to the plants and you are thinking oh these foods I should offer the first fruit I will have got to go your drawing is something and we are you are thinking the way it will grow up and you will keep the fruit the first fruit I will over to God what happens your mind is it God every day you go way I promised that I will give I must take care it should not be destroyed you are thinking about God you are doing the gardening only but at the same time you are thinking about God so that is the way constantly their skull Aradhana and that is how some mother is stating that you should try to keep your mind constantly at the feet of God so this is the wheel what will happen Power Suit de power sounds of the powers of the means your mind will get purified purification of the mind means purification of thought and the wing the thought is not going to the world and constantly you are dragging it and putting it at the feet of God remembering God and just singing that's why it is better to keep books good books in different places suppose you were taking the brick first and he apply some dough just taking read one page give it back you're thinking of God and some good lines and that is the way constantly keeping the while at the God while driving go on repeating the name of God are put on a beautiful music and listen to that some of the words and this we constantly and then the time will come your mind itself will be going on remembering God and you cannot do anything else except that so that is the condition Baba chicken guy come back Iman Assam but jicama theme orogeny parrisha bhava should t be deity that is the baton Allah that is the system friends with a very handful of you I really am happy some of you who always attend this class to come to this particular place means you have to drive minimum 45 to 1 hour you should have to have a car you should never have time and you are coming into these Tuesday next day most of you have to go back to our fishes but the different work responsibilities but still so that is the reason it shows that sincerity do not forget this teaching somehow have to keep the mind at the feet of God and this is called Aradhana of God and dad surely clean the mind how to clean the mind this is the way the physical cleaning we know we have to bathe and are these intent but this is call and Abaddon the shooter it's also a very famous book it says smaran teacher he's giving different meditation the is that smullin teacher again gone just remembering the vedanta-sutra says just remember that we do and Shiva Shankara he is telling you don't bother about be building and pure plays a nun pupil not ever just go on taking the name of God wherever he was so that is the way one should remember God constantly all the time and began to shoot lots of prescribes that's modern teacher go on remembering the divine things that too is too personal a twenties who fashioned Islamic history started taking plunge her mind to go with Benghazi say you have to go plunge deep into the name of God Tom distance talking with Pratap again and again and he's talking about the marine and really this is very interesting when this the table much under was asking with this knowledge honesty was talking about North and naturally he got interested with this knowledge then he say Salam peace zone that's a young boy didn't heed and see him Noren came over here both of them decide on the same tires and they addressed and by God's grace cinema business blessings that Ian boy who was not even having that the experiences like the Pratap module da but he completely changed the whole audience 7,000 people they got up and clapped that is called God's power when the God is Tuesday night yesterday when sharmaji came from Calcutta I took him to those places he sort out say I am only going to see two places one where Schrom it is said that charge is then he sat on the steel steps of the church and exactly opposite was a family the help family who helped sharmaji that house and the place standing

telling again and again now my life's dream it has come true not a handful nothing is necessary so that is called devotion when you hear about that that is called devotion this is the place where sharmaji traveled and this is the place from misty this is the place from which is tool this is love and by that way what actually coming in our mind homage and we show me G Sedan Krishna himself what they did Thomas hapana what is the thermal love and become unselfish the DS cinema Krishna is going on dating do you must try and try but him finally when he left Pratap Majumdar Master Marshall was recording the conversation he says he doesn't think that he was impressed by those words the - my cinema question is to say he tried to change the Pratap you need of course it helped next life latest dish of Jenn Dechaine he got lot of change in that he was lucky to understand the true spiritual words and true master this is also the luck otherwise very I know a lady she was educated wanted to become a non accepted amount we to a place and tried to practice but that particular one the person was not a true monk and all hard emotion the dream and the broke shattered she has come back now nothing left with her such touches the reason Shankracharya seen three things are very very important Manisha she got television movie said to all the desire to realize God she got that too but the last one maha consciousness Australia oh that is really very sad so that is the reason when we have got this great Maha Purusha Saddam petitioner who is the embodiment of love and unselfishness we should not be some stand and then narrowness should not till till our mind as a team and let us pray to Him Oh God reduce our duties so that more and more we can devote in taking your name increase
