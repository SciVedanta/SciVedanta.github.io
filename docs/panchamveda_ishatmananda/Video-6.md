[7. Panchama Veda 07: The Gospel of Sri Ramarkishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=coI6nOS7EQo)

um we will begin today as you usually do by taking the name of god on our 21st may in the last class on this subject the fifth book of knowledge as i personally believe the gospel of sri ramakrishna as we call it in bengali and we have discussed the excellent answer of how may i fix my mind on god in reply to this question siram krsnadev said in the words of swami gogula nandaji he has written an article he said is the commandment of god is i repeat the name of god constantly in another place bhagavan siram krishna said what is this this girl in jabba in sanskrit it's called chapa and siram krishnadev said silently repeating god's name in salitu is jabba when we were quietly taking the name of god in a solitude it is job when you chant his name with single-minded devotion you can see god's form and realizing so this is the greatness of this answer siram krishna is telling only very simple way how can i fix my mind in god as if it is so easy but for that we don't have any conception of god how can i fix our mind fast secondly our mind is not in our control is all the time turbulent is going here and there and we every one of us we know and he is not asking anything else very simple way he is telling and we will find that that is the unique answer that has been practiced thousands of years by all the spiritual leaders and the spiritual parts he is selling silently repeating god's name in solitude and when with single-minded devotion we can realize god and at the same time according to patanjali now we see bhagavan's his answer is this what the scripture says and others says in the patanjali it says regular repetition leads to the awakening that means that god and god he says you repeat the mantra then and then you have to at the same time remember the meaning of it the meaning of the omkara that from the home only all things are coming up that is the the repetition of the mantra and meditating on its meaning and sudam krishna they've said taran one part second part is also at the same time you have to repeat the name at the same time meditating on his qualities or its qualities but he is mentioning here the god personal god we can say he or she so sing his glory shall we become the same mantra is a special word one boy after taking the name and getting the initiation and he was so excited when he was going to her initiation because first you have to go to the beluga north and in our case in the ramakrishna mission particularly in india only president maharaja and to vice president they give initiation so naturally there's a long queue so it is difficult to get a chance to and when he goes over there the secretary of the presidents and they will be asking whether you have read this book or not if not go and complete the reading then afterwards so it takes a long time and after all that excitement when he was he got the opportunity he went and got the initiation and came back and he said but i knew this name earlier then he said i have done so many things i was thinking it is something special but i knew this is because we don't know swami we began this telling mantra is a special word or secret text or name of god chosen by the guru for the reputation and reflection by the disciple so when the guru is choosing a name and giving to the disciple then that is the specialty because that name he himself the guru himself has realized he has practiced on that it's not just that easy of course nowadays many people they are getting their guru in that way just named that is a different thing but actually you this guru means he has realized the truth and then only he is giving this name otherwise not and then he is telling these words are not sounds of words but god himself this is very important the name of the god that has been given by the guru to a disciple is not only a simple word it's meaning only the words meaning not like that it's a god himself so this is very important and we do anything and everything and we have so much of time and doing but only we feel tired to name take the name of god you see constantly our mind is going on thinking and thinking so many things but when we are sitting to take the name of god we cannot and even when we are taking the name of god the mind is thinking something else mind is not ideal not that it is taking rest it is going on taking the name of god i mean going on thinking something else but in the moment it is you are asking to take the name of god it feels tired why because our past karma and that is why we have to go on forcefully trying to repeat the name of god this is called krishna when the master asked how to keep my mind on god keeping the mind of god fixing the mind on god means what constantly remembering god and in this situation when our mind is going on here and there first you have to go and practice these brahmacharya he simply said repeat the name of god and then he said you have to all the time remember the qualities of god also so two three things are there fast is the name then the quality then continuous these are the three things we have to remember in hindi song long back used to hear a famous singer he sang that nama japan that's a very nice song so you why you have stopped repeating the name of god so this we can constantly suggest to us why you are not revealing the name of god nam devi has given greatest emphasis on daily jogger and meditation those who are trying to lead a spiritual life what they should do see sirama krishna mahasaratha swamiji and this wonderful movement of ramakrishna thought rama movement as they call is actually helping us to realize god but in such a simple way that sometimes we think is nothing we will be okay we are coming to the and at the same time going to this place that place and then afterwards making a total thing messed up finally so that's why the very simple way that ramakrishna and maharata is telling that is within our control anyone can do it has nothing to do with the cast nothing to do with the religion nothing to do with the language or anything very simple mashallah is telling mind will be studied of itself if aspirants repeat god's name then of course 15 20 thousand times the fifteen thousand times of the twenty thousand times if we can remember the name of god repeat the name of god in a whole day this is the problem we are ready to do so many things and then she asks like a real girl she is telling like a real guide i myself have experienced i have experienced then only i'm telling you some people will be telling giving the guidance and giving the guidance is most easy job but the difficult thing is to practice and here she is telling i have practice to have experience then i am telling you not that simply i'm telling like that this is very important i have seen god you too can see god i have myself experienced that my mind is becoming so controlled and when this mind becoming controlled come what happens joy peace this is the way we can realize god very simple way so the master was shy he asked a wonderful question and in reply siram krishna is telling and slowly slowly as you go we will see how much of knowledge we are getting from this gospel of krishna so it is really rightly said panchama veda the book of knowledge knowledge of spirituality and here mother said 15 000 times or 20 000 times if you can repeat let them do and if it is not really active it's not getting the result come and tell me those who have read the biography of they know how mother used to take not fifteen thousand one lakh one bad times she is going on repeating the name of god and the wife of caitanya also she used to we have read many of you have read she had a wonderful way she used to take one name mantra and one grain of the rice she will put aside and how many thousands she will take that many thousand grain will be there that she will boil and eat the wonderful way the controlling the mind mind knows because associated to the body i feel hungry if i am not getting good food or little and literally before and for that only it will go on repeating the name of god that was our way of doing doing she also used to do like that here mother is telling like this but so many thousands of times used to do now guru nanak in the sheik she is telling let us repeat his name he means the god's name let us repeat his name as he was in the beginning the truth he was through the ages the truth so is he now the truth o nana so will he be forever and evil and the sheikhs also japoji that is the book is there and they'll be all doing like that the sheikh and the shikh religion also this japan this is also very important and guru nanak he himself is advising that we must kirtana japan and kirtana then now then they constantly do they will be going on doing the kitchen and what is that again see the krishna answer the name and the qualities that you have to go on repeating the name of god at the same time going on thinking is qualities why unless and until you think the quality you are not transforming yourself only never do whether that boy he said i knew this name he knew this name but he was not knowing the quality and what is that quality that is the uniqueness it cleans our past karma removes our past karma risk is giving a boost in our spiritual life and what is the spiritual life slowly we will know that actually the spiritual life means joy love unselfishness how it will come why it is not coming in the pages of the in the pages of this book will slowly come in this repeating the name of god japan and singing his name is also they are doing an sri krishna in bhagavad-gita he is very clearly mentioning among all the young sacrifices this is it is me the name taking the name of god the students of religion know that and it is very interesting there are many differences among the different faiths and paths but one thing is very common in the spiritual life and that is japan taking the name of god in hinduism like the hinduism buddhism also they uses rosary and they also repeat the name of god tibetan buddhism of course they have simplified this they have a revolving will if you have gone to that buddhist temples you have seen there will be so many big big uh the wheels the wheels and the people are also the devotees are also going on rotating they believe that because it is mentioned over there they have written over there engraved over there the name this mantra oh manipulator as many times you are going on circling that and that many times you are repeating at the same time you must have to repeat i think they should they are repeating but for the ordinary people just to give a boost if you are going there in a big uh that type of rotating things so many times that name this mantra has been engraved written and they believe if it is just roaming like 100 times that hundred times japan is over like this only but they also believe of lord and they have so many names they'll be giving so many names in islam also so many names will be given to god and he ours also the name of krishna and all these names will be there see names of god the moment you are thinking the name is god so this way in christianity they say for our heart for our heart shall rejoice in him because we have trusted in his holy name we have trusted in his holy name so our mind will rejoice you can remember the small story that siram krishna is telling the power of the in the name one person our ravenous brother vivishan he asked a person to cross the ocean and how to cross the ocean he said i am giving you this small paper hold it in your hand and just walk and that man he was holding his hand with paper and he was walking and he then is good there's no problem i am walking then when he was in the middle of the ocean suddenly doubt came and he said what is it that i am holding only a small piece of paper what may be inside it is so powerful that is helping me to float on the water let me see he could have done it on the shore but when he's in the middle of the ocean he opened and said oh my god only the name of sri rama and he immediately now the faith that is the power the moment here the actually christians are telling that we have trusted in his holy you are supposed to help me when i am dying to take me to the heaven to your abode because i am taking the name of you are bound to do it because your name is that and at the moment of death if i can utter with devotion the name of durga i'm sure you will rescue me so that is the power of name i told you the story of numanji how anumanji just by taking the name of sri rama saved the life rama's arrow also couldn't touch couldn't do anything that is the power we trust in his holy name the christians say the famous book that we have almost all of us we have read the way of the bill green the russian monk that he is being telling the name of job lord jesus have mercy on me that was the only the mantra he was doing he went to a church and there he heard that the pastor or the the father and the son said constant company of god what is the constant company of god he was going on asking people these questions and then someone suggested take the name of god oh jesus have mercy on me and then he was he started staying near the church it was a long story it was a beautiful story the book is available in our the book sir and there it is mentioning he is mentioning then only ordinary pastor in a village church he answered take the name of god fast days then there is then these slowly increasing increasing three thousand five thousand ten thousand then he understood that he cannot remain without taking the name of god that is uniqueness and when you are taking the name of god you must be enjoyed there should not be any frustration there should not be any physical problem sometimes some people will be telling that we have taken the name of god so many times now i cannot sleep my mind has become agitated wrong then you have not taken the name of god maybe that forcefully he wanted to see it he has forced his mind to do and that has created a mental problem psychological problem if you are taking the name of god with love how can this be one gentleman he he was the leader of the brahma samaj used to love him very much because he was the leader of brahma shamaji was supposed to be the guru but this person commented by taking the name of god in such a in a vehement way siram krishna has lost the balance mental balance and then siram krishna after hearing it only commented you were thinking about the world and you were saying and i am thinking about the atman the consciousness and i am losing my sense can this be no so when we are taking the name is obviously that it will give a wonderful balance in our name so this is very very important in islam in sufi mystics they also regard the repetition of name of allah as the highest form of worship repetition name of allah a famous sufi saying he prayed very sweet is the name of lord and i likewise does it offer me oh lord i ever remember thy name this is what we find almost all the spiritual the paths they are also taking the same type of the only one there we are all united that in the rituals we are all different some are asking that you should sit facing the east some are telling the waist somewhere these are there there may be differences but you see taking the name of lord taking the name of god taking the name of allah taking the name of bhagavan everyone is telling that that is the first and foremost otherwise you cannot improve but this java has wonderful way three types of java we can do first is wachika one can alter the holy name clearly with proper pronunciation in an audible words horrible voice when we are alone there is nobody if we like the name we can we are uttering it can alter so that i can hear it also that is also possible it's called but you have to pronounce properly there's so many stories are there in the you know in india they will never take the name of husband or the elder brother of the husband the ladies they do not take the name of husband here of course they only say that take the name husband not even the title name and that is okay there's another culture so they had the ancient tradition that they'll never take the name of husband and elder brother of the husband also basu bashu they will never take the name so one lady her barshur's name elder brother's husband his name was krishna now she got the mantra krishna how can she pronounce that so whole life through she repeated the name krishna krishna krishna like that cream is fall became form and when she died the yamaraja his people came then the lady was arguing i took the name of the lord why you are coming i am supposed to go to the heaven why you are taking to hell but what name you repeated why the name of my husband's elder brother and what is his name that i cannot pronounce but that is the reason that is the reason that that means jokingly they are telling you to pronounce it properly and why then because it is becoming one pointed why why all these things you should not tell it to others why because it becomes deep down within me is so such a trace i will not share with anyone it is only me it is with me it will go along with me and i am not going to tell it to anyone that's why you are not supposed to tell the mantra that's why the children should not take the initiation because just childlike way they may tell it to their friends and all that and the and we can say the purity of that mantra the spiritual power of the mantra will be lost when we are keeping it in the within heart we are loving it is only my result i am not sharing with anyone not with my children or any relatives not my friends or anyone that becomes very powerful this vaccine then upon shu another type upam should fix the mind of god and moves the lead but there should not be any sound in particle sometimes our lips are moving raja maharaja he used to do like this his chakra was like and sriran krishna used to say the moment i look at him like him and he is repeating the name of god that reminds me of god and immediately i go into shamathi his mind was like that the moment he is thinking about the god immediately it is reaching to samadhi so raja maharaja constantly used to take the name of god and there are mahapurus maharaja also used to take the name of god he never stopped in their younger days they never stopped one another direct disciple of sirama krishna he suddenly decided that i won't take food why because when i am picking food i am stopping and taking the name of lord then ramakrishna was like just like mother he used to take care of all the brother disciples and he feared if you don't eat anything and that too in those days you know your grave the history of ramakrishna nation how austerity three year of study they practiced they had nothing but only a little grain of food that that also he was not ready to take then ramakrishna you must have to take he was forcing then it was decided if swami shivananda mahapurush maharaj is touching me at that time i can eat because shivananda was stopping repeating the name of god and that will surely come to me also so here is a spiritual and a competition so one must do it and that is the uniqueness sometimes our devotee is there between the jabba yappa yankya 24 hours morning six o'clock is to it will start a group of devotees will come they will sit over there and do jabba for one hour just at the back there will be another set of arsonas will be there another group will come at say a 6 55 they will sit over there and they will start the jaffa and then at seven five minutes all of them they are doing and this first group they go and they take little rest or little food or water this group is continuing for one hour then the third batch comes fourth batch like this continuously from six in the morning to six in the evening twelve hours yep continuously and when we are taking the name of lord continuously the atmosphere becomes wonderful we were interested immediately that charge them and they start feeling something good and they say when i come to this place i feel it is good many of the people they say when we used to go to hyde park austin used to feel good because 30 years the swamis brahmacaris devotees their practice when this place also as we are continuing from 2008 i think we have come over here and slowly slowly after five six seven years you will think you'll see the whole thing has changed well at most people will be surprised by that and that's where the devotees should come and see we are inviting swamis they are coming taking the name of god that is adding to them atmosphere if you go to balloon war whether you understand it or not immediately you will start feeling some good what is there in berlin just a ganga flowing that ganga is not only to build more so many other places are also there but why then we feel good why we enter into the temple we feel good because in the temple you'll find nothing if you go to other hindu temples so many gods and goddesses and oh so many beautiful way in one temple you went and they were showing us how they have made the pillars how the pillars without any iron accident in belume or nothing like that nothing is there the moment you enter straight to siram krishna they have not kept their direct circles photo also not even ma swamiji only krishna and your eye and concentration will go straight to that in the traditional hindu temple if you go inside it is all dark your mind don't go here and there if all the wall is having lot of carving beautiful pictures then you will look just take a glance to the god and then you will go on looking at the pictures oh how wonderful appreciating the pictures only but the effort is to concentrate on god the moment you are entering into the temple garbha mandira all dark only one lamp is burning near the god your whole concentration is going on there that is the idea so this way when all the devotees are coming taking the name of god repeating the name of god thinking about god slowly slowly that whole atmosphere become wonderfully holy and that is called temple that is called mandira that is called the holy place so otherwise what for the teeth the people that sometimes they'll be going for with a big camera and so many things goggles on the head and they'll be taking the snaps they are all going over there they are not pilgrims pilgrims what concentrated mind they are going and repeating the name of god and at the same time thinking the glory of god here swami vivekananda say one may ask another is another is manasika this manasika means ponder the meaning and practice silently with no movement of lips just inside the mind no one will be able to understand that he is taking the name of god very quietly he is doing and sometimes whenever you are moving we can take the name of god but at the same time you must be very very practical you know in in the believer heart one brahmacharya we were all there and as a practice and as a training uh we were given the training of dressing the vegetable whoever you maybe you have to come and sit over there to sing that that is the training of the brahma challenge then cleaning the floor sweeping the floor cleaning the bathroom serving the senior swamis reading the scripture doing puja meditation all this is a part of our training and when you were doing it someone he got cut his finger i asked you to cut the vegetable not the finger why you are cutting your finger and that means the concentration is not there whatever what we do with concentration we have to do that is the uniqueness and with concentration when you were doing so that we are in the car we are in the bus we are in the train we are in the office but siram krishna says keep a portion of your mind on god and we are going on taking the slowly slowly this is under the meaning and practice silently with no movement of the lips if you go on taking the name of god like this the local polish marriage to you he is going to learn maybe that he is a linearity so he is going on repeating something so it's not people don't understand that what you are doing this is the great swamiji is telling the inaudible repetition of the mantra accompanied with the thinking of its meaning is called the mental repetition and is the highest and this is the highest problem this is the highest one may ask is japan repetition of god's name is the direct means of god realization when we are taking the name of god just repeating the name of god can you realize god directly this is a philosophical question here the mother says martial the devi by jabba and austerity tapasya has recalled the bondage of karma it's very clear the philosophy mother is very clear she is constantly telling you must take the name of your god fifteen thousand twenty thousand but don't think by doing this directly you are realizing god no when it comes to the philosophical questions is her answer is very clear she is telling it caught the bondage of karma that means past actions but god cannot be realized except through love and devotion just have taken the name of god so god is supposed to come to me that one do you have to develop love for god that's why name at the same time his guna and the moment these qualities we are remembering and a love comes from he is simple and he is straightforward and he is as he calls sharol this is that simpleness and this type of gunas when it is coming and those gunas automatically coming within us is telling and then we can remember that wonderful word of the meera meera said some people will be telling if you are worshipping the swamiji we went to that river godavari and we found this and it is just in the shape of krishna or then we are worshiping only if you are worshiping that stone do you think you will you will realize god no the mira she is telling if by worshiping a stone if i could realize god why the stone i should i worship the whole mountain the whole mountain will worship no problem those who have realized god no ambiguity very clear idea if you are thinking just by taking the the vegetarian food i will realize god wrong in that case all the monkeys would have realized god long before because they are living only on the fruits a long back four of us after getting the sannyasa we going to that's called gomuk you know and gomu just before gomo getting 13 kilometer before gomorrah you cannot reach promo in the same day is difficult you can reach difficult so there is a lullaby very famous one swamiji is there he always wear a red as a color as called shocks so he has been named nobody knows his name so lal baba and the red bhagava he had only one thing i won't give you any blanket unless you are taking the name of lord and you are taking prasad prasad is offered to rama he is a devotee of rama so he will be offering that and that is also evening eight o'clock so cold and you know the people from the plane they have not seen when there's uh the snow is falling and that's snowing so cold there you have to wait for eight o'clock and then there'll be puja a little of course the arathi then the prasad will be given after eating the prasad you will get the blankets that is the system so we have to wait in that and what we will do till then all the swamis different groups they were all sitting here and there taking the name of god we four were reading this gospel then one brahmacari of the ramayana is very hefty very strong he was going somewhere he said saw and when we were reading the begawali he heard it and said yes he was asking and his voice was everybody could hear what he's telling then it was so difficult in the naturally and what to say and these people are very very orthodox and the moment you say something and if they are not liking they will ask go and sit in the outside you're not going to share the room with you it's a big room it's all but they won't then immediately i asked then he was telling who is mirabai that was the chance for me to put down and i said then you don't know me rabbi what is it and then i told this one see this is the wonderful sentence all people are only thinking what you are eating what you are drinking from whom you are eating how you are drinking swami vivekananda again and again he is telling this has nothing to do with religion religion means you love for god the love for god how it will come if you are continuously going on taking the name of god so this is austerity subdued the senses this is the important we have five sense organs and continuously they are collecting collection they are going on collecting group rashes of the sparsha ganga they're all going and collecting information and putting it on the mind and making a mind a mess and that is the problem and with that mind only we have to go to god our vehicle only vehicle that will take us to god is our mind and if it is not ready to go to god so that is why we have to take the name of god srirama krishna said constantly take the name of god and also remember all his qualities mother said jabba and other austerity subdue the senses vigorous jabba neutralizes low thoughts help the aspirants to rise to higher spiritual planes one person came and asked sometimes bad thoughts are crossing the mind what to do very simple suggestion he gave immediately take the name of god and with clapping of hands if you are shouting and clapping the hands immediately all other thoughts will go away what are the problem with the mind thoughts what are the thoughts different worldly thoughts selfish thoughts different type of thoughts are coming so how to control those thoughts by taking the name of another thought another thought only you have to pour that he is telling shrima asks a very important question how to pick the mind on god and bhagavan say repeat the name of god constantly and it is only for the household or devotee because srimad was a householder and giving the answer is it only for the householder devotees no it is for the monks also for everyone and gokula mothers telling is the commandment for the householders he's giving importance he was talking to the householders but it's for all brahmanandaji who is considered the mind born son of god krishna manas he is telling the easiest way in this kali yuga is the path of yappa this taking the name of god in this kali yuga at this age it is the easiest way to take the name of god the easiest way in this kali yuga is the path of java by constantly performing jagga the mind can easily be made calm and steady and finally it will lose itself in the ishta the chosen god or deity so these are the statements this his name was rakha but he said he has the capacity to rule the whole country and then swamiji said then he is raja from then he became raja raja maharaja used to call in ramakrishna mission in the whole ramakrishna you know this family they'll be calling swamiji means and maharaja means raja maharaja but all the swami is there called raja swamiji or maharaja so he is telling this is the thing and then the second part of the answer of bhagavatam krishna guna ghana seeing the glory of god constantly millions and millions of people they are daily taking the holy name of sri rama and sri krishna if you go to brindavan never for a minute there will be no there will be no name of sri krishna 24 hours 365 days all through there will be the name of krishna somewhere or another this is the beauty of brindala if you go to vrindavan there is a circle road is there you can go on circling you will hear either these people somewhere they are taking the name of krishna or some other time and some other time someone or other taking the name of krishna and 24 hours continuously just like the other clock it is going on taking the name of sri krishna and in also the rama if you go to ayata is nothing but the temple all all the places covered with so many temples all people are taking the name of rama or krishna but then why don't you fight fine why you are not finding the religious people why not this is the answer suramar krishna is giving only name won't do you have today also remember the guna what is the guna this special quality has so many qualities of sri ramajandra but the special quality of ramachandra satya is a truthfulness he will never deviate from the satyr to whatever the position he is there he will only take the new or only continue or continuously practice satya right his father was also ready he told what to do now i am in a problem but if you like you can arrest me see ramachandra said no that don't do if you have given the word you have to practice it you must have to do it the long hand we find the naji keta a young boy of eight years old he swami vivekananda loved him so much again and again said about nachiketa be like naji keta what was the quality of nachiketa satya when his father said go to yama then his father was repenting no no no i just you know from the out of the sick of tongue as they called do you need not to go to i didn't say it then he's foreign at the past all our ancestors they were deviated from the truth but now if you do that what will happen in the future all they'll be following you and they will deviate from the truth and we will live just like any grass and the plants that they just born live for some time and die is this the human life some people they think they are very clever they are telling the lies doing all these sort of things and they will be going to the temple and donate something and they think now we are free from the same i am really very sorry they do not understand they got the opportunity but they are misusing the opportunity and they are sure to warn their fingers in the next slide they will have to suffer good good bad bad none can skip the law swami vivekananda in his poem his writing you must have to suffer whether you believe it or not whether you understand it or not a child do not understand that if she is putting or he is putting the finger in the fire it will burn it will burn it's not considering the child or an elderly person it will burn the work that you are doing hundreds and thousands of people they are having so much of money because they did lot of good job good work and that's why as a result they got this opportunity instead of helping the poor helping the town trodden serving the god the living gods they are cheating them regularly taking away the money from them and thinking we are very clever and they will go with all good dresses to the temple and they will donate a huge amount and the priest and all others they will take them in the front they will go and do some arati and like this they are coming out before all thinking we are somebody and there will be nobody afterwards they don't understand so this is the thing this is not one life this is not one life so one must be very very careful sat there we have to stick to truth and that's why sirama krishnadev said go to sadhu satsang the next class and then i have a crowd coming the week we will meet and we will discuss about the satsang here the rama he was the main quality satya and one simple devotee i was just because you know him a very very humble devotee he was the worshiper of sri rama and he denied to say a single false because the yamindar the landlord of that time of the village say because people knew that he never tell lies if you go and tell a lie only a single life for me i will win this case and for that i will give you everything but if you are not obeying me then i will take away everything from you but he said no this is called character what is character but i feel the character means it's not a good man he's not a person who is not telling lies it's not a person who is not stealing the character means a person who can say no on the face of temptation who can say no on the face of fear hear his name and that's why the god himself said kadhiran i like to be your son kudiram said no sir please don't come i'm so poor i won't be able to serve you properly no no i'll come and he came not only he the vishnu shiva and also brahma they all came in one body that is sri ramakrishna and khudiram became omar because he is the father of sri ramakrishna as long as the sun and the moon will be there as long the human society will be there as long there will be purity in the hearts of the human being so long the ramakrishna's name will be there and each and every one will remember the simple brahman just because it never deviated from the truth now he is amar in the krishna what was his quality diya in a simple way is telling if you repeat the word gita again and again what comes gita gita it becomes the quality of sri krishna the other he could become the emperor of the whole this huge india but he refused he didn't take a small part of it this is the so these are the
