[3. Panchama Veda 03: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76WxzDsV1JQ)

so and then he was wondering who is this holy person holy man so sorry he got attracted and he went out to see the temple and once again came back here srima is coming back and then he's talking with the when he came back he saw that door is ajar and there is a lady standing over there seymour asked him can i enter because that is the custom of the educated people unannounced one should not enter this we discussed in our last class so when he entered and he saw the suramar krishna in a different mood little earlier he saw him talking with people now he saw him he is just answering some questions but at the same time his mind is reaching somewhere higher and then afterwards sidhana krishna is asking where do you live what is your occupation why have you come to varanathi these three questions he was wanted to suramar krishna wanted to know in details about sri maha master martial and this is very very surprising because it was not his characteristics we can say to inquire about people whoever came he talked with them that's all but here you find he is taking all information about master mushroom here master masha replied and seeing that he is absent-minded to some extent master mashay thought that maybe sriram krishna wants to perform meditation prayer etc was not understanding the how much advanced soul that he is meeting that was the first time so he said perhaps you want to perform your evening devotions in that case may we take our leave sridharan krishna still in ecstasy no evening devotion no it is not exactly that very ordinary conversation but it has a deep meaning last time when you met the last class we were discussing about the story of sirama krishna that one later one person lost his letter afterwards came to know about got that later back found that later and then he found that what is written over there and perform in that way that is that way when a person is reaching the goal we don't need other things that we find in the life of sri lanka then still after a while little conversation game saluted the master and took his leave then in a very simple way siram krishna said come again this is a wonderful invitation can't begin when he is asking a person come again here we can go back are from the rooftop of the kutibani those who have visited the nation they can understand from that rooftop used to call the people facing towards the banga and the other side of the ganga is the city of calcutta as in calling those people where you are come to me god is giving this call eternally but very very few people they can hear it majority of the people don't they don't listen the call of god because they are all busy busy with majority of the people they are busy to earn and somehow to survive somehow to leave those is not having those problem they are also having some other desire name fame all these things in the society so they don't listen to the call that is constantly knocking the door of our heart constantly god is knocking come back why because we have been created by him we have come out from the god and we must go back to god and then only circle will complete otherwise not and in between we will go on getting the knocks sometimes and sometimes some prizes will go on constantly ultimately when we will reach that god then only we can get the satisfaction in a wonderful way in a story that has been given in dua supernatural there's a bird two birds they're having the same plumage one girl is jumping from this branch to that branch and the speaking this fruit and that fruit sometimes sweet sometimes bitter experiencing the sukha and dukkha experiencing the bitterness and the happiness and continuously moving on and on and slowly slowly jumping upward upward upward suddenly this bird of the lower branch it saw a same type of bird of his same blue mention sitting on the upper branch god contained it this giving the story the punishment wants to say the same soul those who are tormenting over there they are also the same soul holy soul only problem is they do not understand what to do they are thinking if we purchase a car we'll be happy thinking if we construct a home we will be happy thinking if we go over there we'll be happy and like this way constantly going on on and on then ultimately when they see someone they wonder how he is so calm and this is the experience we find in the life of siddharth as a he was a prince he came out once he saw so many uh things passing on one person he is going he's darting on his stick the old man and one person is suffering another is dead and he was going on pondering am i going to have this type of experiences whether my wife also had the same whether my son will also pass through these stages he was asking question and every time he was listening the answer yes yes yes dini sorry monk is a nyasi he's also a human being unpardoned when he was going as if the peace was falling from his scattering from his person then he said who is this and decided to renounce the word this story of the life of bhagavad-gita and that teaches us the god is giving the call siddhartha heard it he understood it and responded to it and said her to transform to buddha knowledge in knowledge one knowledgeable one and here again we find many those who are majority of the people don't hear it can't hear it because so are so busy they are so busy one swami he was long out not coming to make the holy mother ma sardamoni i don't like to call holy mother mother is always holy why should i necessarily put it holy all our mothers are holy and the divine mother of course holiest of the holy now he was not coming to mother he was practicing tapasha and all these things nothing happened then he came to mother and after offering his pronunciation don't make me round this birth and death and birth the circle of death and birth then mother smile and say baba how many days you were himself roaming over there didn't look at me never cared for me now it is my time that i will also do a little so like that life goes the moment we hear the call then we come there's a beautiful bengali song it's not actually song these are all the prayer that comes out from the heart the words of our heart that's coming out to the music i get time to perform all my duties only i don't get time to remember you remember god i don't have time to call look at the people who go and call them please come they don't have time there are so many other engagements and truly they are having their engagements but suppose you say that there is a cinema actor is coming and you are invited to go over there and can talk to him or her and can have a dinner with her or him do you think they will say that i have some work i cannot go dear it will be very few bug people majority will jump on the idea they will all go why because that is the attraction worldly attraction rupa russia all the pipe they're constantly drawing us out so naturally we don't hear the call of immediately he started wondering who is this serene looking man who is drawing me back to him look at the word he used drawing me back to him is it possible for a man to be great without being a scholar he was wondering how wonderful it is i should like to see him again he himself said come again i shall go tomorrow or the day after a type of you know desire to meet make the beloved one meet to someone with whom really i want to go and meet that is we do not love god that's why we don't go to god we don't like to go to god when there are problems then only we go to pray to solve that problem otherwise not so this is the call that god has given to everyone and then again he is telling pratap's brother he was going on talking about the information and the beauty of krishna is the moment master masha came he started talking with him as if he was knowing him for a long time it was the first visit this is the second visit and the second visit when it came where do you live in calcutta ramakrishna where are you staying here i am at my elder sister ishan kobiraj house see bharanagar was not calcutta calcutta was very small a small city and those who have visited calcutta they have must have seen that there is a trench is there a river has been the dividing calcutta protecting calcutta so that goes up to calcutta where mother's house is there and after that it was not calcutta now it has been included into the calcutta that's why siram krishna is asking doing master much i said i am in calcutta then while where you are living here that means it is not calcutta but another was not calculated though it is a part and parcel now immediately he recognized oh kishan ishaan that means he knew that siram krishna he was a religious man most of his time he used to deep down in his samadhira's meditation but he used to keep information about the society he is to go and visit to the people why he had a mission what was that mission to awaken people that they are not ordinary human beings they are divine that divinity god himself going and visiting people asking them talking with them and encouraging them well how is gishop now the second almost second question how is keshap now he was very ill now he is asking this question to master moshe because is from calcutta and keshav and all others are very famous and obviously natural that people will know each other nowadays in this type of city life even here in chicago still people are having small small houses nice houses in calcutta and other places there is no house all apartments they don't know who is there the next apartment they don't care about but previously it was not all is to give information and kesha was a famous person the indeed i have hearts so too but i believe he is well known master mishra is replying then siddhan krishna said i made a vow to worship the mother with green coconut and sugar on kesha's recovery this is a habit of the back in india these people when there will be anything immediately they'll go to god and say if you listen to my prayer and if it my prayer is answered i will come with this type of puja to you so cream coconut and sugar directly if you are drinking the green coconut water that's not good for health so you are supposed to mix a little sugar the question is telling that green coconut water and little sugar to mother that he would offer if geishas get the recovery look at it how much love for kesha concern for kesha and who is kesha is a leader of brahma samaj who were denouncing cornell alcott he was the only american at that time in india britishers were there americans were not there in india swami vivekananda came to know about him he went all the way to meet him when he decided to come to america so that at least he gives a letter to someone who will be receiving him naturally in unknown place we are going if we get someone's address or some support what is it a great help you know what he said captain all good if you convert into my faith then only i'll support you otherwise not when swamiji declined how can i then afterwards that corner alcott wrote to his friends over here let the devil die in hunger and cold vivekananda came to know about it and say this devil is not born to do like that guy like that i'm going to do something so like this way people the thing the narrow-minded he was a religious person but at the same time his mind was so narrow and here is another person religious person sri ramakrishna who is praying to his own goddess ishta devi for the recovery of one who was not supporting his own religion own faith own power so that's why he's telling and then he's telling sometime in the early hours of the morning i would wake up and pray to her mother please make kesha well again if keshav doesn't leave whom shall i talk with when i go to calcutta so kesha was of that height and surroundings to get joy in his company because he could talk to him suppose a scientist suppose a doctor suppose a writer suppose someone of that if he gets that type of temperament can only he can become friend otherwise they can talk but after 10-15 minutes to be tired they can't understand they can't converse each other so keshav was up that high and so it was that i deserved to offer her green coconut and sugar tell me do you know of his certain mr cook who has come to calcutta he is inquiring from master martial majority of the people if they are religious people they will never inquire about anything they are simply going like this no i don't know him who is he unconcerned about the society never wanting this type of devotees they must be concerned about others also they must give information active always at the same time unattached so look at these questions he's asking about the all then one gentleman he told swamiji you need not to bother about all these things you only simply sit in the temple do all other things we will do i cannot sit constantly before taco and do puja if you like you can do that i will do your job also because ours is totally different type of temperament we like to go and see and mix and mothers also used to keep lot of information swamiji also knew so many people but at the same time look at their behavior on a test they know but don't interfere so he's think inquiring from the master master how much he know and what type of person he is is it true that he is giving lectures once keshav took me on a steamer and this mr cook too was in the party and then master him yes sir i have heard something like that but i have never been to his lectures i don't know much about him master moshe he was an ordinary teacher so naturally mr cook and kesha and they're all high society people so obviously master michelle was telling that i heard about them but i was not in their company changed the topic look over here brother came here stayed a few days he had nothing to do and said he wanted to leave here i came to know that he had left his wife and children with his father-in-law he has a whole root of them so i took him to task just fancy he is the father of so many children will people from the neighborhood feed them and bring them up he isn't even ashamed that someone else is feeding his wife and children and that they have been left at his father-in-law's house i scolded him very hard look at the sentence the word he's using i scolded him very hard and asked him to look for a job then he was willing to leave here swadhar mom when you are married you have to look after your family so that is the wonderful way the religion is taught by sriram krishna if we look at the buddhist movement bhagavan buddha never wanted it but afterwards the movement as such this world is illusioning dukkha of pain and misery and it has a cause the misery has a cause and then from this misery you can also get the liberation and there is a way to get the liberation these are the four are your chakras in buddhism they say these are the four truths that's true this world is nothing but illusory misery full of misery for whom those who have understood it not for all those who have not understood it if you call them forcefully then what happened you will not only become or just behaving acting but at the same time you will be reducing your ideology also and that is what has happened in the buddhism thousands of people is to join in the monastery just putting on the monks girl will do no it is the mind only is your temperament it is your thought that has to be changed so here siram krishna doing just opposite brother is quoting and immediately telling to sri mah why suddenly totally unknown person why is talking like this afterwards we'll know shrimp is not unknown to surround krishna that we will know afterwards here siram krishna is telling that i scolded him and similarly when you were supposed to perform this type of duties and you say that i won't i will do this and i will do that i'll bake no i think all of you who rate the life of sri and holy mother to the wonderful two things he said to mother he said never stretch your hand before anyone like this never in this form begging asking help to no one rather if it is possible try to give someone a joke like this put the hand in this way and try to give try to help but never be because householders should not be should not ask things from others why because his self-confidence will be lost he'll be depending on others and same sidaan krishna he said to swami vivekananda go and bake from each house look at it it is the divine duty of the sannyasims they should not earn by doing some business or in job and all these things they will go to different houses little from each house madhu curry like the bee it goes to all flowers take a little honey and goes similarly a monk will go to different houses to different people approach to different people and collect funds from that and he will do some job some work which will be beneficial for the society sometimes we find then that some of the organizations getting lot of support from the devotees and they're creating huge wonderful architectural beauty and all those things it's not for the monks that's for the kings that's for the businessmen just for the rich people of the society monks what they should do they should try to find out the people who are at the bottom of the society they should go and with every thing that they earn should try to help them because there are leaving gods waiting over there for his service for his job for his puja but that is the thing siram krishna is teaching here and then we find this master masha this after the sadhana he is asking master mushroom some questions this is the unique part of this here he is asking are you married this is a question very embarrassing for the people because in those days people used to get married in 15 16 years boys when they are 15 16 years they used to get mad engaged engagement will be there not that immediately they'll be living together husband wife wife maybe six years seven years old and the husband may be 12 16 15 like that they'll be engaged and then afterwards when they are grown up then he himself also did same now he are you married then yes sir he is not hesitating yes sir he is telling oh ramla allah you know his nephew he's just somewhere nearby maybe he was there and calling him siram krishna is very sad you can say when your heart is answered he himself is married ramallah was also married then why he is behaving like this like one guilty of a terrible offense is writing aim said motionless his eyes fixed on the ground he was a very soft kind headed person in those days he was aiming as a master degree even then he was just feeling guilty he said to himself is it such a wicked thing to marry this is the first time he is getting this type of question the master continued having any children this time aim could hear the beating of his own heart then he whispered in a trembling voice he couldn't pronounce it properly he was very as low voice as possible he was telling he said i have children very sadly said speechless his bride had received a blow him was thinking he knew everything of life because he was an educated man he was a hit master a principal of a school after a few minutes siram krishna looked at him kindly and said this is very important why he is asking this question and replying in this manner then he is disclosing you see you have certain good signs i know them by looking at a person's forehead his eyes and so on the wonderful knowledge he was knowing that it's called samadhra vida there's a type of knowledge that people can understand by seeing the foreign and different features and sometimes afterwards will come to know and you know all who has raped the life of sri ramakrishna then sometimes you'll be owing the hand from the finger and to this elbow he'll be owing the hand and then he can understand he could understand what type of person he is what type of mentality so if we try this will be impossible because this is a special type of knowledge now this how siran krishna could know there are so many arguments are there here actually afterwards you can see in one play siram krishna years years before 500 years before caitanya mahaprabhu was there how could siram krishna see caitanya mahaprabhu so naturally people will wonder and not only caitanya mahaprabhu all these people that they were there he must be looking at us also and remembering us that these people are coming and listening and we'll find it it's really true it's not true and the god eyes if you see jagannatha at the center of india he's sitting his name is means the universe is not the word universe means the creator the lord and very peculiarly this god is not having the hands he is not having the legs he is only having two big eyes without any eyelid very peculiar as we grow in that situation we don't feel anything but certainly if some foreigners will go and see the image of jagatha they'll wonder how it is peculiar type of image not having the hands not having the legs only to be guys why because god is all pervading everywhere to make ordinary people understand it many of the people who are the worshiper of jagannatha they don't know it and perhaps they won't like to believe it also because they like to live in their stories and stories are nothing but to attract here it says that it is not he or she it is that why that because the atman has no gender is the consciousness all perfecting in distance in near inside outside everywhere and that is why the god is the form of the god it doesn't need any legs because we need the legs to go from here to there but god doesn't it's already there we need the hands to perform some work it doesn't because only thinking is sufficient but he's having to be guys without any eyelid why constantly observing constantly seeing who is doing what that's called karma theory comes through these and here the master mashay the moment he saw he could understand not only that he could understand by seeing the narendra now he told you are the god who has come down to help the human being not in himself was doubting what is it then he said you know you are having 18 such power only with one that power kesha is becoming so popular and powerful 18 such power is there within you he said sad please don't say all this thing i know you love me but that doesn't mean you have to exaggerate so much people will laugh keshav is such a person and i am such a little taku told what to do i am not telling his mother forcing me to do asking me to say so that afterwards it became so true so that's why he could see when he saw the rakhal maharaja brahmanandaji immediately understood that he was the com in the company of krishna babur maharaj he was a part of sri radha pure so that is the thing he could immediately see and how it is the same doubt also came in the mind of arjuna when lord krishna said imam viva yoga practice see this i imparted this immortal yoga to give a swan how it is possible you are you and me are almost the same age now you are telling that you told to surya viva swan how it is possible thousands of years before he was there existing then the way that he expressed the doubt krishna is replying means i know all those but you don't understand you don't remember it at the last he is using that you are a ferocious fighter even then you do not remember it now he is not addressing as arjuna he is telling parantha even then you do not unders know it so this is then naturally god has created us we are not the products of blind chance we are highly intelligent creations therefore it stands to reason that some great intelligence must have created us and we call that intelligence as god certainly god would not bring us with so many inequalities good and bad when god has created us then how it is that so many good and bad is there every good or bad qualities we have is the heritage of the past the law of karma why should we do good work there it is coming in in different dimensions in bhagavad-gita and bhagavatam almost in every scriptural books we find this performers of meritorious deeds performers of meritorious deeds now there are some people they think that if we kill hundreds of people by bomb blast we are doing meritorious deeds they are not human being at all because they don't have their own thinking if you really like to fight fight with the soldiers if you really like to show your anger courage and all this go to those people who are really encountered can encounter with you why do these ladies the children and when they are totally unaware they are enjoying over there and suddenly the boom blast and all these things why so this is the thing but they are doing it not as a just activity that i'm your you know it's the war going on and i'm doing to doing this type of work to disturb the other country enemy country no no not like that as a religious work but that is the wrong thing that's why it is telling ramani or acharana not hurting anyone some other time in details we'll discuss in bhagavad-gita in so many words they are telling which are the good words not true words you should hurt anyone holy mother also telling karma devi that you should not hurt anyone with your words also that is the thing i am really wondering over here whatever name may not be from the heart maybe only from the leaves but still people are so courteous the moment you are looking at someone if there is any eye contact unknown people they will smile at rest in our places we never bother to smile why do you smile rather you simply look at him in such a way why you are looking at me like that and who is this new fellow here people are curious they like to see but at the same time the moment i contact immediately smiling at rest totally unknown then when they are talking and helping in a very very courteous way that is the human quality must be a behavior and that we should must know this is ramona and another is what is their performance of bad deeds something is there within our body which passes through body after body yet the famous in the second chapter naruto is as easy as that when the garments become old the people they leave it and purchase the new and similarly when this body become old the one who is residing within it it leaves it as an old used garment look at it just like an old used garment they leave it similarly the body also one who is living within this who is that jiva atma is a part and parcel of paramatma this is the philosophy of the old ancient tradition of india so this you can understand and then swami vivekananda his life after death in that lecture he's telling the idea of reincarnation is most essential for the moral well-being of human race there are objections to this theory what is the objection first and foremost objections by the very prominent philosophers why do we not remember our past suppose we are having the again and again reward why we are not remembering it then swamiji gave a long answer to it sometime making some then here swamiji is telling if the only criteria is to remember do you remember your uh baby hoop days none of us the baby hood days when we were on the lap of our mother what we used to do how used to eat and who took care do you really remember does it mean as because we cannot remember the babyhood days that there was no babyhood in our life similarly this also this is krishna and swami vivekananda maharaja devi in the presentation they are accepting and this also attached with law of karma siram krsna he who was rama he who was krishna in this body as sri rama krishna and when that too when only his disciple narendra not was thinking and he was in the excruciating pain he was suffering over there and he was thinking at this moment if he can say that he is god i will believe so many times he has taken the activity and this time also again examine and tackle as they call pass that exam out by telling this immediately read the mind immediately replied in a very wonderful way he who was rama who was krishna is this in this body as sri ramakrishna again and again the god is taking the form of different name and form to help the human being ma sarudamani devi also when she went to rameshwar in rameshwara i think many of you have already visited there is a shiva linga made by sand that was made by shika ram wanted to worship shiva because he has killed so many people in the world so by worshiping shiva he wanted to that just performing you know some type of performances etc hanuman went to bring the shiva linga but he was late so rama thought what to do then ma shita she made a shiva linga by sand only and chandra perfume puja over there the sand lingam that image still there they have kept it mother sardamani devi went over there saw it and then she was soliloquizing jamonti rekigachi as i kept it same way it is still there so when i went over there when i saw i was wondering this from ramachandra yoga the same thing is there if you don't believe it don't believe it but if you believe it it's a naturality is a wonderful thing and then also when in vindavana mother went to vrindavan she felt that she is radha so this we also sometimes when we're looking at someone immediately we'll think oh i have seen you somewhere where from swamiji is giving the argument again sometime when we see something immediately understand this is this how it is because it is in our memory otherwise how it comes how can we remember it our behavior as a human child our behavior as a cough our behavior as a kitten are all different why because they are born with some memory and that proves the rebar the moment with the rebirth comes to naturally it comes karma the work otherwise why they are so many differences divergence that you find between man and man is their power proves the theory of reincarnation once iran krishna went to vikka with the sagar sagar means ocean he was such a learned person he got that certificate a person of knowledge portion of knowledge and then he also that viddasha said do you think the human being are all different and the mastery ramakrishna whenever attended school he immediately said why then i have come to meet you have you grown some horns on your head no because you are different from other people why they are different karma the people are good and bad because of their karma and naturally the rebirth counterparts the law of karma rebirth theory reincarnation theory that naturally supports the karma khala theory and in the karma palace explain the whole thing they say there are some people who are really very good all through their life what will happen to them after the death and they have not realized the brahman the ultimate goal they have not realized but all through their life they have practiced higher spiritual values what will happen to them they will go to brahmaluka very near to liberation this brahmaloka those who are going from there if they are again they are performing the good action they will be liberated mukti but even then there are chances when you go to heaven those who go to heaven after performing good deeds is it for even with your good deeds if you are reaching the heaven but in the heaven also if you are not continuing with that then what happened like we keeps a lot of money in the bank and then go on spending and then credit card debit card and all those things goes on on then suddenly what will happen then one day one letter will come from the bank uh it's not there and you have taken so much of money we are going to take out your whatever party you are having similarly nakashi after performing all those things you may come on this you must have to come on this or you may go down here in brahmaloka and those mediocre we can say mediocre type they do good little and also bad and like that they have a desire to be good and they're trying to be good and all that they go to chandra loka and this from the chandra loka once again they come back to this earth once again they get the human form human birth once again they are given the opportunity to perform good works and slowly slowly step by step to go to brahmaloka then to mukti and third group they do perform forbidden action what is the forbidden action we know in the law of every country there are forbidden things you should not do this you should not do that if you are doing you will be punished like this and that similarly in the spiritual life also the forbidden actions are there if you are performing like that then what will happen you may sub human bodies you have to leave like a dog cat animals and like that only some human body you may have to leave very peculiarly will see some of the dogs and cats and this type of pets they loved to live in the temple there was a dog swamiji used to love swami bibi and one day he became angry with the dog then he asked to some people take the dog cross the ganga and leave it in the calcutta and that other side of the ganga and they left that the dog was taken by pole and he was left over there when they came back after some time they found it has swung across the whole ganga and once again sitting in that place and looking at swamiji it only then afterwards it so happened when it died it felt they left i think somewhere they kept the body but it went to the ganga and in the webtime it came once again and then its body was stuck at the bellurmont area it was there so how can you explain it it may be a just accident but it must be something that was there and some of the cats also they'd be constantly with the temple they can go to other neighborhoods they won't they'll be in the temple or going around like these that are there some human bodies maybe they were in the previous life they were human beings they made some mistakes heinous work that's why in this life they have come down so one must be very very careful about one's action and finally extremely wild actions what happened to them many birds as insignificant creatures like the mosquito and all others they'll be leaving again again and again no one as you so you re each action has its equal and opposite reaction as the they say in the science similarly in our action also that it is good action of master marshall that he came in contact with sirama krishna and when when he was having dispassion about the family life about his he was not at all attached to that life he wanted to go away from there then he came in contact with god himself and why god was wondering because afterwards he said you had so many good qualities if you were not bound by your worldly duties i could use you your all these qualities for spreading the message of god when he came to know about swami vivekananda that he may get married because one very rich person he was negotiating with his parents narendra experience and they are very rich and offering that if narendra is marrying the girl then they will give all the expenditure for him to go to london and to study law over there to become a barrister the moment he heard he ran to mother kali and prayed to mother kalima okay mother don't bound him because i need him to work mother is krishna and god is krishna at the salaam again the krishna is behaving in this way why these are all to understand sometimes the people will be talking like this why what is there siram krishna was married why you people not marrying so that is totally different the temperament the mentality the moment you are attached with anything and every evening as we pray to takur taji renouncing what jaati kula and maan these are the three words you know i belong to the such and such and naturally it leaves like that impression will be there you're bound by that it's very very subtle if one starts thinking that i am so and so i am so and so accepted jaati kula family those who are having good families sometimes they'll be going on telling my father was so and so and this and all people will say see look at him such a rich person's son he has become long and naturally they will bring all good things for them so that's not good taji jaati kula and man man means amgar you may come to takur but unless and until we understand through that prayer swami vivekananda who was none other than siram krishna himself in that form is teaching us every evening we must pray and pray understanding the words of the songs otherwise entertainment we are singing the song if you go to belmod there'll be two peop brahmacarians sitting in both sides they are playing that big aquarium sort of things and the harmonium doppler and so many musical instruments will be there excellent music if you like to hear music that's the music but if you go every word when you are praying the very first word it is please cut the bondage of the worldliness and what is the worldliness these so sometimes people are they come and say swamiji are you bengali and i don't know you better guess and this is the thing that one devotee should not do i'm telling you if you are really like to become the devotee of sri ramakrishna please keep in mind broad mind anyone takes this name he is my guru swami vivekananda is telling if anyone is taking the name of sri ramakrishna i am the servant of his servant and sometimes he says servants of his servants of his servant why because unless and until the humbleness is there that broadness is there you can never reach this god he looks so simple but very difficult to reach very very difficult very simple you need not to do anything only understand two things who are you and who am i what is our relationship that's will do people are so happy go only this much that we know no it's very difficult so that is the reason in the panchama veda in the pages of the gospel of sirama krishna katha amrita we will find again and again these things will be reminded to us so that we get the knowledge and about that knowledge again master master you will get a review from the master siram krishna after this now please change your the other side of the paper we will chant it and look at the words if you can understand the sanskrit word the profoundity foreign the a in next friday coming friday so discourse on qatar upon asia and next sunday i may not be here because i am visiting uh the washington dc or they will be inaugurating a temple over there look at it whereas siram krishna was a kamaruku washington dc and there he will be sitting and afterwards next tuesday also i could come over here i will come over
