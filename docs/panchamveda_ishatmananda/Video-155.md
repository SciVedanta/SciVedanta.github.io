[156: Panchama Veda 156- The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlTzjSyhAwc)

so before that as usual let us chant this mantra Tabu Kadam rhythm topped achieve annum Kaviri rhythm Calma shop 'him subhana Mangalam srimad artem booby green and de bourree dodging are the last time in the last class we were discussing a totally different aspect the SI la macchina was discussing and one gentleman came he once wanted to discuss about the Guiana mark the part of knowledge so he was quoting from different scripture he quoted from utter gita agni table dejar t-yong agni the fire is that God for the brahmanas the GRT moon enum ready derivative but the Moonies contemplate him the God within their heart pratima Salvati naam the men of less knowledge so they worship God in the image but sarvatra sama-darsinah the service a mother she and the Yogi's who have attained the same sightedness that is the ultimate same cited Sri Ramakrishna will be discussing this same sightedness how it is possible after the complete and perfect realization of the Brahm so this we will discuss and the people will see that how the people with different moods different barber as we call it and they are approaching towards God serrano Krishna adding to the traditional the Baba's that is five he added special one Santana Baba the mood of a child towards God so that will be the sixth one we will read that here see Ramakrishna is discussing about each time Mahima repeated winded Mahima as a person who like the Guru Marga because you know intellectual satisfaction comes that is the reason the one of our Swami he always speaks and he speaks very well I heard I didn't hear him directly and I have invited him for our retreat and now onwards the retreat will been to August but now onwards people are booking only for his retreat that's a very good explainer of the Vedanta are really interested in Viana do they really practice gana I don't know but one thing is very clear it gives us satisfaction those who are intelligent intelligent type of people educated people understand the arguments yuck tea it's a very wonderful satisfaction so that's natural people are attracted to that and here see Ramakrishna he saw the Mahima tyrannous comforts in our busines is a true master he wants to help a person to realize God and always tried to guide him in the proper channel that's way the moment when he mutter and going on quoting and he is quoting from the Shiva - todra he was quoting from different scripture finally he was that we wish that Shankar Acharya he was telling I am the Shiva I am Shiva the many as many times he is repeating that word and see Ramakrishna is repeating again and again with a smile not I not right Dow not I not I Dow again and again I am Shiva immediately see Ramakrishna with a smile is Ray not I Dow Y because Adhikari it is good that we are reading we are understanding we are liking we are explaining we are discussing that's one thing but the spiritual practice is completely different thing and that is very serious thing you have to choose that sometimes even the students of arts they go to listen to a great scholar in physics the long back I went attended one banquet one physicist came and he was explaining everything his physics and a wonderful way he was explaining all people liked him we felt as if he should continue so that is a intellectual way now if all of us that day we were sitting over there if they ask us to go and enroll our server the student of physics how many amigo I don't know but the problem is this satisfaction is one thing but serious pursuit for the knowledge that depends on your attitude that is called Adhikari I will qualify for that in the Vedanta they say Adhikari Adhikari to Medina and they go on continuously for a long long way and all these qualities you should have then only here Adhikari forbidden it's not just study it's ok be done to study is alright but those who are taking up the path of knowledge as the spiritual path 14 they have to understand am I really truly capable to do this the majority of the students they go and choose wrong path and after some time they understand oh it is not by that time a lot of money has been spent and the time has gone now he shifts the other courses other courses so focus should be so the teacher the master particularly spiritual guide they must be always guiding you in the proper way you must study in this way this is not your path you know that wonderful way that one gentleman came a young man to become a monk in the ramakrishna mission at that time the direct disciple of sri ramakrishna swami brahmananda ji he was the president this young man came to him Brahman and Ajit told this is not your path you go and study God will take your service in a different way that young man afterwards became Netaji Subash Chandra Bose he joined in the politics he became an IAS officer and then in the joint in the politics is a big name in the Indian history so if he joined as a monk it would have been a complete failure for him frustration for him and everything would have been lost recently also the present Prime Minister of India Morty he also came not in the Modi to become a monk the seeing the monks the serene and good-looking and all this I like to be mom but the monks life is completely different the serum Oh Krishna is also guiding proper way and he is a very good master without hurting the feelings of the my michurin whenever he is telling I am the shiver that only one can say who is not having any attachment with the world completely detached when you were authoring as a song so many saw appeared children they will be singing mano would the Home Guard cheat on in AHA man they will go on singing like that idea Salameh krishna is guiding in Mahima read a few more verses and also a description of six psychic centers of the body so that he was of the yoga there are fine messages in the Rama gita he is telling he's very fond of quoting from those books then some people are there they are very fond of it like this but look at the master sadhana Krishna oh you are talking about those books many people came and discussed about the Rama gita and all that it has already been done he's not giving much importance on that only those who are capable to follow and very few who can really follow the path of knowledge because ego completely ego free person can follow the path of knowledge we will come to that Mima recited the description of the oh those who read a little and it all is bubbled within their mind they want to tell it to others to get the appreciation this is very common and he was going on coding sitting before Sri Ramakrishna instead of listening to him instead of hearing from him getting the guidance on him he's going on shri krishna didn't say anything he liked it but now and then whenever he's stopping he's guiding him it is like the unceasing flow of oil like the long field of a bell so there is the own color here he was explaining then afterwards the other and Mahima saluted the master and departed the ceramic dish no to the devotee the mother√≠s would mean such a mind that I cannot hide anything from anyone charlotta simplicity the child they cannot hide anything now see Ramakrishna is telling this is very Mahima Jordan was talking about the gana now surrender Krishna's telling we have to mark over here the mother has put me in such a state it's not that I am practicing the mother the universal mother now my ego is completely gone whatever I am doing it is only the divine mother's play can imagine the condition their mental condition whatever he is doing it nothing but the gods so mother has kept me in such a state of mind hiding from anything I cannot hide anything mine is the condition of a child rouxelle doesn't understand him and the rock all means some he brahmananda he was a young man of seventeen eighteen used to stay with this ramakrishna used to help him but to understand ceramic is not that condition soraka he's the son of a very rich person as a German doll the landlord so but aristocracy you know that in the edge ticket people they will never speak properly or say everything openly they don't like even if we are asking someone how are you are what are the details of your air they don't like we also don't like many at times people are asking him but cinnamic is nice I mean I cannot hide anything like a child and why it is not that I am just going on telling like that mother has kept me in to that condition so I am so this is very important and bracha doesn't understand he covers my injured arm wrapping my body with a cloth least others should see my injured injury and criticize me the people have the habit to think that even the Jesus when he was carrying his cross though all over the both the sides of the street sort of the people who were there and they were criticizing this all he is Masseria he has he came and he was claiming that he'll be saving us he cannot save himself look at it completely misunderstanding saving all means what they couldn't understand he could they could not understand that now after two thousand years people are understanding who was Jesus so this is what ceramic isne he wanted to show it see I broke my hand but Raquel that brahmananda after is brahmananda he was hiding it into don't show you what people will think you are a teacher you're a spiritual master you cannot help yourself now how you will guide others see Ramakrishna is not liking that I used to sleep in the same room with the motor and his wife so Ramakrishna was 30 to 35 years old at that time it's a very young man but the mind was so simple just like a father and the mother is sleeping as if the baby is also sleeping in her with them the neighbor also felt like that they felt as if it is the same and this we are discussing about the condition of the ladies the women in the 18th century 19th and early 19th century the very Orthodox ladies they will never see any other so I mean the other Mel C Ramakrishna young man is also sleeping with the mature and his wife so that simplicity why no body consciousness only my mother he is living in that way so I have given the title today's subject as Salam o Krishna the child of the Divine Mother and this is a very special way he is telling sri ramakrishna after the resting and all he was telling now and then I become impatient about my arm I show it to these are that man and ask him whether I shall get well again that makes Rakhal angry why all the time you are asking people what they will know naturally so anyone is coming ceramic Krishna asking what do you think shall I get well after well how long it will take it is paining Rahul is telling why you're necessarily discussing all these things but Salaam o Krishna he is quoting this and then telling he doesn't understand my mood I have marked that work he doesn't understand my mood the mood means the complete dependence on the mother I am a child and child is just like that when he is hungry he never cares whether he's in the other man's house or somebody he will cry and it is the mother and other people they belong and they will take care of him the child only once full and when the food is there but then he is happy again he starts the plane he doesn't understand any thing because that child means completely free from any bondages and sometimes we are in great difficulty here in the Asuma some children will come and as a prank they see something on the world invariably other things are there they won't touch but that fire alarm they will go and pull and then they will hide somewhere but in the meantime the many you have already noticed that this is the child's prank it's not that they are going to do something harmful because the game is played why the mind is like that see Ramakrishna is telling I am asking this childlike impatience of mind is nothing new he is telling then he is asking the aim his disciple master marsha history can you tell me why hey I am so impatient sometimes he is asking in this way particularly we find many times he's asking master marsha what do you think about me am i progressing in the spiritual path he is asking him and what I am Telling all this thing is it all right why he is asking one of our show me he's analyzing this for two things one how far the disciple has understood the master it is clarifying the Hulan first thing secondly whether he is having any ego or not moment anyone getting this type of opportunity of chances is all this mental doesn't understand I have to say then he starts guiding him you should don't do this you should not do that you should not eat addition like that the ego Rises off and they feel I must guide because the does just gentleman doesn't understand wrong so this is the way the master wants to check how much the disciple has understood he the master so he's asking can you tell me why I am so impatient master Masha is excellent he never made any mistakes so many times the Ramakrishna acts different type of questions every time his answer was perfect with all humbleness he's telling your mind said he is always absorbed in Samadhi you have kept a fraction of it on your body for the welfare of the devotees therefore you feel impatient now and then for your body's safety the salam o krishna the avatar his about Aaron he's coming because to stablish Dharma to guide the human being to follow the path of righteousness and naturally the avatar is the great work he is going and explaining it how just living that life and naturally he has to go he has to meet he has to talk if you notice the Lord Buddha he traveled all the length and breadth of the country everywhere used to go and meet the ordinary people sometimes only rich people sometimes only famous people but most of the time he is going and meeting all ordinary people talking with them inspiring them in Mars if they are following then the human generation next generation will also be following that path I have noticed it in America meaning of the Indian parents when they came over here they were very young so obviously that attitude was totally different and their worldly enjoyment a good car good building good everything all these worldly things are best in America so afterwards when they become parents when they see their children they in the field we should give them something some traditions of our country and they always try to give that why they are now the understood understand that this is the best way to get the soleus otherwise my children will suffer and now the children became young people not understanding and then time will come it will be too late for them to understand it so there are two things mind and the physical body part of the mind is completely observed to satisfy the human but physical needs and they go on that's called the worldly thoughts and they go on doing that afterwards they find nothing has given us the peace happiness joy and helped - then when they understand it is too late at that time they loses us because there was no practices said there loses the country then dissatisfaction comes so this is the reason it is the tradition that's why Swami Vivekananda told culture is the culture that withstand shocks what is the culture that knowledge of the truth the culture through painting through music through songs through all dialogues everything always talked about the self the soul the God the Eternity in every society it is there and that fashion only they grow up and if they forget that they suffer afterwards and when they start suffering understanding the very less time is left for that so this is the Ramakrishna he is telling about that and he's chill telling asking his devotee why do I feel like that why should I be impatient the master Marcia is telling because you have kept a little mind on you this physical body so that you can help the devotees and you should go and meet the devotees they won't come the holy people they are going just like the Jesus traveling the huge length and breadth of that country meeting people and talking with them inspiring them giving the sermons telling them the stories and showing sometimes the miracles also because that time it was necessary by that way he is inspiring people and see Ramakrishna at that time again he was trying but the frail body what he will do see the Raman more she he never troubled he only lived the life because he was a sadhaka he chose a path he lived at life he ended over there that's all see Ramakrishna is not an justice sadaqa is an Avatara an Avatara has his own responsibilities shri krishna as an Avatara he was having his own responsibilities nobody was disturbing sit in Sri Krishna because they knew suit to suit Krishna is very powerful so naturally he could be he could leave his own life without disturbing I'll let this Pandava and go over the fight is the family matter why should I enter no he involved into that when you see the Ramachandra he is going and traveling and punishing people or rewarding people appreciating people guiding people and each and everywhere about the Hara he came for that but people and the place and the time so whatever was necessary he gave that his avatar so this is the the ministerial job the colors the tail Minister why here in America the colors Minister why because ministerial job is there you have to go to the people here to talk to them we have to give them soul as the inspiration guide them so this way you have no I am not going anywhere if anybody is coming is okay they are not coming forget about not like that so you have to keep your door always open if anybody is coming with sweet words you have to inspire that this is what see Ramakrishna was doing now that he's behaving in this way he is asking his devotee very close devotee about whom he himself prayed to the divine mother mother giving some power because he lives in the city Calcutta and there only educated people they are all coming and talking with him mixing with him if he get some power spiritual power then through his words they will get purified then that time when they are coming to me it becomes easy for me to give them proper seeds that will germinate and grow but if the raw material is coming to me it is very difficult for me to handle and make them all right so give them with little power so he was praying for his devotees so the messengers so they are going out exactly he gave the power to all these direct disciples he gave the power and he going on giving the power to all the moms we're going out and preaching working because of his power only it is possible otherwise a person cannot do any one trying all alone it is impossible that the presence of God and the power of God many bulent so when the people I went to Alabama I talked to the people people not that they're all just villagers and illiterate people all doctors and engineers and all the professors and this eat over there for three hours four hours so interested to listen to learn and whenever you are telling where did you come together discuss among yourself yes ROM you do it and slowly slowly when the hundred people are coming maybe 10 will be genuine dinner trying that is all right so this way the spiritual the administration goes in this way no force but love and this can be possible only if the God has given you the power otherwise simply you go and try to do it is impossible it's not possible sometimes one or two they are trying they're very good speaker they speak in this way but people only listen and enjoy but don't follow their words they will never but this shows that unless the God is giving the power his people won't take the spiritual words so that there may see Ramakrishna and he says sad because you have kept the mind on your body to help us the ordinary people so you ruined see Ramakrishna that is true now he is telling that is true a little of the mind is attached to the body it wants to enjoy the love of God and the company of the devotees this is a very special thing love of God and the company of the devotees the swami vivekananda he fixed the goal for us at Mauna moksha Jagat eita because we are trying to the is that so for us aqua moksha why you have left the heart and home are no moksha for the liberation of one's own self how you will do that by practicing spiritual discipline what are the spiritual discipline a discipline that you are imposing on yourself which will make you completely detached from the worldly things what are the worldly things nama and Jascha your name and fame that is the worldly thing the Jascha does fame and people should remember me people should know about me people so that the nama and Jascha name and fame these are two worldly things where from it comes from ego so what is the goal of the spiritual practice to eradicate that ego how that is possible imposing the godliness instead of eyeness Dao and not me this is the one path and easiest part that is exactly what Ramakrishna is teaching and money Malik told the master about an exhibition that was being held in Calcutta there is a wonderful spiritual person usually the spiritual person naturally they don't go see Ramakrishna before see Ramakrishna it was a taboo you're a spiritual man you should not go to this social worldly things see Ramakrishna was at ease in the practice the traditional practice of India if you're a spiritual man you are not supposed to go to those be places we're supposed to in a lonely place return right like that so navigation was so joyful used to go to Abel you even the theater is to go enjoy and then place the actor/actress is and used to talk to them how could you do and like that he'll be going and looking at the society people how they're living all these thing is to go house to house to talk to them to mean to them a meeting with them like this is to do now when they told about this then cinema Krishna's eyes filled with tears and he was telling it is called a beautiful image of jeshoda and the baby Krishna on a lap he was describing the person was describing that there is a exhibition of dolls and different type of dolls have come images have come there is an image module sugar and the baby Krishna he was describing Sri Ramakrishna's eyes filled with tears because of emotion because this particular time cinema Krishna was passing through a child's mode the moment the child heard about the mother our affection our love remembered the mother and his eyes are filled with tears and he was telling if you were than money when they saw that Ramakrishna's eyes at from the tears they were consoling him no I like this moment your health is not good otherwise I'd have taken you over there then saddam occasion is telling i shall be able to see everything even if i go i won't be able to see everything even if i go why perhaps my eyes will fall on some certain thing and I shall become unconscious then I shall not be able to see the rest then he is telling I was taken to the zoological garden I went into Samadhi at the sight of the lion for the carrier of the mother Durga awakened in my mind and the consciousness like that he lost she was into Samadhi just by seeing one line he went to zoo near our garden instead of seeing all those things he only saw the line and went into Samadhi a little that so anything suggesting that the God or goddesses his mind was so much tuned with that that's why the master MA she told you have kept a little portion of your mind on your body otherwise the whole mind is constantly going on merging with that that the highest form frames those who are trying to meditate we can understand this when you are trying to control our mind a little it is so impossible thing now ceramic is not exactly opposite his mind is constantly going and merging with the infinite it was difficult for him not to go into Samadhi so he was trying hard to give his mind on these worldly things I will eat I will go to meet him I will take this I will take that all those things he was going on suggesting his mind so that his mind comes down on the body to master my three observance was so perfect and ours is 99% of that when we try to go to margin it is it becomes impossible and he was telling the judge O'Malley 65 years the money money came he had been a member of the Brahmo Samaj for many years and now see Ramakrishna is guiding him giving in the instruction that would agree with his more that's initiation the ceramic is not giving the initiation according to the moon he to instruct you better doing this way even deactivate though he was attached with the Brahmo Samaj but he was not getting satisfaction he has come to see Ramakrishna he was liking him so he guided him so this is the way the master pundit journal and had very liberal views I visited him once and liked his attitude anyone with a liberal view he liked these attitudes and then he was telling to Menino once Manila he was telling a story cinema Krishna again and again harping on that particular point that you should be sincere spending your whole time to achieve the goal otherwise it is of no use reading this book that book and all all fancy things and by that way comparative religion then all these and that then afterwards there is no time money love understanding the ceramic richness the instruction he was telling a story one seven men were crossing Ganges in a boat one of them a pundit was making a great display of his erudition saying that he had started various books like the Vedas the Vedanta six systems of philosophy he asked a fellow passenger do you know Balanta no Revere said I don't know okay samkhya our Patanjali then they know Revere said have you read no philosophy whatsoever no revered sir the pondus was talking in his main way and the passenger sitting in silence when it creates storm arose and the boat was about to sink then the passengers said to the pundits say can you swim the pundit said no the passenger said but I can swim that means you are going to die but I will swim across the river by this story cinema Krishna repeated the story many times telling that what will save you we take that when there's a difficulty you know the swimming particularly in the river and the water we must know swimming similarly in this world only life there are so many things at there instead of going to this variety you choose one and learn it that will take you to the other Shore save you so ceramic isne was telling this particularly what will a man gain by knowing many Scripture the one thing needful is to know how to cross the river of the world God alone is real and all else usually so this is is very coated thing again and again he is giving this while Arjuna was aiming his arrow at the eye of the world he is giving again quoting from the Mahabharata Drona asked him what do you see do you see all these kings no sir replied Arjuna do you see the tree no sir do you see the bird no sir what do you see only the eye of the world where's that I have to should my arrow over there my goal my target and that way I am perfectly set to that focused now it is the modern English the same focused on that particular purpose so he was focused he who sees only the eye of the bird can hit the mark say Ramakrishna stealing he alone is clever who sees that God is real and all else is illusory and to him please buy a few fans for our news here you know in India it is very hard a warm place one hadia they usually the poor people they use the fan fan means meat of one type of leaf big strong leaf out of that that's good looking and there so he is asking the aim master much there's so many rich people at their location I didn't take anything from them he was asking master Masha was a teacher in those days teacher payment was very low and he was having a big family to to support from his salary but he wanted to take from him only many times he took that and that is called puja God Himself is taking the service from that it's not that if you have money God will accept it is only the devotion because the aim master Masha was completely devoted so God Himself is taking the pooja from him and to Manila look go and pay a visit to the devotee is better to meet the devotees if the devotees are meeting the devotees talking and chatting about the god that is good we talked about the socializing we go to the parties and meet the planes and people what we actually talk all kinds of things except God all different things will be there and even if we talk about the god of the god people many comparison oh he is a very good Swami this is not that way this is so comparison but have we even talked about that will benefit our mind we don't so I am trying to develop the small small groups among the devotees not that all the time connected with the ramakrishna idol different type of people so I have given the name began to study circle so they come and meet and they discuss about the Balanta one in half an hour they'll be reading from the pages of the book and close their eyes for five minutes to ponder what has been their they were reading what are the salient points of the doze pale teachings then afterwards another book so that continuously on one book not like that and second book again little meditation third again so their mind becomes calm and they go on listening for one hour so ten minutes ten minutes ten minutes like that it goes ten minutes reading five minutes meditation if they know the beginner saw in between so that way one hour and then afterwards half an hour over a cup of tea discussions what they have read very hard and what all those things when they go back not consciously but unconsciously they carry the message of life the art of living they say this is the art of living so unconsciously unknowingly the wonderful impressions of spirituality comes then at the time of difficulties those impressions that will help you it automatically it will come up and here the since my arm was injured a deep change has come over me I now delight only in the neural Allah not only like the God is the playing in the form of a human being the human manifestation of God Nietzsche and Leela these are the two Sanskrit words that he is using Nietzsche means indivisible Tsuchida Ananda Nietzsche is constant the word Detailers means constant without change that is Brahman and the Leela or the sport take various form Leela means the waves and different type of forms it takes and Leda is the leader of the deities Leela of the man lived up the universe whatever it go we see all around is the divine play of the God in the raga but Gaeta also Shri Krishna he is mentioning in one place a Bajoran tea mam mudha manusim tanum as written for Imbaba the God has taken the human form that is the highest manifestation any human he can think that today I am trying but some day I'll be like that that is called paramo of hava the highest manifestation highest condition god is so close to us I can see him I can hear his words I can touch him I can serve Him I can be in the company so easy remove our highest form problem means highest and this Brahma Baba egoistic people they do not understand it about john untii they do not understand it so that see Rama Krishna is telling it is God Himself who is sporting in the form of man it is he alone who has become money man League he was talking with that man he has become you he and the sheikhs the teaches thou art a cheetah an under Saddam o Krishna though he didn't attend any school never read the scripture or any books but used to go and listen so he learned almost everything the christianity islam sheikh ism to some extent buddhism of course all the of Hinduism now mundane man catches a glimpse of his real self and become speechless with wonder that those who are practicing meditation practicing spirituality sometimes and suddenly the feel that something has happened a wonderful joy comes so he is telling at such time now we must hear we must with concentration we must listen to this small world what happens after God realization what happens after the perfect meditation see our words the delegation is telling at such time he swims in an ocean of joy Ananda is joy so one who is not enjoy he can never become the brahmic we cannot consider in the god realized person a person who is having the hankering cannot be a cost God realized soul and that is why we find the majority of truly God loving people and not having the families the moment is a family has banned wives on the daughter the relation obviously a part of mind will go because this is the thing I have seen the mothers if you give something good they will eat a little and then carry that for their children obvious and for us I don't find anyone for going to carry so I eat everything not like that this way completely detached way one can enjoy so but joy will come and no desire there cannot be the same thing has been described in the Admiral Ayane ceramic is neither Narada said Oh Rama all mean our thai forms and it is Sita who has become all women why do people worship our genes all women has so many forms of the Divine Mother but her manifestation is greatest in the pure soul part genes because the body consciousness has not come but the human form that we can see in her into the manifestation of the Divine Mother so Kumari puja at the so famous Kumari means that virgin that they worship why do I become impatient when I am ill because the mother has placed me in the state of a child the child depends entirely on the mother this way particularly this mood Ramakrishna is adding one moon friends you know and there are five bubbles in the the drita form when we are worshipping God and there are five Harvest Moon and one is shantih shantih means the the mood of the Rishi's self-confident people you know this is going to happen this will be alright they all know about it confident nothing is going to happen it'll be alright sometimes when you go to the hospital you always our relatives and rainstick go on asking the doctor the same question is he going to be all right is he going to be all right apparently it is so critical what the doctor looks at it and say don't worry it will be alright maybe two three days have patience why because he has the experience he has seen these type of patients and many patients in that way so this it is okay so experience always it goes in this way the Rishi's they have experienced whole thing so they become very calm and composed and quiet self-confident whatever they see is okay it will be alright afterwards then come the Darcy Bravo anumana the Kree personality he was having all knowledge no ego he was having all power but no ego his knowledge his power his services is intellect everything he dedicated for his master's service it's not so easy so this is dust here Harbor that is as a servant that would do but Darcy and servant leader totally different this Dacia is a complete different type of moon there are many people they like to do like that but Sunday our affection of the mother madjoe Sudha was having not that she was not knowing the my baby is not an ordinary baby but at the same time her motherly affection the whole is is to prompt her I must have to take care of my baby otherwise what will happen to him so that is called Yashoda the mothers are always having that so the affection that already is there in the heart of the mother now directing towards God so we put the cover and the book good God and say now it is very cold we should not put on the fan even by mistake they come and they check their the fan is on or not that is called motherly down and they must be taking very careful and when in the morning they come and they slowly slowly it will be singing now get up tracker you have to a curious God is always a big eternal sleep because it is the consciousness always away but mother feels might baby sleeping he comes and slowly and then slowly gives something water to wash the mouth and then these and change the trace and then the little food and now you see people are coming they like to talk to you you have to like these they are treating that is called baths earlier circu have a friendly way as Arjuna this norm that distinction oh you are my master you will not eat like that just friendly way hey how are you and in this booty however you booty have like that so like you can also talk to God same way if you have that pure consciousness the God is my friend I have every right to talk to him and this is the beauty of the Hinduism even you can think God as your own lover as your own husband or world like that maduro bhava as Radha was having to her scarred Serrano Krishna is adding one and this is purest form and he said son bond of our in this line I as we read that now mother has kept me in this mood sometime what do we need in this one thing faith in the existence of God this is trust second self for negation I don't know anything my mother knows and complete dependence on the mother what shall I do I will go and ask the mother and third same sightedness when we are practicing that there is no difference my mother in every being so that is the main way the some ton of harbour I always feel is a unique thing that see Ramakrishna has introduced for all the other powers you have to practice you have to be careful that my master my lover my friend my god should not be disturbed through my behavior but was exactly opposite is a baby to chai and the son the daughter never cares whether the father will be angry or not he goes and demands you give me these you give me there and he goes out then the mother runs insist outside it's cold take care of your warm clothing these dad mother and the father they are taking care they always win the crossing the road they will take care the child never at any time is likes to run they'll be holding his hand and taking care that he is not meeting any accident
