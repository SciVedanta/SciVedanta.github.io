[92: Panchama Veda 92 : Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KKxaxjbdztc)

we'll be starting the gospel where Shami nickel ananda g the main full gospel is page number from 243 244 to fortify this pages let us begin with the pranaam mantra needin ginamit IAM on antelope um bak tonneau compa Drita bikram be ye chaahat arum / a mushy medium tamarama krishnam sheer asana mama in our last class we have already discussed on the wonderful excellent topic Maya and so difficult to explain the Maya do Maya is the main cause of all our bondages we cannot make progress in spiritual life why because of Maya and what is Maya we cannot divine so this is the very peculiar condition we cannot define but you can feel and that's why we have to depend on the the greatest advising that is Shankar Acharya and he's way of explanation then afterwards the great another very modern of the waiting swami vivekananda so this is the concept of Maya one cannot see God unless Maya steps aside that is the statement of sri ramakrishna and we have read it in page number 243 one cannot see God unless Maya steps aside so that is very very important for each and every violent those who really want to see God realize God develop spiritual life now in the spiritual life most of us we think a little bit of moral life little bit of goodness social life that is sufficient no it is totally different a complete conception about the goal and total dedication to reach to that goal that is called the spiritual life and to reach over there and that's why it says the millions and among the millions and millions of people only a very handful they are genuinely interested to realize God and among those who are trying to realize this that microscopic that number even then among those I one or two may be successful why because of Maya what is this Maya this is a very peculiar notion it is binding us with something which is not existing it is holding us back with something which which is not existing so just like a miracle only this much if one can understand but to understand that again and again we have to study we have to go to the holy people like bhagawan sri ramakrishna jesus with the great soul why to them because they have overcome that there are successful people they could stop the Maya they could push aside the Maya they could remove the yeah and that is why the Shankar Acharya gave that my ibadah Serrano Krishna along with the Maya bada explained the creation and also we discussed about just a few sentences Ahram Baba de there are so many other bothers are their brothers means the theories and what is the theory for only two things what is this creation why this creation how the creation came so that is called bother in Sanskrit bother means the philosophy or the way of thinking now if I think this world as I see it is real let's call another bother now we have discussed it already in our Sunday discourses there are people philosopher things that this is the right that is called aram bagh odd another is paranormal bother what did the RM ba the first cause is in and the effect is the ache now someone and say if there was no egg we're from the endgame and someone will say if there is no hen hao the egg will be produced so it goes like this there is none so aram baba de where from it started and they are confused they are going on suckling with this in first or egg first like this they called another bath perrine arm of other this world has been created or it has been done made by God how from its own self because except God there was nothing how then the total change the God has changed totally into this world existence let's Cal Poly nama but that cannot be if the God has changed itself how the mill has changed into yogurt now yogurt cannot go back to the milk form again so if the god has changed itself or himself or herself into this worldly form how God can go back to his own self so that is the Pauline amor bother then be worth the bother slowly slowly developed my ibadah that we have already discussed and then finally comes our dwade about we are not going to discuss over here just the names add weight of other that we will study in the next Sunday course it will be our we are discussing about the philosophy so advaita will come there then serrano krishna mentioned about purana contra along with vedanta purana let us say he is mentioning about the piranhas and there is actually tantra and bhakti and vedanta main three paths leading to the goal Vedanta then Tantra then bhakti so he said book the scriptures admit that the manifestation of power are different in different beings manifestation of power but manifestation is by God from God so that is one thing this has been manifested from God then each and every one is God yes then why one should go and pay respect to the other that is the question if I am also God you are also God all these that we see the animals the birds the insects and all this if their God manifestation of God then why we should consider human being as the best that is the question o Krishna giving the answer from the viewpoint of the book thief admitted the manifestations of power power of God are different in different being the best manifestation is in human being and among the humans also the best manifestation we see in the great Souls religious souls so this thing then what is the manifestation the maximum manifestation of God love unselfish love uh natus love and that generates from what from God so that is why it says all the different methods leading to the same goal what is that goal Mukti liberation god-realization etc so what is the mukthi now from our experience in this life we know that all that we see ultimately it comes to nothing so obviously after getting experienced again and again and again getting the heart again and again then one time the mind started thinking enough now I want to go beyond these and that is called the momoke shotta the minakshi otha means that is the unless and until that experience is coming it is impossible those people who have not enjoyed the boga all these things in the life if you go and talk to them about the religion it is as if you are giving a stone to a hungry person let them come let them enjoy and after the enjoyment a time will come that themselves will realize it is futile it is of no use this is not giving me the satisfaction this is not giving me Shanti the peace and to get the piece most of the people they go for or different type of drugs and somehow they are making their brain the thinking capacity numb when you are not thinking and there is no problem for you you just turn into transform yourself into like a wood or stone something like that majority of the people maximum people that's why it's a problem for each and every government drug trafficking who are the people purchasing drug illiterate people no ignoring children no they know it very well why they are purchasing for the fun and afterwards what happened they are bound by that habit and then the ultimate result of that habit suffering so why we are going to drugs becoming addicted to get joy what is the result that we are getting ultimately suffering terrible suffering each and everyone in the society will turn their head from us they won't look at us and the whole family the parents will be ashamed to introduce that child that son or daughter in the society and that particular person is suffering not getting any respect from any quarters so that is called ultimate thing suffering and then when we come to know about it what is the way out how can I go beyond this if I am a rich man ultimately in my old age I find that people are not loving me they are loving my property they are loving my money a person who was a powerful man powerful person in the society then when he returns then he understands it was the chair the power that he was enjoying so people was respecting him not for his himself but for the chair for the power when gentleman was killing today when I was in power people is to come to me when I am not in power nobody comes to me I go to everyone now it is opposite so now the realization comes at the end of our life but that is very late nothing wrong in starting from there itself but why not start early how by understanding by hearing by seeing my ex is not that all the time I have to experience in my life everything know by hearing and seeing we can learn so these are the things and that is called philosophy the motto bada the we go go go to God different type of people giving the this type of advices go to God that is the main source of creation somebody is giving the name God somebody Allah somebody's you ova somebody something else the Hindus they call it Brahman but the same Souls the center position go over there and that is called mukthi that is called liberation that is called God realization but there are hurdles and in the words of Bhagwan see Ramakrishna in the gospel there are eight fighters oosterbaan Donna there are eight fighters at the air and that is the main problem Vandana it is binding what are those eight particularly a thesis specifically it is not the Vedanta but the Tantra they say these are the eight fighters of the news that is binding you what are the DS ate green ah laga Byam shankha chigusa JT benjamine then Coulomb coelom Tata jati esto pasa proc edita ah cool arnab tantra mentioned these cool arnab tanta this country they say in this eight-week first is larger like Jimmy's averse a greener green his aversion greena then lock jaw aversion I don't like this so strong feeling I don't like this what happens if we constantly thinking about I don't like this I don't like these i do not like this i am actually going on meditating on that particular thing and when I am going on thinking like the rabona he was hating Rama ultimately what happened he was going on meditating on Rama in everything he was thinking oh this is by Rama that is by these so the aversion the strong disliking and liking this type of people cannot realize God so that is the first thing a version I hate everything I hate tremendous hate in the mind with that mind you can realize God who is all compassionate different type of people are coming in the different way the different manners it all belong to God I have nothing to do with that I am going towards God in my own way I have to be satisfied if not constantly I am agitating my mind and going every lock jaw the shame when I am trying to practice then people oh you are going to temple began to society my god Hey look at him he is going to be run the society goes to the swami ji he has becoming the mom then they will turn to his wife hey be careful he is going to all this fun and I am Shane no no no no what my friends would say so I won't go you are away from God in that case you have to take the decision if you people can go to the hotel if you can go and drink if you can go and shamelessly dance why can't I go to the temple I will go there so the larger the modesty is a good but the larger as because some people are talking about it someone commented something and immediately I was thinking that I will organize a good program and someone commented now you see it is not possible I cancelled that what happened you were trying to all going to have something good now just because of that someone commented there is a Bengali poem long back we read when you have children I want to do some good work but I cannot do that why because if somebody wills comment on that what will happen in Bengali they say par che lo que aquí chavali party perhaps perchance low key a key to Bali so that's why I see Rama Krishna is telling when you have decided to do something good do that you are not harming others don't bother about anything even your parents your family your relatives your friends your neighbors don't bother that's called lock jaw green alok jha then paya when there is all the time fear suppose I go to the temple then what will happen if there is suppose God becomes angry with me all that person becoming constantly thinking about that fear we can never achieve anything constantly the fear some people go to the temple to the churches out of fear oh I have done something wrong some what will happen let me go and confession this is not how to feel no so that fear about God it should not be so all these things we have seen depicted in the life of one lady raha that the rod ha she never cared all this meerabai this is the great personalities and they were in the society they wear in the household why the ladies then again and again because they have lot many social bindings even the Mel folks up to some extent free but these ladies are bound by the Society's rule still they are overcoming they are going and achieving the god so what are the news what are the binding first is greener a version I don't like that but still it's okay if they like it let them go that's okay Swami Vivekananda a except it's not toleration acceptance so there is a very higher stage it's not the Toleration somehow or other our country the rule is their government rules are there so I am tolerating no not like that understanding this is also a path Shami become the when he was very young used to come to see Ramakrishna does the group of people and these two worship the particular person as the god so naturally there are lot of another rumors were there about the characters and all that young boy he also heard about them and started grinning oh they are bad people I am NOT going to go to them I don't like to listen to them I don't like to hear their names what's the ramakrishna say this is the speciality he said why do you talk about thinking that way it is also a path now there is a house is a building and there are many doors are there one can enter the main door is their side doors are also their back door is also there in the olden days the people is to come scavengers to clean the dirt from the home from the back door most of the Indian another people so there is to have the back door the main people the house they they never use that only the scavengers is to come but salam o Krishna is telling suppose you have to enter into that building even from the back door which most of the people are shunning now suppose you enter into that what is the harm you are now you are inside the building inside the home that is also a path if you don't like don't go but why you are criticizing aversion and these are the teachings of sri ramakrishna he is the personification of parliament of religion at a few days we'll go to attain the parliament of religion what is the problem to religion is there a different type of people through different type of opinions they are having about the God and they have formulated different paths to reach God ok now why again and again here's up two years we have to go on because of the green arm because of the aversion because the hatred to remove that again and again and those who are talking about that other really understanding these they should understand and that is why the gospel of ceramic ISNA this is the answer for the modern problems at least for those who are thinking that true religion we can solve and we can develop the society they must study the gospel of Sri Ramakrishna an analytical study not the page after page you read and forget this is greener he said eight vandana aust abandon coating from the tantra first his aversion then the shame then the fear then Shankar doubt if i go to god what will happen to me will it be this way or that way all these and there and so much of doubt is there I have seen the life of the Ramakrishna I have seen the life of caitanya mahaprabhu i have seen the life of Shankara have seen the life of Jesus Lord Buddha all these are standing before me enough so many examples they are there before me why should I have to doubt if i go to god it is going to be good for me that's all no doubt every day doubting Thomas can do nothing so this is the Shanga think joog Upshaw jugosa means tendency to height holy some people will be there they have the tendency to hide what you are hiding actually something you must have you are having that you don't like to express before others why you are hiding constantly when you are not having the friends why can't you open up no all the time hiding and discussed so that is the Jew Gupta they also cannot realize God that is also in news and there's also binding then lung family again and again we talked about the Lord Buddha Gautama was a Prem's he was a king and these and that that was there of course but why you have to constantly if we are thinking is all right if the person if the Gautama was thinking I am a king I was a king my brother was having a lot of money if they go on thinking in that we can drive a realize God if we are trying to realize God then you cannot drag that Coulomb kula means the family and so proud of the family oh they are coming from very poor family and they're very nasty background doesn't matter at all this is very very important that's why one should not ask or inquire about the family background of a monk or if a monkey is going on tilling I used to study in this university i have completed this paper i had a doctorate then these days once he mentioned is ok but again and again he is mentioning about all the family background and all this it is impossible to realize God because that is also a binding jaffna pucho sudoku which ok on keyboard that is what they say in the traditionally ja na poocho sudoku we're asking for the in which family in which groove and which cost what is the nonsense you are asking about put your gang give out that is the main thing when you are talking with a monk when you like to listen from him ask about the religion things spiritual thing philosophical thing that is the question so that is the historic that monk or otherwise spiritual person otherwise it is of no use the coulomb and the I think I told you that story when four of us for mongs we went to gongo three and there it is so cold outside and we are from the plane we never saw the snow falling that was the first experience perhaps terrible cold outside so but the person who was maintaining the astana he said you have to take the lunch at dinner then only will get the blankets so that was the salad for that who you were waiting eight o'clock there will be our third of the ramachandra they aim the food and then only the blankets without blanket you cannot lie so we were reading gospel and Pingala gospel not that all the Swami's were being Holabird a new bengali language so during early one show me G was reading then one Ramachari he was going if the moment he heard about the Bengali language perhaps he had that idea and he stood over a Swami jee loke I look bangle alcohol and second question was a chap Bengali Swamiji muchly is of kathina and his voice was weed out microphone is it just like the huge AV boys without microphone and all this the hall like this was there a different show me's different groups they were sitting there very very traditional type and narrow segregated MA and they think if you take fish immediately you lose everything anyway I thought is impossible to tell him now that you cannot argue immediately this thing I told jaffna pucho sudoku which are gone chabad and and that I had stop him by that way what you are asking talking about all these things from among you are not supposed to this Coulomb taji jati cool oh man every time in the evening when you were praying the Swami Vivekananda composed taji jati cooler mon so thats is very important after reaching over here most of the people swami ji bengalis will come from a GF ingles Amagi like this so they think that as because i was born in some place I am going on having that no at all anyone good coming to see Ramakrishna accepting the fan the philosophy of Serrano Krishna Vivekananda my friend I don't want to know where from he is coming in which language is speaking what philosophy he followed nothing see now show me Vivek on the himself said whoever will serve my Master's cause that means the philosophy of see Ramakrishna I am the servant of his servant is not that he is giving the stress on his word and the servant of his servant not directly i am the servant of that particular person servant of dad he's solvent so humble because he's taking the philosophy of ceramic ISNA which can bring not only the peace but the progress with the human being so that is why this is Coulomb and Shalom is so modest that you don't like to speak out the truth sokarty is so gentle so modest even a person is going on criticizing and be ok ok ok ok like that no what is truth you have to tell the truth of course in a courteous way so this is the Sheila meeeeee if you are having that you can never be able to realize God the coulomb and Sheila meeeeee this is a story you know in the ceramic ishness one disciple he was the son of a landlord and that landlord was abduction Asia to that area is a very rich person his son used to come to see Ramakrishna afterwards he became the monk Shami yogananda and he was very modest courteous gentle and one day he was crossing the river in a boat and some people who are criticizing see Ramakrishna most of the ordinary people without understanding anything they like to criticize some good name big names if you turn to them and ask what you your contribution but you have done nothing zero but they are very vocal about others not there and when they were criticizing this man was sitting over there then afterwards when he reached he came to see Ramakrishna and he was telling sir you know those people who are talking very this way that way they have used this language that lean against you ceramic is not told what did you do and nothing worse what is it at least you could say the truth immediately he rectified corrected him at least you could tell the truth now it is not i am going to him i am all the time listening to him I stay within I know him very closely why should you talk like this but when I am quietly listening all the wrong conversation because I'm modest because I am Shila meeeeee am indirectly supporting that wrong thing that is why this rabindranath is also writing the if you are someone is doing something wrong and even knowing that if I am not telling anything that's also wrong so this is Sheila meeeeee Tata jati the race people are so proud about their race I belong to they said the whole Second World War millions of people who have killed because of only this new one knows jati and this dirty means we are aliens who your audience we are areas and there what is this idea where from you came and because of the the geographical way the place because of the environment because of the way there maybe somebody's scheme this fear somebody is brown somebody's black what is that external expression what is that main is the internal thought so that is called green ah laga diam shankha jus gupta chishti pan chama cha ET Punjabis of the five

attitudes ah de bunda nos the news and that is why we cannot see God the kundan of Havana then jogger bandhani Bundy to my the one who is worshipped by the whole world I am also joining with the others please remove all these eight bondages now then see Ramakrishna he is talking about then and he is telling one person one devotee he said sad please bless us sad please bless us very common very simple prayer please braces and master said God ease in all how his reply is coming from C Ramakrishna God is in all beings one must pray earnestly God is in all beings that's why the Hindus they worship Ganesha trust any puja Ganesha will be the first why because God is in all being ghana ghana means all Ayesha Ayesha means God that that God is in all beings why he is having the elephant face because the symbol of vastness big so that's why the elephant faith so many stories goes on and we are learning the stories only not understanding the philosophy why the God is of it if you go and tell why the God is having the elephant face your face will be immediately someone will come and give you cannot strong blow and you not only phase the head will go what's wrong so good Hindus are not so foolish for everything they have a philosophy and that abstract philosophy they like to put in a such a way so that all can understand God is in all beings Ghana Aisha that is why Ganesha one must pray honestly it is said that one can realize God by directing to him the combining the intensity of three attractions he is mentioning that what type of desire to realize God should be now he says the child attraction for the mother husband's attraction for the wife and the attraction of the worldly positions for the worldly man there are so many rich people at the other having so much of money but not give even a single further to anyone because they forget that they are temporary and the theme that they will continue all through and so many in our this life we come across so many people and there are some people very poor but they are so broad-minded it's okay for us the sum of the I was reading in the one of our magazine that one choix me was quoting that one lady when she came to know that there will be a temple she brought some 40 rupees or something the how come this 40 or 42 somebody will give 50 or 100 or 25 why the 42 then she told i am a bigger whatever I beg a little portion I came then I came to know that there will be a temple so I thought it's a good work I can never do any good work in my life why not give my this whatever I could accumulate this money for this purpose so that my earning will be utilized for a better cause look at this just that much in the Mahabharata alsa the badura was not a rich person whereas Duryodhana he was very rich a king but Krishna waiting to be do rose house because he was having the love and genuineness that is the main thing this from SC Ramakrishna stealing the three types of Attraction person having tremendous attraction for the money mais early person person totally devoted to the wife and a child constantly depending of the mother these three attraction if combined just fill that attraction if we can apply then God realization is possible there are certain signs by which you can know a true devotee of God hearing that so many people they will go to the temple all this that's okay but there are three signs by which you can understand with a good devotee what are the signs the ceramic reason is telling a real devotee develops the power of assimilating instruction is very important understanding assimilating instruction recently we heard in the newspaper and now the great news in the media I don't know in the newspaper they say in the media they say from a temple someone announced that it is the incident in u.p in India that and in the neighborhood someone has taken beef and beef eating is not permitted over there not knowing perfectly this man announced immediately devotees immediately all the devotees there I don't know whether we should call them devotees or demons but immediately they became activated they came out the such that person without testing on examining whether really it was there the beef or what they bade him and killed him is this devotee and the fellow who told over there we are putting on a garb of a maybe a religious person not only denounced the whole Hinduism but he is not a devotee he proved and these people after listening to death man immediately reacted they are also not devotee atleast ah they are good muscle men and they can kill people can fight with people that's ok but not devotee why they could not assimilate the instruction this very important someone told in the name of religion if you kill your master then you will go to heaven and that fellow went and killed we know that history someone told if you go and blast yourself kill yourself and as maximum people you know some people you can kill and that value is also going to do that now they are not devoting there will be something but not devoting the first thing a real devotee develops the power of assimilating instructions and so many ways even the Guru may say something you have to understand is it practically for me is it possible for me then only I will do it otherwise it is not possible sometimes some for in the name of religion the guru will say donate whatever you are having give everything in the name of God and that fellow in the name of God his thought the Guru has given the call and he gave everything then with the whole family there on the road no you have to assimilate donation good but I have to understand how much salam o Krishna he is asking a devotee I find that you are constantly with me are you married you have family or ESF go back look after them this is called the Guru so you have to understand and then assimilate second the first is the real devotee develops the power of a simile instruction second a true devotee develops the true devotion to God the true devotion means complete faith in God how now i will quote from bhakti rasam with and they're the go penis they say to krishna they were holding the hand of krishna and they were telling we won't let you go krishna the powerful person shook the hand and he was going away then the goofiness told custom wood chipper otto ç bala krishna keepeth bootham what is wonder you need your powerful person and you have taken out your hand custom with chipper you have snatched away your hand forcefully yah to see beloved ballot means forcefully you have taken away your hand from us yah to see going away ok this is nothing important Timoth butum then they said he died adi adi retired from our hearts yadi neri yah see if you can remove your thought from our hearts poor uzum ghana yamete then we will consider that you are a powerful man a powerful person you cannot remove we are going to pray we are going to meditate we are going to think and we are going to offer everything of our soul at your feet can you remove that is called love and love means develop true devotion to God devotion to God no true devotion devotion to some extent ok I am accepting liking but true devotion like this complete faith God must love me because I love and all through my life I'm going to love him so this is and third third is a true devotee as control his senses and subdued the last and this is very very important the devotee means control the senses and subdued the last and these are the three main thing that is where the ceramic is named so unique so those anywhere whether Hindu Muslim Sikh is it is nothing anyone anywhere in any religion if they really like to be a devotee devoted to God these are the three your stick they must follow the first is the power of assimilating the instructions the scripture they say something the Guru they say something expounded this is something but I should understand how far I can follow that in this time at this moment however I can do that and they should understand it properly in the bed on so they say and Shami Vivekananda is also telling in everything that is the same God when if you step true but shall I go and embrace a tiger as because the scriptures say God is manifesting in every being so obviously the tiger also is having the God within eight shall I go and embrace the tiger guru you told Scripture you told no this is very very wrong you have to assimilate this moment tiger doesn't understand that so I have to be very very practical secondly true devotion that means i love God and God has no power to go away from my heart so much confidence and thirdly control of the sins and what are the control of the senses and most of us first and foremost jealous so maybe we can decide jealousy is the bane of our society that means Indian community why so much of jealousy jealousy is they are present in every society because we was subdued by the foreign rulers for a long time and that is why the freedom that thought of freedom and leaving every life was not allowed almost for 800 years and that is the reason constantly whenever there was a little opportunity we wanted to grab that so in trying each and others here in America there are so many opportunities so no problem and when we find only one when people are all hungry if there is only one braid so obviously they will run after that and trying to know your the others in that race to get the bread because all of them are hungry and the supply is only very little when for each and every one there are sufficient same people will never behave like that so why he said this be our constantly we are criticizing others trying to belittle others trying to be more ahead of others why these is a new word they are coined rat race I don't know when the rat there is racing but in your rat race mostly they will be using in Indian language and newspapers actress writer is it maybe we can google search we're from the what came so this now this is we have to understand that these three things this is the wonderful way the ceramic ISNA is stalking her and then he is speaking about a different topic that we will discuss in our next class he is talking about the yoga and the bed anta and it there are different yoga hatha yoga and Raja yoga so we will discuss about that in our next class what is our to yoga what is Raja yoga what is Danna yoga what are the differences all these things we will try to understand let us offer our pranaam to Raghavan see Ramakrishna and we will conclude need Anjana medium Hunter
