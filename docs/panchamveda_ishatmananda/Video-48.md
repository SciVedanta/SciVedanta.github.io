[49. Panchama Veda 49:Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8Rhg3OTsd0)

let us begin as usually do tabaka Tom rhythm top 2g venom Kobe very rhythm Cal moshom shravana mangalam srimad athim boo begun on ta buried aa jaana aa and 22nd July we were reading Raghavan Sri Ramakrishna he is giving emphasis on the Holy Name of God this diksha this idea is very prominent in Tantra and there the in the Tantra they give lot of name of god and goddesses but the diksha in bed on thur it is only inspiration they will guide you they'll tell you the truth and then they will inspire you because you have to go on discriminating and you have to proceed in your spiritual path but the other one see Rama Krishna is telling the easiest way to take the name of God repeat the name of God again and again because that will help he is telling the name of God has very great sanctity asurane nami bari mahato Mahatma means is a just mystic thing mystical thing if you are going on repeating the name of God we you may not understand and in the beginning but slowly slowly whole mind will be purified just by taking the name of God and we were quoting from the Naga birth we were quoting from different scriptures the Vishnu Purana etc the last time we were showing quoting from the different scriptures how they are supporting this then he mentioned why there are different type of people because of the gunas there's a unique way they have discovered the quality of human being the meaner apparently they are all same qualities same looking but when you mix with them talk with them stay with them you can understand the differences you can understand the difference why because of the thinking capacity different people think in different way but why they think in different way there were two sons of it King and he said to both of them you have graduated from your gurus from that other school now only one thing I want to know from you here is a room fill it up and how he will fill it up that is up to you then that one boy he went and purchased lot of hail from all around the area and brought all those hey filled up the whole room with the head and he called his father look the room is full it's okay then he called second son but what you will do in the next room he went with his father and put her candle lit it up old room was filled with light room is full full it light and full it unnecessary a now you have to clean it up and all these things and have no use inside so the thinking capacity one servant one k man complained to his master said you were being this person who is constantly sitting over here and writing something so much of money so much of salary I am working so hard day and night i'm working but i am not earning much he said is it okay go over there i have come to know that ship has come go and inquire about the ship he went and said oh yes a ship has come and a very big ship so many people he said from which country it has come and what are the mark indices they have brought oh I didn't incur just a minute he ran again then he came after again they said it is coming from it early and it is full with glasses and all how much the cost of what total quantity of the class and in exchange of the glass what they are going to purchase what are the things they would be purchasing their the businessmen oh I didn't ask he ran again in a blow like these almost a whole day here and up and down to complete the whole information then the king said sit over here then acts that person who was sitting in the office there is a ship can you present where he went Kim within half an hour and all the information the name of the ship who is the captain what are the things they have brought at what rate they are going to sell it in exchange water things they'd like to purchase everything in one go then he said this is called with thee and for that only I p so the Buddha yogam de Gama ham baaga van sree krishna in bhagavad-gita is telling how can I bliss the devotee I do not go and fight with him I fight for him for the devotee I do not go and help I only give the perfect intelligence and this intelligence how it comes when a person have faith and believe when raghavan see Rama Krishna is telling that if you take the name of God then it is perfectly all right for you it is perfect for me you need not worry about that since he said I believe I take the name only thing I should not forget it go on repeating repeating repeating let us see but this type of temperament never comes why because of three gunas three qualities that makes people different sarthak Raja see and thomason raghavan see Rama Krishna is giving the all details about the Slovak rajasic and Thomas occur and this sorted Tamar is the worst because is the traits of a person in doda Tamas lethargy last anger egotism etc these are not good qualities for a human being but among the devotees of God also the same thing three different type of devotees are there and there is a temasek devotee but very peculiar liver especially Raghavan see Rama Krishna is appreciating the Thomas ignition devotee temasek devotee that Thomas it is only the that quality I should get I should achieve I should have that tremendous eagerness to grab when it is turned towards God that is good they were once Ramakrishna is telling even these three qualities among these three qualities when it devotees having a temasek bhakti he has burning faith burning faith jolanda vishwas burning faith Minette tremendous faith confidence that i am going to achieve it and faith is the root of all success particularly spiritual life if you go to any master he cannot show you God you cannot immediately give you all this realization of God he only says son believe it they are ah there is God and there are the paths to lead to God you follow according to your own choices you like to go according to the path of knowledge or the unselfish work or the bhakti or the meditation whatever you like but do it sincerely I am Telling You you will reach over there we have to have faith that is the faith I am only believing the words of that person my guru because I am not seeing touching feeling nothing is there then the master gave a very unique idea he said the quality of Thomas can be used for the welfare of others the welfare of others means Judy if tamago near more period allah is shallower tamago near more varied Allah if you turn that the tremendous faith tremendous desire to get to achieve to be successful towards God you are successful and some of the people most of the Indian film if you see there are some this type of people work tommo goonies there all the time cheating people grabbing the land torturing and just to get some name and fame in this world suppose that type of temperament the mentality if they turn towards god i must achieve god i must realize God I must get god I must reach over there the same mental attitude the strong attitude reaching over there only turning this I'm going to kill that person for sure i am going to torture him i am going to grab his land that same attitude turning towards god i am going to get god realize God reach to the God and He will attest saw me see ramakrishna is a great master and he is telling if you are having even this type of bad qualities utilize that turn it if you have seen the people who are sailing the boat they'll with tremendous weaned and it is dangerous for the boat but they utilize the way they'll be unfurled and they will use that the power of wind to go now even the modern the aircraft sometimes they know the air is flowing from chicago towards houston and like that right now the show me who came he rang me to tell that he has already reached over there you stun and he was telling though the flight was 15 minutes late but we reached five minutes earlier because Talia utilizing that year that utilizing the force which is dangerous but utilizing that similarly Tamil guna is dangerous but when you were utilizing it properly it moves toward the god then the master given eunuch that quality can be then he was giving the examples of the physicians and the three different types of religious teachers the inferior physician he only gives the medicine and never care about the whether the person has been cured or not he jump simply give the medicine and forget about the patient the mediocre also similarly have you taken you should take this will do you good that much but the third one he will go to his house also a are you taking it or not you have come to me to be cured and I have to see that you are Q and I will force you to do and Saddam occasion appreciating this type of doctors so this is the similar way the spiritual teachers also the inferior teacher only gives the instruction to the disciple go and repeat the name of God but then he forgets second type the mediocre makes the repeated effort to help the disciple and the third best teacher goes to the length of using force when he finds the student persistently on yielding so this is the way one has to show me Vivekananda when he started this organization before that among the Hindus monks there is no organization all individual the monks is to the person is to go to a guru get the instruction sannyasa he is to be there or may go out and practice is up to them but Shami become the seed no you have to be here and then what happened he told early morning at three-thirty there will be bill you have to get up get yourself ready four o clock there will be Mongol aarthi you have to attain that then there will be one in half an hour meditation you have to sit over there then only you have you can come back and take a cup of tea if you are not attending the temple hold a food you own gate from the Islamic you have to go out and be then some of his direct disciples his brothers they were objecting what is it you are giving the ring and then I have to get up then I have to meditate sometimes I am meditating in the dead night up two three four o'clock then I return and go to bay now because of your bill I have to get up again at three thirty and what is it I want all of this becomes as it is not for you it's for the young disciples who are coming they must do it and the hunger is such a thing that you will force him to do it you must have to do the wife of caitanya mahaprabhu vishnu priya her name was vishnu priya she used to go on counting the name of God and to keep 111 rice separately as many names used to take so many Rises and that much arise she could cook and eat hurt sir and then vishnu priya knew that because of the hunger physical and i need to eat more little more he'll be going on taking that name of God more so that the number of the rise will be more the food will be little more so physically and that hunger will be satisfied so this way also that is called a practicing austerity then some people they will practice austerity in the way then when it is full moon they will take the full plate full food next little less little less little as little as that will go on like this and in the AMA vasa the dark knight no food at all then they will go on increasing a little and little and little like that in the poornima again full plate so the whole month goes like this and they will go on increasing their chopper accordingly that is also different way people they are using it because best teacher raghavan see Ramakrishna he told the master Marcia who was a that time he was am aiming you graduated from the University and he told you should not argue about God whatever I say you must follow but about Narendra not afterwards swami vivekananda he told you must go on arguing for everything and he used to ask him to argue in english those ramakrishna was not understanding english that way but he told know that is that that doesn't matter speak in English because new he has to come to America to Europe and that language will be useful so that way a different way forcing them to practice so this is the best teacher goes to the length of using force when he finds a student persistently on ilding normally Tomas are all bad qualities but if you are using it properly it helps then you heard him saying to answer the question of the Brahma devotees he was telling this that has got form or has in non so this question many people this to ask salam o Krishna and he used to reply even the great Swami Vivekananda when he was young he had a doubt and he never believed that God can have forms and he never went to the Kali temple where salam o Krishna stayed he never visited kali temple never paid his prana offering his respect to that goddess salam krishna didn't say anything but he was going on telling indirectly the god can be informed and without form because of the influence of the Brahmo Samaj we almost all of us we know that was a social movement social spiritual movement to protect the hindus because the Hindus were confused whether we have gods and goddesses so many 30 million gods and goddesses is it possible how God can be in so many different forms when God is all pervading how God gain can be in a form in a Murthy in an idol it was a confusing so but tadano kishna answered very nicely he said no one can say with finality that God is this and nothing else how can you say that God is only this much and it God cannot be that who are you to say that the moment you say it is blasphemous against God God can be these guard may be anywhere in every form it doesn't matter for God because he is all-powerful in the taittiriya upanishad also it is said but here we find if one analyzes oneself one does not find any such thing as I I i we are going on telling but bhagawan sri ramakrishna stealing suppose you analyze do you see can you find out who you are no then he is giving an example take an onion for instance first of all you peel off the red outer skin then you find thick white skins peel these off one after another and you won't find anything inside how nicely he is giving the example when you are going to Know Who am I we don't find anything I might the mind I might a physical body I might a name I might the form Who am I the doctors didn't know what is there inside the body how many veins what at the blood and the bones and marrow and so many things are there but where is I without the I this body of his no use with all the bone and marrow and blood and the heart and everything if that I is not there it is dead and if you try to find the I anywhere no we're only for the medical doctors modern medical doctors if the heart is beating I is there and if the heart is not they're not beating eyes not there so where is the eye you cannot find it but I is the anything in the whole personality I is the main so here he show me to see Ramakrishna is telling in that state a man no longer find the existence of ego aha I everywhere everything is I there's a ego now when we are discriminating we do not find the ego and who is there left to seek it who can describe how he feels in that state in his own pure consciousness about the real nature of Brahman then again that is the speciality of ceramic ish nahin will tell something and immediately give an example so that people can understand he said once assault doll a doll made of solid went to measure the depth of the ocean no sooner was it in the water then it melted now who was to tell the depth and through this example he is telling we are from the consciousness all everything is that we see is nothing but the consciousness and when we reach back to the consciousness was what happened we are melted as eve and who will come back to tell about that depth about that consciousness as the doll salt doll who was made of the salt of that ocean went inside the water to measure meant it it never came back excellent way he is mentioning some of the people will be arguing why you cannot explain about God this is the reason because we cannot because we are mixed with that who will come back there is no sign of perfect knowledge I'm sorry there is a sign of perfect knowledge man becomes silent when it is attained then the eye which may be linked to the sword all melts in the ocean of existence knowledge please absolute and becomes one with it not the slightest trace of not the slightest trace of distinction is left so what happens when you realize God we become God and he mixed with that consciousness those who are striving and the path of knowledge what happens to them they melt in that consciousness they become conscious total absolute one drop of water it was falling from the sky and it was shouting oh I am going to lose my personality and then when it fell in the ocean what it became ocean itself that drop of water became the ocean similarly the eye that we all his thing when we go to that state we mixed with that as long as his self analysis is not complete man argued argues with much ado but he becomes silent too when he completes it when the empty pitcher has been filled with water when the water inside the picture becomes one with the water of the lake outside no more sound is hard sound comes from the pitcher as long as the pitcher is not filled with water how he is trying to explain when there's an empty picture we are going trying to take the water from the ocean or from the river or from the pawn there is a sound what it is going in but when the pitcher is full and it is one with the external water there is no sound at all that similarly when a person is trying to realize God he is going on arguing whether the God has a form or without form whether the God can be realized through the bhakti of devotion or through gaana or through karma or through meditation there are so many paths are there and each one is claiming mine is the best but when one realizes the true God he sees that this everything is nothing but the God all are leading to the same goal one lady has send an email giving how in different religion in the same religion one God one holy book one religion but they are fighting among themselves and there are so many varieties why because of this some people will be only describing in such a way then as if that is the only thing that you have to practice it's nothing like that according to the temperament if I feel that that is the temperament that my temperament is this I should go accordingly and this is what vagabond see Rama Krishna is telling all trouble and bother a shin come to an end when I dies the why we are fighting so many meetings will be there all over the world and they are all meeting the political meetings at their religious meeting meetings at their the religious teachers are appealing to the people have peace peace and peace but who he is going to keep the peace because I is so big we are not going to the route we are only apparently telling if you are not keeping the peace rain we will impose all these things on you there will be no business with your country there will be no connection with your country all these things we are going to impose on you but it goes on and if you go and tell people see you are from the same clan you are born and brought up in the same area why you are fighting they won't listen and when there is no external enemy then they will fight among themselves we are seeing it happening in every country so many places why because the root is I that ego those people are fighting whose picture we see in the newspapers and the TV they're only external they are nobody the leaders sitting somewhere you cannot see them and when everything is successful after 1 million people died and he becomes the prime minister of the president of that country then only you can see the person full of ego and because of that I because of that ego so many he sacrificed so many people died and how to eradicate these ceramic isness telling only ego only ego can help if we can eradicate we have to reach to that point ego I concha where am I if you analyze we can understand we are nobody how can we say that i i i i am doing this i am doing that i can do this so this is the point we have to understand if we have to keep peace and harmony among different type of people all travel and botheration come to an end when the I dies you may indulge in thousands of reasoning but still the eye does not disappear for people like you and me it is good to have the feeling I am a lover of God now he is giving a different idea a very good idea this is a spiritual for the spiritual development and he is telling if you think that God is one he is formless i am going to realize God and as because I have understood God in this form this way this method everyone should follow me all other ideologies are bad and wrong I had to fight with that ideologies that is wrong you have to realize God fast have you realized i think i told you that young lady in Andaman when I was there the young girl she came she was coming from a religious organization after praying and she thought I was sitting over there in Andaman we had to open coat here she and I mean anthem on population is very less is difficult to find people so poor lady she found only me she found that she came to tell me about her own faith you read this book and why you will get peace I am already in peace so why should I have to read this book and making jokes with that then he said if you read this book and practice the instructions he will go to heaven at what are you practicing have you read these books yes are you practicing yes have you visited heaven no but i hope i will go and say you are trying to reach heaven i am also trying to reach heaven in my own way let both of us go and let us see who is the fast if I reach over there are you wait to welcome you if you are there fast you would you be there to welcome me but let me go in my own way then she understood so that is what the teaching of agawam see ramakrishna the moment i think i am trying to realize God in this way at this is the perfect path because I have Susan problem is not at the god problem is not with the religion of the philosophy problem is with I I have chosen this part and this is the best part everyone should follow these or otherwise they're all fools this is the peculiar notion is creating all problem raghavan see ramakrishna is telling over here talking with the brahma devotees and he's telling them that you are trying to follow the path of knowledge do you think it is so easy the saguna brahman here when they were talking with this the perfect knowledge makes one silent and we find in the t3 upanishad and master mihashi who has noted all the conversation of a gwan see Rama Krishna is mentioning that from the taittiriya upanishad ya towbar churna bertante appropriate Manas aha as if the word the bacha the word the expression the speech along with the mind traveled to reach that Brahman the souls and after reaching over there it became dumbfounded it could not express anything and the mind also could not grab anything could not conceive anything it's so fast and so big sometimes when you go and see an unique the vastness in the ocean or the beauty of the nature we are dumbfounded we try to click our cameras to grab that only a little portion of it but the huge that those things the beauties unthinkable you cannot express it long long back when I was very young I went to a top of a hill to see the sunrise on Mount Everest even today I wonder how beautiful that was and the Mount Everest when you see the Sun is rising it you can't see the Sun but the light is only deflecting over there and millions and millions of clouds small small clouds the reflected that light as if the millions of birds of different color flying and then they're slowly slowly that light is coming on the snow peak of the Himalaya there's a small place and it is shadowed and light in such such a way as if a golden seat is over there how can I describe unless and until you go and see is impossible to describe even the camera the view also own be able to so that is called self-realization and similarly when one reaches over there before the god gum found it it cannot express only it should say so hum soham so hum so I'm and nothing else I am Here I am Here I am me because he sees that great reflection within his own heart that that is the reason it says yet obaachan Ebert contain the words along with the mind turn back come back mind and speech cannot act over there our mind can conceive only those things which we can understand within the time frame and there is a cause of it then only we can understand when there is no cause there is no time and there is no space how can you conceive that idea no you cannot and sometimes some people who wants to meditate on the eternal what is eternal is the only the word that you are telling can you understand it can you conceive it all pervading is a beautiful word but when you meditating can you really conceive that idea all-pervading what is all only from your rooftop whatever the sky you can see that is all we do not understand what is all all-pervading God means what unthinkable we cannot think of even the universe that we see is only the galaxies in the Sun there are so many other glad galaxy is also there can you concept that idea when in the physical world we cannot concept that idea how we can think of the spiritual all-pervading God we cannot it's an All Merciful what do you mean by mercy I do go on doing mystics and miss chips and wrongs and I am NOT getting punished Oh all-merciful God is it it's not like that the mercy means what all wat SI means it is total love and what is that love a pure love and that love always keeps an eye on you and sometime it is behaving in a cruel way punishing you because it loves you the mother will look at a child drowning at the child to stop that because she loves the child other ladies they will only take that that final sweet boy breaking the so many things good go on breaking unless and until you are breaking your own thing we have no problem too sweet boy go on breaking but the mother knows that I have to stop the child behaving like him peculiarly she will go sometimes she'll be scolding sometimes of stock and in this Europe and America they don't beat the children but they will keep in the corner they will put the child in the corner in one room go and sit over there that is the punishment so this way in our country this is not nothing that because no corner there's no time so giving a nice beating in andaman we had 50 boys now orphan boys they were very very naughty unthinkable naughty so just to punish them I never use those but different type of canes I kept only to show what you have done you have done this so this type of cain will be used for you so if you are doing little more so this cane this can there was a big bumbo and the ultimate thing is this bummer i'll meet you but their children i never use those things like one german young girl she visited tourist she went over there and she was incredible those games so how do you use these games then just jokingly I don't know what you are doing at this game I told lady you won't understand if I explain but I can show you in practice the shipment my god I cannot think of it and all that so they're making fun so you have two different way you have to control because you loved one little boy came his mother left him over there and he started crying though he was a small one but his voice was so still it was impossible to sleep day and night she was going on crying tremendous energy to cry making us mad and what to do then one day suddenly the first day second day third divorce uh delete occurred to me she will only stop he is the only stopping when he's taking food you idiot laughter would start the crime it was going on for two days third day I found out there's a okay then all the boys came back from the school he was not going to school at all he was going on sitting over there and crime so in the wall boys came I told hey there is a beautiful thing that you listen today and in melodious voice he can cry that he will show you today in a circle you stand and he will cry and I put him in the center I told now you cry you could not she stopped crying and all boys they were hungry because they have returned back from the school they were they start crying will not and he was doing from that day onwards you stopped crying so you have to take a lot different type of a measure to stop these things and when you are handling the children you should have lot of patience so this way it goes on and on and where bhagavan sri ramakrishna is telling when you are trying to reach God you should have a lot of patience and along with the patient's love you should have patience because you know that you have to eat adequate you have to wipe off you have to throw all those things that you have collected all through your life so many lives we have lived in the past we do not know it is not only this life it's not only the impression that we are accumulating in this slide in past lives also so much of ego accumulation and slowly slowly we have to eradicate those things then only the pure mind will come there is a beautiful belgium glass mirror but 400 years dirt it covered it you cannot look at that no reflection and to find that glass the reflection of the mirror you have to go on robbing it washing it cleaning it then one day suddenly will find that original similarly our mind it is ready to be reflected with that God and that moment it will be reflected we know that we are nothing but the same that God now when we say the be daunting they say I am God myself the other will say it is hypocrisy it is blasphemy how can you say that you are God you are making mistakes you are telling lies your life is so short how can you be God is all-pervading eternal and then we say unless and until you realize you want this physical body it has limit but the cell eternal self totally pure self all pervading self all-powerful Xiaomi vivekananda rainy came in contact with their self the Hartman the Brahman then he said I can make all people the millions and thousands of people that can change their mind at the moment in this moment but I won't do that tremendous power comes raghavan serum Krishna is doing to house to house meeting with the people this is what not he just like ordinary person and some people ignoring him some people criticizing him some people challenging him his patient but constantly going and asking them why don't you discuss about God you were discussing about so many other things why not discuss about God why not talk about God why not take the name of God so this way he is telling all trouble trouble and moderation come to an end when the I dies you may indulge in thousands of reasoning but still the eye does not disappear for the people like you and me now he is telling people like you and me he is also giving the same level it is good to have the feeling I am a lover of God I love God so this is the easiest way to realize God the Shah guna brahma is made for the doctors now he goes into a little philosophy Saguna brahma near guna brahma brahman means all-pervading consciousness now it has two different shapes one is saw guna saw guna guna means qualities saw means width when with qualities saw guna brahma then it takes the form then we can worship then you can put the girl and then we can cook food for that God and we can cry we can pray we can fight we can have every relation with that God riscal Saguna saw means with guna means qualities what are the qualities sattva Raja come on all these qualities everything is there in that in other words a bhakta believes that God has attributes and reveals himself to mean as a person assuming forms meda by a little girl of 6 years when she was observing a procession that was passing through her house and she was thinking why these people are singing and dancing so much a music so much of decoration father his father the King said oh they are going to marry there's a marriage party then she said I'll also marry because of the fun of it the dance and decorations and then she was going on pestering the father and father said okay now this is your husband Krishna in the house there was a krishnamoorthy was their image she was there it now this is your husband little girl couldn't understand what his husband she started thinking as all the children they'll be playing with the dolls she started playing with Krishna and what I have to do for the husband then all elderly people jokingly said you have to wash the faith you have to decorate you have to prepare food you have to talk with your husband you have to take all care and she went on doing like that and slowly slowly slowly slowly her God became Krishna person and the other person who is worshipping something else oh why krishna is of no value because for heart god has taken the shape of krishna so this is an Amana it is ramachandra shreenath hey John Oakey naughty a breather for a mark money I know with the serene author and Janaki not Janaki means the schita Sita's husband Rama and three means Lakshmi Lakshmi is husband is Krishna the three naughty that means Krishna John Oakey naughty that means Rama I know aveda they are all same both are same bonamana he is telling I know both are same bad i love rama i went to see Rama's picture shreenath hey janicki

begins very difficult nowadays it has become more difficult that place the gang go three we're from the Ganga begins is a huge place here just before that I think 11 kilometer before that particular spot there's an ass Rama the lull baba the said one shadow he is only services to give hot tea to all the people who are coming to that place and in the night hot kitchari the rice and dal and all that debris and if you are not taking that kitchari you won't get the blankets the he won't give the blankets to sleep and so cold so naturally you have to wait for the boga and hoga for Rama and see Rama and that man was very peculiar that we met him he was having only nothing in the body only in his feet he was wearing red color shocks that's lall Baba lull means rate he is to wear only red sox that's why people is to call him loll baba Baba means the father now this larvae were told that you have to attain the prayer also we attended prayer it was so cold outside before the temple we had to wait and the cold wind and I was thinking my god when they are complete this aarthi you're going on or at the diorama joyeux merry way they completed quickly I was praying to Rama to completed as

this is the beauty of the Sanatana Dharma any God you like whichever no problem Allah Jesus raghavan Buddha or the Hindu Pantheon Saul gods and goddesses no problem only say I love that God and love should be changing in and he was really jun ying for the saguna brahman is made for the bhaktas in other words a bhakta believes that God has attributes and revealed himself to mean as a person as you mean forms it is he who listened to our prayers the prayers that you are too directed to him alone you are Baptists not Johnny's or with artists gannys or Vedanta's they're totally different type I was telling you about the schwa me the direct disciple of swami vivekananda he was avedon test he used to think that God is all-pervading in the ramakrishna mission in a duet aslam he was the first
