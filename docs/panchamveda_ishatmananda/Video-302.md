[303. Panchama Veda (303) - “I Gave My Word.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CZo0YDb4p4)

dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening we will be reading from the gospel of krishna the panchama veda and we will discuss on what bhagavan si rama krishna teaches let us begin with the stortra that we usually do tabukathamritam [Music] is giving the the report that happened april 6 1885. he has given the date that recorded that particular date that was april 6 1885. he is mentioning sri ramakrishna sat in the drawing room it is 736th page of the the english translation by she and in the publication bengali publication the original kathamrita there is another uh the description that is there description by the master masha himself i don't think that the xiaomi translated that particular portion is the one page that he's expressing how things happened etc now we are reading from this page 736 april 6 1885 sri ramakrishna sat in the drawing room of balarama's house talking to him now this this particular place where suramar krishna is to go and seat and take rest that has become a shrine and the name of the building has become balarama it is in bhagavajar in the north calcutta is a very famous place it was a very hot day and long past three o'clock he had come to calcutta to see some of his young disciples and also to visit devendra's house they went there another devotee master to aim i gave my word now this is a very important stent statement we can say a sentence and advice i gave my word the suramar krishna it was a very hot day he could say i won't go because coming from dakshinesha and either crossing by boat with the ganga or taking a carriage and coming all the way is a really long journey so suramar krishna could say no but he said no i gave the word he begins i gave my word that i would be here at three o'clock so i have come but it is very hot friends i gave my word i feel that is the religion the religion is keeping the promise if anyone a human being giving a promise that should be kept and that is religion in the name of religion we do so many things but we forget what we should practice this is bhagavan's rama krishna and in his life in some other places also we have seen that he said to a neighbor that i will come to your home today but he forgot and the neighbor also didn't remind it to him and when he was going to bait suddenly he remembered i gave the word that i should go but i didn't go at that time he took a lantern because the road was dirk and those who have visited the dakshinesha you must have seen from there from sirama krishna's room coming out the main gate and then going to the neighbor's house it's a long walk but he in that dark night he went alone with a lantern and by that time those people they have closed their door and they're sleeping he placed his holy feet on that and said oh i came by that we also used to keep his word why keeping the world keeping the promises religion so we know in the kathopanishad also there the nachiketa that young boy when he saw that his father is not keeping the words his father promised that he will give all his wealth to the brahmins to the rishis to the holy people but instead he was giving only the old the the cows to the uh in in as gift but the good cows he was hiding and other wealth also he was hiding though he declared sarvadhana that he will be giving everything all the properties to save the father for commit as because that was a scene to save the fro father from that the son went to his father and instead of giving him advice father this is not good you should keep your word because the son is not supposed to say like that to his father he said father i too as a son is your wealth to whom you are going to give me that's a beautiful way the picture when we read that we can visualize that picture the father naturally so many people have come he's busy he's going and talking to the people and handing over the cows to them and about the cows the rishi in the the upanishad they are giving the description that they have that are not going to give the milk anymore the what that those people are going to do with those cows they will have to only feed and look after the cows but not getting the milk so nirindriya they are not going to give birth to the calf and all this this boy is going on asking the father the father uh whom you are going to give me then diethyam treat him again and again when he was pestering when he was asking the father perhaps you can visualize with the father being angry the father said let you go to the abode of death then that swami vivekananda he is mentioning at that moment that boy he is thinking i am not the worst why the father asking me to go to the abode of death bhunami is not boasting he is not showing that he is proud but he is saying that i am among many i am the first of course among many others i am the second but neighbor the worst by the father so this is the self-confidence then at that time again we find that his father is saying that it is not necessary you should not go i was angry so i said like that then the nochiketa is coating like this and he's telling ya so this like uh the blade of grass like those things again and again taking birth and then dying and again growing is that the life look at your ancestors they never broke their promises now if you start doing like this then your next generations they will also follow you then where will be the human qualities once you say you must keep the word according to swami vivekananda he is to say marath that means the those the people the the human being giving the world means if they must keep that like once the tusks come out of the elephant it never goes back that he is the human being who can keep his promise promise keeping the promises religion and again we find in the ramayana also we find that thing in the ramayana also we find in the itihasha ramayana there also he find when the father the he he was naturally overhanded hearing that the son he has to keep the promise because he gave the word to his wife and now the wife is asking the ram should be banished you know the story so then the father he was not ready to keep his words then the son that's the sri ramachandra he was hardly 16 years or 17 years by that time and he is telling his father so this is the tradition of the rogue dynasty that when we give the word when we promise we must keep the promise we never break it for that if we have to die then we'll die that is also welcome but we'll never keep or break the will never break the promises we have to keep the promises even if we die bachana that we cannot break it so that is the tradition that is called the culture that is called religion so this sometimes we are confused what is religion we only the external thing that we do we go to the temple we offer some something to the temple and we think that is religion maybe sometimes we are fasting sometimes we are giving in charity of course those are good things that boost up our morality and broaden our mind our thought that's good but the main thing keeping the promises and in ramayana again we find that when the ramachandra in the balmiki ramayana the translation of the valmiki ramayana done by one mr sein the there i i was reading the when the ramachandra he went into the jungle and he made the saravangarishi the sarabhanga he talked with rama and then afterwards he went he left the body and went into brahmaluka he was a very pious type of person then the other the the rishis who were around like the bala killer boy khanna sir then supra kala patra hara they're all famous rishis they came to meet the rama over there in the the hermitage of saravanga when they are discussing with the sri rama they were telling orama you were aware that if the king who receives one-sixth of the people's income as tax does not protect his subject he incurs great scene the raja dharma they should the raja the administrator who has taken the responsibility the he should perform his own duty you need not to do anything else so that is called keeping the promise when a person is accepting that office and he is taking the oath and now it is in the modern society and the mostly democratic countries there is no king of course but they become president of the prime minister the administrative hate they take the oath oath taking the promise keeping the hand touching their holy book the constitution of the country and they are taking oh that i am going to give the best service to the people what is that protecting their interest protecting their life giving the all best thing to them and if he is breaking that and how he is doing that he is charging the taxes the people earning going to him even after that if he is not doing keeping his promises then he is committing sin and there in that conversation this rishi is told the king need not to do any extra separate spiritual practices if he is simply doing his swadharma the responsibility that he is supposed to do then what will happen then he said they are telling that he will get one-fourth of all the holy people's spiritual practices the benefit of that and he will go after death to brahmaloka the last and the highest the sphere this is swadharma and about the sadharma we find in the purana alsa the king harishchanra when he said that i will give everything to the guru and the guru said you must do this you must do that once he had to burn the dead bodies and in exchange he had to take some money then it so happened that one day he found that his queen who became really very poor and she was working under some brahmin her son died the king's son arishandra's son very pathetic and the queen richandra could recognize her that my wife and he could recognize his only son but even then he was telling i'm sorry my lady i cannot allow you to burn this dead body of your son unless you pay something because that is the charges i have to keep my promise i am here to collect those churches and allow the people to burn their dates i must have to church you too so that is these are the stories that teaches how to keep the promises even in the challenging moments also people should have to keep their promises and that is religion friends we eat all the time we criticize religion oh religion is these religion is ruining the country religion because of the religion that all these bloodsheds that's true misuse of religion misinterpretation of religion but religion as such should not be blamed is an unique conception to going back to the root to the the god or the brahman as the hindus they say vidantin we have to go back to the root why because otherwise we will never get the complete satisfaction the complete satisfaction is possible only after that that today we have already you know that every three months we are publishing one easing magazine that's called chicago calling and that chicago calling this this uh time i have written that how to be happy because this is a old year is going and the new year is coming so this is the juncture so this is the time that we should have to have uh as happiness we are all exchanging so i have a written an editorial how to be happy all of us should be happy and there there are so many types of happinesses are there four types of happinesses but last is the permanent happiness and that is the source of the creation so how it is possible by purifying the mind so this is the if you go through that you will find that so keeping the promise is the religion and another king the shebi the shebi that's a beautiful story naturally the king is supposed to give the protection and he told that even if i die i will give the protection whoever will come to my uh to me to for the protection then the bird came to the la the king shebi and he told see there's a falcon chasing me he wants to kill me the she be told no i will give you the protection since you have come to me it is a and take you taken the refuge i will give you the protection the falcon came and told king so that is my food you have to give me some meat the uh that she be told the king told okay i have other meats i will give you two no no no in exchange of that bird if you like to give save that bird then i want your flesh you have to cut it from your own body and just weigh that bird and then whatever that weighing your flesh should be given at the same balance the sheepy thought the small little bird is no problem then the weighing machine and the one side the little bird sat and the sheepy was cutting from his own thigh and from the hand he was putting his own flesh but lo the bird was going on the increasing its weight the little bird becoming so heavy she understood the lord the king understood that there is something very special in that bird but still he knew that he is going to die because so much of flesh and blood was flowing he himself was cutting so that is the story then ultimately the falcon it took the form of the dharma and that little bird was the indra so they had a challenge between them the king shebi is a righteous person he will never break his promise so just to test him they they were taking the form of a bird and the falcon so these are the wonderful stories of our puranas only to teach religion religions to keep the promises those who are the water or those things the swa dharma means the responsibility that we accept after the taking the oath the promises we being the monks we have taken oath and that because of that oath we are we're supposed to keep those promises we cannot do this thing or that thing because we have taken the oath as a sannyasi some other that is the ultimate not harming others that is the thing that the sannyashi should do so these are the things as a grassy as a householder you have also taken the promises and also some professionals you have taken the promises keeping the promises is religion and sudama krishna in a very simple word he said i gave my word this is so important see that's why i always say this is panchama veda almost in every line we will find how the lord suramar krishna bhagavan's ramakrishna is teaching us a religion then he said i'd be here at three o'clock so i have come but it is very hard yes sir you must have suffered very much the devotees were fanning sirama krishna master i have come here for baburama and the younger noreen why am i brought pune so he is asking the master mahashaya purna was a student of the master mashay the cerama krishnas to love that boy because they are all very guileless simple so naturally the god himself the surama krishna is nothing but god he used to like them why because pure mind and what is pure mind he himself will say so he has come only to meet baburam can you imagine baburama afterwards he became a sannyasi and of the ramakrishna mission our famous swami premananda ji maharaj so when we address a swami we always respected swami the senior respected do we say revere or the srimad-swami like that swamiji and the g in hindi is a respect that is given to the person at least srimat swami or river swami like that this swami srimat swami premananda ji maharaj he was the direct disciple of sri ramakrishna and he was the first manager of the ramakrishna mission headquarters bellurmart he was a very pure soul suramar krishna used to love him so much so he has come only to see that boy the god is coming to see the devotee so that prima and then young naren the master mashay is giving why he has not brought purna he doesn't like to come to a gathering of people he is afraid you might praise him before others and his relatives my might then hear about it was very fond of another young boy and he used to praise about the look at this boy he's so good so good and that boy was afraid that it may be his relative means that his father or the uncle and they'll be very angry they never want that the boy should go and mix with these holy people because he may become a monk you know this is very very special i should say that our devotees our people they're so devoted and they're also they believe in the existence of god and they have respect for the monks but at the same time they won't allow their children to become monks or nuns they will take them to take the blessings of the monks but when you say why don't you allow your son to become a monk or your daughter to become a nun they'll say no that it should not be why because to hold that is the householders mentality means holding so we here also in the if you go to any uh the order of the monks you will find they also have the property they have the money they have the cars they have their rooms their dresses everything just anyone is having what is the difference difference is true monk is not having any attachment to those things whenever he has been asked to go somewhere else he will only pick up his own personal few books and if one or two clothings and then he will leave without caring for the property who is looking after next and whether he is a good person or not whether he will be able person or not it doesn't matter at all so that when one is not having the attachment for the things that he is with it's called the monastic mentality and those who are holding whatever the little thing that they are having though this mind i cannot share so that is called the householders mentality so obviously the son and the daughter is so close to the naturally to the parents they don't like to share but they have the respect for the monks so somebody's sons may become monk then they will go and they will touch the feet and they'll ask for the blessings it goes on like that but those who are having the like the baburam who afterwards became swami premananda his mother of course gave that son to sirama krishnam krishna wanted if you at this she wanted to give some gift to suramar krishna and suramar krishna told if you like to give me the gift why don't you give your son to me the mother accepted that of course the son was also was very much akin to this monastic life so he became the monk the sudama krishna is told yeah yeah that's true i won't do it in the future well i understand that you are giving purna religious instruction that is fine master masha was a very humble person naturally he immediately said as a matter of fact the same thing is written in one of the textbooks of the school it says with all thy soul love god above and as thyself thy neighbor love so that is the in as the jesus we find in the bible love thy neighbor as they self etc so that type of moral books were there in those days they used to teach in the school and it is very very essential the sometimes some of the some administrations they think it is not necessary the students only should learn uh some of the science and the technology the language history geography that is sufficient no moral things are necessary no religious teachings are necessary the moment we talk about the religious teaching we think that as a dogmas there is nothing like that there's a high moral values that in the beginning long back in the brahmacharyans in this those schools of the rishis and the munis this to learn satyam bada like these they used to learn you must tell the truth never say lies then you should not give up your study apramada you should not give up your study you must continue the study go on learning learning and learning that is the human life then matri devo bhabha pitri devo so these are the ways when the human children are growing up they'll learn this thing and you may say oh no brainwashing they should get their own what the other thoughts will come from they will learn they will learn from the society and if the society is teaching them be selfish only you leave yourself for that if you have to cut the truth of others do that they will learn like that and then you will go on crying oh what has happened to the society there is no one no good people no good thought because these are the things are very important what type of teachings we are giving when they are children so by that time they are learning and what they're learning i must respect my parents my teacher who is teaching me and the people around me who are helping me even the poor person and he is there i should have compassion for these the way the human society grow and that is called culture this the wonderful culture that we find over here also they always teach to help others particularly they are so compassionate for the animals and and then for the poor the now this is the christmas time we find that some people they are leaving so many different foods and other things just at our gate because we are church so obviously people are thinking after collecting that we will give it to the poor people they themselves cannot go so they are leaving that people sending donation so this is the way all the time the human society helping each other they grow so unless and until the basic things are there why we talk about religion religion is the last condition that is the ultimate maturity in a human soul that is that is called religion religion is nothing but love and unselfishness religion none is nothing but keeping the promises then whatever the promises i have taken for the betterment of the others i must keep so these we are see only half a page we are reading from the gospel of krishna and we are finding so many wonderful teachings from that the master masha is telling if their guardians are displeased with such teachings it cannot be helped the purna is a student so he used to learn from the srima so shrimah told not that i am teaching it is in their the study so all obviously they must have to learn this if the guardians are not liking even this i can't help then sirama krishna is commenting no doubt many things like that are written in those books but the authors themselves do not assimilate what they write friends this is also very important for the religion we go on reading so many books for different books and many people nowadays publishing books they are educated people they have the command over the language and they have learned and after the retirement all through they were something else and some other profession and suddenly after the retirement they write like write a commentary on bhagavad-gita and then publish it and then force people to read that it's good nothing wrong they are utilizing their time for a good thing but at the same time have they followed that themselves otherwise it may be a very good reading but you know those words that we are reading from a book the typed words if the person who has written has not practiced will not help you that is really really particularly spiritual life only those books only those teachings we should read from those books which those people have already realized then it is that's why the bhagavan ramakrishna's gospel is so important whatever he said he realized those things sudama krishna is mentioning no doubt many things like that are written in those books spiritual book of course the science book technology medicine it's okay but spiritual book means you have to realize that first but the authors themselves do not assimilate what they write this power of assimilation comes from associating with the holy men people listen to instructions only when it is given by a sadhu who has truly renounced the world they are not much impressed by the writings or the words of a mere scholar the scholars they write they give the talk but some people are very fascinated to go and listen to them and they are not interested to go to the monks there are those who are really really living their life maybe they are not very good speakers maybe they cannot speak in that fashion that way that impressive way the other speakers are doing it doesn't matter at all so we have seen swami gambhira nandaji then not that he was the great the speaker a orator but when used to speak those who are truly they wanted to listen the spiritual talk that was so wonderful and swami the bireswara nanda i am telling these names those who are associated with the ramakrishna organization you know they were all great the precedence of the order and we have seen them how simple they were not great orators and they used to tell in a simple very simple way mostly quoting from bhagavan sidha krishna masharada swamiji upanishad and vedanta but their words is to touch the heart so that we one has to read and listen to them so that is the way only we can develop our spiritual life again i am telling is not about the other subjects but only spiritual life only spiritual people those who have truly followed those instructions in their life why because it is so difficult to practice other things are very easy a doctor a scientist a technician or an administrator they they know their their subject an accountant a lawyer they know their subject very well but not that they have to control their mind from the attractions of the saints objects no but the spiritual life it doesn't matter whether you have started in this university or that universe it doesn't matter at all whether you are having so many uh the the certificates no it's not matter at all have you practiced those things and what is that could you control your passion could you control your mind could you withdraw your mind from the saints objects those are the qualities of a spiritual person so this is the way we have to understand and sirama krishna is giving us that the directions and he is telling only when it gives by a sadhu sadhu means those who have purified their mind and what is mind mind are the impressions that we collect through five organs our eyes our nose our ears and they go out and collect different things and put it in the mind and impression is there so by that mind is constantly going on the waves after waves when you control that mind or transform that mind as a yogi they control as a gyani they transform so that is the way you have to purify the mind the shankaracharya is giving great stress on the purification of the mind it must then the yoga bashist the guru bashist he's using very strong words you have to kill the mind the mind means those thoughts thoughts of the worldly things associated with the world and then only you are pure so god and the world thoughts of the world impure and when you can turn the mind towards god pure but that turning that process is so difficult and when a person is giving advices on that and not practicing himself it is of no use those words his words will not carry any word me wait the he who has truly renounced the world they are not much impressed with the scholar and then suramar krishna as is his own he is giving an example suppose a physician has a big jar of molasses by his side and he asked his patient not to eat molasses the patient won't pay much attention to his advice the practice before advice that this is the base word of the spiritual life the spiritual teachers must practice themselves first and then they should advise but majority of the people are so eager to advise that there's a sometimes you know when the young people are coming to become monastic then there's a story then when you come and just begin your life you have to do a very menial type of work all physical menial and by that way slowly slowly that maybe you are from a rich family but you have to live a very ordinary way the simple way so that your the ego should be the crashed and go away like that the training then there's a story the one young boy came and he told i like to become a monk but what i am supposed to do then they should look at those people they are young novicious they are looking after the cows those they are cooking they are cleaning the vessels and all these minions work that you have to sweep the floor clean these then then he saw a person sitting under the tree and giving the sermon and a few people sitting before him listening to the talk he said wow who is he and what he is doing then he said he is the guru in charge of this astra and he is giving the spiritual teaching then that boy told oh that shoots me i can go and give the teachings to the others in the beginning itself without any practice so that is called ego and in the spiritual life no growth can come unless you practice well how do you find purna now he's asking about that boy how do you find purno does he go into ecstatic mood no i haven't noticed in him any outer sign of such emotion one day i told him those words of yours what words you told us that if a man is a small receptacle he cannot control spiritual emotion but if he is a large one he experiences intense emotion without showing it outwardly you said that a big lake does not become disturbed when even an elephant enters into it but when an elephant enters a pool one sees tremendous confusion and the water splashes on the banks master puna will not show this emotion outwardly he hasn't that kind of temperament his other signs are good what use what do you say now friends when we are practicing spirituality obviously any practice any action as its result so when you are practicing spirituality you get the result but some people after seeing something a little joy within they become so overwhelmed they go on telling people you know i have seen these i have seen that this happened to me there and there to stop because they they think that is sufficient for them there the small the the we can say at the continent so they cannot take much of it the spiritual life means the experience is completely transforming yourself so obviously you have to have the patience so many experiences come and sometimes it is uh and the tremendous very fearful things start the thoughts start coming in your dream in your thoughts in your so you have to go on praying to god tremendous temptations start coming different people will come and start praising you and giving you the gift and inviting you to different places by that way also slowly slowly you go away so these different temptations are there as because the very slippery part and one of the punishers it says shura nishita durgam it's like walking on the razer's age is so sharp if you just make a wrong step and you are done so that is why and then nishita you have to go on practicing practicing you do not know when you are reaching ultimately to the goal in this life maybe in the next life maybe anytime then the the life of lord buddha who could remember 500 births of his own life the after the buddhahood after that knowledge he remembered those and he told about that to his disciples so they have recorded it jaataka stories he went on taking different type of lives but in every life whether you it was a bird or an animal and the what the ordinary human being the prince a king every time constantly he was going on towards the righteousness following the righteousness and so ultimately he became buddha the gyani the man of knowledge so sudama krishna is mentioning that about the purna he saw and he is mentioning the puna will show his emotion outwardly it will not show his emotion outwardly he hasn't that kind of temperament his other signs are good what do you say other signs are good so showing emotion is one thing and what are the other signs you know it is love and unselfishness mainly unselfishness because you are not attached to this world so you don't need anything but at the same time you love each and every one because you are unselfish so these are the two constantly it goes and that is the sign of spiritual growth the more you are developing unselfishness the more you are becoming the man of love a person of love loving each and every one that is the sign of spirituality and the purna was having that mere bride then the master and master maha he noticed he said his eyes are very bright and prominent maybe a good the eyes were good now the master suramar krishna is mentioning mere bright eyes are not enough so the physical sometimes some people are so good looking once i went to give a talk in bombay they took me to a reformatory so the people they were there they were underground people they are not ordinary the pickpocketers are thieves oh my god over there i saw some so good looking boys so fair complexion big eyes and the beautiful hair and well built but they went too into that dark region so one they came to me after the lecture they came to pay respect to me then one young boy i don't know maybe the age but maybe 20 22 like that at that time then sir i asked him why so why you are in this group then he showed his the forehead as you always say because of my past karma so he showed his forehead i felt so bad for him and i told them that i will pray at least coming one month i will pray for you i did that so this this people they were so good looking so well-built that suddenly something happened why because of the bad karmas that force us to take over there the thoughts become like that you feel to do like that then afterwards when you are lamenting and they're crying it it won't help so the good looking only won't help the master rama krishna he's mentioning mere bright eyes are not enough the eyes of a godly person are different did you ask him what he failed after meeting me master yes sir we talked about that he has been telling me that the last four or five days now whenever he thinks of god or repeats his holy name tears flow from his eyes and the hair on his body stand on in such is his joy the haripulation when a person feels joy that the haripulation that purna was having so much suramar krishna very happy the master and him were silent a few moments then the aim said he is waiting the master who purna perhaps he has been standing at the door of his house when any of us passes that way he will come running and salute us the master uh uh he appreciated that the young little boy he has his uh the previous life he was so a holy person and in this life the family that he has taken birth maybe at that moment they were not liking the he was short-lived there afterwards as we know but he used to see the holy people and they feel attracted to them he will be coming so rama krishna was resting reclining against a bolster aim had brought with him a 12 year old boy who was a student in his school his name was kirod m is a nice boy he finds great joy in spiritual talk master smiling he has eyes like a deers the boy saluted srirama krishna touching his feet then he gently stroked the master's feet mastered to him rakhal is staying at home now pultu and vinod were seated in front of sri ramakrishna master to pull two smiling what did you say to your father that to aim he answered back when his father told him not to come here you know in those days it was impossible even in our childhood days talking before the father or arguing with him unthinkable in our society in our country nowadays things have changed so pultu did it so suramar krishna he was wondering how could he do that what did you you say paul to i said to him yes i go to him is that wrong the master and aim laughed i shall say more if necessary he was a young boy he was saying like that master to aim smiling no no should he go so far aim no sir he should not go too far sudama krishna laps so when you were talking with your father you should know sudama krishna giving that teaching and the master mastery also they should have respect but at the same time you have to convince your father that i am going to him and this is nothing wrong the master to be known how are you why haven't come to dakshinesha be not i almost came but when i and then i was afraid of falling ill again i have been ill and am not doing well come to the nation with me master says ramakrishna the year is very good there you'll recover the younger narendra entered the room sirama krishna was going out to wash his hands and face the younger naren followed him with a towel he wanted to pour water for the master him was with them these young people they used to come to bhagavan's ramakrishna but master washer was the main inspirer the srima master mashay whenever he used to find that a good nature boy he used to inspire him to come and have the blessings of bhagavan sirama krishna the narin this is two the young and swami bibiyakananda was also naren that narendra and naren these two master it's very hot today aim yes sir master how do you live in the small room of yours doesn't it get very hot on the upper floor the aim yes sir it gets very hard friends many of you know that uh the ancestors i think the grandsons of the master maharshi they are also so good they gave that whole building where the master masha lived and composed the gospel of sirama krishna they have handed over their property to ramakrishna nation and the ramakrishna mission accepted that property though it is you have to go those who have visited that place you have to in those days the the north calcutta buildings were like that you have to go through a very narrow lane but still the ramakrishna mission has accepted and they have made a beautiful astronomer there our monks are leaving and if you go over there even the mother masala money devi went over there and the room where the master masha used to leave the staircase oh my god how he used to go up in that it's a wooden staircase and very stiff even uh you know some good people also it was so difficult to climb but they used to do like that going upward and sitting and the small room used to leave so the simple living and high thinking that was the philosophy and they got the blessings of the god himself that they that is that the master master suramar krishna he visited that place he knew so he is inquiring from him how he lived master besides your wife has been suffering from brain trouble you should keep her in a cool room aim yes sir i have asked her to sleep downstairs sudama krishna returned to the drawing room and took his seat master to him why didn't come to dakshinesha last sunday master mashay sir there was no one else at home my wife was not well and so no one was there to look after her suramar krishna was on his way in a courage to devendra's house to nimu gosvami lin the young and not in aim and one or two other devotees were with him the master felt great yearning for purna he began to talk of the young disciple master to aim a great soul or how could he make me do japa for his welfare but purnu doesn't know anything about it when the purna was not very i think physically also and he was not very happy because their parents their family people never allowed him to go to suramar krishna so sirama krishna did japa for him so that's the great thing im and the other devotees were amazed as these words master it would have been nice if you had brought him here with you today why didn't you seeing the younger noren laugh the master and the other devotees laughed too the master said to him laughing and pointing to naren look at him look how naive he looks when he laughs as if he knew nothing he never thinks of these three things land wife and money god cannot be realized unless the mind is totally free from lost and gold friends this is a very very important teaching those who like to realize god for them the three things jamin juru chadhi or sometimes they say rupaya as i in hindi jameen means the land juru the wife and chandi are the gold or rupaya means money so these three things that attracts the world to the worldly life and once the mind is not completely free from that it's very difficult to realize god so sirama krishna is mentioning the courage proceed to devendra's house once rama krishna had said to devendra dakshinesha i have been thinking of visiting your house one day the devendra had replied the same idea came to my mind today and i have come here to ask you that favor of you you must grace my house this sunday but the master had said you have a small income don't invite many people the carriage higher will also run a big amount this is the tradition when a holy person is visiting somebody's house that householder is supposed to pay for his passage money friends we'll stop over here today and the next wednesday another wednesday is there in this december we will complete this chapter at this portion at least and january february we won't have any classes then again in the march we will start the class so next wednesday again we will study from this page so the first question is from sanitab energy uh the first question why why sometimes sorrows are arising in our mind please tell us what to do you know the sorrows means sometimes a hidden desire is there so sometimes we don't we are not aware the in the in a conscious mind conscious level it is not there so we wonder why it is but in the subconscious mind in a very subtle way some desires are there sometimes if we don't have the friends or we can't exchange we can't share our mind that is also or that sorrow comes sometimes some of the fulfilling thing like you know that let the babies we want a child we like to talk to the baby even if we don't want a child at least playing with the babies that also gives great soulless so once it is a sorrow that means there is a desire which is not fulfilled so every individual has to observe the mind what is there so if you are closing your eyes sitting alone observing your mind and suddenly you will find in a flash these are the things tormenting you these are the things which you are not getting and so you are not happy so that another sorrow is coming so you have to study your own mind and you can find out that fulfill that or pray to overcome that first second don't worry about all those is the mind's nature to sometimes go down and to go up so don't worry about that continue the practice of spirituality maintain your routine regularly that will make you happy thank you shumindas is saying your voice is so soothing it heals the inner soul that's his first comment marathon second is as a question is it necessary to take diksa to get into religious and spiritual life if yes please guide me uh so men so man yeah so man that is yeah thank you for you liked my voice but anyway the and this uh you know the our diksha is really really necessary the for everything we need someone to teach us that when we start walking the mothers or the aunties they help us to stand and walk and when we learn cycling then maybe if you know every in the car driving anything in the life we need a teacher and why not for spiritual life we do not know what is there so a guide is necessary i would suggest if you like the surama krishna vivekananda ideology mahasaratha mani philosophy then you better contact some ramakrishna mission nearby and i don't know in which town you are so go and nearby astrama talk to them then slowly the if you come in acquaintance with them and if you have read the biography of sirama krishnamasharada swamiji then slowly you will get the guidance from our great teachers over there the river president maharaj revealed vice president maharaja there are there they will give the if you are from india you will get the initiation if you are in europe and america the nearby assam center head she can give you the initiation but initiation is necessary for spiritual life is asking please tell us a little bit about sudha bhakti how do i practice it is the ultimate devotional stage what is should the pure what is purity only god again and again you will find if you are following my talks the there are two things god and his creation the creation means this world and what is this world only five things rupa russia gandha the the form is there name is there taste is there smell is there so like that so if these five things attracts our mind then naturally it's just attracting asuda that is impure nothing wrong in it that is natural but you have to go on praying to god god i don't want your creation i want only you that is called sudda bhakti if you go on praying to god i only want you my mother or my father so that is called pure bhakti and that is the shuddha bhakti and that is the way one should practice thank you srima biswas is asking why today's children's are so selfish they put their parents in old home awesome yeah we can we can't just label them as a selfish because you know that uh socio-economic condition is such i know many of the indian uh and the boys and the girls who are living over here and in the europe they regularly they have are praying for their mother for their parents and they torment so much when they can't go there but the you know the socio-economical situation is such you have to go out you have to live somewhere else then how to so the best way nowadays even here the in indian parents nowadays they don't depend on the children the american society is not european american society the moment the sun is attending 18 years is supposed to go out and they will teach in such a way you have to teach him driving and he should know how to handle the bank account the this credit cards and all that then he should go and join in the college hostel he should i adjust with others then when he is attending the university or working he should have a separate apartment for himself maybe very nearby but still should not leave with the parents that is not good in this society they live like that in our society we used to live together is some good and some bad effect is also there but the parents also should slowly slowly develop this temperament that why should we always be depending on our children whatever the earnings all through our life some portion we should keep for us so that when we are the elderly and some care taking home we should go but we should leave freely sometimes we are going and meeting the children inviting them or visiting their houses live a free life that is also good so that is also we have to think in that way but it changes you know that as because the society is changing that mentality temperament also changes we cannot say completely it is bad we cannot blame that they are not self they are all selfish not like that the good bad all that i have read some of the news is the terrible news is that those who are living with the parents over there they are sometimes betraying their parents that is also there so the closeness not all the time that develops the goodness that is teaching is depends on the teaching both parents should also also be independent and the children also so the relation will be very good so okay then friends thank you so let us say you know that this is the our our new chicago calling it has a beautiful writing uh about the cover page there's a time you can see that it is a showing the picture of a clock the what is the time and how the time merges to infinity and some other things are also there the lectures that was given by omar nandaji that is also here sarvasthanandaji's lecture or whatever i said about the
