[114: Panchama Veda 114 : Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=67RknHugiv8)

good evening let us begin with this mantra de Vaca Tom rhythm dr. G bonham kobe v rhythm calm asha pom sabana mangalam srimad athim booby gunam de bourr√©e de ojinaga and this mantra that describes that if you hear a real listen and this words of the god you get all the merits and when we listen to this those who are really the seeker of spirituality they truly get this today we will read a few passages view the discussion that three more particularly having with ceramic krishna the last time sri ramakrishna was inquiring the last class religious we read after that what do the English think about God he was inquiring about the god of the English and the aim said they believe in a formless God the God without for master ceramic ISNA immediately mentioned that is also one of our beliefs that is also one of our beliefs we have so many beliefs in the Hinduism we are having so many different type of faiths believes paths so one of our believes then he is describing his own experiences and that is very important we talked about the formless God we talked about God everywhere but now he is describing that three different regions where he found God everywhere and we will see that our scriptures are rightly supporting the regions of ceramic trishna and at the same time the visions of ceramic Krishna we should keep in mind ceramic Krishna didn't read any Scripture not that after reading the scripture somebody is talking and giving the description no not like that he never read in his scripture but all his realizations tallied with the scripture so his realizations are the proofs of the scriptural truth here we find ceramic ISNA is mentioning for a time master and disciple remained silent disabled means i'ma Dean see ramakrishna began to describe his experiences of Brahman one day I had the vision of consciousness non-dual and in divisive oh is a page 282 of the gospel of sri ramakrishna by shaman aquiline and the g one day i had the vision of consciousness non-dual and indivisible we know about the brahman almost everywhere they have said it is one without a second that same brahman he is mentioning consciousness it is everywhere and at the same time non-dual not having do and in divisive all at first it had been revealed to me that there were innumerable main animals and other creatures the ceramic ishness vision it goes beyond even the other realizations of the Brahma Gammy's he said in one place we should not misunderstand that he is boasting he was the person who could not even say I he was so humble he was not associated with his body at that person said akon car Oh big guitar bid bid on Toki charya gets the experiences of this person over here in ceramic ISNA it has gone beyond the Veda and vedanta what is the veda the knowledge of the Rishi's realizations of the Rishi's now here in ceramic is near the modern age he has realized in in such a way that it has super past that even so he is telling when I am seeing that consciousness non-dual how he saw he saw at first it revealed to me that there were innumerable main animals and other creatures among them there were aristocrats the English the muscle man's myself scavengers dogs and also a bearded muscle man with an art in where tree of rice in his hand he put a few grains of rice into everybody's mouth I do tested a little the very special way of realization and this muscle man we all know sharma vivek and also say islamic body the unity they are not divided the car screen now division that is the unity and here he said arrest record and also the scavengers all of their and the different people belonging to different religion they are there and see ramakrishna myself were there who is the ramakrishna the Avatara the even the incarnation of god and a scavenger a dog different people belonging to different religion all belong to that Brahma this is the unique way of expressing the brahman and he said I too then he said the second day another day I saw this time not men animal or anything I saw the rice vegetables and other food stuff and filth and dirt as well suddenly the soul came out of my body and like a flame touched everything can you imagine so sometimes when we try to understand what is Brahman the most of the people they say that you cannot describe Brahman here salam o Krishna given a complete and clear idea about drummond each and everything and he is given very categorically first the male mane animals and all sorts of people then this type of he says a rise vegetable other food stock another day the third vision it was revealed to me that I had devotees my intimate companions my very own so now this is the third stage where he found the Incarnation found that his own people are also there and they are also the manifestation of the same Bremen and then he said they are after after this realization I would climb to the roof of the Kuti as soon as the bills and the conch shells of the evening service sounded in the temples and cry out with a longing heart oh where are you all come here I am dying to see you that this is the call of the God and those who are pure in heart they receive that call and they come to God and they get that opportunity to understand to realize God but sometimes unfortunately after coming over here again we develop our own shots of ego divisions narrowness again we go back to the same square one so that we must be very very careful friends as salam o Krishna was describing about the Brahman the art Minh which is in everything we find in the scriptures also here in the issue Phoenicians it says in the sixth verse of the issue of ownership very clearly mentioned yes to cervoni kutani at minus 10 / shetty suruba booty suture at mononym the toe nabi jagapathi cervoni hutong he whose is all beings in the self now what we read in the gospel of ceramic Krishna he sees everything in that as the cell not only the men are the people are the human being animals and also make everything including filth it all comes into that yes to serve on in Bhutan here it says about the water about the being at Manila varnish shitty in the self itself and the self in all beings sarva bhuteshu chart manam the tuna baju gujarati it cannot hate that we have noticed those who know about the Hinduism Tantra is a process of Tantra they'll be going into not only in the solitude but in the places where the dead bodies are burning all lined up they will go and sit over there without any hatred without any fear they develop that the mother the power of God that consciousness that Brahman that is also there in everything so this is the experience of the realization and when we realize that oneness how can I hate that is y mas are the money they vie said do not criticize others do not find fault with others and she said if you want peace if you want peace if you don't want and nothing to say but if you are interested to have that peace the joy the happiness eternal then don't try to find fault with others and this is the teaching we get again I was quoting from the eShop Anisha now in the bhagavad-gita sixth chapter 30th sloka mantra it says yo mom Pusha T sarvatra whenever I read this pages of the gospel of cinema Krishna a little slow in reading because always I try to get this shastra the scripture which is the support the basis this our bhagavad-gita the super Nisha the Veda how it is collaborating supporting so that we find here too in the bhagavad-gita we find the description yo mom a shitty cervera Sarah buncha my machete Tasya hamne prana Shami such Amina pronoun shotty he who sees me in all beings in the initial pune sure we find the same thing in the bhagavad-gita he who sees me the god this time it is not artman it is the god in every being and all beings in me m capital the god to him I am never lost nor he to me so again we find as Raghavan see Ramakrishna's experience he saw these that is me he saw the Muslim Christian a scavenger and I took at and Saddam Disney himself even the Avatara all belong to the same group utter Gita is a another wonderful the disc conversation shri krishna mentioned over here since the Paramatma the Supreme cell is present everywhere that were gianni that means the knower of the Braman sees that cell in everything why the tattoo Aghani the knower of the brahman he sees the cell or the brahman everywhere because it is present over there so that Krishna in the gutter Gita is telling yatra yatra Mon Ami RT tatra tatra param padam tatah ratata param brahma sarvatra sammobile stickam these are the unique way of giving the example of the brahman all over we talk about Brahman about the Vedanta about the God without any form now we see that our scriptures whatever they have expressed about that Brahman as maximum possible as close to our understanding and the same is Saddam o Krishna giving a clear view about the Brahman and now if anyone is fighting in the name of religion how that can be possible how a man can criticize others if he is a man of religion if he says like that naturally we filled out is it telling the truth because the moment we realized that you find the same God everywhere then if you don't say God then the consciousness or the art man or the gunman in different names and finally we make code from the great law giver of them Hindus the manu maharaj he is also telling in the same way sir Babu te shooter art monomer sorry boo-boo tanita art money sorry boo-boo tshita art mana mean every wing if I see my god or myself the Hartman and again in the admin all being saman passion art mahadji at mahadji means at magani at magana means the knower of the self some emotion he cannot see indifferent it cannot sewerage America chetty Dean only he can realize his own realization means the Mukti artham as the Buddha's eight knowledge or near wanna moksha whatever we say the ultimate goal is to see only one cannot be the difference this is C Ramakrishna he is explaining and giving his own experience and to whom to master Marsha not publicly only to master Marsha he is telling master Masha is noting this is also important because ordinary people may misunderstand and after narrating this thing his own experiences then he was asking the master Marsha why because he selected master Marsha to note all his messages and to publish it for the benefit of the people all these experiences of the Veda so clearly realized by C Ramakrishna that's why I gave this benjamin way the name after this gospel of ceramic ISNA is the fifth veda all full of knowledge every page every sentence giving us that at mcdonough and naturally the person who is leaving just sitting before me easy a cod realized person or incarnation of God doubt may come and he is asking the question to the master Marcia well what do you think of these visions most of the time people is a sad this type of vision another weak mind they see so many things he is asking the master mature because master mushy will be noting if the person is not understanding they think properly then he may note it or express it afterwards different way the meaning will be different Master Masha immediately said God has created other beings as if with a machine almost the same way but yourself with his own hands here in America they say the custom made if you say properly these are the things I want and then only they will prepare and very costly so God prepared see Ramakrishna with his own hand master wishes realization the God has created other beings as if with a machine but yourself with his own hands then he said well hajira says that after the vision of God one occurs six divine powers is now asking the same way to master Marcia what about that I am not having that six powers they naturally the people ordinary people they always think if there is something special in that man supernatural then only we can believe that he is the manifestation of God or having little power of God I think I told you once then one of the sect one I went to a place they are the followers of the Lord Krishna and when they saw me and tore are you from the ramakrishna mission I told yes then an elderly person told oh my god why you were so ignorant about this you're following see Rama Krishna is God and you why what is the problem salam Krishna could not leave t even in a small piece of stone whereas sri krishna lifted the whole mountain and leaving Syria Krishna you are following three ramakrishna at or what is the air if sri krishna is lifting the mountain with his finger that is a different thing but the serum but the people they always thinking that way unless and until you are showing some miraculous power they will never accept you as divine so this is the great value those who are truly seeking for the god realization the true knowledge they must understand this has nothing to do with that and we will hear the sea ramakrishna is also mentioning the six knowledge six divine power spiritual power that the Hazara always mentioning that is this we sure yes ship some of Garcia he showed you some of the barriers here yasha three gianna Baracus chiba shannon baaga eating ghana these are the six power one is a Sharia another is be here another is yasha then sorry jaan by Daka now if we look at sea Ramakrishna we can see everything in him that's why Babu afterwards in the beginning he was not believing Shami Vivekananda was not believing then afterwards as a true scientist he examined see Ramakrishna then when he himself realized he understood see Ramakrishna of course he said very little but even then he said see Rama Krishna is the father of God what you talk about god Raghavan a Baba in Bengali he said is the father of God why all the qualities that you see or you think you can imagine in God much more is present in see Ramakrishna each and everything is present in ceramic Easter so that is the main reason he said that Hara he is also always talking about this if man this man has realized God why he's not showing all the six powers then the M those who seek pure love don't want powers the master ma cherie now he is understanding so he said when we need pure love we know the stories of the gopis when the gopis they went to see the krishna and they went to the gujarat dwarka dear they didn't like Krishna because he was sitting on the throne it all those because he was a king over there the Krishna gopi's never wanted to see Krishna with all that power all that wealth they wanted Krishna the person whom the loved it is this many ceramic ISNA mentioned this point those who really love God never want the power never want all those things because the love is the best thing and Saddam Sri God himself as Shami vivicam distilling l.o.v.e about ceramic is nigh said l.o.v.e part this is the love when the love is small just me and mine there is also the expression of God but win that expand it goes and embraces everything without any discrimination that is godly that is divine so here he says that hazra is talking about all this so aim must Amish I said because you don't want all those you want the pure love so you are not showing as he see Ramakrishna mentioned perhaps haja was a poor man in the previous life and that is why he wants to want so much to see the manifestation of power those who are the poor the all is the think about the wealth so whoever is well the in our country if you go and see even a small person may be an ordinary leader of a village he will show so much thing otherwise people don't accept him if you are not going with the red light and the police also giving you the scored and also many people they know other people who won't respect away is nothing he's just like us his ordinary man because therefore they want to she see that the shoe off the power the world and then only they appreciate is the indication of the fullness of mine in the spiritual life also when you you always go to those people who are showing some miracles this is there just like a jihad the previous life they wanted to get something and now in this life also always appreciating something which is having the miraculous power and all this says ha gi√† perhaps was a poor man then he'd find that he says many a time you have said that a devotee who loves God for the sake of love does not care to see horse powers a true devotee wants to see God as Gopala him remember all the words of the Ramakrishna now he is telling those and master said yes it is just like the Sun at the dawn you can easily look at that son it doesn't dazzle the eyes rather it satisfies them how the wonderful expression when you want to see the God weed out all that he is having the power now in the eleventh chapter of the Bhagavad Gita also rewind what you wanted to see that type of God who is having all power but when he saw a man like Arjuna hero he was afraid immediately he prayed please become as you were before I cannot withstand this so that is why he all is the prey to the the Lord Shiva dakshina ama come yet the Machine are mahkum that I want to see i went to see oh god that your benign fares see Ramakrishna always is to say do not worship the hoshan Kali the Kali in the cremation ground she is terrible that time she is destroying she's mother but at the same time that particular moment she is doing something terrible and you should not go near him at that time rather you worship dakshina golly when she is benign should we always suggest our devotees whoever wants to keep the picture or the images why not the image of dakshina sure because that is the image where Saddam tishner brought the Divine Mother that power in that so she is so divine so Ben I'm so loving I can go near to that mother I can pray and I can meditate on are here the same thing cinema Krishna is telling when the Sun in the middle of the day it is impossible to look at this on but in the morning dawns on it is so good we can see both remain silent for some time then the aim said why should you reach and not be real certainly aim the master Masha he is thinking that is the importance that is the beauty of the ceramic ishness devotees when they're listening something even from the mouth of the ceramic wish nuh not that they are accepting immediately they are pondering over there meditating on that finding out though really it is true and what not so all this time the master Marcia I was pondering over all those visions that Saddam occasion I described now suddenly he is telling why should your reasons not be real if they are unreal then the world is still more unreal for there is only one mind that is the instrument of perception your pure mind sees those visions and our ordinary mind see worldly objects he is going to the point of the Vedanta there is only one mind when we are reading the scripture particularly the Upanishads and the king of benicia we found that the disciple is coming and asking the question ken'ishi competitive roshita mana kena prana pratama piety and why my mind is not listening to me not under my control as if somebody else is utilizing my mind sending it to any different direction k nice item but at Ypres she tamanna then in the answer the Guru saved that behind the mind there is another mind behind everything all that's Chuck shoe karnin aashika another power is there without that nothing can work so that power is the power of the Brahmin now those who are studying the Vedanta they can try to understand this and they are slowly understanding this the something is always there behind all our mind our conception our intellect our existence so obviously that power is nothing but the power of the brahmana the consciousness right this moment we cannot perceive we cannot touch we can smell but realization is possible the aim master Marsh I after discriminating thinking and then he said you must be possible because it is your pure mind with the pure mind which is not bind by any desire when there is no waves of any thought any desire there the reflection of the truth is there but we the only people as because we are having so many different thoughts in our mind so naturally we see things in a different way master I see that you have now you see he is giving the certificate to the master mancha is giving the certificate I see that you have grabs the idea of unreality well tell me what you think of Asura again he is going back to a jira you know why because most of his disciple they were impressed by the Hegira the young people and Hegira Marsha he's sitting over there with so many books and naturally the modern people they appreciate the person who can quote from different books and if you can quote from different Scripture and also the scientists also the writers the people are so much impressed some of our speakers they are melting money just because they are utilizing their intellect in that way but if you go and ask themself have you realized that or do you practice what you say far from that so that is the main things I Ramakrishna is always guiding his own disciples in a very proper way and one time maybe in this book will come to know thats Ramakrishna is telling directly that was not his nature but only here we find to the aim master master who will be his Ganesha who will be writing all his messages he said don't go to anywhere come only over here and at this time when he gave the call he called those people then he said if anyone even for once truly called God will come over here in the ideology of ceramic ISNA which is all-embracing the ideology of Sri Ramakrishna is all-embracing his neighbor denouncing anyone but if we come to this Swami Vivekananda indirectly in one place long time afterwards when he is very famous he is telling oh I see that the flowing the drinking water flow he says surah Denis that is the pure Ganga Ganga water the pure water is flowing but some foolish they are making the well wet on the bank of the Ganga they are not going to the Ganga to take that water unfortunate so this is C Ramakrishna who is giving the true religion but somehow we do not understand that we go to all the different places he is giving the indication again in different places will find that he is telling that botsa he are male taka now in the age of the in the urn the realm of the British shirts you cannot utilize that the coin that was made by the bath shells and then the Muslim rulers you cannot use that coin now because it everything has been changed it is the British rule the indication is the previously the same God came he gave the instructions but that was only for that particular people that period of time hundreds of years have been already changed mentality of the people have been changed lifestyle changed so now God again he has come and giving the new direction he is so easy for the modern people if we go back to the old and then try to do that it is impossible here he is master ma shy when he was suddenly he expressed his own opinion about the visions of Z Ramakrishna the cinema Krishna was very happy like the true master true teacher he said I see that you have understood this idea riya unreality you have understood what is that unreality temporary it's not that is not there sometimes when you talk about this this world is unreal and you always say that it is like the mirage but some people's it is not the character the way of expression when you are giving the example of the Mirage it is not there actually in truly but you see that then you go but in this life I can pinch and can feel the pain when I am hungry I can understand that I am hungry all these things are very much there how can you say that is just like the mirage or a dream is very much real how it is real it is real but in a lower level as the children they think all their playmates and the dolls and all the games are very much real to them at that time but the seniors when they are providing all those things to them they understand they will throw away all these when they grow up because of the advancement of knowledge experience same way this very moment we think this world is unreal no it is also real but in a lower knowledge and same thing when we grow and realize that Brahman we see you know all that we see is nothing but the same ramen as we have just rate the experience of cinema Krishna all different human being everything is nothing but that Drummond oh I don't know the master is loving when he was telling that you have understood done reality then the aim he was a very shy type of person the very knowledgeable person very educated person and he felt shy hearing this appreciate asian they said oh I don't know Master laughed and said well do you find me to be like anybody else he wants to make it clear ceramic is no never inquired like this thing but with the aim when this conversation is the aim is recording he was only one with him nobody else was there so he is only recording otherwise whenever the other people are their aim always mentioned who are the people from where they came how they were sitting what happened everything all description this time in this day he is only having man-to-man conversation 121 and ceramic ISNA getting himself very clear he was sure about him but at the same time examining how he is understanding the moment he master said well do you find me to be like anybody else m said no self again there's very interesting the master said like any other piranha Hampshire because there are so many all the time people that declare self-declared for announcer paramahamsa means the so on the grade so on perama hamsa parama means great hamsa Swan why because they live in the water but never wit by that water that is the symbol the paramahamsa after realizing the god the brahman the living in the society just like any other people but not associated with those the thing that is there in the samsara like narrowness hatred jealousy nothing in there so here he says any other paramahamsa aim said no sir you cannot be compared to yells master smiling have you heard of a tree called a chin a chin means unknown so a chain 3m no sir the master there is a tree called by that name but nobody knows what it is in likewise it is not possible to recognize you the morning man understands you the more uplifted he will be the Mora man understands see Ramakrishna the more uplifted he will be it's very very rare the serum Krishna Ava's said about himself but in one place to one devotee who was not having any faith in God and he was constantly thinking doubting the existence of God but see Ramakrishna was very eager to help him to realize God and he said you remember me that we do because he had the faith in cinema Krishna so he is to come to see Ramakrishna to had dialogue it's a Ramakrishna Sosa Ramakrishna understood that if I say that he will concentrate on me then he said you remember me that will do you need not to remember anything else that we are imagining Krishna arama or cali of Durga but here is a person whom I can see I can talk I know about him he has a picture most of the time people will say why not a statue of ceramic is an idol of why because this is true it was in the in the photo that same arch or the money there he said the modern people are so clever they have taken the photo of the God and he said if you you need not to meditate only look at that that will do so that salam o Krishna he said and the master smiling have you heard of your teen 3 know then he said likewise in was silent he said to himself the master referred to the Sun at the dawn and the tree unrecognizable by man did he mean an incarnation of God is this the play of God through man is the master himself an incarnation now this is the question with all these things Master merger is still having that question in his mind contemporary people is very difficult to understand but the contemporary people is so difficult to understand so naturally he is thinking the person who is sitting before me I can't talk to him I can see him but still and that person sometimes asking master Magi can you purchase it dhoti a piece a plot for me the cord is asking a piece of cloth from me can I consider him as God that these are naturally the doubts the team also having and he is thinking is the master himself an incarnation was this way was this why he cried to the devotees from the roof of the Kuti could he means where the landlord's of the Roxy nature distally there's kolkata body so the incarnation is giving the call come to me as the Jesus give the call to the fisherman he told you give away all those things the net with which you of catching the fish I will you how to catch the men so this is a total that call born the boat at your back and follow me thats all the time they're incarnations are giving the call where if you can understand it the Blissett view the understand it they follow him and they realized that truth ceramic ISNA he's sitting in a room in his room and he is thinking master Marsha he noticed that Saddam agrees no went to the Kali temple came back sat on his bed and he's talking with the divine mother mother what is all this rule about shall I go there I shall go if you take me this is really unique salam o Krishna every moment he used to feel the presence of the Divine Mother and never did anything without harvest without her permission so this time invitation has come to visit the devotees house and cinema Krishna is taking the permission of the mother if you say or if you take me then only I will go or not the master was to go to a devotee house was it for this that he was asking the divine mother's permission the same thing happened in the life of Shami Prime ananda shammy prime Ananda worse supposed to go to the east bengal the Nava days the Bangladesh everything was ready the people also came with the boat in those days days to sell with the boat to take him then primin on the g wayne to offer pranaam to tackle ceramic ish nuh in that old temple of the Lord MOT and he was taking a long time he was not coming out and the people went and saw that he is having the conversation with Ramakrishna they couldn't see the ceramic ich nur this or the picture but they could feel that Prime Ananda he is having some dialogue and then he came out and tour no taco is telling not to go this time I won't go so this is the prisons Shami Vivekananda also without any the permission of the mother the Divine Mother in the form of martial a domani Debbie never did anything that's why we always think that their presence is so much we must go and ask the permission and tell him I want to do this shall i wait for and then you will see everything is becoming maybe that we are not directly getting there the order of ceramic ISNA but we will feel that everything is becoming all right so we can feel it is the will of God I can do that if it is not it's good that I have not done it I could not do it I should not feel sorry rather i'll be happy that it was not the will of God that I couldn't do so that is called Karma Yoga so whatever I am doing I am doing at the behest of the mother of the God and so I have nothing to do if it is success it is for because of God give it is not then he never wanted it to be done so this way even Shami g prime ananda g again he spoke too hard perhaps bring about an intimate disciple this is very very interesting mother please make me stainless well mother why have you given him only a particle why have you given him means the devotee a particle was such a small portion of the power divine power you have given to him then remaining silent a moment listening to the mother from the math something is she is telling oh I see that will be enough for your work can you imagine when a person is so near and he can listen to the conversation between the divine mother and the incarnation of God and that way everywhere anyone becoming little successful be sure that is the power of God manifested to that so we should always wait and pray for that power to come and even a little there is sufficient that which is Brahman is verily Shakti I address that again as the mother I call it Brahman when it is inactive and Shakti when it is when it creates preserved and destroy it is like water sometimes still and sometimes covered it waives the incarnation of God is the part of the leela of shakti the purpose of the divine incarnation is to teach man extracting love of for God the incarnation is like order of the cow the only place milk is to be God God incarnate himself as man there is a great accumulation of divinity in an incarnation and that is why Jesus said those who have seen the Sun has seen the father that is seeing the incarnation means seeing the god it is that accumulation of the God see Ramakrishna also in that same position that we see now in this picture he said it is a expression of great divinity wonderful living in this expression when he is sitting is that true that posture the divine is manifesting only we need to have the eyes to understand that to see that some of the devotees wondered is the Ramakrishna an incarnation of God like Krishna jaton and Christ it is devotee mean again the master he is going on thinking and some people they say some of the researchers on the gospel they say when the mosques Ramakrishna was talking with the divine mother and was arguing about a devotees divine power and said that much will do it was about master Marcia the mine denard Gupta the writer of the gospel and the recorder we can say the recorder of the gospel of salam o Krishna because this was the master Mercia we saw afterwards because of the gospel thousands of people came to know about ceramic is not even today so many people after reading the gospel they understand religion in a true manner a one American gentleman came and he told I am trying to understand this Hinduism recently I got the book gospel of ceramic ISNA and I cannot leave that book every page I read and I feel this is true religion so that is the power that the divine mother gave to the writer the teacher is a very ordinary man and see how threw him a great work has been done so if the mother the Divine Mother which is nothing but Brahman giving a little power to anyone he is blessett and ceramic ISNA was the incarnation no doubt maybe we will read other passages next day let us conclude rotana mantra need anjana medium hunter ljubim bak
