[33: Panchama Veda 33: Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QcK7HOUhwbw)

a the last time we are still reading the conversation between the bidder sagar and bhagavan sri ramakrishna and here the bhagavan sri ramakrishna he was describing about the god bhagavan which in the last class on 10th december we were discussing sriram krishna is telling just see how picturesque this universe is how many things there are the sun the moon the stars and how many varieties of living beings big and small good and bad strong and weak etc so this whole world is a creation of god some some intellectual being as the present-day science is thinking not being some intellect intelligent field from there things are coming and almost all the philosophy the religious people they believe that god has created this and in indian philosophy we find that a few words are coming again and again sometimes which is very difficult for the western mind to understand that brahma atma is all these total almost seven words so these seven words they are explaining the whole thing first is brahma and atman what is atma what is brahman then come ishwara then bhagavan agatha we were discussing about the bhagavan and last the last day we quoted from the vishnu purana where it says sri aha we know that there are six qualities what are the six total this power media is a special mental strength virya yasha and then the sri then gyana and bhairav these six now the ishaja means riches we were discussing that is usually the word rich this whole universe just now we quote it from cerama krishna is a beautiful universe so many things it has been created so many different varieties of things are there and in this universe there are so many as the human being considering like the platinums like the gold like the other jewelries so many costly things in the standard of the human being so everything is there all tons and tons of all those things and this is under the control of the god ishwara once in the vishnu temple in dakshinesha some the burglars they entered into the temple of the krishna and took away all the jewelleries next morning when it was reported the jaminda the landlord he came and he saw and then he was complaining to god what type of god you are you don't have power to protect your own jewelry so rama krishna was there he turned back to mathur babu the landlord and said for you these are all costly things for him is nothing because so much is there in the whole universe the aishwarya when we talk about naturally the ordinary people we think about the jewelleries and costly things in this world there are spiritual treasures are also there then yogic treasures are also there is not only a sharjah all different types of treasure and first is the worldly second we were discussing the last day yogic treasures what is that is one these are all eight siddhis after a lot of practices one person may get a little shitty that is sufficient and then when he gets he forgets everything one person was there he got the power of anima he could make himself very small and can go from here to there in different places just in what whenever he thinks and how he applied that power that is very peculiar the moment you get that power is very difficult to control the mind because the hoga immediately drags and he started visiting the rich family enjoying this thing and their thing in the night and that way he lost that power also so anima he could make that but another is prakamya whatever you want you get swami vivekananda when he was in south india i think in hyderabad he came to know about a person who could bring anything he wants who could say anything like that so he went before coming to a medical it happened in his life vivekanda's life he went over there to see that particular person whatever you say he could give then he was sitting just one blanket and nothing was there it was a loin cloth bare body and nearby nothing so you cannot say that it's just magic no tricks magicians always they will see they wear so many dresses and very glittering dresses people always look all those things and in the meantime he does something but it's not magic no dress at all just sitting in a corner of a room bare body only one blanket he was putting on his body then people they were asking different things we were asked whatever immediately to us from the blanket under the blanket he brought it and gave it to him then some flowers which is very rare in the south india and usually the flowers and the high altitude it grow i think someone in the com from the company of swami vivekananda he said to that man can you please bring that those flowers and this type of fruits like the graves and all which is not available and in those days there was now that market everywhere everything is available it was not like that he brought immediately immediately and he showed that there is nothing under the that blanket and then he immediately gave it to them so this is possible another person he could get this type of different type of information because he was having under his control two or three the ghosts when you talk about this this is very peculiar but this is possible he was having this power he could control the ghost and you are swami vivekananda suddenly when he was traveling suddenly came to know through different sources that one of his sisters have committed suicide then he was wondering is it so to get the information in those days you know there is there is no communication even if you are the fastest communication was the telegraph that's also very costly and then that too would take some time then someone told there is a person sitting he is a tantric and if you can go to him he can tell you swamiji you went to him and said is it possible yes it is possible i will get information about your sister he's sad in meditation after some time and then he was asking someone go this is the address get the information and come back immediately then he was waiting after some time something happened immediately he said yes this is true that your sister has committed suicide it became so but the same person was asking swami vivekananda can you please bless my child he is sick swamiji told but you have every power no that power i am not having you have that power there is a special to your power and then this type of powers are also there so this yogic treasures it is also there and spiritual treasures are also there the first worldly treasure second yogic treasure third spiritual treasure whatever you want you will get the aisha yes and uh it is this is really very wonderful before the birth of bhagavan sri ramakrishna his father sudhiram died he the only one very young kid was there he used to love him so much but he somehow he was possessed by ghost shuddhiram chatupatha he was a very pure man one day he asked who are you why you are possessing my child what you want then he said that i am suffering a lot in this world and i know you are the only person who can help me to get rid of this suffering my soul is suffering my spirit is suffering then she did die he said what am i going to do you go and worship on my behalf and i will be free so sudhiram went and the shraddha almost in middle india the hindus usually after the they go to pray for the departed relatives see how true it is he went the shrimp went over there and he said how i will know that you are leaving my child he said you look at this tree the huge branch the moment you will offer the puja and i will get freedom i am living over here in the stream i will break the branch and you will know that i have left it happened the moment the shrine offered the puja over there the branch was broken so these things happens we cannot explain but this is the spirit is there it is power is there it is possible but not for all some people only can do it so here we find that yogic treasure anima small mahima gigantic garima heavy laghima light prabhti obtaining any desire that is being fulfilled ishitwa lordship and vashita the control so in the this gospel no details description but why i am giving this because this is very interesting and we should know about it the surama krishna only mentioned bhagavan and he is having all the power and if he is not having the power who will accept him as bhagavan so like that he is telling but what are the powers these aisha then veria mental power this mental strength is tremendous the moment he thinks that i should do like this and he does shri krishna verse is a formed child a brindavan people used to love him but one day he decided i should not be here i have some other mission i have to go and he left it is not possible for all ordinary people it's very very difficult and he was getting all the respect he could become the empowerer of the whole india undivided india and that comes right up to the middle east in the olden days it was like that he said nothing so this is not an ordinary power tremendous mental power is necessary otherwise this temptation and fear people cannot overcome so this is called virya and the moment we usually say we we always think about the valor and the courage that the army and the the fighters they show it's not like that that is of course the strength but the video means the mental power and to realize god we need this media and that's why swami vivekananda again and again asking the indians particularly become virgina have that mental strength and he was telling see look at these britishers how many are there only handful and how many of you millions and millions of indians and little handful of britishers they are controlling you how because they have the self-confidence barrier they feel that i can do i must do and you people cannot that is the difference only so virgin then yasha all glory then sri we know the sri means lakshmi lakshmi is again the wealth of this world and all that at the same time sri the word sri is a not only the wealth the mental attitude also the shriek the some people are having very good mental attitude they may be rich they may may be poor they may be illiterate they may be very educated but very wonderful mental attitude that is also sri aesthetic sense you know the what type of color i should use what type of picture i should use and these some people don't have the aesthetic sense at all that is free xiaomi vivekananda after the formation of this when it was established the belure what and some young people they came and joined as a brahmacari new recruits he used to go and visit the rooms suddenly he will enter into the rooms of ibrahcari sometimes two or three together they are leaving in the dormitory used to visit and he'll be sitting on the bed of the brahmacarians but never dictated never said anything but the brahmacharya is understood any time swamiji may come any time god may come so we have to keep everything neat and clean that's called also sri alert for the beauty then sometimes some people when you're offering a glass of water you try to drink from the glass it's a stingy smell it's not properly cleaned and they say what is there would hold the glass like this and then drink so don't bother about them smell no that is not like that and some people they will be dressing themselves and that's also not proper sri everything comes under sri the moment we talk about sri we only think about the money no wrong all these things comes in the street our business community should know it particularly in india i don't know about the other countries but wherever you go they will be only concentrating in earning money and not developing anything nowadays of course because of the government is conscious people are conscious people are visiting the europe so they are doing it to some extent these three that's why in uh english they say cleanliness is next to godliness so that is also the sri there's a culture lot of culture the young kids they are coming they are offering pronoun or to the senior people all comes on the street the wonderful culture they will never misbehave they will never miss the dress also not very peculiar the language when they are using that also very controlled so that is all shri all people know all that this type of filthy languages now that i see the english movies to get myself trained particularly the pronunciation sometimes the south american movies cowboy movies and sometimes the african-americans movies to try to understand their pronunciations and sometimes they will be continuously using the filthy language it's not necessary but going on and in sanskrit we call putita putidam in the beginning and the end there will be something so it is sandwiched so some good thing the omkara it is putita means in the beginning in the end so it is becoming very pure like that and they do the all ugly words put it up they're telling they'll be uttering a very ugly word fill the word in the beginning and then they will say something and then again that why it has become a habit this is not sri so this is also very important for a spiritual life for a human life so that's three should be then external knowledge the worldly knowledge and spiritual knowledge the gyana two types this knowledge and also the other knowledge some people they have come all the way from the other countries they are here got education earning money established over here but constantly hating this country and of course they do not do anything else only they are in their blogs or in some other blogs that they do not use their own personal blogs they have made a committee ah there they will be putting all these type of things about america and why because the parabid the upper habit that they are having mostly doctors engineers scientists researchers but they could not develop that that's why i should be grateful to anyone who has helped me that is absent that's why swami vivekananda when he came over here and particularly when he went to great beaten he was he himself has written has said there was no one in this world who came and to london with so much of hatred like me and now i am the one like them because of the qualities so this is called pravida and aparavita worldly knowledge but we should have open mind to appreciate people who is having the qualities why not because this is the gyana then comes ultimately by rajya this bhiragya dispassion we will be reading as we are starting the yoga aphorism we will be reading the dispassion even then that we last class also we discussed about the dispassion that is the ultimate parabolic i told the parameters the highest this type of things are nothing we have renowned something some brahmacharyans came and they were boasting we have renounced this world and all that then one of the direct disciples of sri ramakrishna said what you had that you have renounced you were not having anything a little bit of this and that what is that look at gautama buddha he was a king as prince at least the worldly treasure that he was having that you have renounced what renouncement the renounce means i don't want anything that is very peculiar i will find here in this gospel in the last sentences conversation with bid sagar and suramar krishna what's called renunciation even denying himself but people don't understand that in sanskrit we call binoy binayam the modesty but he some people in the some places it is so difficult you don't understand this is called bhairavya in the indian philosophy all these words are coming and they again they say ishwara i will just touch this word ish from the word ish the root is ish ish means possess rule over one who possesses one who can rule over is ishwara many people most of the people and it has become so easy for them so all is they pronounce my name ishtananda so it is easy but i wonder all is have they not heard the word ishwara so ishwara from the ish isha atma these are the two words isha and atma and ananda three words that is my name my guru gave isha means that god the lord and who is this isha ishwara we find a divination in patanjali we'll read afterwards in the samadhi pada and 24th aphorism he says in our sastras whenever they say any word they always clarify it so that we can understand it properly kleisa means ignorance that we have already if you can remember those with the student of yoga aphorism we have already started the klesha cliche means ignorance usually the translation of the word glacier means suffering here actually the word glacier means ignorance why we suffer because of the ignorance we are so much attached to this body and the mind and the things of this world so we suffer so that is recall clasha means ignorance karma means work whenever we are working for something we always get try to get the result of it and bhipaka means the result good or bad whatever and what comes where from the desire comes ah asha is many desire from all these things ignorance then the work then the result and then the subtle of the result is desire all the fourth thing is absent in this master of the world he is ishwara he is doing everything but he is not attached with anything this is the beautiful thing ishwara this is the conception bhagavan sri krishna in bhagavad-gita he is telling i don't have anything to do over here don't have anything in this three words in the neither world in this world and in the heaven i don't have anything to do why should we do here i am doing right from 11 o'clock to again in the afternoon sometimes the night i am a sannyasi but working why we are working to spread the message of vedanta and for that i am always inviting people so many people are writing to me are you available on such and such day these these this i am making the my diary and then i am thinking that my responsibility over here going over there meeting people and all these things is a work of course it's a different type of work but it's a work and sometimes i'm successful so i'm not sometime i'm loved and accepted by people sometimes not so naturally happiness and the sorrow everything is coming it goes like this why karma so the lord is telling i don't have any such karma at all but suppose i am a member of the ramakrishna nation and this organization was formed by swami vivekananda with one thing if you don't believe in jagat ether if you only believe in atmana moksha only my own liberation don't join the ram krishna nation and if you have joined the ramakrishna mission if you have if you are taking all the benefits from the ramakrishna mission then why should you not follow the work that both the things you have to follow or go away sit somewhere else you are taking everything from where from the devotees each and everything and then if we are not doing anything for the devotees either praying for them or trying to do good for them then are you not simply cheating the people and then you are telling no i am free from all this i only for the atmana moksha majority of the indian monks they say like this the vedanta but when you are surviving how you are surviving just by drinking water and taking some air food clothing everything you need where from it's coming from the society in return what you are giving to the society almost nothing not even a good thought so that is also in the name of karma and his fellow some people by mistake they always misinterpreted and they wrongly interpreted not only one thousands of them so this is very rare you will find the ramakrishna mission i have kept a flyer that has been published by the beluremot please see that and show it to your friends too how our monks they are giving help to the uttarakhand people this is a hilly terrain hilly region our monk carrying a huge load of things and sitting in a chair and that is a just you know on a road which is a real ropeway just on a rope they're dragging from the other distance other side and he crossing that creek if he falls he will die it's not a simple thing as a young man he left his heart and home he joined the ramakrishna mission and not one so many of them they are going over there and going to the people who are suffering serving them not taking proper care even here people are so cautious they will be taking gloves and all that they are nothing available so directly going and helping them doing like this that what is it karma what type of karma puja through developing or helping other people who are suffering thinking that they are living gods same karma helping me to realize my self that is called claisha karma bhipak purushubi sheisha but look at the bhagavan srirama krishna he is also doing this type of work he is going to viddar sagar why does he care for viddarshagar nothing not at all you see how what he will be telling afterwards he is not caring for the biddashagar but he is visiting with the sagar and all these people because if they are converted into some good ideology hundreds of people will get the benefit that is the reason so here we find that bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling about the atma brahma then he is telling about the bhagavan then ishara then we know about the avatar the incarnation of god in human form in that in different forms it may be but mostly in human form i and my father in heaven are one what is that jesus is telling i and my father in heaven are one i don't know whether all people are understanding this particular sentence of lord jesus this is abu dharr and again he says he who has seen me has seen the father look at it bhagavan siram krishna said whoever will look at this picture will see the god mother also say and this local the present-day people are so clever they have taken the snap photograph of god himself look at the person just like us then if you look at this it's not like the shiva sitting bare body in on the snow itself not like that rather when he used to go out he used to put on the dress properly and used to go out but he is god himself why because the qualities what are the qualities these qualities as we were discussing and sometimes some people if you believe these words of bhagavan siram krishna when he was on the death bed lost almost suffering so much most beloved disciple narendrana in a corner of the room he was standing and observing and what he was thinking just like the pure scientist the researcher he was asking within his mind in this pain can he say that he is god he didn't utter the words he was only thinking immediately the all-powerful god who is residing in the minds of the people immediately said o my nareen he who was the rama he who was the krishna is now in this body so that is the power of god he was god himself then someone was thinking how this god can go now here we find again bhagavan si rama krishna he is telling to vidyasagar that he has some he has given endowed with more power and some with less power sometimes some people will be comparing oh this swamiji is like this and that swamiji is like that i told why you are comparing if you like anyone very good follow his words or otherwise it is of no use wasting your time because god has given different type of power to different people don't compare all people have the specialty particularly the swamis one specialty you must admit that they have left the hearth and home they have lived their own people and accepted an ideology all through their life they are practicing it be some is very eloquent very good speaker some may write nicely some are good looking some are bad looking whatever it may be one thing is very common that is they have great love for srama krishna that is true and if you have the love and respect for the ideology you will love everyone why because of the ideology and if you are loving a person it's difficult there's a possibility of suffering sometimes the person may change we do not know what is going to happen so that is the reason sirama krishna when he said then the viddasagar is telling has he endured some with more power and others with less this is the argument of the communist so-called communist people the god is unjust he has given some people so many many things some people so lays we why we should accept him this is a very bad argument suramar krishna is giving the answer as the all-pervading spirit he exists in all beings be boo in the sanskrit word they say bibhu bibhu means all-pervading and subtle way he is everywhere even in the and the small and that is crawling even in that and also that god is present can you believe it but this is the truth but the manifestation of his power are different in different beings otherwise how can one person put tend to fight that is the manifestation of the power while another cannot face even one and why do all people respect you he's asking with the himself look at this this proves the power of god a person who is countering and answering talking arguing with bidda sagar never attended school so is it not is something special miraculous what is the miracle look at it biddashagar is so humble not just because he was a guest he came okay not like that but the sugar was not that way immediately he would have said now this is wrong here bida sagar he could not answer to him why do all people respect you have you grown a pair of horns everybody started laughing you have more compassion and learning therefore people honor you and come to pay you their respect don't you agree with me look at it is an ignorant is it illiterate how the argument is putting with the saga smile couldn't reply the master continued there is nothing in mere scholarship next step he told viddash that all people are coming because of this quality and again now he's telling the truth he's a real master like a father compassionate father a guide telling you the truth he is telling there is nothing in mere scholarship with the sugar read all books all the scriptures and that's why the object of study is to find means of knowing god and realizing him there are so many people they have already read so many books and one person was doubting swamiji you are in the library do you think you will be able to read all the books then i i told why should i read i will read only one book that is sufficient for me and some of the information that's all what is that one book suramar krishna's gospel what it says be genuine that's all be what you are and pray to god with your tears god i cannot understand you i cannot pray so much i cannot observe so much austerity but i like you love you and i pray please help me to realize you that's all why because he is my father he is my mother why should i not have all this thing on my mother and father i have that relation he is nothing nobody from outside why should i feel shy before my parents sometimes the children they'll be going out and they're all keeping well etcetera suddenly something happened misfortune where do they go to their parents only then again they will go back to the mother to the father and the mother father never said no the door is closed for you they'll say come somehow we'll adjust that is the parents always with compassion and love so one man he is very very aged mother and naturally in the old age people become little uh irritated in little things so she was rebuking sometimes to the uh uh what is called that that and then she told the husband that you have to throw away the mother because she is already old and no use why don't you go and put her in the jungle then man coming back home after so much of work he wanted little peace and regul learned this thing it was so disturbing one day he told her mother mother this is the problem i want peace i cannot leave my wife because this is my family now and you are almost at the end of your life can i take you in the jungle and leave you over there she said well son if you think that that will bring happiness to you it's no problem for me please take but i cannot walk what he will do then he said i will carry you but in the daytime if you carry me other people will see then they will criticize you that wouldn't be so in the dead night you can carry me she was giving telling her her son and even then she was trying to protect the son from the other neighbors bad words criticism and when the sun was carrying that old lady suddenly somewhere there's a stone he stumbled and then the that lady was asking son aru heart you can take little rest so that is the mother always compassionate always compassionate always compassionate and here the god is also the mother of all beings and that is the reason maha sharadamani devi she said whoever will call me as ma mother i cannot turn him back i will accept whatever what he or she is so that is the mother is a very very pure word sometimes some people they use holy mother i say don't use the holy because mother is holy you need not to go and sprinkle the ganges water on ganges the ganges itself is holy so this is the all-pervading spirit everywhere and what they do as the mother was guiding the sun sirama krishna is telling only mayor scholarship owned health what is the significance of the gita now he is telling and everywhere people will be reading gita what is the significance he said only in a half a word he said if you continue to read gita then it will come taggy if you try to say then thank you so this way if you are pronouncing then whole thing that comes like that caitanya was set out on a pilgrimage to southern india one day he saw a man reading the gita another man seated at distance was listening and weeping his eyes were swimming in tears caitanya asked him do you understand all this because he could understand that the sanskrit is impossible for that person to understand so he was wondering he is crying sitting over there and when he is listening the gita the chitanda dev naturally he doubted is he really understanding gita why he was crying then caitanya devin asked him do you understand all this the man said no o revered sir i don't understand a word of the text then why you were crying asked caitanya the devotee said i see arjuna's chariot before me he saw the picture on the gita i see lord krishna and the arjuna seated in front of it talking i see this and i weep what the gita they were reading he was seeing before eyes though he is illiterate and he was thinking how come compassionate the god is he has become the chariot driving the chariot of arjuna who is arjuna comparing with krishna but he is sitting over this in the seat of the driver driving for arjuna so that so this is why does a vigne keep an attitude of love towards god the answer is eye consciousness persists it disappears in the state of samadhi no doubt we'll be reading about the samadhi in the yoga aphorism in the sunday classes we'll be reading even after attending the knowledge this eye consciousness come nobody knows from where so what to renounce krishna said in bengali ami moly if you can eradicate the i the ego you get everything so all the burden will be all those things will be removed you can realize god in whatever form you desire if only the i the ego is removed and so difficult and that's why he is telling first he said only reading scriptures on do and then he is telling the problem is you have to have love for god and how the love will come when your ego goes away once rama asked hanumana how do you look on me then hanumana replied o rama as long as i have the feeling of i i see that thou art the whole and i am a part thou art the master and i am the servant but when o rama i have the knowledge of truth then i realize that thou art i and i am when i feel that consciousness and that's why the jesus said i and my father in heaven are one he is not telling that i am the son many times he said but here he is telling i and my father in heaven are one is not two not the father and the son no two entity one only but how people would understand so they always make jesus is separate god is separate you cannot see god no one can see god so in between god and the jesus there is a holy ghost coming up and down nowadays of course we don't need the holy ghost because the antennas are so powerful we can directly contact with god is it like that no we are so that is called vedanta i am joking but the holy ghost means what holy ghost means i myself and how it becomes my purity and how i become pure when my ego is absent so that is the step-by-step the relationship of master and servant is proper one since this i must remain let the rascal be the god servant the eye is not going so what to do then i have to say i am the servant of god i am the son of god swami vivekananda in one place is telling i am the son of god i i the son of god and that way you have to keep yourself away from all these worldly things so much of attraction so we have to always keep the mind in that label i am the son of god i am the child of god how can i behave like this that consciousness will always be within me and will save me one should constantly remember death this is a very peculiar teaching of bhagavan sirama krishna how many people will understand i do not know he is telling constantly remember the death any time i may die why this is true but we don't like to remember we didn't like to think about that i was sitting in long long back i was sitting in the royal nepal airlines you know nepal some small country poor country they were not having a good aircraft from somewhere secondhand aircraft they purchased and now in the name of royal aircraft so i told oh my god this type of aircraft it may break anywhere then the teacher he was sitting i was in the school so the teacher he was sitting here hey why you are talking like this unless we reach over there don't talk about crashing and breaking i told if i don't even say it may happen and if i say it may not happen but my teacher who was so senior he was afraid of this so this is in the will of god in the hand of god we cannot say anything what is going to happen in the next time so death i am here next moment i may not be there why should i be involved in this the moment you are going to a relative's house you are so good and people are also so happy with you why because they know that you have a return ticket and you know that i have a return ticket why should i be involved in this and if you don't have the return ticket if they come to know that you have come for good you'll see the whole behavior will change this is so practical when you go as a guest to some other astronaut those people who say swamiji you are so good i told because i am a guest so this is because of that so when we are thinking about death what is that i am a guest in this world why should i be involved in this as best as possible i will try to help and i'll try to leave happily and try to make you also happy that's all right but i know i don't belong to this so this way he is going telling uh then with darshan with a smile he was asking bit darshan what is your attitude he said i will tell you someday then forgetting his own self why because of love love for god never caring where he is in the presence of bidda sagar in his house and he started singing who will understand how the goddess kali is what the goddess kali is even the six philosophy systems of philosophy that is shankar this sixth system even they also don't understand if you read one system of philosophy will find the long and so difficult to understand the intricacies but all the sikhs together they won't be able to understand who the kali is ke jaani kali kamoon and this the whole song is there if you want you can read in the english transcription is also there in swami nikhila nandazi's book the gospel of krishna this is a wonderful song and who has written another person who was also the worshiper of goddess kali in a village and how could he write this through realization he has seen this we think the goddess kali means only that no it is the primal power of god what is god god is all pervading god is these god is that all the power that we are reading and all that power as a separate name what is that shakti the shakti means power and that shakti manifest in goddess kali that's why bhagavan sirama krishna is telling whom you call as brahman i call as kali my mother kali is nothing but the brahman but i love to see that brahman all pervading all-powerful in the form of kali so he is singing and last word today we will read visha bhakti chai we want visas the faith and bhakti the devotion these are the only two things those who are really sincere to realize god they realize the atman realize the self only two things are necessary faith tremendous faith in the words of god bhagavan sirama krishna he said this i believe it and then bhakti the moment i believe god then all my devotion comes to him i know god you are somewhere here only my misfortune i cannot see you i cannot realize you i cannot feel you i cannot talk to you and every moment the tears will develop and any moment i may pass god i don't know when i'm going to die so please don't waste time please come to me if that way we pray we need not to study all the six systems of philosophy we need not to see it for meditation we need not to do any worship only two things vishwas and bhakti faith faith in the existence of god faith in the words of the avatar the guru and then devotion and devotion like a child the child loves the mother same devotion and when i'm asking for the god i never care for anything in this worldly things so that is called the secret of success in spiritual life and next tuesday again we will study this portion niranjana foreign is on that's it i think the weekend i will go to dallas the friday and the saturday and saturday night itself i'll come back and then sunday coming sunday the yoga apparitism that i don't think it will be possible because we'll be observing a holy mother's titibuja as you always do in the titi puja the special worship will go on continue for more than one hour and we'll be discussing about holy mother reciting and chanting i'll be singing singing one line and you can sing back like this we will continue and then the prashad will be there after pushpanjali and the next tuesday again there will be 24th december and we will observe the christmas because in the ramakrishna nation it has a very significance the christmas it's not only the christians that they observe are being hindus also we with great devotion we observe because we have great relation particularly the ramakrishna mission that we will discuss we will have very young people to come over here and sing and the music will be there and reading from the bible and all please come and bring your friends and relatives that day and that they
