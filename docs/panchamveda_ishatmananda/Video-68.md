[69. Panchama Veda 69: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOnGKTxGGFM)

again today the 28th we will uh read the gospel of the ramakrishna which we know as pancho veda as usual let us chant from the gospel beginning kobe vidam a giving the answer to some of the very very interesting questions and they were asking is it necessary to have a guru to realize god i am praying to god i am trying to realize god so why should i have to have someone in between then to answer this siram krishna said shachidananda himself is the guru shatt that is the epithets of the brahmana the brahman which is all-pervading the brahman which is all consciousness it is so difficult to understand that that same brahman is the take is taking human form and giving initiation directing the disciples taking a human form as an avatara or a son of god messenger of god is it possible so that naturally the question comes and with that other day we discussed that brahman gunaha brahman accepting the qualities of the maya that is the answer how satchita ananda can which is all pervading consciousness can become a personal god so that to answer that it says actually it took the help of maya maya is god's power and on that maya when it is reflected it says that that is actually issual as a consciousness cannot create consciousness cannot do anything but it is consciousness the moment the consciousness is reflecting on its own power it's called ishwara and the ishara has the capacity to do the things bhagavan sirama krishna is an abathara but more than that he is the ishwara sayam so he had the intention to spread this vedantic thoughts among the present-day human society so they can understand it better and can once again try to realize god and can get peace and harmony can prevail among the divergent people so that is the idea and here it says grita maya gunaha accepting the qualities of the maya brahman as ishwara is creating in bhagavata also that also we discussed the other day in bhagavata we find a wonderful story bhagavata is we quoted from the bhagavata that he took the help of the maya this is a beautiful story that one rishi he is su tapa tapa means austerity is a famous in austerity his name is sutapa and that rishi and his wife is prishni they came to greet god and told if you are happy with our austerities our prayer and if you want to give us a boon please be gracious enough to become our son or send someone like you we want a son like you then the god told okay give me some time and he traveled all the three lokers this is the neither world that means the pataloka then the bri that means the earth and also the heaven after searching all the three worlds the god came back to them and said no adriana on these three in this three loka in these three places i couldn't find anyone shiloh odarjo guno the qualities that i am having these qualities no one is having now it is your prayer and i promise to give you the bone and like me there is no one anywhere so what to do then he said ahami sutto bhabham sutheban i will sutho means the sun i will become your son prishni garbha i will accept the prishni as my mother it is in bhagavata it is very clearly mentioning like this this is a story form but these are the truth the god himself who is all powerful all pervading but at the same time as because he is having all power god can take any form god can go anywhere so this time he came as krishna and is the father and mother the sutapa and they became vasudeva and yasuoda so devaki varsideva and devaki so these two they came in this form and became their father and the mother he who is guru is also the ishta the chosen idol bhagavan srama krishna is telling the guru and the easter are the same why because the god is the guru and god is the easter so all these three are the same the ishta devata is nothing but the guru mostly the teachers in the ramakrishna tradition i don't know other things they teach us that when you are meditating first you be grateful to your guru then you go along with the in the company of your guru to your easter then you see that your easter is merging in the body of the is your guru is merging in the body of your easter and then you are only having easter to meditate upon so the guru actually taking the form of a human being and taking you to the god to the easter and then he is merging in that form of that god and you are meditating on that god so ultimately the guru and the easter are the same so srama krishna is telling he who is guru is also the easter the guru is the thread that leads to the god and that is why we need a guru the question was do we really need a guru to go to god here the answer is you can realize god but guru as a trade as a chain if you are holding a chain and slowly you are proceeding towards the end of the chain you should not think about where we are you are going because you know you are going to the correct direction right direction you know where you are going to reach only thing you have to go on holding that chain and proceed proceed proceed proceed one day you will reach over there that's for sure and system is so simple most of the people do not believe it if they ask you to renounce this thing and do like this and do like that then they think yeah something is going on but when they're telling nothing you have to do you have you can only thing you have to do that in the morning you take god's name in the evening you take god's name that's all so obviously the people think only this much and nothing else so slowly they introduced different type of rituals to the satisfaction of the people and every time but even if you call on god sincere heart once with the tears flowing down sufficient so that is the that you hear again it says hindus have so many gods and goddesses so many gurus so many easter's but all can live together because the teaching prepared them to be broad-minded so that is the secret of hinduism how in india we could survive for thousands and thousands of years with so many varieties because of this teaching and here it says fix your attention on that form shiramakrishna is telling fix your attention on that form of god which appeals to you most look at it the freedom there is no injunction there is no imposition only asking if you like this do this fix your mind on that god which appeals to you most but know for certain that all forms are the forms of one god alone so this is the teaching of bhagavan si ramakrishna i think in the october we are going to attain this time is the first time many of our swamis will go the jansen trees also coming from india the parliament of religions the council for the parliamentary religions as a organization they organize it this time in a big number we are all going many of our devotees are also going we will be having a book show over there like this what is this parliamentary religion that i got an invitation from a group of people from korea they will be organizing here itself in illinois maybe in chicago itself the same bring peace immediately how the peace will come adjustment how the adjustment will come understanding how the understanding will come by knowing the truth and what is the truth here bhagavan si ramakrishna is telling that in the 184 page of the gospel of sirama krishna that published by the new year it says that never harvard malice towards anyone never harvard malice towards anyone so this is a great thing the other day um some of our devotee he was very young man he was joking for something you know the moment uh the other religion it comes and naturally something against them we like to talk just for the fun of it it's true but then i told you we should not tell like this because we are vedantin the followers of srirama krishna we are vedantes and in vedanta everything is inclusive and we cannot say you are not ours that is one thing and secondly we are the followers of srama krishna even by joking we should not hurt others and criticize others they may be bad they may be wrong we may pray for them we should pray for them but within our heart we should not harbor anything against why because that ultimately will ruin the fabrics of hinduism the basic of hinduism so we find here suramar krishna is telling never harvard managed towards anyone among the devotees there was kedar a gentleman whom shirama krishna is to like most and understanding his mental attitude cerama krishna is giving a great certificate he is telling he is very nice many other people are sitting cerama krishna pointed to him and said he is very nice why he is nice he accepts both the absolute and the relative so this is the main thing now many many others either they are telling that there cannot be god in form it must be only without form thousands of years we are fighting whether god is with form or without form among the hindus of course we never fought with arms we only fought with arguments so the dwitavadi and the advaithavadi in between vishishta vadhi also so they we wish to constantly argue now yes ramakrishna is telling he is very nice why because he accepts both absolute and relative now the relative things we cannot say no and absolute is absolute absolute is the truth we cannot say deny it we cannot say no to that also so obviously these are the things that we have to understand then only we can understand hinduism properly whenever people are going over there to the hindu temple and they see any hindu temple they see so many gods and goddesses images huge tomb and so many things when they come over here the first question they ask is it a temple because the only the chairs are here other two three pictures that's all is it a temple and there is no one attending them immediately doing some arti giving them prasad or these are that nothing is there the question comes i told you it's a temple of course it's a temple it's a holy place but there you see the practical thing here you see the absolute thing here we teach the philosophy there they practice that thing in a different ritual form if you understand why they are doing it naturally it will help you but both are same so this is the hinduism absolute and the relative in the ramakrishna mission very peculiar so whenever the devotees come they come with an impression and whenever they will come they will first thing they will ask why thakur is like this so many years old asthma there is no image who is going to do the puja in the image who is going to offer the fruits and all the foods so naturally just you cannot keep the image like that you have to do many things and what is necessary when we got the camera and we got the real picture of the avatar why should we go for the image like this but the impression is this the temple means like it should be like this it should be like that that is the impression but why that's why in the ramakrishna mission if you go to mayavati in himalaya and the name of the assam is advaitastroma established by same swami vivekananda and again this swami vivekananda he travelled the length and breadth of india begging the donation asking donation requesting donation monetary help only to purchase a piece of land and to build a temple in the name of his guru and how much he was humiliated at that time if we read this biography we can understand and these same vivekananda is telling no image or even the photo should be here but both are hindus there in the beluremot if you go every day there is a something some function is going on apart from regular puja one after another programs is going on durga puja kali puja this puja there's puja hey all sorts of puja in advaithasram you cannot burn one incense sticks also restricted why that is also hinduism so the whole gamut of hinduism from the absolute to the relative so when this kedar in those days he understood it and he was very very sincere then sirama krishna is appreciating that he has understood it properly most of the people could not do that then sirama krishna is telling that he believes in brahman but he also accepts the gods and divine incarnations in human form so why he was praising kedar look at his mental attitude he was really blessed person otherwise now only intellectually we are accepting that too is very difficult 100 percent mind we cannot accept that which is formless and same thing is taking the form we always ask question we are little bit confused but here this man in those days he is telling and that srama krishna before everyone he is talking about him he believes in brahman but he also accepts the gods and divine incarnation in human form srima the writer immediately gave a note one line separately he wrote in kedar's opinion sirama krishna was such an incarnation in those days when sudama krishna is a natural you know contemporary people they cannot understand and accept a person who is roaming among us behaving just like us more ordinary than us not having any money no education even can't speak properly he is a little bit stammering is there and pronunciation is just like the villagers he is the navatara how it is possible he is not showing any miracles he is not walking on the ganges rather he is hiring a boat and then traveling and he is not floating in the year he is not fasting for the years together nothing he is doing so ordinary and whoever he meets immediately he will be first to bow down sir please come how are you he will be the first person to tell that so humble so ordinary and he's an avatara many many people never believed it even today many they say is a good person but not an avatar even here i heard i have not seen and one or two temples where they are mentioning about the indian sages and saints there is a picture of sudama krishna but a sadhaka as a holy man trying to realize god they never can believe that he himself is god and how they should understand because of his life his teaching his behavior his knowledge everything that they must have to count then only one has to he is a very good doctor and what type of doctor he only refers whoever goes to him he will say go to him go to that he is not treating at all so how can you understand that he is the doctor so doctors should be proving that they can analyze the thing and can understand and can cure then there is a doctor in the cerama krsna's life we find whoever is coming his judgment is very very correct and there he is excelling everyone about krishna that swami vivekananda is telling in kedar's opinion srirama krishna was such an avatara incarnation and in the bhagavad-gita in the 9th chapter 11th sloka it says abujananti ma supreme lord of all this that exists and i am in the form of a human being roaming over here mura muda means the fools that they cannot understand at all abujananti maam muda the fools without an understanding of my higher nature as the supreme lord of all that exist disregard me manifest in human form disregard me who is telling krishna long back shri krishna and he showed so many miracles right from his childhood days we all know those who have read the biography the life of sri krishna in the bhagavata and others we know so so so many miracles he showed supernatural power his maternal uncle kamsa wanted to kill him he sent so many powerful people but nothing they could do no harm even before the eyes of many many people he came he and his brother almost the same age one year difference balarama and krishna and they killed the very powerful people who were engaged by the kamsa to kill them at ease even then this story was known by everyone even then they used to doubt him so naturally he is telling abhojananti mam mura manushim tanumasitam the moment you have taken the human form is very very difficult to understand and it says that the christ is telling the moment you understand this you are blessed why only he can understand who has raised his mentality mind in that level otherwise it is impossible when all others are telling she is or he is very great and we are all going and wrong they are in good number just going because the crowd is going in the long back and sometimes at the college students just to play the prank in the calcutta streets the people are full of curiosity and lot of people suddenly one will start shouting and he will tell his friends also to do as he is doing he will put his finger like that to the sky and as if there is something very special all of them will be looking at the sky with all curiosity will you believe immediately hundred people will be around like what is there what is there what is there you see they are all seeing very carefully oh yes something is passing something is happening this people have already left engaging them to only gazing in the simple sky clear sky imagining something is going on so this is the ordinary people wherever you go there is the good number all other people will also go but that doesn't prove that he or she agreed so about have to understand avatara in a different way how by practicing spirituality in such a way so that you can feel that he is really an avatar a great person now kedar he's a householder even then his practices his life is so pure and so high that srama krishna before everyone giving this certificate christ told he who has seen the son has seen the father father means the god the christ is to call father god as father who we have seen the son who is the son christ has seen the father how so that is the question people should understand what is god bhagavan sirama krsna said seeing abutara is seeing god seeing abutara is seeing god when you are seeing an avatar he is god what is the conception of god so that is the thing most of us we do not know so naturally the confusion and naturally superimposition of different type of thoughts the god means he must be very very tall when he is standing over here his head is touching the sky and must be at least four hands must be these must be there all supernatural things must be there why not normal the moment that god says i like to eat food oh my god he is no he cannot be the god that same thing happened in the life of lord buddha in the coming sunday we are going to discuss about lord buddha when he was practicing without any food then some other people they came around oh it's a great yogi he doesn't take anything you know great you the buddha failed that he cannot even sit straight because he became so weak so he went and started taking some fruits and water immediately they left him telling that he has fallen from the itunes because he's taking food and when the not only food the fruits he also took the porridge that rice and then he realized that god and became buddha he came back then all these five they became his first disciples so people they don't understand and buddha he was very kind-hearted so he went to them first because they were his companion the beginning so he went there so that is a different story the seeing avatara is seeing god how can you do like things like that because all the great qualities good qualities the best qualities that we can conceive we can imagine all we find in that abhotara or the son of god or any person having those qualities and sri krishna in the bhagavad-gita 16th chapter fast 3 sloka 26 qualities he is mentioning if one can have those qualities is god himself so here then sirama krishna is telling believing in abhothara is a sign of pure complete knowledge so the knowledge the moment we talk about knowledge we know those who are followers of vedanta knowledge means brahma mitta but here cerama krishna says they are having a complete knowledge why the same brahman who is absolute can also become the relative in this world so shankaracharya he is accepting this suramar krishna's guru the great tortapuri he was not ready to accept in the beginning then something happened in his life he was feeling terrible the stomach pain it is it was so severe he wanted to commit suicide it was so severe pain he went into the ganga and he found the whole ganga he almost crossed from this side to calcutta side and there was everywhere needed water in that ganga needed water so obviously when he was shouting what is this miraculous thing then suramar krishna told you are not accepting the power of god you only believe the god without form and consciousness but the same consciousness when doing all these things all around creating the world and having the leela that too you must have to accept you and if you are not accepting those things that means it is incomplete he wanted to help his guru to complete his knowledge that's why he did all this so that is the cerama krishna in the bhagavad-gita again about the avatara and difficulty to understand sri krishna said naham prakash sarvasya yogo maya sama again he says yoga maya the maya is it deluding the mind of the people they are so intelligent and they think they are intelligent and that is the problem the moment they start thinking that i am intelligent i can understand everything you know for sure the maya is having the total possession over that mind so naham prakash sarvasya in sanskrit the filthiest word that they could use is the mura below that they could not so mur this is very special word ajam i never take birth but again it says i am taking the human form and if you don't understand that you are a mural but sir you are taking birth and again you are taking telling that you are ajam you don't take birth how come so this is a different total different discussion shankaracharya in the bhagavad-gita he has given this explanation eva eva means azif it's not real but as eve when you see the reflection of the sun in that water just like sun but it is evil as if it is not the real sun the similarly when we find that see that god is behaving like this it is as if the when sirama krishna was having that throat pain and he was suffering he was he became so weak that even people had to help him to change his bed and go somewhere the sudama krishna one day that srirama krishna in that condition one day masarada devi saw running and crossing the field and coming back again in that speed and lying down again when the mother surprised asked him is it you then immediately he told you have seen don't tell anybody evil everything that is happening is evil one of his direct disciples who was not that way educated he was not having the school education and when he said it is all his drama you someone say ramakrishna is suffering everybody is concerned about that and then he said and told all his drama sriram krishna turned to him and said he has understood it he has understood it that means the real god cannot have all these things but the god is behaving in that way as if that i am also just like you even then in this type of condition when i am dying having so much of pain i can remember god all the time and whoever comes near me i always talk about god and nothing else god intoxicated mentality so next we find that sirama krishna it was friday march 9 1883 1886 left his body at his 83 just three years two and a half years before suramar krishna is talking with the devotees god alone exists and all else is unreal see the same the brahman alone exist everything that you see is unreal brahma jagan mitha the same thing sirama krishna is telling and again at the same time he is adding the divine mother has kept all deluded by her only one thing is truth only that truth is there brahma-satya but why we can't understand that because god's power that is called maya is deluding us why when the question was asked he will find that he is asking sir why god has put us in this world why he is keeping us in this world we are all suffering the answer will find sirama krishna is giving it is his divine spouse he has created all this we what we are is also god the god has created all these then he entered in different names and form and then he is playing sometime as a good person sometimes a bad person so this is divine sports divine leela it is the whole thing is nothing but the divine drama but we have to understand that and that is possible when we take away our mind totally then only it is possible otherwise not those who are in the game playing they cannot understand where the mistakes are and but the outside those people who are sitting the spectators when they see they shout oh you should not do like that like this so those who are watching can understand but those who are in the game they cannot so you have to take your mind out from the game though you are very much in the game and that is what shankaracharya said jivan mukti jivan mukti sukhaprafti means freedom freedom from where bondage what are the bondage this maya what is that maya i me all these feelings then you and me that comes from the maya so this is where srama krishna is telling the god alone exists and all else is unreal but divine mother has kept all deluded by harmaya look at men most of them are entangled in worldliness so majority of the people he is telling the truth and naturally he is telling in such a way many people may not like it but is sugar-coated words it is not possible for them to tell so he is keeping the truth before you and now what we have should do we understand that this is my situation my condition and from here i have to go that is the truth but this is my condition well let me try from here i cannot just now i cannot say as surama krishna is telling it is not possible and that mistake did by the buddhism to some extent they completely said that the whole world is misery whoever will be in this will suffer wrong because they are not feeling the sufferings they're enjoying it sometimes the elderly people sitting in a circle in a in a shaded place when they see the young people of playing in the open field in the scorching sun they feel how can they be there suffering they are not at all suffering they are enjoying that game in that scorching sun is a joy for them but when i feel that they are suffering it's not they are not suffering i think that scorching sun and i am burning under that and why with a ball simply running here and there but they are enjoying it and i when i saw these two little boys staying over here it was snowing even then the two brothers they are playing i stood over there i observed and i was thinking oh my god what they are doing they will suffer because in the cold and these things but they are enjoying at my age i am cautious i am thinking that that is not good but at their age it is not so the people who have understood the foley the unreality of this world for them sirama krishna is telling look at these people most of them are entangled in worldliness then one person is asking the question and surama krishna again continued the truth is that no one seeks god that we can understand and we understand this very well truth is that no one seeks god there are people who eat the prickly leaves of the pineapple and not the fruit that in the pineapple is very difficult you have to you should know how to clean then only you can eat like the mango or the apple if we straightway go and bite then obviously you are hurting yourself you should know it in the world also seems something like that only the cover they are eating but below that inside that this beautiful taste is there that suramar krishna is pointing out one devotee is asking a question said why has god put us in the world this is a very good question see all we are suffering is because we are here and who has kept us god why he has kept us stealing the world is the field of action karma bhumi in the mahabharata it says karma bhumi karma means the action and what is the action now is the wonderful way in the hindu philosophy it says action and reaction no one is giving you misery you are suffering because of your past actions so sudama krishna is one line he said it is a world is the field of action why this action because my desire where the desire comes became from my action so it goes on like this when i am doing something bad the bad result is coming and obviously that is driving me to something and again i am committing some mistakes again the punishments are coming so this reformation the centers as they call nowadays all these jails now it is all reformation houses what reformation you go and take the record again and again they're coming back for recording and when they are coming again another they were only a little ordinary person did some little mistake and now in coming in contact with the bigger people with much knowledge about these bad things they get inspiration guidance help and they go on in that fashion it goes action reaction chain so that is the world is the field of action that's why sirama krishna when he is advising us in the very beginning of the gospel he told the four steps to realize god first and foremost you have to go to a holy person and know what is truth shadhu sangha the first and foremost you must know what is truth then nirjan vasa then you have to take yourself out from that and quietly you have to think what i am doing is it good is it correct am i on the right track and slowly slowly you have to rectify yourself i have to proceed because this is in your hand only your thinking naturally the god's help will come i want to do something good i want to be good i want to be good only prayer and from every corner all good thoughts and the blessings of the great souls all will encourage you and slowly slowly one day we will find that i can do it i can come out of this bondage so here it says the nerjan bar and then bichara i have to understand myself fast what is my condition i am simply seeing somebody over there if i try to emit it that will be a blunder i should not do that i know my condition so from this condition let me slowly improve and when i am trying to improve how i can improve giving the best thoughts the most of the time the early morning i'm getting up and doing little japa taking the name of god then reading some good books then doing little physical exercise to keep my body fit then again coming and taking the flu some breakfast and again that time i am going through some of the good lines some good books like that constantly if we can give good thoughts the bad thoughts won't be there when there is no thoughts there is no action and when there is no action and thoughts the result is always purifying so karma bhumi this world gives us this opportunity and swami vivekananda said you are the maker of your own destiny constantly you have to go on thinking it is not possible to think constantly on a higher spiritual level impossible no one can meditate 24 hours so obviously where we will keep our mind ma sharda mani devi in a very simple way she is telling what is tapasha we talk about tapas tapas tapas about the spiritual austerity what is that austerity only somehow keeping your mind at the feet of god look at it so simple solution only somehow when i'm all alone doing some or work ordinary work if i am singing the song of god when i'm walking maybe on a machine and i am thinking i am going towards the omar not and amarnath is 11 kilometer i have to reach over there and today i have covered one kilometer tomorrow and every time you are walking instead of looking at that how much i am walking if you just think that we are reaching towards home or not so there in nowadays in the youtube all those pictures are available how the roads are you can just think and that way you are keeping your mind at the feet of omar not and when you reach over omar not then you were going and taking the bath and with the fresh clothes you are coming so many other devotees are also there from one corner you are going looking at the god and thanking him that you have reached over there where you are in omar not physically you are here but mentally you are with god and that is called karma and there is a great karma and those who were there already in the amarnath itself may be doing some business or some other things they don't think about god at all they think about how many people are coming and how much collection i can do today so who is actually going to god mine so note that every time we have to physically go to all these places it is necessary to go physically why so that i can understand it but if i can't just by seeing the pictures if you see the picture inside the room of dakshinesha takur the thakur is sitting over there he is sitting keeping his feet on the floor and going and prostrating and then touching his feet and sitting at his bow so near to then he's talking with greesh goes master masai i am just sitting over there where you are in the company of sirama krishna how mentally what is that karma again the work what type of karma tapasya so according to the definition of mas arudhamani devi we can always do this tapasya if we can have sadhu-sanga what is the sadhu-sanga reading the gospel reading the books by holy mother so that we can learn these things and then we can apply these things the world is the field of action through action one acquires knowledge the guru instructs the disciple to perform certain works and refrain from others look at it that is the job of the guru when he sees that something is going wrong but he must say without any reservation if i say like this they may be angry with me they should no that is not the job of the guru and not good or bad you must help because you love so that is once swami sardananda ji maharaj his disciple came he was a rich man and naturally little egoistic person other people who came they were poor people he entered into the room when maharaja is talking with those people and he shouted hey get up get up get up go away i have to talk with swamiji the important talk is there you go away you used to donate a lot in those days ramakrishna poor so he thought the guru will be happy and he had that capacity right to do that all these ordinary people sitting with the guru i'm a special man immediately sardar nandaji who was very famous for his calmness reacted very rough way and asked him to go away from his out of his sight and ultimately at the end of his life he understood why guru behaved like that he could not forget those words and the face of his guru he was going on meditating just by remembering his guru slowly slowly his mind became purified and he understood the true meaning of it and he became so humble so this way also blessings comes so here again he advises the people to perform action without desiring the result the impurity of the mind is destroyed through the performance of duty impurity is destroyed by performing some actions we have seen some of the people they go house to house begging one rupee or five rupees collecting fund param krishna mission and they will walk miles after miles why to save some money so that type of people also we have seen and by that way surely their mind in mind is becoming purified so why should i ask i am also a some person over here how he will feel he is not thinking in that way constantly he is thinking i am collecting these for the sake of god's work and this thought slowly steadily purifying the mind whether he or she understands it or not the action is sure to bring the result the impurity of the mind is destroyed through the performance of duty it is like getting rid of the disease by means of medicine under the instruction of a competent physician the guru is the physician he told you should do this you should not do that so under the competent position as we take the medicine with complete faith he said you take these things you must take those with complete faith he knows it better similarly when the guru is instructing why doesn't god free us from the world then his reply was he will free us when the disease is cured so again a little bit of repetition today i have done because they're very important and our class was long back so naturally we forgot so very very important words thank you for coming is mama namaste the coming sunday we will discuss about the buddha's life and his teaching to perform the buddha jayanti in our own way the buddha saranam and friends you must have received most of you those who are having your address email address with us that belmont has started the relief work through the
