[319. Panchama Veda (319) - “Sir, What is Ekaangi Prema.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0v3dlUmNvc)

namaskar dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening we'll be studying the panchama veda and the gospel of krishna and we'll be discussing about the bhakti and the beautiful question that girish chandra ghosh asks to bhagavan srirama krishna and he asked what is ikangi prema ikangi we will come to that let us begin with this in our previous discussion we have read that bhagavan sri ramakrishna they're concluding by saying the discussion was going on the two days we have discussed on the incarnation of god and the reincarnation theory etc and he is concluding there by saying that the incarnation of god belonged to the class of the another terminology that he used is sharakoti and different type of jivakoti and isharakarti the that means the ordinary self and divine self these divine selves they come of their own they are not bound what is the bondage again and again we have to remember we have to go on remembering the bondage means desire desire for the worldly objects that is bondage when i am desiring to realize god that is not bondage the bondage means the desire for the worldly objects and what are the worldly objects five different objects are there so by by seeing by hearing by touching by testing by smelling this way we can understand the five different organs are going and enjoying the five objects these five objects are the causes of bondage any all of these or any one of it if we are having some attraction some desire to have it then it is in bondage again bondage means again you have to come and take the birth and we are not sure whether it will be the human birth or not so obviously the uh they say the spiritual people the hindus the sanatanapanti they say you better go beyond the circle of birth and death how withdrawing the all these desires how do we draw the desires by understanding that these are all temporary this is the processes this and there we find in the jivas a group of people who are living in this world they're just like us they're also eating they're also sleeping they're also talking they're also moving but they're not bound by any desire they are called ishara koti the ishwara koti about them ramakrishna is telling the incarnation of god belong to the class of the isharakurtis incarnation of god the god himself has desired to take a form and there is no desire for the worldly objects the only desire is to help the people to guide the people to go towards the right track so that they also can go out of the circle of birth and death they roam about in the open space they are never imprisoned in the world never entangled by it their ego is not the thick ego of the worldly people the ego the i conscious of the worldly peoples like four walls and the roof the four walls and the roof the story the reference is the previous discussion there is nothing no space to go out so some people are eye consciousness that is the ego the terrible ego but if we try to analyze what is this ego we will never find it this is the very peculiar thing each and every one is constantly going on telling when they become the five uh the the years or the six or seven years old from their eye this is me this i am reading i am drawing this is my father that is my mother all i they all slowly they become so attached and the more we grow up in age the more we become attached to the this worldly things then i am an educated person i have this i am from this university there also again the same education but this university is best university so i belong to that so that is also another type of ego so this different type of egos are there but actually to whom that is the question and there comes the spirituality the moment you stop and turn back and try to see who am i the before i was born where i was and who i was after my death what is going to happen to me all these certificates what they are going to do with this some of the people close to us will maybe they will protect it for some days and then everything will go away even then we are so very attracted attached to this some people will look at me they will talk about me they will write to me my followers my followers nobody is following anyone only as little the passion that much so friends here and now we have to understand that everything that we see temporary the people who are supporting me are also temporary they support that they're all the expression of love also temporary okay that much but if we live only for that that is called bondage we need food we need a shelter we need clothing we need all the company we need society but that doesn't mean that we have to be bound by only all these this much religion is nothing but understanding this much swami vivekananda said religion is realization what is the realization this the moment we realize that we are free now there is a group of souls they come to help the god to demonstrate to the ordinary people to ordinary souls who are bound that even living in this world without the attachment of anything of this world we can survive that is called isharakoti they come and and bhagavan sri ramakrishna is telling incarnation of a god is also of that great of that stage of ishara kotis they are never bound by these devotees listen breathlessly to these words about the mystery of divine incarnation who has created this universe we all say all religion all faith all philosophy god has created by something it has okay we can call it god you can call it any name now here we say the sanatana the vedavadhi or we can say hindus we believe that it is all temporary we are unnecessarily attracted to this and we have to go back now how we will understand we need an example god himself comes in the form of a human and lives with us he's also growing up along with us then we find he is doing everything without attachment and that is called incarnation and we also try to understand and i see that every time every moment that person is so happy so happiness is the goal of human life we forget that we think to become a someone in the society to reach man in the society with all of wealth that that is the goal no that is not happiness is the goal i am so rich fabulously rich but i am not happy then what is the fun of becoming rich person i am highly respected but the moment i become alone in my room when i close the door and there is no one around i'm a miserable one because i'm unhappy what is that life then so what is the goal of human life happiness and what is this happiness god god is the source of all happiness that's why bhagavan si ramakrishna said the goal of every human being is to realize god and what is that god happiness mastar damani devi said the same thing in a different way if you want peace my child do not find fault with others there is a great teaching but we are at fault so we have to rectify ourselves unnecessarily we are going on pointing to others but it is our fault and but what is the goal peace happiness again the bliss joy so we have to go to that in this gospel of sudama krishna that we are reading in every page every time bhagavan suramar krishna that supreme god incarnated as sri ramakrishna and he was born in 1836 passed away in 1886 within these 50 years he gave us complete idea what is religion how to practice religion and what is the goal of religion what happens after realization of that goal now let us read in another chapter that begins from today the master as the houses of balarama and girish those who are following the gospel of sirama krishna those who have read the gospel of sudama krishna you are known with these two personalities one is the balaram bush and another girish chandra gosh the bosh and kosh so this balarama and girish they are not brahmin so to say but both of them one was both of them were very very devoted both of them reached to that highest point of devotion so this bosh and ghost balarama bush and girish chandra ghosh the bhagavan sirama krishna is visiting their houses god is visiting the house of the devotee think of it the devotee is constantly praying and now the god is coming in the form of bhagavan si ramakrishna it was friday april 24 1885. master mahashaya he is mentioning about one o'clock in the afternoon aim that means the master merchant arrived at balarama's house in calcutta it is in the bhagbaja locality those who know calcutta is a very big city now and it in the northern part of the city is very famous is called bhagbajar and there the master came and he found the master asleep in the drawing room one or two devotees resting near him aim began to fan the master gently so this is the devotee the devotee is supposed to serve and serve the service that he is rending or she is renting without any expectation just out of love the other devotees are there they are also resting maybe sleeping lying down nearby if you have visited that balaram mandir where to take rest now it has become the shrine it's a long it's a big hall and the people they used to lie down noon time and summer time and naturally they should digressed master masha he was a teacher so it was a recessed time in his school so he came running over there he saw the bhagavatama krishna sleeping he took the fan and he was going on fanning so the summer time my teacher will be happy and he will he can sleep so that he is giving the service that is called devotee a devotee always consider himself blessed by giving some services in exchange in nothing only i like to give the service the master masha is gently doing it a few minutes later sudama krishna woke up and sat on the bed with his clothes in a rather untidy condition aim saluted him and took the dust of his feet master tenderly to aim friends we have to understand here the master bhagavan sirama krishna the god himself showing his tenderness love affection to a devotee why because of his devotion because of his service so here and we should learn we should learn to become like the master mahashay humble very capable very intelligent but at the same time very humble and always ready to serve are you well i'm feeling rather uneasy i have a sword in my throat i suffer very much during the early hours of the morning can you tell me how maybe i may be cured and just like a little child he was asking they served pickled mango with the meal i ate a little of it because he was having the developing slowly that the throat problem and that he was feeling uneasy little painful so he was talking with his devotee but he was the god himself when he is in the body he is behaving just like a very humble a little child as if so friends we have to understand when the god is coming in the human form he bears like human but that human is so simple and he's the open book he's not hiding anything he's not trying to show anything there is no show up no hypocrisy at all those who are really trying to become spiritual must be very careful about it majority of the people that we see in this world in the name of religion we see they are showing off the otherwise they are something and they will be presenting themselves like the actor actresses it should not be it should be simple the original this is when you read the gospel of course there are great teachings that there practices are there but at the same time when we are reading the simple line like this the masama krishna he is sleeping and then he when he got up with clothes were not that way proper he is not careful about that too and he is also discussing that i'm having some pain i can't eat properly nowadays and everything that he he's not hiding anything this is the simplicity and how is your wife i noticed the other day that she said she was looking rather sickly give her soothing drinks to keep her knobs cool master wives ah she that as we can understand was little mentally was disturbed so suramar krishna observed and talking to the master aim green coconut milk say master yes a drink made of sugar candy is also good the suramar krishna he is giving a talk in this way since last sunday i have been living in our house with my parents m is mentioning the then master rama krishna oh you have done well it will be convenient for you to leave at home since your parents sleep there you won't have to worry so much about your family the the wife and the children they are there but the elderly ah the parents are also there they will be taking care so here we find that he is also concerned about the that devotee also their family how they he'll be happy so this is the way we always find the bhagavan krishna helping his devotees while srama krishna was talking his mouth became dry he said to aim like a child i feel a dryness in my mouth do you all feel like that that way so he is comparing so this discussions are going on balarama when he heard he said let me get a jam rule for you it's a type of fruit that has a very wonderful juice so that may be that that will help too is going on drinking water but that is not helping so maybe that fruit can help surama krishna immediately you don't have to go out in the sun is the summer time was still fanning the master master you may stop now you have been fanning a long time the m the master mahasha i am not tired sir then bhagavan sirama krishna tenderly no so when we find these when you are reading this and if you close your eyes and try to imagine it is a vivid description of what is going on the surama krishna is sitting like that and the master master is fanning this type of discussion is going on as if there is nothing spiritual but have you noticed there's so much of care the god has for this devotee love affection for his devotee this is spirituality the spirituality has nothing to do with any selfishness there is no self pure love only that's why he is concerned about his wife that is he is happy that his parents are there to look after his wife and children so this person will be little free he can go and attend his work and can come to dakshinesha to get the company of the holy people so he is happy in that way also at the same time when they are fanning he is concerned so we can understand that god is concerned about us and if we are genuine if we are sincere so he is going on talking like that sirama krishna sri ramakrishna you will be going to visit the another house that is the devotee stealing aim school closed at four o'clock he came back to balarama house and found the master sitting in the drawing hall the devotees were arriving one by one the younger noreen ram came narendra too was there aim saluted the master and took a seat master mahashay he came at the time of lunch break again he went back attended his duty as a teacher again he is coming and joining after the school hour is over and he is giving now the description who else are coming and joining the master narendra 2 was there aim saluted the master the lady sent the plate of halwa for the ramakrishna because the the sword in his throat he could not eat any hard food master to narendra ah this is nice stuff eat some it's good eat some we know the love for the narendra bhagavatam krishna had a great love for the narendra dusk was coming on sri ramakrishna was about to go to the house of girish who had arranged a festival to celebrate the master coming the master came down from the second floor to second floor of balarama's house with aim and a few other devotees near the gate he saw a beggar chanting the name of rama and he stood still he fell into meditative mood and remained standing a few minutes he said to him he sings well a devotee gave the beggar for paisa a devotee means this master master himself he is hiding his incognito sometimes he is mentioning a devotee sometimes aim sometime master sometime mahendra and different way but this is thus immediately he understood krishna like that person and the beggar who is singing the name of sri rama and not only that when he was taking the name of sri rama shirama krishna the god standing over there in a meditative mood listening to the song of rama friends most of our astramas and many places we organize the holy and kirtanas the songs in praise of the god we just sing over there do we believe that god is listening to that see here and when we sincerely sing god really listen to that and he becomes happy so these are the traits of the devotees i feel in that way so when we are devotee we believe that god is there and when we do anything for god god is accepting that when we are reading when we are talking when we are singing when we are discussing about god he's present he's listening and sometimes he's happy this is the way if we understand then we'll understand that our devotion is truly getting a former shape otherwise we think oh this is the gospel i have to read so i'm just reading a few pages not like that each and every word if you are reading properly will feel god is there a beggar is singing a song and suramar krishna came he liked that somebody gave some money to that beggar that's all no the beggar sang the song that touched the heart of the god himself and who that god rama himself he who was rama he who was krishna in this body bhagavan sirama krishna said he was the ego free person when he said that it carries a long meaning it's true and that sri rama in the form of ramakrishna is listening that someone is singing in the praise of sri rama he liked it and the beggar is also really very lucky person them gave the money sri ramakrishna entered bosh bara lin bhushparalyn still it is there in that northern side of the calcutta and he is laughing he said to aim what are these people saying there comes paramahamsa's battalion when the sudama krishna used to go to that area very frequently and whenever he used to go he would be naturally walking and many people following the other people these two cut jokes those who are not liking not knowing properly they used to say the forge for which means the battalion of a soldier so battalions are coming soon krishna remember that and so many people following suramar krishna all they are going to girish chandra house so he is remembering that and mentioning there comes paramahamsa's battalion sidhama krishna entered giri's house the latter had invited a large number of devotees to join the festival many of them were present they all stood up to receive the master who smiling took his seat the devotees sat around him among them were girish muhimacharan ram and babanat also baburam narendra jogin yanga narin chuni balaram aim and other devotees who had accompanied the master from balarama's house the group were already waiting in girish house and from balarama house also they came so all devotees are constantly getting the company of bhagavan's ramakrishna and they are all blessed people they are coming to this place and together they are seating now see how sirama krishna is slowly training them up master to mahima charan mahima charan was a great scholar we all know i said to girish about you there is one very deep you are only knee deep now you must help me check up on what i said somewhat the girish and mahima charan trilock if you remember in the the previously used we we were reading girish had a discussion with trilocka about the incarnation of god and today mahima charan another great scholar that means girish was wild red person of course he was a very good debater so suramar krishna wanted to listen the what actually they consider what is incarnation what is these how these people are thinking so he asked mahima charan now girish is also there one is very deep another knee deep now i like to know whether my assessment are good or not correct or not so you have to start the debate kirishan mahima charan started their discussion soon rama said let them stop let us have some kirtan ram chandra he was a doctor ramchandra dutta he was a relatives of swami vivekananda also and then he he was a good devotee but he used to feel that i am a doctor educated and well established person in the society so he used to sometimes some devotees are like that they'll be trying to guide the other things in the astra srama krishna is presence ramakrishna wanted to listen to the discussion and he said no stop that rather let us have some the songs now the sudama krishna is replying he said to rama no no this has a great deal of meaning this has a great deal of meaning sometimes some people they say swamiji in america and europe all the ramakrishna mission astronauts which are known as the vedanta societies what is their work they only give some talks that's all they're arranging some the conversation or the debate or seminar or they themselves are going and joining the seminar that much work but we like to donate for those who are in the india are the poor countries like bangladesh nepal and those our money should go to them and to serve them that's good idea but at the same time this philosophical discussion to make people aware about the truth that is also a great service giving the food to the hungry people and giving the clothings and giving them education serving them with medicine they're of course good but they're all temporary and when you give after some time again they need it but when you can remove the ignorance from the mind of people it has a great impact and majority of the people if they can understand the religions are nothing but the different paths going to the same god who is nothing but love and unselfishness majority of the people if they come to know about it think about it the whole society will change human society the human society will change the leaders where from they are coming from the society and when they are young when they are coming to know about it slowly growing up into that in the schools in the colleges in the social functions in the churches in the synagogues in the mosque and temples when all are talking about it and we are being educated in that way the different paths only we are following different culture because of the geographical divisions and different features because of that climatic divisions but actually we are all one so that way if we learn think of that day that is the goal of human society the god is coming down to this earth taking the human form and teaching that only again and again the great souls philosophers they're coming teaching that only the oneness but we again take up that and make a different package it is my religion my god my holy book my way of giving it to others and i want majority of the people to follow me it is not god's it is the person who is trying to give that that is the difference the bhagavan sirama krishna he has come to this earth the god himself has come to this earth has taken the form of sudama krishna and giving this teaching and here he is mentioning the debating is also necessary suramar told chandra he told this dr ramchandra he was mentioning that we need to sing and increase our devotion but sirama krishna is mentioned no no this has a great deal of meaning this philosophy this discussion this publishing of the articles this is also essential they are english men english men means modern people english men means modern people bhagavan cinema krishna used this word and a few in other places the modern people how they are thinking how they want to establish their ideas what are the views that he wanted to know i want to hear what they say muhimacharan contended that all could become krishna by means of sadhana now here see mahima charan he was a scholar he read many scripture and he felt in this way anyone can become krishna krishna the god in the fore and incarnated as krishna giri said that sri krishna was an incarnation of god however much a man practiced sadhana he could never be an incarnation bhagavan sriram krishna supported this view we can get liberation but an ordinary jiva can never become an incarnation god himself is taking a form how the jiva can be like that from the point of view of the vedanta advaita vedanta it's completely different so we should not mix up that this is a different view this is god is there and jiva is there the god has created this world and this jivas individual selves now these individual selves among them the human being those who have god by the grace of god and for by their good karma the human birth and with an intellect a clear understanding this world is so temporary i need permanent happiness i have tried everything now i must try to follow the path of religion where i can get the permanent happiness joy please no i am going towards that that is called god realization but to become god himself is little difficult so this is the viewpoint the master the mahima is telling do you know what i mean let me give you an illustration the bail tree can become a mango tree if only the obstructions are removed it can be done by the practice of yoga girish you may say whatever you like but it cannot be done either by the practice of yoga or by anything else only shri a krishna can become a krishna if anybody has all the attributes of another person radha for instance then he is none other than that person rather herself so that is so we have to understand this viewpoint he's telling when you are thinking that it is like that like a drop of water falling in the ocean it becomes ocean and there is no separation so this is the way sometimes the people they try to say mix merging with the complete that consciousness but when the god realization they say this is a duit of harvard god is separate there we can go near to god we can live near to god like that there are seven stages are there we can but to becoming god it is not possible for the ordinary givers that is the viewpoint of the girish but he is telling no we can there's a mixing up of the duita and advaita so they are asking in this way mahima charan could not argue well at last he had to accept girish views mahima to girish yes sir both views are right god has wield the path of knowledge he has also wield the path of bhakti mahima was talking from the point of view of knowledge girish was also talking from the point of view of bhakti devotion so this is the difference this hinduism this is the beauty the different type of views are accepted all are correct now swami vivekananda very nicely put this he said we are traveling from lower knowledge to higher truth lower truth to higher truth not from error to truth no if it is either completely to truth it will be difficult it is not possible it may be that i know this much only so he said that suppose a man looking at the sun standing on the earth he's looking at the sun his idea about the sun is also correct but a person sitting on the airplane looking at the sun will be different from this person and the person who is in that rocket outside the orbit of the earth looking at the sun their experience will be completely different but all the three experiences are correct from three different standpoints so traveling from lower truth to higher truth here also the two different viewpoints we find one from the knowledge and the from the devotion the mohimacharan accepted and then he said he has also he has also willed the path of bhakti and pointing to surama krishna he said as he says by different paths people ultimately reach one and the same goal the master assigned to mahima you see what i said was right wasn't it so mahima was a scholar the sudama krishna what he said all paths are leading to the same goal mahima accepted srama krishna again confirmed are you accepting isn't it and that is correct so we should not fight you know hundreds and thousands of years the people fought on these the gyana and the bhakti the loggerhead these two fight each other they will never accept each other's views but both are going to the same goal in their own way there is the mahima is telling yes sir as you say both paths are right master pointing to girish haven't you noticed how deep his faith is he forgot to eat his refreshments like a dog he would have torn your throat if you hadn't accepted his view but we have enjoyed the discussion then he is telling that is the humbleness you too have known each other and i myself have learned many things the god is so humble and so simple he is mentioning in this way the musician arrived with his party and sat in the middle of the room he was waiting for a sign from sri ramakrishna to begin his kitten the master gave his permission rama to the master please tell them what to sing master ramakrishna what shall i suggest after a little reflection well let them sing the prelude to the union of radha and krishna friends those who are aware about these in the may be that today we may not be able to reach to that i'll try the radha and the version of samaj and here the jibatma and the paramatma and the play is going on the jibatma is attracted to paramatman paramatma is hiding and tasting so that is as if a conjugal love a lady and a gentleman as if attracted to each other they like to come together there are so many other hindrances of the society what the people will think etc etc all that is but it is not worldly love it is divine love radha is nothing but a heart of a devotee pure devotee and the songs are going on we will escape these songs one after another is going on krishna he stood up in a state of unconsciousness and went into deep samadhi when he heard ah the blessed name of krishna full of sweetness when in that song that they were singing like that the krishna himself was listening to that song and with the devotion when they sang it touched the heart of god and that god in the form of that krishna in the form of ramakrishna went into samadhi again and again i am mentioning i like to tell it to myself and to you too that the when we sing the devotional songs god listens and if we can truly sing understanding the meaning of it with full emotion and love and his prayerful heart the god will surely listen to that the surama krishna after hearing that he went into samadhi and again srama krishna went to samadhi when they they were continuing see how all nodia is shaking under the waves of gauranga's love gauranga mahaprabhu he was almost 500 400 or 50 or the 500 years before sirama krishna he brought the love and that though he was the dasami sampradaya sannyasi but he introduced the path of love devotion gorilla version of sampradaya and he introduced radha the love for god as if a lady loving god a human as a gentleman so like that so he's listened to that song he went into the samadhi now talking about the hasra narendra the young boy he was pleading on behalf of the hajjra hazrah had a lot many other things also master was not liking him but the narendra went on telling no he is a good person why you should not bless him like that and sirama krishna said you see because he takes the name of god narendra he said many brahmins of bhatt para showed him respect that i am not reading the whole thing the he was going on talking about it and narendra said bhattpara is a very famous place where all the scholars used to live in those days and when they have accepted someone means they are accepted that person so pointing to that he said to sirama krishna you don't like him but he has been accepted by those scholars then sirama krishna is smiling look at it this sentence that was the result of his job and austerity when we are accepted by the people when someone is accepted by the other people it is because he has done something good otherwise it is impossible and what are the good things spiritual practices what is the practice japa and austerity trying to control all the saints organs is the austerity so that is meditation and japa taking the holy name of god so these we should this one line only he mentioned this hadra bhagavan sudama krishna was not very happy with him but the young norin so he is arguing the why you should not love because the gentleman lives with you over there and he was showing krishna was giving so see he does this he does does that he's not listening to his mother his mother wants him to go back to take care of his family this gentleman is not going through all this now not in the he was because of the young mind he was telling then when he mentioned this this sentence struck me he is telling the acceptance by the people means you know why because he do the chappa and practice austerity the taking the name of god helps us these are the indication clear indication then do you know how i look on people like hazra he's mentioning i know that just as god takes the form of holy men so he also takes the form of cheats and rogues to mahima charan what do you say all are god mahima yes sir all are god mahima from the point of vidanta so this is the way srama krishna is mentioning now the girish asked him sir what is a kangi prima e kangi the econ the ghee is a because they're mentioning in this way the female way ekangi the ikangi prima prima so the female way they're mentioning so this is the eka immediately it means one-sided love for instance the water does not seek the duck but the duck loves water there are other kinds of love sadharani and samantha and samartha in the fast which is ordinary love the lover seeks his own happiness he doesn't care whether the other person is happy or not that is called sadharani that we have love but in that love most of the time we have seen either the wife or the husband is not very happy all the time doubting and like this so naturally that is sadharani love that is love of course but the husband or the wife wants that i should always be there and nobody else never cares about the other one the partner second is samanjasah and samartha in the fast which is ordinary love the lovers seek his own happiness he doesn't care whether the other person is happy or not that was chandrabali's attitude towards krishna in the second which is compromise both seek each other's happiness this is a noble kind of love but the third is the highest of all such a lover says to his beloved be happy yourself whatever may happen to me lob knows no barter swami vivekananda said what is god god is nothing but l-o-b-e this love this world we all the time use it and the relation between the husband and the wife between the children and the parents father and the mother and the father and the son mother and the daughter all these relations that we see is nothing but love but what type of love is this fast type that i only want my happiness and i don't care for the second one whether he or she likes it or not second is both are seeking each other's self most of the modern times they do like that but the third one that is divine love here it says whether i am happy or not it doesn't matter at all but i like to see you happy that is called spiritual love such a lover says to the beloved be happy versus yourself whatever may happen to me radha had this highest love she was happy in krsna's happiness the gopis too had attained this exalted state friends in the next class we will be discussing a little bit about this different schools of love because in the vedanta they are the different schools of devotion so we'll be as because it's a at the beautiful discussions it may take some time in next week we will try to discuss the different schools of love now let us stop over here if there is any question we will try to answer trigonometry is asking how to remove expectation question mark how to increase love for god so that is called sadhana trigona there is a expectation we can remove by analysis so what is the analysis the if i am expecting that my son will be with me but because of his job he has to live somewhere else and there is no other option so obviously you can say well it is his life i have lived my life the parents should think in this way we have lived our life now it is my son my daughter my our children it is their life now wherever they are happy let them be happy wherever they are successful let them be successful and that is sufficient for me they are happy they are well doing well so that is the way if you are thinking your expectation will come down and the more it is coming down automatically your mind will be free from the attachment the moment the mind is free from attachment wherever you like to turn to that mind it will go over there now if you turn it to god you can love god thank you raj bhattacharya is asking how to harmonize internal renunciation and external karma yoga ba beautiful question the harsharaj that is internal renunciation as a householder bhagavan si ramakrishna again and again said this is your internal renunciation it should be what is that he gave so many examples if you have read the gospel you know or the life of suramar krishna where it has been it has mentioned that the ladies working in a rich man's house she is taking care of the rich man's children and she mentions out of great love oh my son my rama my jodu but she knows in the heart of hearts they are my master's children my own children are somewhere else so that is the way you have to renounce this is my father this is my mother this is my family this is my society and i have to serve them because i am here but at the same time every moment if you are telling to yourself any day i may go away from here i may die any moment so whatever the responsibility i am supposed to perform i should perform with all diligence with all sincerity with all love but at the same time i am not going to be attached to any of these so that is called mental way of giving up sannyasa means giving up what to give up attachment only and nothing else and what is what was the second one second question how to harmonize karma and external karma yoga karma and that this is the you you are performing you are doing the work that very sincerely but at the same time you know that any moment i can go away like the people who are retiring the two three days before or a week before of their retirement they always become very completely detached and will be telling to other people hey if i had anything wrong about you please don't mind you'll be shaking hand or hugging and saying goodbye to everyone and he'll be loving every corner of the office each and everything including the people like the peons and all others he will go and say now after seven days i am leaving you must be happy like this like that that man is there in the office he is also final finally he is performing his duty at the same time he is completely free from that like the person going to return as he is behaving in his office similarly every day think yourself that i am going to retire from this world and work sincerely loving but not attached thank you devashish is asking is human expectation a part of maya or it just comes out of the desires it is of course it's a part of maya everything is a part of maya because only reality from the point of view of the piranha only reality is that consciousness supreme consciousness which is known as the brahman other things are nothing but the maya but at the same time when we are here in the practical level so obviously we have to be very practical we have to accept this moment that i am leaving and all this responsibility i am having but you know devashish again and again as said you must apply oil and then break the jackfruit the raw jackfruit so there will be no problem the if you have already applied the oil or the lubrication then you are not going to hurt your skin will be saved so that way knowing this that all that we see around us are all temporary i myself i don't know how long i am going to survive and that way if we continue our life it will be unique spiritual life thank you srima biswas is asking when they misunderstand parents what should we do but the children misunderstand the parents you know this is very difficult to change the others attitude but as a father and as a mother if we go on you know this is the capacity it is teachers capacity you know sometimes same thing other people will be tell in a very convincing way and all people accept that so we have to develop that capacity to convince them then afterwards that is up to them whether they accept it or not up to them it is everyone comes with his own fate own karmapala so naturally i have tried my best and if you don't listen it is up to you say that much thank you friends let us chant this mantra and we conclude niranjanam is [Music] [Music] foreign
