I'm written dr. jeevan KO be rewritten Calma shavon shavon among golem 3 Matata Tom Kubik nan de coup d'etat Jana today we are going to study that the attitude of religion the proper attitude of religion that the bhagavata-dharma Tichenor this is very important for those the followers of Salaf additional salam dish Navy Reserve it's very important particularly this discussion master Michelle sorry mom who has registered his discretion you know today is his birthday so he was born on this particular deal this trouble that is and punching me I think in Bengal particularly they worship the snake goddess today because a lot of snake that is God and in the villages the people they worship the goddess of snake Manasa article is Manasa on this particular day he was born so I just remembered and he's not in down Friday September 26 1884 a graphic diss description sadhana busines had come to Kolkata it was the first day of the durga puja and the five days durga puja it may be the Shasti are subtly the i think it is such tea the first year - Durga Puja the Greek religious festival and the Hindus are the metropoliz were celebrating it the master intended to visit the image of the Divine Mother at others house she also wanted to see Shobana the brahma devotee it was about midday umbrella in hand in image the master himself was spacing the footpath in front of the Brahmo Samaj temple two hours had passed that the master had not yet appeared those who visited calcutta and from there you know that still the travel Brahmo Samaj it is still there and master michelle was going up and down now ending in sat down on the steps of dr. maha Mahana leash dispensary and was the joy and mirth of the people um we're celebrating the puja if you go to the doctor with your time it is appearing according amounted to the same thing he was fine but the crowd is little more because of the population but the same description can also write in the same way that master measure has done a little after three the Masters carriage drove up as soon as long-distance tipped out he saluted the temple of the Brahmo Samaj with folded hands this is a speciality about one son - nah he was not a problem you know that this fraction still it is there so from the Hindus they were separately deformed is so much a group of people who were following the Hinduism but without image worship did this story you all know but there is a temple means a place where these two discuss there is no shrine as such but these two discourages to meditate is to see the Salam o Krishna getting down from the carriage he is self in this temple he though he was the very Hindu of course but Poojari and the Kali temple but look at this discipline of hold hands Hofstra and the few other devotees were with him in bow before the master and took the dust of his feet master told him that he was going to shoot knots house a few minutes later several members of the Brahmo Samaj came and took him to shitness bath ship not was not at home shortly afterwards beach Jericho show me riche and other the Brahmin leaders greeted the master and took him inside the brahma temple ceramic or krishna was in a happy mood she was given a seat below the altar there the Brahmin devotees sang their devotional music the joy and the preneur devotees sat in front of the master which I preached ago show me the afterwards he separated from that the Brahmo Samaj and Vijay Krishna was a devotee but then in those days it was almost all the educated people young people dished to join this Brahmin movement because that was very in those days it was very modern denouncing all the gods and goddesses of the Hindus and going out of the traditional anything that shower naturally people the thing something new that we are going to hear so most of them they join which are Krishna also person and Krishna recognized him you don't know you belong to change the Tama Prabhu the devotion is much more in you it is natural why you are going to that path you should always go to him you natural way so afterwards you never said directly he give the hint indirectly and then which I understood that to grow in spirituality he must follow his own feeling so afterwards which is now at this moment the joy is one of the teachers of the Brahmans the PJ I said over there to be joy with his fine master is telling I was told that you had put up a signboard the people belonging to other failed are not allow to come in in the promise of not in order to not have to wear some baby bacon and the to say to me you shouldn't go to the Brahmo Samaj you had better visit Nan's house the house so you can go there but not the Samarth with the already empty cleared no other should come now from here begins the view of Bhagwan see Rama Tichenor and the real attitude in religion the today's topic the real attitude but I see that we are all calling on the same God jealousy and malice need not be some say that God is formless and Sun that God has found I see let one man meditate on God whit fall if he believes in form and let that another meditate on the formless daily if he does not believe in from what I mean is that dogmatism is not good that this is the ring or burns around is not it is not good to feel that my religion alone is true and other religions are false the correct attitude is this my religion is right but I do not know with the other Asians are right or wrong true or false I say this because one cannot know the true nature of God unless one realizes that this is the main meeting point of the in reason Hinduism always say you must realize yourself where's our fathers they always say no realization is not possible for you only one who is the son of God or the Messenger of God the only realize God and you have to follow whatever he is saying but here in the Hindus and always encourage Ellison inspired you as an individual must realize God so this is the special pregnant that is what Shanti become and also say religion is realization so you know there are three steps maybe when we are going to discuss this in our coming retreat 26 27 28 of this month maybe we will be discussing about this the spirituality in modern life but there are three steps one is a human being and the religion and then spirituality spirituality actually the goal and human being which trying to reach to the goal he has to go through the process and process is religion it may be different process may be different especially we become the same religion is a process that makes a prudent man and man unto God so these are three steps man then first is the brute brute man selfish man living for one sir and then slowly coming in contact with the religion the process slowly he develops all that beautiful attitude high moral values thinking for others pray for others helping others and then he reaches to that God and what is that God spirituality and what is the spirituality the manifestation all manifestation of all the good qualities in a human being and that is spirituality what happens the individual become very happy and the society also is benefited by that so these are the things theatre drama business talking about the religion all are leading to the same goal only they are calling in different names but the differences is in the process and he says why not try this is the speciality you don't like form no problem while you are criticizing those who are worshipping first rather you meditate and try to realize God formless God and that will be successful this attitude can solve all the conflicting among the religions this attitude or so I should follow my own path and I have no right to criticize others only this much and nothing else maja Arthur says to our mafia body that were Paris on the premises of a body means the business with the people they take the religion as the business they used in religion for their own benefit then this problem comes but the true religion can never say against others I haven't fallen in this path but I'm not going to criticize others why should I I want to be very much you know the proud that I'm following this to the people the children the students they go to their university to the school they are very proud of my school is the best good but he's not going to break the other schools I am very happy with my school my teacher and my system ok but why should I have to go and criticize others and try to break others this is exactly what Saddam omission and then he's floating from another Saint who was a Muslim by birth and Hindu by practice spiritual practice this is Karina very famous and the career as a soccer mini-mom mera mera Bob cocooning doe Kaku mundo don't and so simple me all the problems are solved cocooning Lukaku bundle he sees God week for his make model Sokka Mihrimah God wit form is my model the faultless is my father nirakara mere above which shall I plane cocoon into which light pls kappa bundle don't open the body the two parents of the skill are equally heavy they are all equal both so whom I am going to praise or criticize this attitude brings a beautiful combination and that is exactly what some occasion attitude this is exactly the true into attitude each and every human do should understand this whether the fathers are not my religion is this now the question comes if the people believing other faith they are upon us what we will do of course you have to resist no Christian and here is no question of the religion is the question of the security and they have you must have to fight back no question about but again we the question of religion counts practices come then you have to say their practices we appreciate the problem for us but I am going to follow that because I don't like it I didn't believe in that I believe in this path so I should follow these but when there is economical political social prob you have to solve it accordingly who says long but not in the name of religion provides our business technique Hindus Muslims Christians sharp shaver bushnell charcter that is the tantrika and Shiva also tantric about the worshipper of Shiva and which neighbors the worshipper abysmal then he is mentioning grandma Gianni's of the time of the Rishi's mother at the end in the Vedic times the Rishi's were known as Brahma gang and in the modern times at the time of the 19th century there this drama samajis they also used to say Brahm again Brahmans of Rama the brahmana so Ramakrishna mentioning the Brahma grannies of the time of the Rishi's and you the proper mechanics of modern times all seek the same object all are trying to understand the same densitometry Schnur it is that special way he mentioned a mother prepared dishes to suit the stomach's of our children this is a very simple way he is mentioning the same item has come but the mother is preparing different type of dishes according to the capacity the digestive capacity of the children the God has given all these why didn't you are unnecessarily creating problem for yourself and problem for the human society do you know my attitude is 8 I love all Liberation's the reparation means a different type of paths and leading to the same God and that is why we keep always this thing all the symbols that we have kept over here and the two major cards the Buddhism and the Christianity we have gift over here because we are the followers of Saddam of Krishna I do not know other individually do it it's not necessary also only the Saddam additional followers and this is the spatial context is telling those who are the followers of Saddam of Krishna must understand things otherwise they always think that someone came and told if we have a colleague on the do but there a lot of people will come we will earn some money and of course money is necessary only to our money Kali wanted and then some people who say conditioned ones that we will draw more people another connection thing and then to worship that we have to bring pujari from India and then they had a problem and they form walk the temple for the solace for the shanty but the spiritual growth for the love the peace all will be lost he want examples just visit the any of the Hindu temples and talk to those people you will find that I think every year or every two years there is the election and they'll be campaigning you know sometimes I get the requests from influence influence that man he goes to you he should vote for me I go to Temple for temple say don't involve me in this I know you are only thing if I had the opportunity to tell lined up told if you are not there in the committee good so you can worship God love God meditate on God bring it to God clear mind and Sun God also so be free from the a and give the service to God so this what Saddam Christian say do you know my attitude I love all preparations to show me be beckoned the same if necessary I can go and sit with in prayer with the Muslims I can visit the churches and I can go and meditate with the Hindus in the jungle why not when I am going to visit the church I see my God with him I see the glance the now Krishna standing over there I don't see any other God because I love slava Krishna I like to see God my God over there why not but I go and I bow down I will bring some of our friends our devotees they accompanied me to that NASA Naga so they have very closed society but still they opened it up they have been prayer for us and in the rear we participated maybe the first time the some people who are not Jews they attending their career but when they were standing up we were standing up when they were turning right and left we were also doing the same way they turned to the completely turned back we did that what's problem and when they were closing and trying to bring in their own way we were praying to our one God so in the same dr all supreme and suppose the Akama would hear and when you see a sinner saying that we have to give the the mark on your foreheads okay this is the problem and they noticed and before taking the mark on the for a the Hindus they put the hand at the back maybe to control them yes but do you do like that same way to take the money there's no I appreciated not that that they are becoming Hindu by that way what is the problem so things we must have to understand the one African boy he has taken institution from me so he came and I was putting flour to God and also the children I also gave the gender until Ankeny and then afterwards they told I have a question to what is this mother for that shall I have to carry it every time everywhere no just it came over here I was also taking so I gave it to you now you can go and wash your face there's no problem now what is the meaning at will the meaning is to remind us that we have a spiritual I should have to have the spiritual eye open the this mark the drinking this is a symbol of the third eye 3d vinayan there's a spiritual eye so this spiritual idea that win the Sangha the he got the spiritual I am he could see everything now some people may argue what is the spiritual life now to the camera to the satellite we can see everything of course you can but that is also the possible the people can see everything without satellite or in the camera Salam Krishna could see ancient everything holy mother could see shall be be bigger the could see then these are all presentation over here and also in France that one lady came Madame Kali shall be pivot and was not knowing her at all the without announcing that she came the moment she entered into the room of Shama Vivekananda with heart frame who actually brought our dear without seeing the analogy was facing the wall and in the writing table he was writing something the moment stepped inside the room and he started telling everything about the life of that lady without me and very recently perhaps I told you that one prematurely he was thinking that he has realized mother Kali and he went to tell that to Shama Camilla and the G the moment it touched his field community by the time lost his eyesight he couldn't see the man but the moment it touched him immediately he started telling commit antigen whatever he has done no no no no you have not seen Kallie I don't believe other I doubt whether you'll be able to a monk or not because that that quality is not there you don't have the restraint to all this how it is possible with a miraculous it is possible why not a steady Sheila hi so salam o krishna stating I love all operation where evil people have assembled to call on God knowing for sure that is a holy place because they are trying to forget the world and they're trying to concentrate on that holiness in their own way Ramakrishna is studying do you know what the truth is God has made different religions to show different as parents times and countries all doctors are only so many parents but in fact is by no means God path is not the government the path is by no means God himself indeed one can reach God if one follows any of the paths with more hearted devotion suppose there are dealers in the religion that one has accepted if one is sincere and earnest then God Himself will correct those errors and right type of people will come and guide so these are not the way you should and he would also understand that even feel that I must accept this fact that the Sun either severe I should not extend I should continue so this is what is called the right attitude in religion and there was a lady saint in the muslim saint Rebecca and Rebecca used to practice inside there's no human be deserted players so she used to practice over there sometimes some people used to come over there and talking with heart they were so happy just to go back and tell there is a lady saying this is so wonderful full of love compassion the moment you go and sit before to talk with God then you can feel peace and joy palpable so naturally the audible laws they were very unhappy what is it so many years we are practicing people and not praising so they became anxious that they are going to lose their followers one day in a group they went to her and asked according to our system practices the before praising to God pray to God you have to criticize the TV to do that we don't see you are not criticizing the devil Shaitaan you have to criticize but then the rabbia same hadn't have time to criticize this writer the wife has been mine dying on is really thinking about that time I mean today utilizing thinking about God this is the correct attitude now when we are thinking of what other people are doing how they are going to go to hell no that is a very wrong attitude as I am Telling again if the most people creating problem in the society society has the right to control them in whatever manner because that is a human society and obviously in the name of economy or politics and religion whatever it may be you are trying to create problem naturally though those countries and the society has the right to control you but that doesn't mean that I have to going on criticizing others this is domination attitude and he is telling that it is for the people because they could understand that so for them God has created this bad but the parrot itself is not the God and if there is any mistake God will come and correct it if there are errors in the religions that is not of our business God is a God to whom the whole world belongs take care of that now here comes I want to realize God what is the first step Frosty's I don't know what is God how about it read about it people talk about it but in reality I don't have any conception of God we must be a great personality must be very powerful and they say people they say God God means full of love God God is all-powerful omnipotent omnipresent only seeing the beautiful terms the use and we also memorize those terms and then afterwards what no conception no idea what God then how can start field satyr who faith and those people who have already realized God how to know that those people have already realized God their lives and in their lives will find that there is love and nothing else not for the human society for the human being without any discrimination oh he doesn't believe believe in me so let him perish no he can't be God the God is full of love anyone trying to rise up immediately God will come and he'll see sometimes what happens the students medical students but the parents are poor they cannot support them they want to become a doctor or an engineer how the professional it needs lot of money support but we know that information the news come out publish in the newspaper so many people are known people they will say man to them they really contact the newspaper our creation you have published this information we like to help this why because we didn't know why that particular student let him come up with some money that is the only thing and then they would say please send me every year you result we like to observe whether you are really making progress or otherwise why should i am-ness explain my money but why we are supporting because we love and momo you're supporting who i don't know even if he becomes or she becomes a doctor an engineer i am not expecting that then he or she will arm and then look after me no no question and this is religion the love that comes out and then reaches to everyone without discrimination that is religion so i am not going to criticize anyone I love so God that is my goal and I have to develop that and what is the benefit by that what I am going to get Nene don't stop above it Dasia need the Sri lead the Mangala in the book the beautifully they are describing meet the would suffer poverty Isha where in your mind they'll do itself all the time different programs are going on and supposed there once in a while there is a program and we go we listen to that music and there you see the dancers good people talking with them that is the woods are not regular life would say only but if you realize God he will feel the joy great charmed in your heart and you are not depending on anything else automatically to be me the roots of the shun needlessly meeting the Mangala martial community we used to live in that very humble condition there is no money there is no support and in those society the women you can imagine the people are not supposed to see their faces but that way this to hide themselves at the same time mother was not having her separate room so she used to live only on the steps some moms used to lie down can imagine and not for a day or two years together months together and she's to cook for Taku and then she will go and have the bath early in the morning two o'clock so long when all people are sleeping she finished and then came again the next after 24 hours she can go to the bathroom after 24 hours can imagine and how much suffering even things you say anything rather afterwards when the devotees is to come and they realized the divine the presence in are then she say Oh mother you had such a very terrible by even you you were suffering but I told no I was having joy always within my heart on the court abortion Arnon Lienhard the picture of joy constantly in my heart I never cared for the situation the people the condition because I was always enjoy so what is the cool mother say if you want bees my child don't read asides others don't find $40 Exeter what is the condition peas if you want bees then you should not do these so what is the goal in our life God what is that God few love and that love gives us unselfishness so love and unselfishness if the error errors in other religions it is none of our business ceramic is 'no but dogmatism is not good between the wrath of religion dogmatism is not at all good you have no doubt heard the story of the chameleon now he's trying to explain that the dog baptism through its beautiful anecdote a man into the wood and saw a chameleon on a tree she reported to his friends hey I have seen in realism she was firmly convinced that it was nothing but the rate another person after visiting the tree see I am seeing the green lizard over there she was firmly convinced that it was nothing but the green but the man who lived under the tree my man lived under the tree saw that he says no no what both of you have to say true but the fact is that creature is sometimes read sometimes green and sometimes euro and sometimes has no color at all he's not a lizard that lizard family comedian sit through this story I see the call of God his tales true but only partially true God is this partial truth this is the problem and sometimes nowadays with a great joy and enthusiasm anything new always in the society that brings then at some of the young people they're searching other people who do not believe in Ramachandra hey sing China if you don't save will be tea now that there are it is having like this it's not social problem not religious those who are settings say Jayram they also don't have wrong thing about ramchandra they don't know anything about but the person who is sitting I don't know about Ram what I see is also the same page both of them they don't know wrong but only we are now powerful you have to say like that when the Muslims came to the country they were also in one hand they were having the sword in another and Quran you must convert yourself or I am going to kill you do you think is a good Muslim no it doesn't know anything about exactly that is a social problem we should not take that as a spiritual problem religious rather completely social political problem but the religious people those who are sincere to realize they want to know God you want to get the peace if they also mingled in that then they're losing all the balances so Saddam addition is telling God maybe this maybe that you do not know whatever the realization that you have got anticipation for you God has been described in the Vedas as both with the attributes and without ceremony Schnurr is a neither unlettered person they say he never read but sit through his realization he was always perfect any statements correct you described him as without form only you means a Brahmin samajis that is one-sided but never mind even know one of his aspects on truly you will be able to know his other aspects to God Himself will tell you all about them so this is what cinema distance teaching swami vivekananda when he was visiting the europe and america these teachings of sri ramakrishna he placed in a very wonderful way he said we are traveling from the Lord took 200 not from either tutored not from false to true the lower truth to higher truth what is the lower truth who God lives in this tree God baby the godly in this particular animal God live on that cloud God is in this form God is in that form God without form all water and it is higher truth I am that because without me there is nothing and what is that I this body this mind no all-pervading knowledge consciousness so that is the I is only hypothetical at this moment for us but slowly slowly when you reach over there we can understand when it is possible is true so when we are children we hear about so many things and snow is trouble we grew up we realize and the things which were very much in interesting for us we give up give up give up because we know that's all useless when you are all young children we still cry for the bicycle and when you got the by seconds not a few days and will never leave the bicycle not share TV one we fought for that and then after some time when you grew up we need a motorbike then a God then a better car then the variants all these things goes on no he loved it and then ultimately one day we said we enough is enough I have got happy with all this I need happiness how to get the happiness so that is the question and from their religion begins here the religion will come and say these are the practices you must follow sama dama karate so thick Shahada Samad on these are the steps you have to follow slowly slowly you have to conquer your own senses and this is called practices and these practices are nothing but religion but religion is not the aim it is a means only but through the means you have to reach to the God the way someone goes for the initiation if I take the initiation am I going to realize God is he yes but depends on you how sincerely you are taking the name of God and concentrating your mind in meditation if you have the faith in the words of the guru whatever the instruction he has given you practice that practice there and see the changes are coming all that doubt slowly slowly vanish then you think oh yes this is possible this is also all right and wonderful qualities understanding adjust feeling for others love for others all good qualities consulting qualities you will feel within yourself then a moment will come time will come as if in a flash all the nollans will go away what is that ignorance me and mine I am always correct and this is my idea all that will vanish and helping out our so that is exactly Saddam Disney is pointing to this promise Ahmad his I understand that they have been finding fault with you for mixing with those who believe in God there ever be generation of a sham he was passing through a very hard time because a has within him was the devotion and promise you know that this is the dogmatism the moment they know you cannot visit to the people who are worshipping wind form and you cannot keep contact with them to Matt isn't know why because they are afraid if I allow them to mix with all others they may be there our number will go down so there are afraid of that they like to keep a big group you will find the weak people only say like that and in Hinduism they always encourages all the time they are visiting everywhere and very happy in it at the time of the Christian the celebration leave it go they will also participate and if there is any Prashad the mostly the church don't give any pressure but whatever did maybe they're happy and then in the Muslim the celebration also no problem what is the unabomber offered it properly only if you are cooking the food in a proper manner and then there's the problem for us to take in Andaman the one lady was there I have forgotten her name and she used to give tournament God in the Durga Puja time that the young lady seems to give the gentleman any Hindu is coming she'd forced hey come over here I want to take the child out but well I don't know whether good to water or not this is gentleman don't have doubt in this she used to force and in when the Muslim celebration she'll be all distributing one type of sweet to all people and the first packet needs to prepare in the family to bring to the Osterman so what is wrong in it this is all God and she is very ill she was very happy in that systemic Christian stealing I can understand that people are criticizing you because you are mixing with those who believe in God with four is that true he who is a devotee of God must have an understanding and cannot be shaken under any conditions he must be like Pollan if blacks means of shop he's constantly being struck by the hammer still it is unshakable those who know the history of the sheiks when the Guru were arrested by the Muslims and the Muslim Naga told because they were having that long hear then cutting that means cutting the hey deceitful so the Lama told if you are not getting converted into those Islam I am going to cut that you're here he said oh wait wait wait I will give you little extra up to my throat take the head also along with the year but I am NOT going to change my idea the constant I had believed that this is my god and I'm ready I'm not deviating I'm not disturbing years but I am ready to follow my path so this is how they still follow ceramic history is also telling one must be careful about few things first is telling an influential man who has money and Maine under his control he may can see he can injure you you must avoid that those who are trying to develop spirituality the first thing they should be away from these people otherwise is very difficult in our life we have seen very influential person well placed in the government offices and they come and they still do be and immediately you start feeling proud because of the bloody that man is dead oh you are not addicted job no problem I will call him until it and he starts doing like that and pick up the phone and says old his mind on can him please and the people when they come to know about it all they come to you and they start requesting you and you do that through him and you feel proud I hope tonight did that I do that so that's why one should have heard the very first thing maybe he is telling and every thanks really a second is a dog in the street talks sometimes they like to the can in this country it is not that much in our country it is too much so one must be very very careful in the early morning if you have gone out for a walk then he should have a stick in your hand not to beat but to save yourself we do not know what will happen to the dog and suddenly something happened so one must be third a bull another you do not know but their grazing sadly if they see a particularly this type of color red color but I don't know why it goes man immature so must be very careful on the pool fourth is a drunkard and because the drunkard person is not having any control so immediately whatever he says oh yes he is okay okay you have to keep him in good humor and if it if you try to tell him oh the drinking is very bad not only damaging you but then you are also wasting money he will be very angry with you and not that see Ramakrishna telling these now all only the dog only the food only done good he's trying to tell you you must avoid those people who doesn't think that we create problem in a spiritual growth in a spiritual growth whatever his problem try to avoid those why do I have to keep my mind Tom controlled meditating if something happened and I get agitated go on thinking about that when you meditate so try to avoid in the presence of wicked person I become alert Christian person like him an Avatara barista he said in the presence of the wicked person I become alert and when these wicked people they come they were not too good they won't good but he can harm you that's why you have to say oh hello how are you that much so one of the must be what does it mean in the journey of spiritual growth one must be very very intelligent also its Ramakrishna once you say back to OB the book of again when you have to become a devotee it doesn't mean that you have to be him like a fool you must be intelligent enough to understand who is part and that way you must make progress but here he says you have to discriminate the great deal in order to avoid a bite otherwise your passion will be stirred up and it will carry you to destruction [Music] Buju is telling I have no time self I am entangled in my duties here masters Ramakrishna you are religious teacher others have holidays but not so to a religious teacher religious teacher has no stop why because the love we were comes we must go and accept them and sometimes I see even our monastic brothers they say this much time I am NOT going to meet you know I'm talking like these and there it is not good when a person is coming to the Osterman you must feel Ramanathan tomorrow also used to say that your mind should be always open anyone has come to the God he must be welcoming me maybe different a per person but at least you should will come and should talk to them give some time to them and what else you can do now I am meditation time who I understand in the beginning it is okay but when you become a Swami you are all the time in every went domain twenty-four hours you are supposed to take the name of God not that only one hour in the morning and then one hour in the evening twenty-four hours every time every moment and whoever comes try to help them try to talk to them whatever best way it is possible and pray for them that so what else we can do that is what Saddam equation is dealing read yourself please give us some instruction sinaia Vijay is telling master clients around the brahma temple and say with a smile this is a nice to the temple then you say a mixture of Christians and Salaam the Christian setup means you know that in our country when they make that molasses the heart molasses it will be first liquid so they keep it in an art and power the loan the liquid thing they make small hole at the bottom so the liquid portion will go down slowly slowly only the solid Christian will be there the similarly Ramakrishnan stealing now it is a mixture of samsara and God because in the samsara and in the household so this is a mixture very good but keep a small pool later all the liquid part of it that is your desire and your doubts and your anger all that go away slowly slowly and ultimately you do the feature that is this body will contain the perfect portion and that is God thank you friends and tomorrow again and next class we will discuss and it has concluded after this please repeat after me need a medium on and on gumpa Drita be crowned by Aisha with our Polynesia medium Tom Ramakrishna cheetah Sundy Sundy Sundy happy that's three dog Krishna our eponymous two
