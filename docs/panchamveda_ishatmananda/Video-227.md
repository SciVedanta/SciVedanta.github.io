[228: Panchama Veda 228 : Don't Speak Ill Of Anyone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKSHxCdMWAg)

Tabu Kadam Ratan Tata G Bonham Kobe be rewritten Cal mashup 'him stubborn among golem srimad artem boobie goon and de bourree dodging our dear devotees and friends good evening this is another Wednesday and we are going to study the Pancham of a the gospel of bhagavata-dharma kishna we were studying that Sunday October 5th 1884 account of the master Marcia and now I'll be starting from page number 591 here see ramakrishna is telling and quoting hodja hodja hodja at the devotee he was there he used to claim that he is a he is following the path of Gianna knowledge they used to study the Hindu scriptures like Upanishads is to quote from there but you know as we have already got introduced with the Hazara we know that he was having some other intentions also so it all those scripture coating all those taking the name of God was nothing but he's trying to get the I'm trying to introduce himself with the rich devotees that is the most ugly things we can say in the spiritual life so we need money of course and particularly those who are running the organization institutions and nowadays individual Swami's the shaniyah chains mendicants are very less all are almost organized according to the condition situation of the society we need money we need donation but at the same time if we are going to only to those people who are reach to the satisfy them we do something which actually we don't do this hypocrisy that is a terrible thing the Xiaomi we become the said I can stand everything but hypocrisy so now the Hodja he was in that way we can say a hypocrite Ezra said that God was not like such will the people of the world did heel a quilt Ezra arguing with Raghavan see Ramakrishna and he is telling the devotee can ask well from the God or if he is not asking automatically the God will give well to the devotee according to hustla almost the proof of his devotion that he'll be blessed with the wealth by God that he is but ceramic estate selling to the devotees he said but I call this impure devotion to God as a devotion but in pure devotion to God pure devotion has no desire behind it so this is the difference assirram Krishna is the God Himself about our average time and why he has come to lead the humanity to the Godhead so that they get the liberation from the game of this Maya and he himself said in the beginning itself the each and every individual the goal of every human life is nothing but God realization God realization happy satisfied successful life in the world no the wrong Krishna never talks like that but he gives the chances okay you are not ready no problem but the goal is to realize God and how to realize God only by hankering for God and nothing else and what else is there except God this world and what is this world name fame and all these beauties so obviously we have to be very very careful if we are going towards God we have to shun this world the nama Rupa name-and-form this is the world and beyond that is the God that is the consciousness or the brahman cinema krishna is very very particular to guide the devotees i repeat the word devotees those who love God doesn't want to realize God that they want to go to God for them ceramic is nurses no that is impure devotion the devotion with desire to be successful to get proper ticket money in this world pure devotion no desire behind it love for love's sake you don't want anything from me but you love to see me and hear my words he is giving an example my mind also dwells on you I wonder how you are and why you don't come if a person is going to someone and constantly asking the favor obviously that person won't like him but he is going only to because he likes him the loves him so he goes there how are you and he wants to listen to him so naturally slowly slowly that person will also develop the sympathy love and then he will inquire where is that man who is to come so that love will be there and then when he will come to know that is some trouble is the surely help to God's graces creeper in Sanskrit Disick creeper you have to cremeens you have to perform something and you have to do something yeah the practices of austerities that is for to get the blessings of God and then we will get it creeper them and the world like that and this say what is this creeper God's grace and God's got how it comes without any effort and when without any effort means work I love God I depend on God I have complete faith on God but at the same time I'm not asking anything from God so this is on this point we must discuss a little because sometimes some of the people they're confused shall we not pray to God for anything the one mother recently she called me from India and she was asking the clarification of this my children are there in US America and one of them is in New York shall I not free to God Bhagwan see Ramakrishna for Harville being a daughter until you must why not where you will go so we have to go to God and say I love my child and she is there in the New York and every day I'm reading that this is a so bad condition so please protect my children a mother a father obviously and do why not where he will go he's my father he is my mother I can but you know the selfish motive that is exactly what the Ramakrishna is meaning he's not a selfish motive as a householder he is having his family sannyasins nothing but we pray pray for whom for everyone for everyone so that balloon mod Durga Puja we do Durga Puja is nothing but prayer prayer prayer Dunham's the he Josh on the he roopam the all give give give give to why the Sun machines are performing durga puja for the betterment of the world for the betterment of the devotees not for us so that always we can do otherwise where you will go this moment I have to survive so obviously I will turn to God almost everywhere all Hindus are now hunting the Chandi and worshipping and many are chanting the Sheba stotra Exeter Exeter they are all doing whatever they feel that we should do the Hanuman Chalisa many of them they are chanting regularly so why because we believe the God only can take out all this problem from the humanity last two months all over the world whole humanity is suffering and being a religious person shall I not pray to God for that so this also we have to understand when see Ramakrishna said the impure devotion the purely selfish motive to love God what tie God please give help me so that I become successful successful in the litigation that is selfish motive and then I want to get these I went to get there you need not do one gentleman came a lady came to march out of the money day be and she was praying to Marcia Radha mother please bless my husband so that his profession becomes successful professionally become successful mother action please listen profession of your husband he's a doctor then the mother told them no my daughter I cannot do that success of your husband means suffering of other P they should be ill then they will go to a doctor then your husband will earn know how can I organize your the blessings on that so this is the thing that what is the impure devotion this purely selfish motive but when I'm praying for the world ball praying for my children to protect them I don't think that is selfish so we have to understand it clearly other it will be confusion and we will be in two ways and what to do I am a mother I cannot pray for my child why not you pray for your child at the same time pray for others also at the pray for service turreted organi sorry boo Vadra Hani Pasha too in that undergo Benicia in the Veda they are teaching us to pray like this oh god please remove all these miseries from the whole world there's also prayer to God this is not a selfish prayer so Sarah Marcus knee is telling the dirt is my mind also dwells on you I wonder how you and why do don't come you don't want anything of God but still you loving this is called the pure bhakti love of God with no motive behind it Prahlada had it he shot neither kingdom nor reaches he shot hurry alone now the stages are there so you have to understand that stage is also the win we are devoted to God then children they also go to the temple and the parents are asking them to pray to God so they will be asking the mother what shall I pray this should be successful in your exam because that is the difficult for the child so naturally exam success then when he growing up then having the faith in God for everything is going talking to God this is happening that is happening in the household life is obvious natural but for a monk what type of the prayer should be there make me give me the devotion so that I can be liberated from these life from this bondage from the all desires give me that devotion that it should be the prayer and then monk always praying for the others so the first he will say the please bless all others the way we get the initiation our gurus the teachers before starting your japa and meditation you must pray for the will being all around you and the people all over so naturally if the first thing then afterwards we pray give me the devotion or the faith or the knowledge so that I can overcome this Maya the bondage of Maya now this is stages are there so we must start with that but pure selfish thing is completely different I think that we should understand the completely selfish and prayer for our beloved or our the loving ones that is a different thing in now giving a something son his opinion about the Hegira he said is a chatterbox you won't achieve anything unless he becomes silent the serrano krishna was talking about Hazra now in gave his opinion he's criticizing Asura this is the two different thing we will come to this point and very very not only important interesting also now and then he comes to me and becomes mellowed but he is a pest again he argues it is very hard to get read egoism you may cut down an - what the tree but the next day is proud will spring up as long as the roots remain the tree will grow again - wata that tree we know mainly in our the warm countries it is the without any water also it can survive and will never die and particularly in the old buildings you will find slowly hair from it is coming maybe with the birds and all and then it is growing on the rooftop slowly breaking the the building itself so we know about and this tree like they're giving the example of the tree Sri Ramakrishna it is like the ego this moment we feel oh there is no ego it goes away the second one next again if I know it is already there so like that it says I say - hasta don't speak ill of anyone now this is the point we need to discuss master Masha he criticized him he knew that ozra Masha and he said is a chatterbox he won't achieve anything unless he becomes silent he goes on telling many things but he doesn't know and makes mistakes but with the proudest ramakrishna he risked to that point because of the ego so he is going on giving his own opinions this is the point now two different approaches friends I was just searching what the other religion say about this criticism this is a criticism that we are doing see Ramakrishna he is also talking about has remorse - Masha gave his opinion no one is appreciating him is not a criticism but Salam o Krishna said I told Hazra don't speak ill of anyone how is it in the religion particularly the spiritual life this is the most important thing we should not criticize others what is this criticism not Dhammapada it says that Buddha large Buddha is telling speak only endearing speech speech when it bring no evil to others is a pleasant thing it is very clear from the Buddhists so Buddhism we can say that as swami vivekananda say the rebuild child of India ISM a lot of individual influence of Hinduism shadows of Hinduism are there both Hinduism Buddhism they follow they're almost the same thing now here it says endearing speech speech when it brings no evil to others is a pleasant thing we have to remember this way to keep in mind this point I am telling something about others but that is not bringing any evil this is going to help them it's an endearing thing that's also yeah that is true I must have to understand these I have to rectify these teachers in the classrooms constantly going on correcting the students out the finding faults if you say eh you should not find far no this is not I heard long back when Brahma chaddy who was in charge of the kitchen of a big Asuma he saw and he noticed that the cooks and the people who were working in the kitchen is a big kitchen so they are taking the things and it was not directly stealing he saw it noticed it but never say to those people and nor he went to the insurgent reported those things why when afterwards when it were those people who have caught and it was reported that in church Swami Osteen you noticed it yes sir and I noticed that for last 3-4 months they were doing it or more longer than that why you have not reported to me no mother Marsh are the money Davey said don't find fault with others there's a very important statement of Martha the Mona Devi if you want peace my children don't find fault with others yes correct so he took it in that view they are doing the wrong thing but we am I to criticize them where am I to report against them I should not is this the right point it is the right the the viewpoint of this statement of Martha would need a B no but dear the duty it says that you must have to do that because my duty is to take care of the kitchen and things around and it is not a small thing as a huge kitchen the big ass Rama every day nearly eight hundred people taking the food four times you can imagine so obviously he was supposed to report it to his superior the schwa me in charge over there but he didn't do that because he was misunderstanding the state or the teachings of Marshalls I may need a B so this is the blueprint the Buddha also said speak only enduring speech speech when it bring it no evil to others is a pleasant thing there's correct but you had to understand it if when and who is doing it at polish officer he has to take out the a person who was caught doing something wrong and naturally policies' interrogating how he will behave there are many ways of course but here you cannot apply this thing you have to take other measures also to get the right the information from that particular person a terrorist and/or the informer of the terrorist if they are arrested how will behave with them so these are the very practical thing religion religious teachers they're giving us the advices and how those advices can be applicable in our day to day life and if they are not applicable then what is the use of those at those speeches or the advices so here we have to apply our discriminative capacity the here he says normally usually I should not hurt others with my speech rather I should present though the whole thing in such a way so it becomes helpful to others but in a particular situation I should take different measure so this what Buddha says another he said should you find a wise critic to point out your faults follow him as you would a guide to hidden treasures he's giving that there is called a spiritual practice you know if there is someone with a positive criticism then someone will say you should do it you should not do that when we become novices in the spiritual life to become a monk our seniors almost in every step every day every time this to observe us and to stay better you should not do this better you should do this you must speak in this way you must wear the dress like this everything all the time there is to guide as the mother will guide or the parents will guide to the children because by that will you grow is it the criticism no it cannot be the criticism we have to understand to belittle that person to insult that person but when I am criticizing that man I am NOT trying to help I am trying to denounce him to insult him that is criticism so this difference we must understand in the Quran also other that Muhammad he said do not criticize then a very nice way he puts do not criticize you will not die unless you experience what you criticize the hand criticizing our brothers oh they are not telling the truth oh they are like these do like that but hazard nama said then you have to go through all those things unless and until you are you're still rectified you have no right to denounce others so that is the viewpoint of the Islam we have people may not following that that is the different thing but the founders of the religion the true understanding of the religion of these founders are so clear that those who are claiming that I am the follower of so-and-so but not understanding or misinterpreting or utilizing for a selfish motive that is a different thing but here the truth is all religion says be careful before criticizing others now the Bible Lord Jesus said with James he says do not complain brethren against one another so that yourself may not be judged behold the judge is standing right at the door in a different way and very flowery language is using but what he said God will judge are you also correct if you are not correct then you don't have the right to criticize others that is the point don't speak ill of anyone when the ceramic Krishna is telling it to ha JA is not criticizing him for trying to denounce him to insult him he is trying to rectify him the wind we are finding fault with love with affection with an idea to make the person perfect then it is not criticism so this we have to understand all the religion they speak in this way the cinema Krishna is telling like this he is not criticizing Asura he is trying to help him and we should also understand we should also learn a proverb they say a gentle answer turns away wrath but a harsh word start up anger though this is for practical uses so when something is happening maybe there in the office the boss trying to show that he is the boss sometimes they will shout and in there an hi speech they will say be humble before him you are confident that you have not done anything but when you are giving the answer softly gently so that fire will go this is a practical way but this is not the point we are discussing we are discussing whether we will see fault in others are not and if we see or find faults in others how we will express it or should not express what you'll do this is the practical question well religion here to help me to guide me to develop my character so naturally we will discuss it and what is the conclusion conclusion is if I know that I am going to help this man then what I should do as Swami Vivekanand advised do not criticize openly take him aside and discuss with him try to know his viewpoint and then tell these are the shortcomings that you are having try to rectify that is the way you can help so this is how we should behave seeing fault or finding fault that the teachers the parents the guardians and also the spiritual teachers they should find it and try to rectify it not denouncing it so criticism is completely different and finding faults are the defects and with great love and affection when we are trying to rectify those there is a completely different Ramakrishna is not mentioning about that so he is asking Nara not to criticize so here again and why not it goes to viewpoint of the Hindus at the Balanta we can say why not criticize so it goes in this way it is Narayana himself who has assumed all these forms one can worship even a wicked person haven't you observe the Kumari puja here let me read it again it is Narayana himself who has assumed all these forms Narayana himself though he were reading a book written by Swami Vivekananda's brother about our the rajamallika me brahmananda ji the brahman and the ji went to see the Jagannath temple and he was a very emotional person a devotee he went and he saw the juggernaut he must have seen the juggernaut the view up there and he could not control his emotion he started crying before everyone and he was shedding tears profusely all people were aghast they were turning to him they were looking at him Shami Vivekananda afterwards he told him you should not express your emotion in that way if you are expressing your emotion the people will think that we should go and cry so hypocrisy will come without understanding anything they'll outward expression will be to draw the attention of the people appreciation of the people see I am crying and wailing for God though he is truly not the dis is called dramatic way to get the attention many of the people that do and in the name of religion it is so easy because no other will be able to see God and they will think you are talking to God you are seeing God you were crying to God and they will appreciate you don't do it and that is what ramakrishna missions from amongst the whole is follow no expression externally so if we do that then what happens the people will also follow that without truly realizing that afterwards Shami brahmananda ji the first president of the ramakrishna order and the mind born son above once Ramakrishna it was a so high soul about whom shall maybe become the state he is the highest in spirituality like that but still no outward expression religion should be inside and when you are asking people so in a different way so this is what we should not Anna himself we know everyone that is the reason the main reason is this why not criticize and March are the money Debbie also said if you want peace my child don't find fault with others why the is abaddon tur because there is nothing but the Bremen there is nothing but the expression of God so that is a very high point then you come down take the position of a teacher did the position of the mother father take the position of a guardian we are supposed to rectify the children guide the children then this same thing will be as who you were discussing it will be not criticizing but finding the defects in that green a person may be elderly but in the spiritual life he is a child so obviously you have to rectify you should not do like this you should not do like that but this is the way and he is telling that you must do like this two monks had arrived at the temple garden in the morning so another picture we find the ceramic richness talking with this - they were devoted to the study about about Gita and Vedanta they were not devotee they were following the path of knowledge now this to have come all this devotion we were talking cinema Krishna's talking about devotion now suddenly two monks they have entered and they are the followers of the path of knowledge and that's why master Marche very correctly he is mentioning they study only bhagavad-gita and be Dante began to means Upanishads so they always discuss about the Brahman all-pervading consciousness like that and other scripture they entered the Masters room saluted him and sat on the mat on the floor Salameh Krishna was seated on the small couch the master spoke to the shadows in hindustani salaam krishna knew that language because he used to talk with many other people particularly are just into Dakshina sure we're used to stay garden that just close to that there was a factory and that factories girls they were mostly Punjabis this to talk in Hindi the salon Krishna developed to some extent the spoken in D so he's to speak in Hindi now he is using that have you had your meal master is asking to those monks yes sir what did you eat dal and bread will you take some through they were asking Ramakrishna so you can imagine the ceramic ISNA affectionately asking these two young boys the two monks so that you have taken food or not people those who are from the West and all they will think oh why do all this why he should ask what their I have taken food or not no that is the there is their affection there's a lot of concern for the person we're visiting so have you taken what you have eaten what do you have taken food so that is the question because the so closeness what did you eat darlin braid then Hindi they say dal roti so naturally dal and braved will you take some master no I take only a few morsels of rice the Salam o Krishna from Bengal the Bengal is a rice eating mainly so he said I took rise but these people are coming from the northern part of India but Punjab and you you P so they are habituated with the bread roti well your japa and meditation must be without any desire for result isn't that so after this say this is the how the the realized soul the leave the question that the wood dhaba has asked to Sri Krishna how I will understand it is a man of realized a soul the man of liberation man of the man the liberated person how he'll understand that now they will always speak about God about spirituality they cannot talk about other things other things they are talking but at the same time the main thrust will be the main point will be only spirituality religion all the time every time so ceramic ISNA after the immediately he goes to the your japa and meditation must be read out any desire for result isn't that so the shadow replied yes sir that is good one must surrender the result to God what do you say that is the view of the gita salaam krishna himself didn't read the Gita but he knew all this whole Gita his memory was very sharp whatever he heard immediately memorized and he knew and he knew the exact teaching of the Bhagavad Gita there are many people who can recite all the seven hundred verses where you have no use you have to understand the truth that the Gita is trying to bring home so that Salam o Krishna said the Gita means completely giving away everything to God isn't that one shadow said to other quoting from the Gita the original verse it is in the ninth chapter xxvii words well the bhagavad-gita it says yet Karoshi yet as naxi yet Juho see Dada see yet yet apostasy conte that kirusha mud or Panem that is the in Sanskrit verse and this is the way when the two bonds they go any reference immediately they will quote the original so that they can memorize that and that we help the both so this is the his one to another he said if you is selling one shadow said to another quoting from the Gita or Juna whatever action you perform yet Karoshi whatever you eat yet as nasi whatever you offer to sugreev in sacrifice that you will see whatever you give in charity the dust yet whatever austerities you practice yet apostasy canta canta means the Arjuna that kirusha mud or Panem offer everything to me the spiritual life means what practicing austerity what is the austerity taking the mind out from the worldly thoughts and giving it to God all the time that so when we had be just before eating food or at the time and when you were eating also we try to think about God that I am feeding God that is fast and with the algebra when you sit for meditation and japa and there also God this is for you that I am doing please reveal thyself that's all and then I offer it to as we always say we are the followers of the Ramakrishna we say Ramakrishna are panama's to will give it to see Ramakrishna why we will come to that at the end of this page then he will find what happens when we are giving it to God why God is asking everything from his devotee and devotees or junuh his friend his beloved and he sees the God sees that he is Arjuna so in in talk about Gita itself he said that so that is why he is asking him to give everything here you find that if you give God something you receive it back a thousand times over that this is the reason you give all the japa only one hundred eight or maybe some people thousand and when you are doing that if we give it to God god I tried to meditate I tried to control my mind I tried to overcome all the passions and the desires now I give all those try and think to God and what I will give get back thousand more so that is the reasons Ramakrishna is giving if you give God something it's not a faith it's not the belief it is the fact because the orchestra is telling it so here I must say the cinema Krishna neighbor came to deceivers or just telling some and then the world so that will be interested in it no nothing like that the truth only whatever he said truth and it's not me Marsh are the money David vagabonds ha Swami Vivekanand then many others they say what even Bhagwan see Ramakrishna said is a truth so here when he said if you give whatever you give to God thousand times better you get back and that is why after dream meritorious deed one offers a handful of water to God that is the usual practice after doing the job after doing some good work they take a small little water in the making a cup of this palm and then it offered to God saying that the eponymous - and you need not to calculate it will automatically all those things will come back to you they say God is like the ocean the ocean never takes anything if you throw anything I'm that and if you go to the sea beach and throw a bottle or anything it will come back it never takes the same way whatever we are giving to God God don't need anything doesn't need anything so obviously it's giving back and what is giving the thousand times more that whatever here and then is telling when judicial was about to offer all his scenes to Krishna Bhima warned him do you ever do such a thing whatever you offer to Krishna you will receive back a thousandfold so that is the main thing they don't give bad things here sometimes we find that the people they are pouring water to God you know this is a system in the particularly in the southern part of India they go and they offer the half fill at the full fill pitcher the water so the poor know Kumba's naina are the combust naina nothing wrong but one should be careful what you are pouring the water is the symbol of your karma pala and if you are offering your karma Paulo to God you should be careful is it good karma color that I am giving or the bad colorful I am giving if I gave the bad karma follow thousand times more it will come back and if I give the good one of course all the time good will come back so that is the reason one should be careful show me Vivek only in one place he said there any scene committed outside the holy place the result is less but inside the holy place if you do the same scene commit the same scene the punishment will be thousand for these are not just words these are truth so one should be careful about it so he says in this that if you give God something you receive it back eight thousand four then one shadow to another well sell one should be desireless one should renounce all desire isn't that so NASA Ramakrishna is asking to one of the monks sorry Salaam o Krishna was asking to one of the amongst the one should be desireless one should renounce all desires isn't that so shadow yes sir master but I had the desire for bhakti see haha who he is teaching them I have the desire for bhakti the design for bhakti God please reveal thyself to me it is not a desire God please hold my hand and don't leave me alone it is not a desire the last time we were reading Shammi be Ganon and the Jews to say Oh mother keep me always allow me to sit on your lab all the time and hold me tight even if I did wish to go out of you don't allow me to that it's not a desire these are the prayers there slowly slowly this type of prayers that purify the mind I want to be with you God I don't want the pleasures of your Maya so that is not desire that is the prayer so ceramic isne is telling but I have the desire for Brook tea but no that is not bad rather it is good so Salaam o Krishna it mentioned in this way and ceramic Krishna then asking the shadow then the shadow said yes sir the master well said what do you think of the Vedanta now see how he is slowly slowly he's talking with the two monks and he is trying to understand how much didn't know and what actually they are doing different type of monks came but sadhana Krishna's talking with him sat for a long time and with all these topics so that means he liked them the young two monks I think they'll be very young because they were roaming around and they came from the north to the east so obviously the ceramic isness talking to them he liked them and that God is liking them and trying to help them to clear their understanding about the vedanta and the knowledge is there so blessed the ceramic is not asking one of them what do you think of the Vedanta then the shadow says it includes all the six systems of philosophy so here the answer but the other systems they won't like it that there are so many arguments and counter-arguments on that and if the big anther is having all the six with an ting they always say that but the others don't accept that there is a controversial point but he says because he loves Vedanta he said all others are included in it it includes all the six systems of philosophy Salam Krishna didn't go into that he said but the essence Abaddon the ease this is the beauty of Sri Ramakrishna we always talk about and other people they always talk about the decoding different verses only to prove how much they know but cinema Krishna is a true master true teacher he never waste time in that way he goes straight to the truth and then reveal it in that way so that oh I will read this book I will read that book why the vedanta means this that's sufficient and if you want to get the conviction some of the way the bed on time they try to prove it the two ways we can go one is shabda proof what is the proof shabda what is the shop the after baka who is the after realized soul and who can be better than Serrano Krishna he not only realized he himself was that same God in the human form so obviously having that complete faith in the belief in the words of Serrano Krishna what is the bed anta brahman alone Israel and the world illusory I have no separate existence I am the Brahman alone isn't it so Brahma shotta jagan mithya Jeeva Brahma ba na opera that is what the Shankar Acharya saved and ceramic ISNA here in his own mother tongue he said that Brahm Masha - what is that Brahman all pervasive all inclusive everything consciousness there cannot be anything else the brahma satyam jagat whatever you see is the projection on that Brahman is a super imposition on that Brahman how through Maya what is this Maya is covering the truth and imposing something else which is not truth so this is whole about the Vedanta in a nutshell this Shankar James L said sloka ardena provoke Shami you Duke to a grunter khou-tv I will tell you I'll narrate you a half a verse which the crores of the millions of scriptures are telling what is that Brahma shutter Brahman is the truth jagat mithya it is not truth Jeeva Brahma ba na opera zebra means the individual self is the brahman itself and nothing else Sadam o krishna said the same thing so just in his own language and that is butantã so then the shadow is telling that is true sir the he was telling that all philosophy inclusive in the Vedanta he could not come to this particular point did you notice that the winds Ramakrishna is asking so what do you think of Vedanta instead of telling this point he said all the six philosophies are inclusive in the Vedanta there is a different idea it may not be accepted by all there may be lot of arguments and the counter arguments cinema Krishna didn't go to that he pointed out exactly what is Vedanta so the question and the answer answer should be to the point what is the to the point what is Vedanta I am Brahman and nothing else and this world is illusory it's not false at ease there but what I see is not true it is illusionary and not false I will never say their table is not there I'll never say that I am giving a a talk and the live stream is going on or it will be online discourses it is true but this is not permanent that is the thing before me so many leaders came spiritual teachers came they also spoke maybe in those days this the high tech was not there but they also they went all around the spoke that is also there then think changed then after me also something else will come they were discussing about the 3d projection then you can see me just before you talking to you like that maybe this is the science but this is temporary so it is not there not like that but is there but at the same time it is not true why it is temporary so just like that is the reason they always say that it is like the Mirage the mirror do we see and as long as we see the mirror you never think that it is false but in reality there is nothing this is exactly what the bed Antion they talk about now this line I will read absalom Oh Krishna statement and then we will conclude for today and see Ramakrishna said but for those who lead householders life and those who identified themselves with the body this attitude I am he is not good so this is what the Ramakrishna said I am always what I feel ceramic is me is the great master and he doesn't want to spend time unnecessarily talking or arguing he goes to the truth and he point out the truth and he says understand your position and then try to go upwards so I'm a householder I have so many responsibilities and naturally being an householder even being a monk I have not overcome the body consciousness so obviously this path right this moment is not for me the but for those who lead householders life and those who identify themselves with the body this attitude what is their attitude pedantic attitude I am he I am that God it is truth but this truth right this moment I should not apply on myself because I'm not ready yet that is it's not good it is not good for the householders to
