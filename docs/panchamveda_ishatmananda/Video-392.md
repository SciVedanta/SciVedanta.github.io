[393. Panchama Veda - “Be Free From Worries”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG86S64bhTU)

their deposition Prince and let us study the Pancham away that the gospel of bhagwan's ramakrishna translated by xiaomi nikhilananda the page number 792. let us begin with this mantra jivanam strabana mangalam srimada the last two Wednesday and we were that discussing about the different stages of sadhana it is an upward spiritual growth a journey towards the unity the conception of many merges into one so that is how we all discussed the the different type of sadhanas first is prabhataka that is the beginner then who is already start practicing then they sit there he has developed the faith and some realization conviction and finally sit there sit there that is ramakrishna's words so he is the fully transformed person now this as Swami Vivekananda said that the spiritual journey actually it goes how it it is from the lower truth to higher truth it is not that from the wrong to right or from the darkness to light not light not like that it's a beautifully the Swami Vivekananda said it is from lower truth to higher truth when some people are thinking that the God is only into this particular ah form our particular place a particular something that is also OK that is also true because they are believing in the exist existence of God and their thinking in this way so slowly slowly if we see the history of the spiritual or the religious growth we will find how the human psychology human thought evolved But ultimately goes to one and when it goes to the ultimate the one and there is no two so there is no two the person who is thinking the God is there that also ceases to be he merges with the god or the aspirant becomes the same about which he or she was meditating concentrating thinking imagining it becomes the one so ultimate goal is to become one and when it becomes one that is called advaitha there is no two advaita vedanta Veda means knowledge antar is the end the last knowledge at the end of the knowledge is Oneness so when we see the picture of bhagavan Sri ramakrishna that we have installed a statue of nearly 22 feet the the biggest statue over here in Chicago in our home of Harmony there that statue shows the right hand of bhagavan sirama Krishna showing this particular form of the two fingers we can imagine that the Lord wanted to tell us that as long as there are two there are differences but when these two become one one is the paramatma and the jibatma as if he is indicating when they become one then in the left hand he is showing on the chest The Joy the happiness the Bliss the ultimate knowledge is the knowledge of one so that is the ultimate goal of all spiritual life there's Sometimes some people they cannot think of it and they think that we will go to God God is over there and then we will leave with God stay with God the in the in the near the the places of God in the heaven all these thoughts are there but this is the stages in the final stage it is one so that goes the culmination of the spiritual journey is free from Oris as long as there is Duality there is worries that we find in the that Radha as she is worrying about the Krishna the where is Krishna why Krishna is not coming to me why he is not revealing himself why I am not getting the company of the Krishna that Duality means that there's a beautiful that the bhagavan sidama Krishna said some people they want to enjoy that that is of course it is good but ultimate culmination is when the Radha Krishna there's a beautiful song The Radha Krishna that they become one tanu tanu means the body they become one the moment they become one that's parent and the object the god become one then there is no ODI so today we are going to the the bhagavan cinema Krishna in giving us the idea how to be free from all these that that we will study then let us think in this way the bhagavan he was in the Ram's house and he was discussing about different things and he said that God is under the control of his devotees this is a unique word the Beautiful World the God is under the control of his devotee the love is so wonderful that the God is also Bound by that love now the devotee and the God it is a dualistic way so again and again as because the Hinduism it merges that the Guyana and the bhakti these two paths Crossing each other almost every time and when we are talking about the vedanta the pure vedanta we never talk about God or heaven or devotee we talk about completely different way that there is nothing but one and that is consciousness but the same thing same consciousness it is taking a form that becomes easy for us ordinary people to understand and we as because we are our whole at the mental condition is like this we can understand thing if there is a name and there is a form the form is there name is there the beautiful Krishna standing in a very unique way and playing the flute immediately we start loving that particular form and we know that is God and how then does all the stories goes in his biography in his life that he is lifting the heel he is punishing the very powerful demons and these that so many things are happening miraculous powers are there so we think God is there he will protect her and at the same time he's so lovable we can love him appreciate him we can be with his in his company so that also it goes and again the same Krishna he says I have created this whole world I have created this whole world I am the Creator I am the sustainer and everything goes Within Me the 11th chapter of the bhagavad-gita where the great powerful heroic Arjuna also shaken that seeing that the Lord is taking everything the whole world into within himself as if he is just biting eating and solving them by seeing the terrible form of Destruction even the so powerful hero like Arjuna he started praying to God oh please stop this and lay I like to see you as I knew you before so that is three different forms of the same one spiritual personality now it is all pervading at the same time it can take a form a name why so that it becomes easy for us in his gospel when you are reading we find that sometimes he's giving the hint that everything is one at the same time he says well the path may be dualistic path so God is under the control of his devotees this is a very encouraging the words the if I love God the eye will be able to control the god in what we through my love I'll say now you be with me you have to eat with me you have to talk to me that love King duryodhana was very attentive to Krishna and said to him please have your meal here but the Lord went to bedura's Heart he is very fond of his devotees he ate with a simple rice and greens as if they were Celestial food it is not the Grandeur of the money the power and the social status the God will be there no so this is the teaching in one sentence bhagavan's ramakrishna giving the clear idea but most of the time do we think oh I have money I will go to the temple they will open the door whenever I want and I donate so in a separate way they will take and I will go and sit before God and God will be very happy no it is completely different I'm sorry if we can understand that this will be so this is the way we can we can feel the here there is a God he loves the devotee what type of devotee those who are genuine whether he is Rich whether he is poor whether he is educated uneducated it doesn't matter at all God is always in his wonderful way it is expressed in the bhagavan sirama Krishna giving an incident from the Mahabharata when the Lord Krishna is coming to visit duryodhana wanted to impress him because Durga also knew that Krishna is very powerful person if I can convince Krishna and can make him my friend and can bring into my the camp then it will be wonderful I can control I can conquer the pandavas so he wanted to invite the Krishna but his ego to show up that I will give you the food on the golden plate and these that but the Lord never liked it he went to the bidura also belongs to the same but he is a humble person but very very devoted to Sri Krishna buy this in the sudama Krishna is mentioning it is not the wealth it is not the Social Power but the humbleness and the devotion that you can control God control God means God will like you and he will listen to your prayer because sometimes the children they'll be crying and the mother and the father listen to him that's why we can say oh that he is controlling the child is controlling the parents it is actually the affection the law the child has no other person to pray so the child is crying and the parents out of affection they say okay what do you want you be with me so mother and father they sit with the child and talk to and play to and give the company so by that way devotee also try to control the God and constantly feeling the company of God that there are so many devotees hundreds and thousands and millions how the God one God can be everywhere with every devotee sometimes we think in this way you know if you can if you have read that bhagavata they are the Lord Krishna he alone he is Dancing with the gopis and gopinis each and every one is a very good devotee they want the Krishna to be with him or her and when one time they saw the Krishna is with him with her each and every one was feeling that I am with Krishna no one was deprived as because each and every one was genuine so each and everyone got the company of the Krishna the Rasha Leela each and everyone having the company of God why God is all pervading God is residing in the heart of each and every one and God can be with millions and trillions in any number because he's all powerful the conception of God the God only belongs to me as because I worship God in this particular form here is the god and others those who are not following my path and not having God is the wrong conception God can be anywhere in any form in any time any place because he is all powerful so these are the ideas the beautiful ideas if we can understand we understand the broadness of religion the narrowness the sectarians bigotry all that will go away and unless and until all those things goes away from the Mind One cannot reach God whatever may be the name whatever may be the form of that God God is all pervading God is everywhere it is the wish of God to be in different names and different forms in different times one cannot say that God is only with me it God is with you but God can be with some other else also so Rasha Leela where the Radha the Supreme devotee she was having the company of the Lord and she was satisfied but others were also having the same time same everywhere so this the unique conception the God can be everywhere so he imagining a perfect knower of God and the perspective bhagwan's ramakrishna is mentioning is sometimes the perfect ghani behaves like gold gyani not just one paragraph before he was mentioning God is under the control of his devotees then he gave the example of the duryodhana and bidura a rich King but proud the God is not accepting his invitation but a humble person devoted Lord is going to his home so this is very clear in the next paragraph that's why I was mentioning we must be very very careful the path of Guyana and path of bhakti is constantly Crossing each other where when you are reading the gospel of Sri ramakrishna so we should not mix it up immediately after that he see ramakrishna is mentioning sometimes a perfect gyani not a bhakta not a devotee it's a gyani a path of the knowledge that a person is following is called gyani behave like a goal it doesn't discriminate about food and drink Holiness unholiness a perfect knower of God and a perfect idiot have the same outer signs and in this line he is mentioning the god a perfect Noah of God and what it becomes gyani the nowhere means the knowledge and knowledge in Sanskrit Ghana so gyani who has understood that the God is everywhere then for him it is wonderful and how he behaves bhagavan Cinema Krishna is mentioning as long as I see God separately then I am careful the eye should be very careful to approach God so I should not go in any ordinary dress there should be a perfect dress when I am going to God I should be after cleaning my body and then only I should go like that like that all this in the temp temples in the churches everywhere the people always try to be holy so that they can approach the holiness but when you go ultimately and reach over there then what happens you become the same then there is no difference for for those who have not realized God for them Temple images and the priests are separate but the person who has realized God for him God is everywhere inside the temple outside the temple in that particular priest and outside the beggar all are the same so in the beginning we were discussing that what is that ultimate goal of of spiritual life Oneness the realization of the Oneness we can talk about it we read about it we hear about it but feeling about Oneness is really really difficult why because of the ego that I that sense separates me so that is the sadhana here bhagavan sidama Krishna is mentioning the culmination of the spiritual journey that gives us a freedom from Oris even a devotee when he is so close to God or she is so close to God but at the same time as a different kind of Ori is there constantly thinking will the God be with me can I talk to God today will he appear before me that tension is always there but when you become one the God and the devotee then there is Noory and that particular condition is called gyani is coming to that first through devotion one can control God because the love that binds God second when one become one with God that is the perfect condition of devotion and that is called the gyani the position of that the person is known as the Innova Brahman nor of God gyani a perfect note of God and the perfect idiot of same outer signs how because the outwardly the behavior is completely the same a perfect gyani perhaps does not utter the Mantra while bathing in the Ganges the traditional Hindus when they go to bed in the ganga they will be first touching the water holy water and they won't touch the feet they will touch the water in the hand and they will pray all these the mantras are there and the ganga stotra is there they will sprinkle on the head then it will go inside the water and that is the ganga worship first you will do gani perhaps doesn't utter the mantras while bathing in the Ganges while worshiping God perhaps he offers all the flowers together at his feet then you know there are many mantras are there so all the gods and goddesses Demi gods and goddesses so they will be going going on giving so in the if you have observed the Hindu the the Performing the Puja every time they will take a flower and uttering a name of god or goddess they'll offer like that they will go on saying but the gyani who has already realized the God he knows they are not different only one we at this moment when we do not know we are trying to appease all gods and goddesses if you go to any Hindu family you will find so many gods and goddesses in their shrine I have visited so many houses everywhere they will keep so many gods and goddesses and sometimes some people will keep their and the ancestors pictures also maybe grandfather or the grandmother or the father of the mother those who have passed away they also consider them as God and Goddesses they will be keeping in the shrine the same way their guru's photo is also there and they are worshiping maybe the Lord Krishna at the same time in one corner there will be Shiva there will be Kali there will be these there will be that so many why because we think God may be manifesting through different forms so I should not say the I I don't worship this only one so that is called prabhataka they are beginning slowly slowly when the knowledge Dawns and they can understand everything is nothing but the one manifesting through one and that Oneness gives the knowledge not only the god I am worshiping outside as an image or a picture but the God is also Within Me I am that God a few days before when we were worshiping the mass saradamani Devi celebration I was showing the devotees how the pujari is showing both the hands like this you know that that the aesthetic sense is also there like this also you can do but when you are crossing the hands the both the feet and the whole body and the head and your Crossing like this it goes beautifully the aesthetic way but what he is mentioning I am that God I am going to worship here in this case bhagavan sirama Krishna he was worshiping sirama Krishna so sarvodaya Buddhism so he was going on altering and why he's showing the hand like that from my head up to toe I am that this is Hinduism I am going to worship the God but who am I I am also the same I too am the same God but right this moment I want to enjoy separating myself from God and worshiping God that is called Hinduism is so broad so vast so unfathomable eunuch we are not afraid of God and I am mentioning right from the head up to the toe I am that purity can we think of oh God in my feet that is called knowledge each and every part of my body is nothing but that purity everyone I am going to worship you devam bhutwa devam jajid I am going to worship the God by becoming devata divine otherwise I cannot unless and until I become that I cannot worship that God so this uniqueness the moment you become one you're a gyani and that gyani how he behaves because everything is nothing but the same the manifestation of the same God whether you give one one flower offering and uttering the name of different God or take all the flowers and offer at a time is the same for him unless and until you are truly feeling that you have to practice one by one just after reading this book if we go and take all the flowers and to save time oh that is this and it's okay no it won't so that's why we have to understand that when we are performing we should be genuine in feeling in realization in understanding so otherwise outward Behavior has nothing to do we can deceive people by saying oh God is one I have realized God but your behavior how you are thinking now it comes to a man cannot renounce action as long as it desires worldly enjoyment now action action means the karma and it is related with the desire when the desire is there the action is there now I like to eat something I have to go to the market I have to purchase those ingredients then I have to cook properly and then I can enjoy that particular plate particular food so desires to eat or taste enjoy that particular food so naturally it is related with the action but if you don't have the desire no action similarly when I don't have any desire in this world it becomes Karma siddhi it is a great idea there is completely free from action first is shravana then Manana nidhi diasana then first I am hearing about God that is the beginning of my life's journey the many of the people they particularly westerners they read from here and there and mainly about the yoga and they think that it is a great thing that that Kundalini jagran etc etc and some of the the people also mentioning that but this is we have to understand one thing what is this Kundalini what is this power suppose this Rises OK what is going to happen to us just we are Imagining the Kundalini jagran and all that you know that sometimes I hypnotize myself thinking that I have realized God but your behavior your action that will show that whether you have realized or not this is ramakrishna is mentioning those who have truly realized God those who have become one with God how they will behave when Arjuna is asking the second chapter of the bhagavad-gita how I will understand the one person who has realized truly realize God that in the bhagavan Krishna he is giving the complete idea is the first line means giving up now pra that prefix pro means perfectly perfectly his mind is completely free From Desire Prada come on Karma means the desire so when all desire each and every little desire also sometimes jokingly mother is also is to say ma sarasamani Devi bhagwan sirama Krishna even the desire to eat something if it is there then again you have to come down you have to come and enjoy that a little desire also will not allow you to go pass through that is when someone has been able to completely give up each and every desire not an aorta of Desire is there in his mind know him as a perfect person or a god-realized person or a man of knowledge so when we go and judge the mahapurusha these there are different type of names they take and then they will be behaving like that and it looks that they also dress in such a way that oh it looks really really the great but all performers but his performance is making the day trying to impress people that it doesn't I don't know if people are satisfied is okay but the true thing is is not having any desire then what is there why is surviving love love for the beings after the realization he feel oh my God look at these people sometimes you will find a person who became very very successful in his life then after the retirement goes back to his own village from where he started his study and he goes and tried to help those little boys the young boys and girls the students so that they can also grow up now he satisfied he is now complete then after that he is not simply forgetting rather going down to that particular place where from he started his journey and now trying to help Those whom he doesn't know may perhaps there's no relation not that there is all relatives no but because of the love or these children are also in the same condition as I was now after the realization of God some people some great Soul they come down and they help people Swami Vivekananda the great mind he said as long as even a dog will be hungry that means any suffering anywhere why he mentioned dog the street dogs you know in India has a very wretched life so like that I will come back I will serve them so that is the not that he is not free he is the Shiva himself he's completely free because of Love they come down the P after the successful life I have seen many people in America and in Great Britain in Canada they're thinking about their own village own school unowned people we like to help them I know a doctor doctor successful doctor he has started one school over there in his own village and there he is giving them the help so this is the way the Love Goes Down so sometimes the perfect gyani behaves like this and he does not discriminate about food so this is the way we have to understand the Great Soul so outward the dress and the behavior and the talk and the popularity and the money nothing will be so to understand a perfect person is mentioning a man cannot renounce action as long as he desires worldly enjoyment as long as one cherishes a desire for enjoyment one performs action in two lines in this book The Master Mercier very clearly mentioning the statement of bhagwan's ramakrishna the action at different time it says the karma the four stages four different tribes karma is action the karma action why we do action because we have some desire something we like to do now after coming over here in Chicago it came into me that this is the place where in the whole series of the human the growth if we take it for 10 000 years of civilization the first time in the human history in Chicago all the religious leaders came together sat on the same platform and at rest the people and talked about their own paths and they were side by side sitting not fighting not arguing but just disclosing I like this way I like this way that much there's a unique thing unity in diversity there are differences but we are united how because as I am thinking that I will reach to that goal by this way you are also thinking let us go in your own way why should I have to change or to criticize or to create problem for others no that is the sign of civilization understanding accepting cooperating that is the sign of civilization it's not some the beautiful building and these and that that is not civilization civilization is the broadness of mind so we are civilized now and that happened over here in Chicago now we have published a beautiful calendar one of our devotee I mean she is also a monastic member and a nun she after the research the beautifully you know every year we published the the calendar there's all the informations are there as a calendar at the same time the other page will give you the information about this the how it came long before the Chicago parliamentary religion the world conferences were held so 18 851 from that London and all the all this history coming down 1892-93 about that we all know because that was the first time they organized the Parliamentary religion that dear it began embodiment of the Parliamentary religion it is Sri Rama it is of said the same power manifested at different time for different type of purposes different type of people and this time the purpose is to show the world all paths are leading to the same goal at the time of Sri Rama there was no different religions at least we do not know at the time of Krishna there is only sanatana Dharma so when he says he is not mentioning different religions disciplining different duties the Dharma here the duty is the responsibilities so give up all those and come to me surrendered to me that is the meaning but when bhagavan sirama Krishna came in 1850 35 36 he was born in 1836 that time in the whole world so many varieties of religions the paths and philosophies now the god he was practicing all paths in his own life and his mind was so focused So within few days he could realize the truth and he ultimately he said all paths are leading to the same goal any religion it can take you any path can take you to the same goal if you are sincere if you are genuine in that and no conflict but unfortunately because of the misunderstanding some of the egoistic people who took up the mental on them and thinking they are the keepers of religion they started fighting and in the name of religion hundreds and thousands of people have been killed so much a Bloodshed because of the religion a group section of people a group of people they started shunning the religion now what is this religion that making us different here is the answer bhagavan's ramakrishna is the answer religion not to be the the way to the when we are talking about that that we should not denounce religion religion is pure only application only misunderstanding misinterpretation that depends on those people who are ignorant was selfish that's why we have to understand who is a religious person who is not having any desire that is the criteria whatever may be the religion whatever may be the language if the person who is demanding that he is a religious person the only the year stake is are you having any desire selfish desire then you are not so that's the bhagwan's ramakrishna is mentioning then I thought as sirama Krishna he practiced and propagated this particular they all paths are leading to the same goal this is a unique way that we can the humanity can grow grow in peace in Harmony in happiness Why not start so we purchased a particular the place in Chicago and started home of Harmony that is the name I have given home of Harmony and Swami Vivekananda came and he talked about that that is the ideal very humble then not that the so-called big spiritual teachers are coming and talking it will take time but it is the first day and it was necessary and Chicago is the place where it should be then slowly slowly by the grace of God when people will understand when they will come in the last from the ma May 21st we inaugurated and every Saturday different religious leaders they came they expressed their views and the slowly slowly it is becoming a very friendly place one Muslim gentleman came and he prayed before sudama Krishna he was praying his God the Allah but in for in in the front of sudama Krishna there he was not hesitant I also was not hesitant to allow him yes why not and the Christian and the Jewish they all came and different type of other the people they are performing in different way they all came this is really really unique now that will reach to the the other organizations religions they will also think that why not let us develop this idea so that's ramakrishna's idea and really really very Catholic very broad very unique and that is the only solution to solve the conflict between religions and philosophy is mentioning what is the goal of religion that is also we follow religion without knowing that what is the goal there is a vague idea of Heaven no one knows what is this heaven oh there is a beautiful place there is these there is that all imaginations that those who are very rich that the Kings and the queens and the very very rich people that they are living in the heaven only why they should go to heaven then what is this heaven or the lot of food and no tension and ultimately thing is there is no worrying and that bhagavan sudama Krishna is mentioning that each and every one of us we are chasing the happiness knowingly unknowingly I have to become a doctor I have to become an engineer I have to become these that why to become happy after becoming a doctor if I am not happy they notice the use of that knowledge I am constantly suffering mentally apparently people are saying who is a great doctor but inside mentally I am constantly suffering is that the ultimate goal no this is the happiness and how it is possible is giving that example a bard sat absent-mindedly on a must of a sheep anchored in the Ganges slowly the ship sailed out into the ocean when the bird came to his senses it could find no Shore in any direction because in the sea there is nothing anywhere it flew towards the north hoping to reach land it went very far and grew very tired but could not find no sure what could it do it returned to the ship and sat on the mast after a long while the bird flew away again and this time toward the East it couldn't find the land in that direction either everywhere it saw the nothing but the Limitless ocean very tired it again returned to the ship and sat on the mast after resting a long while the bird went toward the South and towards the West when it found no sign of land in any direction it came back and settled down on the Mast it did not leave the Mast again but sat there without making any further effort it no longer felt Restless or worried because it was free from ODI it made no further effort then the captain who was prison he exclaimed mentioned ah what an illustration how to be free from ODI completely depending on God whatever will happen happen what I can do the way that way the Masters in the story The Mast of the ship is nothing but that God and when I am worrying what is going to happen to my son to my daughter to myself to my service to my job depend on God all worries will go so long I am surviving every day every moment all protection came all Health came to me up to these I grew then why I am worrying somebody must be there whom people call as God to look after me have the faith in the words of the scripture and the guru and completely surrendered to God that is the ultimate of religion but it is very difficult to surrender when the SRI ramakrishna is mentioning sorry how to be free from the ODI there's so many books out there so many different way people are mentioning practice these practice that and you should close the right nostril and take 11 time breathing in from the left nostril so anyways the people will be telling the practices are okay but the ultimate thing if we can have the complete faith in the existence of God and depend on God as the bird in the story was depending on the Mast ultimately it tried it tried it tried not south east west then ultimately it was sitting on that you know that it is going to reach somewhere and I will be fine so that is the moral of the story that we have to depend on God to be free from the oldies the cinema Krishna is continuing worldly people wonder about the four quarters of the Earth for the sake of Happiness four quarters means east west north south like that so that is the everywhere they go for happiness but they don't find it anywhere they only become tired and very the people they are studying and they are giving the competitive exam and they're coming to the foreign land they're getting the job then they are getting married they are purchasing a house they're purchasing the car but then again they're telling oh no I'm not satisfied so at the very end of their life they don't find the happiness why because the completion is not there why desire is there as long as the desire is there you can never become satisfied so what is the ultimate thing the Ori will be there when you are having the wealth oh I am having the wealth maybe the decoys are there bad people are there if you're having the beauty of your physical Beauty you will be worrying about why I'm growing old what will happen wrinkle will come on my skin these that worrying about the beauty worrying about the world the name and fame in the social status I was the great singer I was a great actor I was a great leader now the younger people are coming up they are taking my place what will happen to me oring so in everything the people will be ordering why desire is there suppose you don't bother about what is the the wrinkle is coming on the body let it come and if you think the money is going let it go whatever to enjoy I have enjoyed so many places in the world I have visited I have seen everywhere is nothing but the same same type of shop same type of building same type of people the same way they live what else to see wherever you go the same thing but still we go if I say like this and if you people take my word seriously then the tourism will stop so naturally the people they are going only or if I go to the South it is beautiful play if I go to the north it is so wonderful so all this way constantly the tourism going on they are traveling they are spending money their The energy they have all everything only for happiness but after all these when they settled they found the happiness is within myself Within Me and that is I'm free from desire when that Dad goes all desires goes I'm fully satisfied completely satisfied and that is exactly the teaching of sudama Krishna the worldly people they wonder about to the four quarters of the Earth for the sake of Happiness they don't find it anywhere they only become tired and ODI when through their attachment to lust and gold the only suffer misery they feel an urge toward dispassion and renunciation most people cannot renounce lust and Gold without first enjoying it there are two shorts of people those who stay in one place and those who go about to many places in Sanskrit they say chaka kuti chaka is sitting in one place they don't go anywhere but they are very satisfied because they know this is the word so I why what I'm going to see this is not necessary so that is called and bohu udaka udaka means water a person who is visiting different places that means drinking water of different places so they say bohu udaka so by that way that means he is a traveler visiting so many places that one person came over here is a really very courageous person the young man who buy on bicycle disturbing traveling the whole world he has completed almost the whole world and now he came to America and the visiting the whole America from west to the East and then he will go to other places and finally return back to India he's from India now when I was asking what have you seen you are showing the picture and the people and experience different places different type of experiences then I asked what finally you are going to do you cannot continuously all through your life go on cycling you will settle down isn't it then what you will only the experiences of visiting different places will remain over there for few days you can have some contact with the people that you have visited in different places then slowly they will also forget and people will also forget then what only in your remembrance you will go on telling the younger generation you know I traveled in this is this and he will be showing the paper cuttings magazines the that published your traveling that is okay then finally are you happy that is the question million dollar Christian am I happy after performing all these so if I am not happy then what is the purpose of visiting talking with all these that and how to be that happiness will come how that one can become happy bhagavan's ramakrishna said two different ways one having the faith in the existence of God and depending on God and second not only dependence become one with God when you feel that you are that God when there will be no desire then that particular the cover that was covering your real nature will go away and you will find oh I am that I was searching for God but I am that God I was searching for happiness but I am the source of happiness I was worrying but there is no reason to worry that is the ultimate of religion thank you friends we will stop over here and in next Sunday again we'll start from 793 at the page any question Sangeeta is asking how can we control our anger in adverse situation this is a good question you know Sangeetha the adverse situation the anger comes when our desires are not satisfied but if you think that I should perform this Duty perform this action perform this work in this way but somebody else maybe your boss they're asking you not to that if you can adjust okay I am here to perform this work now I was thinking to do this work in this way but my boss says that you should in this way it is OK let me do it in Bengali they say it is your goat and you like to cut it either from the tail side or from the neck side it is up to you I am yet to cut it then just tell me from which side so that way if you surrender see yeah you can tell the boss or tell that person if you do like this it is good but if they are not listening to it ok no problem how you want me to do that I will do that and I suppose that is not the moral work then take off your hands they'll say no I am not going to perform that go away from there this is the one-way action wise but spiritually go on praying for those people oh God they are not understanding properly can you please turn their mind so that they can understand me properly and we can become friendly we can live together happily you will find that you will also solve the problem thank you is asking please guide me how to control the diverse nature of mind that is the practice you know that a diverse nature of mind how the mind means thought then how these different type of thoughts are coming because different type of things that you are hearing or your reading or you are seeing so by that way as we always say and as a student of vedanta you all know the puncture the gyanendria this is the eye the nose the tongue the ear and the touch we are always collecting information and that information goes to the mind so the different type of thoughts are coming because of different type of experiences and if you think that those experiences those thoughts are disturbing your mind try to keep distance make distance if possible completely separate them from you then the mind will be all right if not suppose you are in the working field then as the beautifully one of our Saints says say yes yes to all people and keep them in Good Humor as they call it in English keep them in Good Humor but you remain in your own place only thing that it is not immoral that you should be very careful and this if this is immoral immediately detest yourself in no way you should be there and finally when you are controlling your mind only one thought will continue and that thought again I will say will come if you pray to God oh God please help me he's asking please help me to deal with a spouse who constantly complains about others and worry about things that might happen in future please help me you see that spouse means is very difficult you know that because of the past Karma some people are like that but the only way to expose him or her in a positive thoughts so when we are discussing this Gospel of sirama Krishna we are trying to give always the positive ideas and if you can expose him or her into this on a different type of the words the sum of the people they talk nicely but they themselves are not the pure people their characters their the manners are different so don't listen to them that won't give you the perfect that effect in the mind they are like the performers like the movie artists the when they are talking they are moving they are doing there is a they are very attractive but that much entertainment but for the enlightenment you have to expose him or her to the right type of teaching I would suggest the best way is the gospel of sudama Krishna suppose you were close to him or her just try to read one or two pages from that book or just open one or two talk on that so that he or she will listen and slowly slowly will get changed the man a person is nothing but his or her thought and if that thought changes everything will be all right complaining means the lot of desires are there if those desires are not satisfied they they complain but when they understand whatever they have God that is sufficient millions of people have not got that even then this complaining nature will go away try that is asking is dependent on God and self-confidence conflicting no because the way you are depending on God you are depending on yourself because that is the self-confident person only can depend on God you know how the if you are doubtful about God you won't be able to depend on God as because you are confirmed whatever happened happens once I have thought that the God is there and I am going to depend that means that you are self-confident both goes hand in hand they are not separate they are the same thing thank you always asking swamiji I am I am with someone who is extremely lazy I have not seen these things from childhood I've grown up around very active parents now seeing laziness I feel very angry how to cope up with this so this is the different type of characteristics now as because you just try to help that person to be active but at the same time you also Ponder you also think meditate are you too active or things can be done in a slow way also because instead of going out and criticize some people and thinking that because of them you are not happy why not Ponder why not focus on your own self is it necessary to do that in that way it can wait for some time also you can both of you will be in another middle path not extreme I think that will help so both of you will understand each other and he or she that company will also adjust with you and he will also adjust with them so that is the way the life becomes all right Sometimes some people they are so intelligent they understand things so quickly and they start thinking around why these people are not understanding you will notice it in the in the children's School there's some children they are very bright very intelligent they understand things and whenever the teacher says they listen they immediately understand and that is over they know that this is this I have learned and they will start playing they'll start creating something and naturally the energy is there then the teacher will say oh this is a naughty boy as a Very unattentive Girl not that they have understood all those so that is the way you have to understand I can't do it so quickly but this person cannot so well let me do it in a slow manner so that he can also cope up with me this will help you thank you srima vishwas is asking how can we meditate srima this is a practice you know constantly meditation the if you have already taken the initiation from a guru who has taught you or otherwise what you can do you can choose a god or goddess and or in a just think that within the center part of your heart there is a flower on the flower there is a burning lamb and try to visualize that flower and the lamb forgetting your own body and don't think the physical heart it is just imagine that there is a beautiful flower on the flower there is a lamb and the lamp the light is not flickering it is still as if the it is burning in a place where is there is no flow of air so that way if you can try to imagine even a flash you know one or two minutes that will be sufficient for meditation every day at least twice or Thrice if you practice if you are trying for 10 minutes maybe 10 seconds you will get that view that is sufficient try in that way is asking why do some saints in their poems call themselves Sinners even though they have realized God oh that is the to express the humbleness you know that the Sinners means we are no one we have nothing oh God you are the only one like that that they express the humbleness that is there so are the good questions thank you and uh you know that this reading I am sitting over here in Chicago in America and then reading out and you people are listening and why all this only one that we should be happy the reading means not that the holy book we should read not that and it is only when only reason that we should be happy and to become happy we should have the clear idea that every day we are becoming old and going towards death and if the mind which is having so many different type of thoughts if we cannot now slowly slowly minimize those and focus on something which will bring happiness to me then what is the purpose of this human life are the animals they survive only for survival but the human survive only to go beyond this life life and death Circle so let us try and then pray both this together that will give us the success and someday we will be able to say as the rabindranath said even the death becomes a lovable God Marana Ray to whom Momo sham or Shaman the death is the greatest fear but one who has understood that the death cannot create any problem for them so that happiness should come the slowly slowly reduce the desire try to understand others and give them Liberty and freedom before me this world was after me this world will be why unnecessarily I worry so so that should be the conception so let us pray to the God and offer our pranam and we conclude is [Music] [Music] oh oh Shanti Shanti Shanti harihio that's it SRI Rama Krishna namastu [Music]
