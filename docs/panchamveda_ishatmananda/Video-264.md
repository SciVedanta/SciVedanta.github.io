[265: Panchama Veda 265: God's Love for His Devotees](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aAxKYs2MY3c)

good evening dear devotees and friends now we will study the gospel of krishna as i call it panchama veda now this is the last class of this year 2020 and then next two months january and february we won't have these discourses we'll go for recess and then from the march onwards again we will start now this we will start as usual with the sloka tabok the nectar the amrit that the lord is giving to us through his words and that if we can understand if we can take then what will happen we will get the ultimate goal of the spiritual life and what is the ultimate goal of spiritual life peace please eternal so that is the ultimate goal now it is the process slowly slowly you have to go over there and why this process we are practicing because we have forgotten that in reality we are that brahman we are that consciousness we are that bliss eternal we have forgotten it why you have forgotten now the vedantes say it is because of the maya and this maya is the power of god so we have to go back to god we have to get his blessings his grace then only his power the maya will open the gate for us to enter into as the bible say kingdom of heaven what is this we always say that please full of please now bhagavan srirama krishna is suggesting that those who are householders should not try to follow immediate the monks the two different type of mentalities and because of the past karmas because of the samskaras this come now we are not going to enter into that discussion the suggestions that bhagavan si ramakrishna gave for the householders those who are willing to realize god what they should do majority of the people that think that we should go out from the home and we should have a monastic life and then without that we cannot have the realization that says in the upanishads also in our scripture without renouncing you cannot get the amrit the eternal bless it is not possible but what is that tiago majority the people they interpreted that you have to leave the heart and home and what happened to those who are not ready for that a miserable life they come and then they leave for some time and then they feel the this is not the way that we want it and they cannot go back to for something and they bring down the ideals also not only they live a wretched life but they bring down the highest ideal of the tyaga of the sannyasi's life to boga the secretly they will be doing all the things that is not at all goes with the spiritual life but that is the reason bhagavan says this is the uniqueness of bhagavan siram krishna he always says where you are now in the household no problem for you start from there so we will discuss that in the last wednesday we have already discussed in bhagavatam krishna said fight from inside a fort thought means you are inside your home so he meant the fort means the home when the soldiers are fighting and we all know of course nowadays everything is completely different and they are not going to fight face to face but the fort is meant where the soldiers they stay together and they learn they are comfortable over there and from there sometimes they will go out for attack and then again they will come back the forties that which gives the complete support the householders house is that for bhagavatam krishna said you need food and for food you have to go out and you have to bake that is the sannyasi is life and you need clothings you need each and everything that a human need to survive so obviously where you are going you are going out to the society to beg for that why you are having that why should you have too big it's not necessary moreover your temperament is not that you will go and bake it is not like that you won't be able to do that you won't be able to bear all those things that you have to face externally or suppose you are now now almost all the hindu organizations are also having the akhadas astramas centers well the same minded people they leave over there but you have to adjust with them varieties of people different type of people and they are not earning anything they are not doing any business and they are not going for job so they are depending on the society for donation so that is again the same different thing is coming so sirama krishna is asking those who have grown up into that atmosphere of the home why you have to leave the home this is the unique advice of suramar krishna what you need to withdraw the mind only and to withdraw the mind that is called tapasya that is called austerity that is called spiritual practice why you have to leave the home at hearthand home be there and you have already completed all your duties now you are safe over there you have someone to cook for you at least you can help yourself also for the clothings there you are there everything is there and you are free that is the main thing and what you should do now i was thinking the what are the main two enemies what are the enemies we can ask what are the enemies of spiritual life only two bhagavan sri krishna says this is the uniqueness all the hindus avataras and the gurus they always say not much only one or two but of course to attain that to do that is very difficult the krishna says your enemy enemy why because they will never allow you to develop the spiritual life otherwise it is okay in the society also if you have the karma and krodha then of course there are other problems are there but still in the spiritual life no no no you cannot you cannot do anything with these two so they are the enemies of the spiritual life karma the desire growth anger and why i am angry because i am not satisfied so that is why the anger the when the karma the desire is not satisfied then the krodha usually comes the kama asia grow the asia these these the sri krishna the lord he said this is your enemy why you are blaming others oh because of that person i cannot meditate because of they cannot do this so instead you can always think of course i know that we all understand in the household particularly some of the places there will be problem in the household but still we can do like this now i was thinking that let us analyze the suppose a married person having wife and children what he should do second unmarried middle-aged person and he is still in the household but not married what he should do and third unmarried young people what they should do so these are the three things these are the three things that is happening married having wife and children now let us think in this way if the children are young and the couple they are also not not that very old they are also young so what should be their responsibility swadharma and what is the swadharma the sadharma means he should go to the job he should earn money or do some business the earning money and like that it should go on and then they should try to slowly grow the spiritual life how the early morning they get up and they go to the personal shrine and there they are meditating a little then go to the office and coming back once again then again sitting for the meditation for a little maybe 10 minutes 15 minutes morning 10 minutes and evening 10 minutes sufficient in between if you can read a holy book good or when you are driving or you are traveling if you can hear some lectures or some devotional songs good the somehow you have to keep the mind again and again at the feet of god that is the main thing a person then who is having the young children he has the responsibility to help them to grow so this is one so we are keeping in the mind that we are one day i like to dedicate my whole soul for the realization of god this is one thing i'm fighting from the fort according to bhagavan siram krishna another those householders almost retired are going to be returned and their children are grown up they are also subtle now the responsibility are not much their routine should be different you should try to think that whatever the knowledge that we have acquired the let us serve let us give it back to the society if possible if cannot go and help the society physically well i can help them with some monetary help or some other way and then giving more time in reading holy books having some companion of the holy people sometimes visiting out to the different centers holy places temples churches and like that so they have to develop a routine more time should be spent on spiritual life i would suggest if you are a retired person and health is all right if possible four hours for spiritual practices like meditation like doing japa and the same that way and then four hours if possible read different books holy books there may be biographies of different holy people a little gita then the upanishad listen to the different talks nowadays in the modern society so many varieties a talks are there you can listen note down and whichever is appealing to you try to concentrate on that so this is the one way for four or four hours means eight hours your mind is dedicated to god eight hours the work and suppose you can dedicate some unretired person sometimes you have to depend on your physical condition if you can do some work you can go to some society and the asthma give some voluntary work or giving coaching to the young people the poor people doing some work get associated with them and do some physical work also and then balance eight hours is yours then you can eat sleep etc and you can make it 10 hours for your personal six hours for your work or four hours and 14 hours like that that you can always adjust but make a routine [Music] and this is for those who are married having the wife and children now the third if the wife is also of the same temperament same mentality then there is no problem if not you have to adjust with heart too and that you have to make your own way unmarried middle-aged people if they are interested in developing the spiritual life living in the household you are earning money and some portion of your money you should keep for yourself and so that when you are retired that you can help yourself first second you have to make a routine as i suggested the same way you have to make a routine and since young age still middle age means you are working that you have a lot of time you are spending for your office work or the business work so a little time you are giving for spiritual but you should get associated with some organization go to them whom you like sit with them talk to them maybe you were sitting in the library or in the shrine doing some voluntary work get associated with them because you are going to be alone afterwards so your your journey will slowly slowly spiritual journey means it is a lonely journey don't think the friends will be there the families will be there the grandchildren will be there following no no no it's all alone and that is the reason you have to go on analyzing who is there that is shankaracharya's the beautiful way bhaja govindam govindam you have to be slowly slowly you have to be alone you are you will be alone so prepare the mind and get associated with the society so that society the spiritual people the religious people religious minded people will be your companion the middle aged unmarried person you have to prepare your life for the spiritual journey because you are planning to fight from the fort and the young people after finishing their education maybe after working in the in the world for some time if you are feeling the strong arch to develop spiritual life and if you are below 30 it is better to join a monastic monastery or the convent if you are a girl you can go to a convent that will help you so that will help you to grow in your spiritual life or otherwise you can go to the second or the first one so that is the way bhagavan ramakrishna suggested that one can fight from the fort from inside the fort now many they say that you have to this world is all misery full of misery so give up everything come out then don't do like that so try to understand what actually we are going to uh overcome our desire karma desire i can do it from anywhere this is the practice and for that i need some guidances i need some idols before me who has already done it so swami vivekananda bhagavan sirama krishna caitanya mahaprabhu shankaracharya so like that jesus christ these are the people i should keep before me and then accordingly i will try to develop my life these are pretty practical suggestions i am giving then bhagavatama krishna also in encouraging meditation or yoga through songs there is a very another uniqueness of bhagavatam krishna and if we go back to the old time of the vedas there were the rishis who is to realize the truth through songs and whatever they have realized it and they recorded it they have given it to their children to their students through songs so that is the way also before bhagavan sirama krishna and there were two other people very famous the kamula kantha and ram prasad they realized god through songs sirama krishna also appreciating that system that path krishna is embracing each and every everything so that is the way he is embracing so suramar krishna is also supporting this path so we will read from here the sonama krishna waiting and a musician was expected he was to sing with his party sudan krishna asked the devotees every now and then where is the musician the mohimacharan he was a man of knowledge he wanted to have the discussion the all this devotion he was not liking those things so mahima charan told what we are quite all right as we are that means the ramakrishna is sitting devotees are there discussions are going on why then these musicians told the master said no sir you get this all through the year these discussions through the year but the devotion the sometimes through the songs that is also essential a devotee outside the room said the musician has come sudama krishna was filled with joy and said ah has he then he max was prayed on the floor of this long baranda in the northeast of the master's room suramar krishna said sprinkle a little ganges water on the mats many worldly people have sat on them a preparation for puja and what is that puja songs and these songs means kirtan and when they're going to see it sirama krishna is taking care of the devotees he's telling sprinkles some ganga water and purify the seed because the people who are going to sit over there should not be affected by the thor that has got associated with those mats and seeds because some people who came who were not at all of spiritual minded their association that has may be contaminated is very difficult but this is a very subtle thing in spiritual life and that's why they always say when you are using a seat for meditation that will be your seat and you should always use that because the thought that you are constantly thinking sitting on that that is also getting associated on that seat and the clothings that you are using at for the time of meditation every day before sitting in the meditation you should use that not the different every time changing so that is the thing that one should try so this ramakrishna is telling that the mats were sprayed on the floor the long barranda and sudamakis the ladies of priya babus priya babu's family from bali had come to visit the temples they wanted to listen to the kirtan a devotee said to suramar krishna these ladies have been inquiring whether there would be any place in the room for them can they have seeds the kitten had already began the master said no no where any room here well already people are sitting now to make the room for those ladies and in those days at the time of bhagavatama krishna that was completely different type the ladies they never exposed themselves or the people could not see the faces of those ladies uh where they will see it who will arrange the whole thing will be disturbed the sudama krishna said no no not now there is no seed so they now narayan arrived so this is i have marked it this is a boy who was having a great quality bhagavan sirama krishna liked him very much narayan arrived and saluted sirama krishna the latter said tenderly bhagavan sriram krishna very tenderly said to him why have you come your people at home have beaten you so much so just this it gives us another thing that as because this young boy used to come to bhagavan srirama krishna the family of his father uncle they didn't like that he should come and they were afraid that he maybe leave the heart and may leave the heart and home can me become a monk so they didn't like it that is also another mentality particularly the asians they are so connected with the all the family members they don't like to send them but they are very respectful for the monks for the nuns for the holy people but sarcastically they don't want that there boys and girls should become like that they will go and touch the feet of the holy people and they will say sir please bless my son bless my daughter and when the son said father can i also become like that no no you should not you should read you should become a doctor or an engineer or then like this they will say so this is always they cannot understand what is spiritual life they are not fully clear about the spiritual life so they are afraid and they don't like to part with their children so they say the narayan that young boy he was having the love for bhagavan's ramakrishna and the great attraction for spiritual life and secretly used to come and visit the holy place and used to talk with sirama krishna and when his parents came to know about it they punished that boy and they threaten that you should not go as they usually the guardians they do they say to that to him but even then he has come to suramar krishna and he was going inside the room not outside if anyone noticed sudano krishna was worried about him and asking why have you come and he signed to babur ram to give narayan something to eat the young boy has come maybe he has not eaten and taken anything maybe a little hungry so he as rama krishna asked by sign to babur ram to give some food narayan entered the master's room suddenly salam krishna followed him he wanted to feed narayan with his own hands afterwards he returned to the baranda this is a rare thing ramakrishna when listening to the song it is not for entertainment it is for enlightenment that is the specialty of sadama krishna when he's sitting and listening to that those devotional songs and if those songs are sang with true devotion sirama krishna used to merge into those and he never left that because it is a meditation but this time he went into inside the room to feed that nada and so much of love for the boy afterwards in the next page we will come to that and he is telling many devotees were present including bijay mahima charan narayan aim and the young gopal soon narayan came back to the baranda and took his seat by the master about three o'clock other arrived at the sight of him sirama krishna excited appeared excited the devotee saluted the master and sat on the floor sirama krishna become to him to come nearer he was so loving to all the devotees bhagavan krishna is asking them to come to near near to god so they were so blessed the god himself is calling them beckoning them come to me come to near to me when the music was over the gathering of devotees broke up some began to stroll in the garden and some went to the temple to watch the evening service in the evening arrangements were made for kirtan inside master's room those who have visited dakshinesha they know it's not a very big room but even then that arrangement was made over there and salaam krishna eagerly asked a devotee to have an extra lamb the two lambs lit the room brightly sudama krishna said to be joy see look at this the small little thing when some celebration is there he will come and sing and then people will be there and in a in a dirk people cannot do like that so one should be careful one should know what to do and what not to do so that is the way the surama krishna said bring another light and try to make it more lighted so people can get the joy as the first tip mode will be there sudama krishna said to be joy why are you sitting there come nearer to me this time the kitten created an intense atmosphere the master danced in an ecstasy of joy the devotees also danced encircling him while bijay was dancing his clothes dropped he was unconscious when the music was over bijay began to look for his key which had fallen somewhere master washer giving a full description if we read and while reading someone is reading if we close our eyes we'll be transported to that particular the place and the time and we can see the whole thing going on over there the master said to him with a laugh why bother about it anymore because why about the key and the boxes and all that so be like this he meant that bijay should have nothing more to do with boxes and keys kishori saluted sadama krishna and was about to take his leave the master blessed him touching his chest tenderly and bad in goodbye his words were full of love in the gospel and the gopal saluted the master they too were about to take leave he said to them with the same affection couldn't you go tomorrow morning you may catch cold at night sirama krishna this is called divine love these people were not connected not from his family but still his love for them concern for them that it is a cold evening if they are going back so they may catch cold so he the amen gopal decided to spend the night with suramar krishna they sat on the floor with few other devotees sirama krishna had at no rest the whole day the devotees had been with him all the time he went out for a few minutes returning to the room he saw aim taking down a song from ramallah what are you doing aim said that he was writing down a song on being told what the song was the master remarked it was a rather long song aim wrote a line or two then stopped writing a little later sri ramakrishna took his supper of pudding and one or two luchis a lighted lighted lamb stood on a stand by his side him sat near him the master asked if there were any sweets in the room eem had brought some sweets shandesh which he had put on the shelf sadam krishna asked him to give him a sweet ames searched for the sweets but couldn't find them he was embarrassed they had been given to the devotees they're so common this type of things that every time always happen so when we are trying to realize god look at it all these things the similar type of experiences happen in our life too and it happened in bhagavad-gita's life so this is now see how after finishing his offer sadama krishna sat on the small couch and aim seated himself on the floor rug the master talking about naran was was over overcome with emotion so whenever he is talking about the narayan master i saw naran today amy said his eyes were moist when i looked at his face face i felt like weeping master the sight of him arouses a mother's love in me friends i like to repeat this line the god's feeling for the devotee the sight of him arouses a mother's love in me as it were his relatives bait him at home because he comes here there is none to defend him master the m the other day he left his books at haripatho's house and fled to you so he was going to school and instead he kept the books in some friends house and he visited the surama krishna so that love that attraction for the god and that is why the god is also loving him so this devotion to god ramakrishna was silent after a few minutes he continued you see he has much substance in him otherwise how could i be attracted to him even though i was listening to the kirtan at the time i had to leave the music and go into the room that never happened before the love for narayan what was there in that boy why the master was so much giving the attention that god was attracted as they say if a true devotee who loves god is there the god will come to him as the mother cow comes to the cuff so that is the attraction friends this is very important if we can develop the divine qualities we can purify our mind our thoughts god will be attracted god will come to us god will love us so this we must here i like to quote a few a few slokas from the bhagavad-gita is from the 12th chapter and it says the bhakti-yoga and bhagavan's sri krishna he said from the 13th verse 12th chapter from 13 to 19 whom god loved so this is really really we always think the god realization means something miraculous and when we read the mystical experiences of some people we always think that those things will happen to me but in reality what is god realization developing the qualities and it is not the only moral qualities morality is the basis standing on the morality we have to enter into spirituality and what are those spirituality how to develop the spirituality here those who are really sincere to understand the religion and how to develop the spiritual life must read these verses 12th chapter from 13 words and he says so we can read separate separately that advait advaishta what is the meaning of the vista free from hatred that is the first thing in the spiritual life and if a spiritual person it administering or ruling a country is very difficult and he has to be like the janaka the janaka was all right because his mind was completely free from any attachment because he should not have any dwisha so advaishta salibu bhutanam he's free from hatred and he's friendly he's compassionate and he's free from idea of me and mine he is free from egoism and he is even-minded in pain and pleasure and he is forbearing ever content steady in contemplation and self-control possessed a form conviction and devoted to me and that i love him is my dear that is called the devotee to me is dear to me so these are the qualities only 13 and 14. then in the 15th verse it says that he by whom the world is not agitated and who cannot be agitated by the world sometimes some people they develop a peculiar characteristics all the time criticizing wherever they go whatever they see whatever they hear they can't control them they will give their comment and they will make some problem over there so people get afraid of these people and do you think they can realize god maybe they will be giving donation to construct the whole temple maybe they are very other way good but this is the character one cannot realize god in this way so that is and he is free from from joy envy fear anxiety he is dear to me the god loves those those who having these qualities again and i read the english from the free from dependence on a picture not depending on anyone completely dependent bhagavan buddha said in a spiritual life you are depending on yourself you have heart from your guru now you have been guided by the scriptures and now you have to depend on yourself and you have to continue so that is the first thing on a picture shuchi and daksa he is pure the pure means unselfish and daksa very perfect in work and sometimes we think the spiritual life means we cannot understand this he cannot understand that he cannot do this he cannot do that that is not the way he must be very intelligent and can be perfect whatever they will be doing perfectly they will do sometimes brahmanandaji direct disciple of bhagavan si rama krishna he was the the concept vice president of the ramakrishna order used to go and check how the young brahmachar ins they are dressing the vegetables you know we have to do by hand so not in machine so how they're doing it when they're peeling a potato so how they're doing it how much the potato is going with the skin by observing that he used to say those who are very fine they used to say oh this boy has have develop the concentration so they could understand that whatever we do and we have to do with all concentration so this it says like that and daksa [Music] this is not only morality these are all spirituality the don't still don't tell lies don't beat someone this is all basic moralities but spirituality means transformation and this transformation completely take your soul so higher level and it says like this and that he who neither rejoice nor hates not grieves not desire renouncing good and evil full of devotion to me and he is and then last two they will be telling like this [Music] is also in honor and dishonor so this is called spirituality the when the mind is completely tranquil and the same who is the same and in in pleasure and pain who is free from attachment and to whom the criticism and the praise are equal who is silent content and steady minded full of devotion that man is dear to me now bhagavan sirama krishna he is loving this young boy must be that he has developed all these qualities in him in that young age and that is why the god is so much attracted to him the friends in bhagavad-gita 16th chapter first three slokas that gives 26 qualities that are divine qualities we should understand what is the divinity we should understand what is religion and all the external things that we see it is only the support to develop those qualities we misunderstand and we fight on religion because we see only the the surface don't entered into it and in the hinduism particularly there's no conversion it is only the completely transformation this transformation from the lower self to the higher self to the oh you always think that it is me and mine we should have all these things but slowly slowly we have to go what is this me who am i and that goes to and merge with the god that is called spirituality again and again we have to understand these now master is talking about that young boy sudama krishna has spoken about chandra master to aim please ask him what he thinks of me does he think of me as a gyani or what does he say about me i understand that he is a very recent to gopal ask teja chandra to come here saturday and tuesday suppose i go to your school and look for then immediately aim thought that salam krishna wanted to go to his school to see narayan he said to the master you might as well wait at our house look at it the sudama krishna he's searching for the holy souls wanted to visit the school and master masha he was the head master he thought if sirama krishna comes only to see the narayan naturally so many boys will be there how they will think what they will think so he said instead you can wait in my house and i will call him from the school it was not very far but sirama krishna is saying no not like that and he is talking about one person who has not visited krishna sram krishna wanted to know what he thinks about him so much of concern for every individual why to help us to grow the spiritual life and here the master said that suramar krishna wanted to go to school to see the nare master said no i have something else in mind i should like to see whether there are other worthwhile boys in the school when they go to the school and he wants to see the faces of the children and he had the capacity to understand their thoughts what they are thinking what type of the some scholars the they are having so searching for the holy life so this is the way it goes and aim of course you can go other visitors come to the school you can come too master the because he's a teacher head master is thinking what the authority of the school will uh see that think about it if saram krishna goes about then he is giving his that this argument is to satisfy himself now many people they come to see the school you can also come to see the school but that way it can be managed but sudan krsna's idea that means he is giving us the call the god is searching for a holy serve it's not that eunuch god is searching for our the holy people so that he can bless them he can take them to the spiritual realm so friends this is very important to develop the good qualities so we spend a lot of time reading books comparing philosophy these that lot of time is done with that then it will be intellectual discussions arguments counter arguments debate but where to try where is the time to try to develop these wonderful qualities so if a person is really sincere he should note down these qualities from bhagavad-gita the 12th chapter from 13 to 19 all these one after another and the 16th chapter first second third 26 qualities keep them there and every day we should have to see look at this quality so how many qualities i am growing within me can i be like this can i be like that self analysis for everything in the study also the students are supposed to do self analysis whether i can be successful in this type of exam and this type of question is coming how to answer that spiritual life is also like that we have to grow those qualities and slowly slowly one day a person will become completely unselfish without any desire and the love will grow that love will embrace each and every one because that time that person will see it is nothing but the god in different names and form and that is the ultimate goal of spiritual life the do's and don'ts that we see in the temple in the mosque in the synagogue in the churches that is only to give us support to grow in this way and if we made the mistake whole life spend only the anger only desire only the ego will grow and no benefit in the spiritual life the sudama krishna there slowly of course you can go other visitors also come and the surama krishna was talking with the gopal and they decided to sleep on the nahabit the aim sat on the floor near sirama krishna then another this is another description there are two dhabas nahabit means a double storage the small house and where the in those days only the sanai one type of musical instrument they used to play in the early morning just to leave the night over there in the early morning they will go on the upstairs and it is all open they'll be sitting and playing right from the 3 30 4 o'clock and so the beautiful music the people will rise up and then they will go to the temple after the abolition and that that was the that's called there were two if uh those who are visiting ram dakshinesha they always see only one nahabhat where mother masada money devi and the mother of bhagavan suramar krishna but there is another nahavatis there that is in the other side near the bridge mostly people don't go over there in that now birth master masha used to stay and sometimes the other devotees too it was not very comfortable but still the devotees to stay over there there's not many guest rooms and all so this is the way the salama krishna is teaching the devotees and it was ten o'clock or eleven o'clock at night sriramakrishna was sitting on the small couch resting against a pillow aim sat on the floor the master mashai the whole day they had so many other programs and in the night at 11 is awake and he is talking with the master and master attentively listening to that and keeping it in the mind sometimes noting a little so that afterwards he can reproduce all the conversation that he had with sirama krishna and sudama krishna has a lamp burned on the stand near the wall the master felt great compassion for his devotees he wanted to bless him by accepting his personal service master my feet ache please rob them gently aim seated himself on the small couch and took the master's feet on his lap he stroked them now and then sudama krishna would ask his disciple a question the friends will stop over here today and as because the coming two months we won't have this and then from the march again we'll start let us conclude by thinking the why not note down the good qualities that is there listed in the bhagavad-gita and now the pandemic situation is going on and the spiritual life can be grown very easily because we are not meeting many people we are not getting disturbed by different thoughts so we are all there in the room whatever the work is there we will do and then the rest of the time if we note down the bhagavad gitas all these and try to improve our qualities then one day we will be really blessed those who are not interested in spiritual life for them it is different but those who are sincere regularly attending this class not only that so many devotees they are writing to me that themselves are reading once again and again they are listening to these so by this way you are trying to improve i'm sure the masters bhagavan sadama krishna will be so happy and he said in one place a monk is supposed to take the name of god what else he will do he has left his heart and home and he is not having any other responsibilities he is supposed to take the name of god but look at a devotee he is having so many problems so many responsibilities so many he be loaded on his head as if but still finding time to realize god so friends let us try to develop ourselves and develop in such a way so that no we are not going to god god will come to us if we develop these qualities the god will come to us searching for us hey where you are like that he will give the call so one day
