[257: Panchama Veda 257 : "I See God In All Things"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KphQrkQg9A)

car good evening dear friends and devotees today before we start let us chant this mantra as usual rhythm friends last few weeks we are reading from chapter 33 an account of the october 26th sunday 1884 bhagavan sram krishna said to his devotees that he sees god in everything that is the highest realization in the spiritual life some feel god in his heart some see god in the shrine in the temple and like that experiences are there that is also very excellent experiences very wonderful experience there is a blessed we can say those people but when one can reach to that ultimate of the spiritual life that is in the language of bhagavan siram krishna gyana then he sees everything is god that in the we find in the page the gospel of sirama krishna by swami nikhilanandaji that is 643. he says i see rama rama means the god in all things this is the truth this is the eternal truth now why that we know those who are students of vedanta if you are following the classes like the yoga vashishta or the ashtavakra meetha and you know that the material cause and intellectual cause are the same so the god has created this universe and there is no other material than god himself and god is the consciousness so everything is nothing but that consciousness rishi bhushishta also is also putting this argument before sri ramachandra the young prince who wanted to renounce the the family and to go for searching for the truth he said where you are going what you are actually leaving you'd like to renounce what this world this home this is nothing but god so that was the argument and sudama krishna here when he's talking with the devotees a very famous devotee like mahima acharan he was a scholar salaam krishna is telling i see that it is god himself who has become everything the universe and its living beings this is the truth but we don't feel it here is the question we understand that this is the truth intellectually but why can't we feel that that i am god and the thing that i am dealing with everything is god there's a in the majority of the people they have a very in a shallow idea about god majority of the people they think the god means some sort of miracles some sort of supernatural power and that those things only what is that god we do not know so we are very excited when we find that somebody is showing something miraculous that that is not god the god is completely different thing god is the consciousness and when one can feel see that everything is nothing but that consciousness that is called god realization friends many of you those who have gone through the gospel of sirama krishna in bengali the kathamrita in hindi bachchan amrit so this there in one place ramakrishna krishna he's appreciating a very young boy was going to catch a grasshopper and he's very quietly going towards then suddenly there was a wind and the lips of the trees they are moving making the sound and that little boy turning to those lips and putting the finger on his lip he said hey don't don't make sound as if he's talking with those lips of the trees for him everything is leaving so that his imagination he is going to catch the grasshopper from the back and he wants that everything should be quiet so we're asking the stones asking that leaps of the trees the bushes to cooperate with him so that is the way suramar krishna he saw that the faith of the little boy and he appreciated and he said the after the realization of the god one sees the same thing everything is consciousness there cannot be any difference he cannot see any difference so this is called the god realization the brahmagyana atma this only conception of the one and no never two now this is the truth but hence the when the devotee is telling this is but we don't feel because we are under the spill of the god's maya god's power from here begins the journey the spiritual journey we have to accept that we are under the spell of god's maya and who can make us free from that maya from the bound of that maya from the spill of that maya god himself now we are in truth god and nothing else but god brahma satya jagan mitha jiva brahma even this brahman is the truth but this universe which you see is temporary illusory it is not true and jiva brahma all the beings that you see are nothing but the brahman and this is the truth we are all brahmana we are all that god but we don't understand why because of the spell who spelled god's spell they call it maya now we have to pray to god concentrate our mind on god so that we can go beyond the spell and that is called god realization all the spiritual journey spiritual life all the sadhanas all the spiritual austerities and nothing but this so that is the ultimate thing and here when the devotee mahima charon is asking by what kind of work can one realize god what means we have to try naturally though what kind of work sudama krishna's answer any work any type of work there is no difference for him there is no secular or secret so when you go to the shrine when you go to the temple when you do little meditation and when you talk about the god when you read some scripture when you offer the puja the ceremoniously we think that is all sacred thing that is all the sacred things and sometimes some people they become so mad when they come out of the temple and if someone says something to them hello how about you and they'll be very angry don't disturb my mind and you'll fight with him and saying why you are disturbing my mind my mind is like the getting pure what is that purity that means he is just beginning he doesn't know much never make any progress it is nothing the person who is talking to you is also god and the inside inside the temple the image that you have meditated there's also god so this conception the more and more it deepens there is no difference when someone is coming to talk in the office when you are sitting and talking as if that is a secular work that we are doing and when we go and sit before the temple and close our eyes as a very secret thing that we are doing conception but the more and more we can understand that there is no difference that is the highest point of realization he is talking just like normal behaving mixing with people chatting and the life of krishna is open book of spirituality he's cutting jokes and he's visiting this place that place and everything he's doing but his mind is constantly connected with the spirituality so that is the main thing bhagavan krishna we find that page 646 he is telling any work there is no different but the thing is attitude with what attitude you are working suppose in your own kitchen you are cooking food for your family family members but you were thinking that i am preparing that food for god and you were constantly taking his holy name and cooking very conscious very alert that all the ingredients should be properly given so that the taste and the smell of the food should be proper and like that when you are thinking you are truly doing cooking for god and those who are cooking in the temple and the food that should be offered to god and the over there they are discussing about hey who is going to win at the vote and they'll be discussing so much of politics and social things and cooking they're cooks only that cooking and the cooking in the hotel are the same because attitude where is your mind so that is the main thing when someone is offering you the food if he or she has cooked that food in a proper attitude i like to offer this to a holy person that food is completely different even the songs when the people are singing the song be inside that shrine in the temple constantly thinking all the people who are here they must appreciate me god never listened to those bhagavatam krishna's life we have seen his dearest disciple swami vivekananda he was narendra nath when he was singing one day his mind was thinking the god knows the mind friends the god is not we cannot deceive god that is the problem we cannot deceive god god eyes a jagannath is looking everything through and through so whatever we are thinking he understands it he sees that that young narendra he was singing that particular day he was thinking that i should be particularly careful about the science of the song so the emotion and the dedication for god was not there bhagavan sirama krishna said it is tasteless like the the food without salt jolo laglo in bengali he said so that is the main thing attitude whatever i am doing if i am doing for god offering to god thinking that god will be pleased god will be pleased and that is called a holy thing i am sweeping the floor or cleaning the bathroom or cooking or anything i am doing and at the same time preparing the girl and for the god are the same if the attitude is same that is exactly what bhagavan suramar krishna taught us any work he said and that is the one needs to prepare oneself for the so journey are recapitulating the the pages that we have already read and suramar krishna said you have to prepare because this is also the greatest signs the science to discover oneself we are all tired with the body and the mind and intellectual things that we do and we are very satisfied and egoistically we say oh we are we we know all this so these things are happening in this way but behind that at the back of it the main cause that is the atman the source of all knowledges we do not know about it that is called when we turn to that that's called spiritual journey it's nothing absurd now we have to close our nose and to close our eyes and to do this that is in the beginning it is okay and we also teach that you you should have to withdraw your mind is okay but ultimately it goes and then it becomes like a sky and it embraces everything it finds no difference anywhere and not touched or contaminated by anything of this world lives in this world but never ever touched by anything me and mine that is the main thing the power grabbing now the in america that this race is going on tremendous power grabbing do they think that they are going to serve the people afterwards they will think they may but now this is the power grabbing and that is called worldliness spiritual people exactly oppose it they will give away nyasa samyaknyasa sannyasa that is called monastic life the monastic life means give give give and never expect anything in return that is called monastic life and that will take you to spirituality and what is that spirituality seeing god everywhere every moment so this beauty bhagavan si ramakrishna is teaching and that is why his gospel is nothing but the veda vida means the knowledge how to prepare then he is suggesting holy company fast second discrimination and third blessings of god these three things holy company we can say guru the preceptor the teacher spiritual teacher guru he has already traveled and he has also acquired this knowledge so he transmit that to the disciple please do this thing and sometimes particularly in the vedantic tradition in the ramakrishna tradition very simple so they'll say please do this and morning and evening please take the name of god 108 times that's all they'll say and when they are saying like that if you just take that and do it then after some time you will feel oh only 108 it's five minutes i can do that can i not increase it so you ask your guru and you will be so happy yes yes go on increasing then as the ma sarada muni devi says ten thousand times every day ten thousand times you are taking the name of god then reading a few pages from the holy book your life will be saturated with spirituality all the time the thought will be only god on god and slowly slowly you'll be feeling the joy and happiness every moment for everything so that is called the company of guru and discrimination majority of the time our mind takes us to the supernatural power oh if i have realized god when i thought like this and it happened that means i have i'm having the power when i say to him this that happened to him that means i am having it may but never ever bother about that that's called discrimination i have not left my heart and home or dedicating my time for god realization for this thing no so this is the discrimination i have a goal and that goal is to see that consciousness in everything everywhere every moment till i reach into that unto that i am going to continue so that is called discrimination bichara and third the blessings of god when one is trying the blessings of god automatically comes obviously comes that anyone trying anywhere to realize god sincerely after a few days he or she will find that some good friends are coming good people are coming around and supporting him or her to continue that that is the blessings of god and utilizing that cooperation one should continuously you're making the progress and those who are helping you that you should also feel and pray for them friends it is like as the they say guru krishna vaisnava they always say guru the guide the spiritual teacher krishna the god himself and vaisnava the student vaisnava the the person the devotee who is trying to realize god if these three comes in the same line then it is called triputi veda success so these three should be as a person who is tr striving he also should be or she should be sincere and then must be guided by a proper guru and the god's grace will come then the success will come bhagavan sirama krishna he said bhagavat bhakta bhagavan and in vedanta it says 3 puti veda in a little different way three means three that should come together and this there are two choices before us one is god another is this world god's creation and this god's creation means if we become attest to the god creation then it is problem otherwise utilizing this creation if we can go towards god that is the technique sa chaturi chaturi in in the vedanta it says very nicely that is the technique that way you should overcome sachari that technique that intelligence that you are applying that and then overcoming the problem for the monastics total renunciation and for the householders mental renunciation living in the household you must have your debit card credit card and the house and the car and all those responsibilities everything properly but mentally at the same time you are thinking enough is enough and as because god has kept me over here i will do like this we will read from krishna we'll be advising this is the the take the name of god and perform your responsibility mam anusmara yuddhacha as the sri krishna said in the bhagavad-gita when the mind will be free from all desires thoughts of duties and responsibilities hold to god only in the page 647 this way bhagavan sirama krishna is giving us the advice in the world man must fight against passions like lost and anger against many desires against attachment is the page 648 he says in the world a man must fight against passions like lust and anger many desires against attachment so these are the things attachment is there desires are there and tremendous at the force in the desire for something for which the physical joy comes we have to fight against this that's why swami vivekananda said by controlling nature internal and external do this by any method and be free so that external and internal that we have to fight externally there are provocations there are temptations so we have to be careful about it and internally desires are there subtle desires and we have to be careful about that too so this is the way slowly we have to go suramar krishna is telling it is convenient to fight from inside a fort from his own home so so practical you see so practical a time came when it was declared this jagat mitta this world is illusory the full of misery and naturally as the that it's called mass thing they always accept something which is going very popular and they follow that and afterwards they suffer only so the mass temperament if someone can come and then give a beautiful lecture very inspiring all they will come out and they will follow him they will fight for him and then ultimately they will realize oh my god only we have suffered and nothing we have gained again and again this happened and in every pages of the history it is there but still people they're deluded by this type of people they are so-called leaders they will come and do like that so one has to be discriminative one has to be another very careful about what i am going to do he said like this okay but how far it is possible feasible and what i am going to get by that so these are the things one should be very very carefully the analyze and he says in the convenient thing is when you are fighting for the spirituality and fighting the all this other forces that is dragging you down in the path of spirituality it is better to live in a home for the householders he is telling at home you get the food and other health in the kali yuga life of a person depends entirely on food it is better to get food at one place than to knock at different places in india the the monks they go and they go for begging to door to door this is not necessary living at home is like facing the battle from a fort you get all possible help if you are sick immediately people are there to take care if you are hungry it is there so the so many good things are there in the family of course this there will be people who are not understanding your own views so maybe they will be sarcastically commenting or constantly meditating reading books what is going to happen there is no god that type of things are there so you have to overcome that and if you go to a jungle or go to a other place there will be other difficulties there will be other problems thieves will be there they will take out all the all things that you are having they may still there may be in the jungle if you are there they may there may be the animals so you have to face all this so why not in the home that is he is telling to his the devotees householder devotees live in the world like a cast of leaf in a girl such a leaf is sometimes drawing going here and there and here in america particularly this place and this is the fall fall time and just at the back of our asama and the center there's a big field and a lot of trees they're shedding the leaves and the will that strong wind is coming and all the leaves are going to one direction sometimes some some are just going rolling on the ground as some are flying like that they don't have any will of their own wherever the wind will take them they will go the similar way surama krishna is advising wait for the command of god wherever he wants to take you go and god will protect you for sure then he is telling in giving example the leaf goes wherever the wind blows now god has put you in the world that is good stay here again when he lifts you from the here and puts you in the better place that will be time enough to think about what to do then resign everything to him surrender yourself at his feet and then there will be no more confusion then you will realize that it is god who does everything all depends on the will of rama rama is the god the will of the god everything depends on that so what a householder should do that is exactly what bhagavan srirama krishna is teaching depending on god we love god wherever in whatever form in whatever condition he has kept you be happy and constantly pray to god whatever you want tell him tell to god and for sure the god will take care of you god will surely take care of you whatever you are wanting that will be given by god and if you say protect me i like to become a spiritual soul and give me the courage to follow that help me to take your name and develop devotion for you the god will do that you cannot develop devotion you cannot take the name of god so easily it is not so easy and when you are meditating immediate mind will go somewhere when you are taking the name of god japan we are doing mind will go somewhere else it is everyone's experience so before sitting for meditation and taking the name of god one should pray to god for his help god please help me please help me to develop spirituality please help me so that i can see you that is the prayer we should have to do to god and those who are there in the house houses i should think this is all right and particularly i have seen in here in america those who are i have visited so many houses very nice house everything is there and now that this opportunity if you are utilizing this so good if you make a routine and that should be pointed towards the spiritual goal those who were in the work they have a lot of duties and now because of the pandemic they are having more our work than the normal time but those who are retired those who can do that make a routine and then slowly slowly step by step go towards god this much dropper i should do four times a day then four times a day i should read the scripture then i should do this i should do that but that way and whatever you are thinking write down in a diary that today i could do this much and these are the thoughts that were disturbing me and this is a physical problem that i am facing uh these are the prop these things are happening like that if you are constantly analyzing your mind like a scientist know all the time maintaining the diary and proceeding this is also a research you are doing the research with your own mind you will find slowly slowly you are making the progress and time will come you will feel the joy and you will never feel lonely the feeling joy happiness and not with the help of anything else outside somebody is coming and talking with you on somebody someone's phone call game nothing like that but you are feeling joy within and slowly the you will develop i like to leave alone the company you will shun if someone wants to come to your house and say see some problem is there and thank you that some other time we'll organize you like to leave alone that is the making the progress it's not selfishness you are going towards god so you are leaving the heart of the world that is the way cerama krishna is teaching that you should discriminate am i proceeding towards god and how i will know because i am feeling joy within i am feeling love no hatred for anyone else no criticism and no anger for anything no hankering for all the desire accept the desire or the prayer to god to help me to develop my spiritual life so this is the called sadhana the one should start that the tsunami krishna is telling and surrender to god this very very difficult of course but this is also practice surrender to god whatever the decision that we are going to take the work that like to do before that tell god god i am again and again feeling that i should do like this if this is a good thing and going to help others and if you like it then let it be done and if it is not then okay no problem don't ask me to do that or force me to do that or even if i am trying you stop me so that i don't do that so this is the way a connection with god every time everything having the discussion with god and then taking the decision that is called the every moment living with god if we can do that then a dependence comes on god and if you can develop the dependence on god things will be all solved of course there will be some problem and how suramar krishna was very fond of telling a story that is called the wheel of rama let me read that story as a very interesting in a certain village there leaved a weaver he was a very pious soul everyone trusted him and loved him he used to sell his goods in the marketplace when a customer asked him the price of a piece of cloth the weaver would say by the wheel of rama the price of the yearn is one rupee and the labor for honors by the wheel of rama the prophet is two on us what a businessman so he will disclose the whole thing and naturally he said that the cost of the material is this much and the labor is this much and my profit is only two honors the price of the cloth by the wheel of rama in the one rupee and six honors such was the people's faith in the weaver that the customer would at once pay the price and take the cloth they will never bargain because they knew is very very truthful the weaver was a real devotee of god after finishing his supper in the evening he would spend long hours in the worship hall meditating on god and chanting his name and glories now let one night the weaver couldn't get to sleep he was sitting in the worship hall smoking now and then when a brand of robbers banned of robbers happened to pass that way they wanted a man to carry their goods and say to the weaver come with us so saying they laid him off by the hand after committing a robbery in a house they put a load of things on the weaver's aid commanding him to carry them suddenly the polish arrived and the robbers ran away but the weaver with his load was arrested he was kept in the lockup for the night next day he was brought before the magistrate for trial the villagers learn what had happened to and come to court they said to the magistrate your honor this man could never commit committee robbery therefore the magistrate asks the weaver to make his statement the weaver said your honor by the wheel of rama i finished my meal at night then by the wheel of rama i was sitting in the worship hall it was quite late at night by the wheel of rama by the will of rama i had been thinking of god and chanting his name and glories when by the wheel of rama everything by the wheel of rama went by the wheel of rama a band of robbers passed that way by the will of rama they dragged me with them by the will of rama they committed a robbery in a house and by the wheel of rama they put the load on my head just then by the wheel of rama the police arrived and by the wheel of rama i was arrested then by the wheel of rama the police kept me in the lockup for the night and this morning by the wheel of brahma i have been brought before your honor so the word statement the magistrate realized that the weaver was a pious man and ordered his release on his way home the weaver said to the friends by the will of rama i have been released so this is the complete dependence on god this is a little funny but at the same time look at the faith of the person you know i i think i told in some of my talk that when i was in advaithasrama in calcutta we used to sell the religious books then we received a letter from a prisoner in south india i think in madras i've forgotten so he wrote that i am a life imprisonment i cannot go out but now i feel that i should read swami vivekananda's books because when i came to i was thinking that i should commit suicide but then i went to the library and suddenly a book came into my hand and i started reading it to a swami vivekananda's book and way after reading that i got so much of inspiration you are the maker of your own destiny whatever the mistake that i have done i have done now they have given me the punishment i am now happy that i am having that punishment time i like to utilize for my future so i am reading that book and preparing myself sitting meditating for in meditation etc can you please help us with some books we sent the books to him then after a long time i received another letter the same person wrote now i am enjoying my stay in this jail because now i they are all people are respecting me so much and the jailer asked me to give them the discourses on the spiritual life of swami vivekananda so every evening i am giving a spiritual talk and they are listening to me they are respecting me as their spiritual guide i am enjoying this life and very happy the jailer himself on my behalf appealed to the higher authority so that i am i can get the release from here so that is the the any time anything can happen depending on the will of god so you know i am now suffering i am suffering i am suffering if i go on telling to my our relatives and friends slowly slowly they will never receive your telephone call oh my god if i pick up the phone then he is going to they cry again and complaining again and he can't stop more than half an hour so that is the way they will think and slowly slowly you'll be lonely rather if we go towards god and pray to god i'm sorry god i committed some mistakes please be with me immediately the spiritual help will come bhagavan's ramakrishna is giving this advice to us whether a man should be a householder or a monk depends on the will of god surrender everything to god and do your duties in the world this is the very important thing what is dharma again and again we are confused we always say some of the rituals that has been prescribed in every religion it is there that is the only dharma of course that is dharma but that is the preparation for something what is that that's my commitment i must be truthful to my commitments these commitments is dharma whatever the words that i have given whatever the responsibilities have accepted whatever the oath that i have taken i must observe that and perform that that is called dharma the sannyasis they have some oaths they must practice that if not then he or she should not claim that they are monastics they should leave that and leave a householder's life otherwise this is hypocrisy one should be true to oneself yeah i cannot follow this very high philosophy of the commitments to be honest to be loving to be careful caring to each and everyone that is called dharma and in the household life also a person who is committing to at the time of marriage i am going to take the responsibility of my wife he must continue or the wife also should follow whatever the promises she took at the time of marriage and of each and every one in this the society the king has some responsibilities the soldiers have some responsibilities the ministers have some responsibilities doctors and each and every one they are taking the oath at the accepting the responsibility and they must practice that that is sufficient as a religion that is exactly what bhagavan sri krishna said in the bhagavad-gita mom anusmara yuddhacha he was asking arjuna the lord krishna was asking arjuna to proceed towards the war because that is his swadharma that is his duty to punish the bad people and protect the good one as a shatria as a military he must do that but at the same time constantly remember god depend on god pray to god these are the two things that is the whole religion we are unnecessarily making it more complicated it's not necessary these are the things if we learn that whatever the commitment that i have done for the betterment of the society and betterment of my own personal life i must stick to that so that is called dharma sidhama krishna is also telling surrender everything to god and do your duties in the world and he said like this if the householder becomes a jivan mukta then he can easily live in the world if he likes that's called abaduta jivan mukta means he is not attached to anything mukta mukta means liberated liberated from where from the attachment because he is not having any desire so completely free then he can live over there and then he say man who has attained knowledge does not differentiate between this place or that place all places are same to him this is the highest achievement in the spiritual life no differentiation wherever i live the god is there so let me live over there happily so that is the way this is called spiritual spiritualizing every day or every moment of life the spiritualizing every moment of life and this is that depending on god and performing one's own duties that's all why how to depend on god constantly praying to him and how it is possible when i am working how can i pray how can i take the name of god no not at that time that in one of the books the direct disciple of bhagavan sirama krishna swami brahmananda said the same question was asked to him he said when you reach to your office just sit in on your table and then remember god god now i am now going for work please be with me in between when you get a recess remember god god now we are little free afterwards when you complete your job again close your book and say god whole day whatever i have done i offer it to you good bad i don't know you have given me this responsibility i have tried my best to perform now please be with me that's all only this way if you go on slowly slowly your mind will be purified and how you will know that your mind is purified you will never feel jealousy you will never feel angry and you will never feel feel the attachment so these are the things slowly slowly will put you that test so now i can be at this this is all right for me and then you will feel happiness joy every moment so this is what bhagavan's rama krishna is telling as long as a man has not dropped his tail of ignorance he can leave only in the water of the world friends when sirama krishna went to meet this our kisha chandra shane in the jaigo pulse garden house it is still there in the kashipur area joy gopala's guardian house keshav shane went over he was a very famous person that time he was a wonderful speaker so people used to go and listen to him so naturally assalamu krishna hard about him then that he gives the talk on god so he sudama krishna also went there to meet him but the gentleman who was accompanying suramar krishna his nephew riddharam he was little bit confused what to do because you have to introduce ramakrishna before a great personality like keshav chandrashin but sudama krishna is having nothing though he then went and told sad this person the only quality that he could find in sirama krishna he is not a rich man he is not an educated person he is nowhere in the society so how to introduce then he said this is the person who is constantly remembering god all the time he wants to talk to you by that way he introduced and he told him told krishna again and again be very careful when you are talking with him and you know what happened the first sentence ramakrishna told and he gave him the caution again and again but sudama krishna the first the mate the great personality there and he was surrounded by so many people he said oh kesha your tail has dropped look at it now how people will think so obviously they became angry why you are talking like this in a very rustic way but keshav understood why because that's why srama krishna loved kesha keshav understood there must be something behind this statement why is talking like this he is not going to insult me anyway so there was no very less ego we can say there's no ego i owned but this very less ego because he was truly praying to god so his mind became purified he could understand the word of god though it was thrown to him in a very one excellent way okay keshav you have dropped your tail then he said and let me read this passage when i first met kesha at jaigopal garden house i remarked he is the only one who has dropped his tail at this people left keshav said to them don't laugh there must be some meaning in his words let us ask him there happen i said to kesha there is the full description of this incident is there in the biography of bhagavatama krishna and he said the tadpole so long as it has not dropped its tail leaves only in the water it cannot move about on dry land but as soon as it drops the tail it hops out on the bank then it can leave both on land and in water look at it so how nicely when one has developed the spiritual life he can live in the householder's life and at the same time leading a spiritual life how it is possible because there is no desire how it is possible because there is no attachment in his mind so whatever he is doing is doing for the betterment of others there is no attachment because the ego is slowly slowly going away he is becoming the god himself likewise as long as a man has not dropped his tail of ignorance now sudama krishna explaining he can live only in the water of the world but when he drops his tail that is to say when he attains the knowledge of god then he he can roam about as free soul or leave as a householder if he likes if he likes so friends we'll stop over here that this is the conversation this wonderfully he is mentioning ultimate thing for a householder now he's talking to the householder not for the sannyasins sunny since has completely different thing sannyasis means they should give up not only the mental attachment but external physical attachment also so that is called sannyasa and it's a very tough life very difficult life and majority of the people they start trying it then after some time they forget the ideology and they adjust the ideology and they start leaving a retired life a nice life that's all but the spiritual life means constantly the burning inside the how far i have realized god that is the main thing leaving a holy life is good of course good but living a life for realization is a completely different thing so how you will understand that person will have no desire anything in this world his whole point will be only to serve god and how to serve god by benefiting helping the people sometimes some people in the name of god they are doing genius thing i am going to serve my god so i go and kill some innocent people that is madness that cannot be the spiritual life no one will accept it only you know those who become crazy in the name of god they go and kill unnecessarily some innocent people if you have that courage go and declare i am going to fight with someone and go and fight with someone then only you encourage your go and those who can face you go and face them why and completely defenseless a lady or a child a person who is not actually aware that you are coming from the back you come and stab and kill and then you think that you have pleased god is it not craziness i don't know how people can think about it but anyway that is completely different but be aware always i am doing the god's work means two things will happen and that is the motto of the ramakrishna nation in the motto the goal of the ramakrishna mission means and the two things at the same time i am serving my god and i will feel that i am becoming pure i am becoming free from the attachment and feeling joy within when i close my eyes i see the face of my deity of my god when i look at the sky i don't see the clouds i see my god is sitting over there when i go to my bed i feel the god is also with me each and every time all the god is always there within always so that is the one point yes i am proceeding towards god heading towards him reaching to him and second thing whatever work that i do for the benefit of others never ever i will do anything that will create problem for some others never i will never say harsh words to anyone i'll never do anything that will harm someone neighbor and this is called spirituality we don't understand that and that's why in the name of spirituality we are hurting others we are criticizing others and we are thinking that we are becoming spiritual friends we should be very very discriminative intelligent to understand the spirituality is nothing but seeing god or seeing me in every being thank you very much is there any so let us chant this mantra and we conclude bhakthanu kampa is [Music] namaste
