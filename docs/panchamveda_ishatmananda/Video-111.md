[112: Panchama Veda 112 : Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmeFBq1T7y8)

and let us begin with disprin our mantra double Kadam written dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten Calma sharpen sovereign among golem srimad artem beginnin de bourree dodging ah no the last time when we were reading the gospel of the ramakrishna and that was the August nineteen eighteen eighty three the ceramic ashtray was telling do you know what Maya is he was asking three ma master Marcia is it attachment to relatives etc now we find this about this Maya we have already discussed first again we find that in the breeder and knock upon Ishod also it says that Indra Miyabi pure Rupa IATI this a unique way Indra that means the Supreme Being is not that methodological God Indra but the Supreme Being Maya ve through false notion Indra Maya V Peru Rupa manifold is perceived he attained the Indra that the Supreme God he is manifesting in all over in so many different forms that Maya the word has been used in the breeder new combination in the bhagavad-gita there also we find it says in the eighteenth chapter is shuara suribabu tonearm rigged a ship arjuna tisthati brahma insolvable thani gentle Ronnie Maya again the Maya that word Maya has been used the God dwells in the heart of all beings resolving them all by his mysterious power of Maya as the machine does with its mounted on eat so the mysterious power of God is Maya the ceramic each name is asking do you know what is Maya again in the shatter shatter Upanishad I find the same Maya ma√≠am to recruiting with droite my mature Maheshwara Maheshwara that is the supreme lord supreme god order in other way we can say the Brahman with Saguna he is creating sustaining and destroying this universe with the power that is called Maya this Maya this word has been wonderfully utilized by Shankar Acharya to explain how that Brahman about which we are discussing in our Sunday classes that my this Brahman how it could become so many varieties so that way he has utilized this Maya using the power shatter shatter Upanishad return bhagavad-gita again in the Tantra Jana Sangh Killiney Tantra it says that power of God which God uses to create reserve and for the destruction of the universe is Maya saw Maya very clear paulina Shakti Bellini Shakti is sustaining preserving this universe sisty some hard colony again creating and also destroying whenever we are using this some harder means destroying and we say that this as if destroying everything is not taking back into the original form that is called Samara so that is done with the power of God Sam I am Polynesian Shakti thristy Samara Carini and in the Bhagavata also we find the same it is supporting this Maya Saba etirsa some such - Shakti he said Assad at Mika Mayan armor Maharaja Jai Edom need mommy boo boo who in the Bhagavad it says that power through which God created this universe please Maya so when we are Saddam o Krishna simply mentioned a single word Maya he say do you know what Maya is but when see Rama Krishna is explaining the Maya it is actually in a different dimension a complete different dimension all these scriptures they were talking about the Maya the God's power which is helping to create sustain and destroy but here cinema Krishna says it is attachment to the worldly things it is attachment to relatives Maya and then he used another word daya Maya is attachment to relatives parents brother sister wife children nephew nieces but the ayah means love for all created being in a different way so this point we must remember Maya taya when the Maya comes the ceramic is neutralizing this power of God for the creation sustenance and the destruction at the same time for the individual being how the Maya is acting and says it is attachment to the world things attachment to the temporary things attachment to which I feel is my own so that is called Maya and because of that attachment again and again we are coming back to this life and suffering etc next come in that ceramic isne afterwards he is mentioning about the another thing the other Shan and Balarama Bosch came to visit master and then the discussion went into the another way that is consumed Hawaii me yes I visited the goddess he was telling I've visited the goddess she is worshipped by one of the branches of the Malik family of Calcutta he's a very famous family they were very rich they were having lot of businesses and factories etc this monlik family this branch of the family is now in strained conditions circumstances and the house the leave-in is dilapidated the walls and floor are spotted with moss and pigeon droppings and the current a semen and plaster are crumbling but other branches of the multifamily are well of now in the big family as it always happened different brothers they are different way they are doing so this particular branch of that family which is having that famous Durga murti image of the durga she mo ba he me they are in a very poor condition economically very pure condition this branch has no sign of prosperity then he turned to the master moshai and said well what does that signify they are worshipping the goddess the other branch is not but those who are worshipping the goddess in Hawaii they are economically in a very bad shape so he was asking the opinion of the master moshai what does that signify master Mercia didn't reply he remained silent then ceramic reasoning himself gave the reply and that is very important and he said the thing is that everyone must everyone must reap the result of his past karma the thing is that everyone must reap the result of his past Karma one must admit the influence of tendencies inherited from past births and the result of the prayer of karma here comes another very important point of indonesia karma fella this is the theory nevertheless then again he goes in a different nevertheless in that dilapidated house I saw the face of the goddess radiating a divine light we will come to that afterwards but what is this karmic Allah and we thought that you will discuss about disc arm of Allah and it says karma that is predestined or the fate something like that fatalism sometime people the same and this fate or the lock this karma the sanskrit word karma in English is called action but the action has different type what sometimes the action is intentional is consciously done deliberately done willful action so the action is also the follow the result will come win this is in this way intentional conscious deliberate willful action when we are doing it it has his effect the Karma and this karma pala action that is called Karma and his father God it says is the law of karma obviously is a lot of discussions particularly then just with this school and the Hindu school they are doing about the law of karma and they say in this way as the sign says every action has its opposite reaction similarly the Karma the action when you are dream obviously it will have an opposite reaction and it says in this way Shuba karma the wholesome karma good karma or bad karma or shuva karma are on all some Karma there's the action there's a neutral karma also sometimes we are sleeping eating or sitting all these neutral karma in that way we are not doing anything which will be harmful or can produce some action I mean result so there are three types of karma we find one is the Karma that is having an intention to do obviously result will be something like that I go to a person I tell him that I'm worried about so-and-so and actually I give a totally false picture and then I influence that person in such a way that he take the action and obviously they that action brings the result in a different way I did nothing physically but when I go I say something that creates a result physically I'm not doing anything but my words and way of presenting that is creating some action which the result may be good or maybe bad if I go and say that person is really very good and you should not think in this way or rather you should help him that way I am inspiring that man encouraging that person is a good karma but the opposite way is a bad karma so the Karma fella with the intention I am trying to do something for the good and I am trying to with an intention to harm others I am Telling words in such a way using the words in such a way that is having a different meaning and the person understanding in a different way and reacting his Karma follow his action will bring result to him and same time to me too though physically I didn't do anything so what type of karma then it says Chaya mana Baca Chaya means physically I am doing I'm going helping someone physically or harming someone physically that is kya Karma mentally I'm thinking something sometimes good sometimes bad and we know that sometimes before the all our gurus the say before you try to meditate or you are praying worshiping you must pray for the betterment of each and everyone in the Hindu society they have a system they any puja that you do before that you must perform Ganesha puja this Ganesha puja means you are worshipping thinking the betterment of each and everyone Ganesha is the embodiment of the whole universe gana Aisha usually is the God Ghana means all sadhana Aisha that Ganesha when we are thinking that let everyone be happy service started organi serve over granny Pasha to let everyone be free from all miseries that is the prayer when I am doing that what happens good karma how I am doing mentally the one karma I am doing physically another karma I am doing mentally and third karma is there Barker about which we were telling if I say something positive which is bringing the good result because of my talk of my report or the way I present that it is said Raja karenina pashyati the King sees through the year that means he listens from different people he cannot go the King cannot go all over the players all over the country but he listens and gets the reserve reports and from that he's forming some idea and doing accordingly that is the thing a person who is reporting with an intention to harm someone else and that is very bad so that is the Karma we must be very very careful always it is there and different way it comes so the Karma is very very important and see ramakrishna is mentioning about that so see the branch they are what does that signify that means about the family the thing is that everyone must reap the result of his past Karma one must admit the influence of tendencies inherited from past birth and the result of the pirarucu karma he mentioned about only one now the karma means action and this action may be is intentional or unintentional sometimes just for the joke just for fun I say something not too hard or not to influence someone that result will be different though maybe that person is hard but I was not having the intention too hard so naturally the result will be different that is called the Karma father in a different way and then intention is very very important if the intention is not correct so this is we are discussing because in our daily life we are suffering or enjoying why some people for some reason they are suffering when we see we see oh this is the because of these and there but we don't understand it has a Karma so this is a very important subject a topic that one must be very very attentive to stand and then act accordingly and this karma is done with intention without intention karma is done through physically mentally and through the speeches Barker three March our domine Devi said you should not use those words which may hurt others so that is also babka kiya mana vaakya they said tapas in the eighteenth chapter of the bhagavad-gita they say tapasya austerity again industry bocce tapasya one should be very careful when using the words while conversing with others otherwise it is bringing the bad result sometimes some people are coming when they're discussing you feel joy you feel like talking with them but sometimes other people are coming the same way they are sitting same way they are talking and usually when they will go because the way they are expressing way they are talking the subject that they are discussing is not that way good Raghavan see Ramakrishna used to love Mata Baru very much and at the same time he used to love to visit the holy places so he went on a pilgrimage he went to the car she he went with matter Babu and he was staying with them but dear he was hearing that they are going on discussing about the business so he was not at all happy and he was praying - mother why you have brought me over here I was happy indoctrination such as environment the situation same people but the way they are thinking sometimes we don't express we are quiet but still the other the Companions they can feel that I am not liking to be talked or to discuss or to be there how it is possible because my mental waves the lens are green and touching the heart of others also thoughts also so the one must be very very careful about the mental thoughts the thoughts about that conditions under reach actions are done modified the result a soldier killing the enemies he is killing but he is killing the enemies in the world field and the person is killing only to grab something from other and he is punished he is considered as a dacoit he's the same killing is considered as a he nears he is punished by the court of law but when a soldier is killing over there in the border he may be killing so many people and the whole society giving him the respect as a hero so action in a different situation in done the result is different and we find that the same action and it's later eco karma and the Karma father is just like the Eco the sound and the Eco whatever we do it comes back to us so one must be those who are trying to be a religious person so yeah yesterday a group of people came I were talking with them I was trying to tell them but it was so impossible to convince them about this only some of the rituals going to the temples or construction of the temple or performing some Pujols and rituals that is sufficient of them so it is difficult all those things are of course good but the mean is if a person is not trying to improve his own mind how he will do to the Karma to the good karma that's why I see Ramakrishna again in a game he is asking xiaomi Vivekananda he said through unselfish work you can reach the same goal head with the wrist by his knowledge and Christ by his prayer so this work that is very very important and we find were here that Lord Buddha says no we're on art or heaven one can scape one's karma that is the Lord Buddha's the Buddhism and Hinduism both they believe in the karma fella otherwise he won't be able to explain why a person is suffering right from the birth another person right from the birth enjoying that is the Karma voila the past life I can't see that is why the Krishna say to Arjuna bahunam a batty tani gentleman eat about charge una Tanya jambe the Cerveny not 1 beta parent Appa though you are a parent Appa you're a very ferocious warrior even then you cannot remember you don't remember that you and me both again and again was born in this world in different forms different times I remember those so punar janma vada the rebirth karma follow Buddha they're all coming together and that is the result we are either right now enjoying or suffering so he has shown me be vacant on the same almost like the Buddha good good bad bad non can skip the law so this is very very important but there are three different types of karma in the Hinduism they say prarabdha sanchita and egami so karma means action the Karma the action when I am doing with an intention may be good good karma with an intention to bad bad karma and sometimes neutral karma is also there there is no particular intention of good and bad that is also there so three types of karma and the Karma follow also comes according to the situation very bad karma as if killing a person I am doing as a soldier in the battlefield it becomes good it becomes a good karma again when the Arjuna was confused in the battlefield when he was thinking shall I kill or not krishna encouraged him to fight to kill his own kith and kin why the first when we were reading see Ramakrishna is telling Maya attachment to the relatives Arjuna was under the influence of that Maya the influence that they are my Keeton came why should I kill though they were bad people they do they know they were harming the society but Arjuna was having compassion because of the attachment which the gods the Krishna broke and then afterwards Arjuna worked and then see Ramakrishna is telling after the whole karma you give it to me and I will be here you and I will to make it make you totally free the same karma we are doing but giving it to the god yet karma yet Hiroshi let us now see a duo see the Darcy earth yet the Pacific on the gerousia mother Panem whatever you were thinking you are practicing your acting everything including your thoughts also give it to me so the Karma at the same time we can get rid of all this but if we cannot then what happens the result comes to us good karma the good bad is bad as sharmaji said non can scape the love and there are three types of karma per hour up de san cheat and Nogami prarabdha means earned before now whatever we are now today is the result of the product a karma is very difficult to really feel and understand and we don't like to understand this or accept this because whatever we are today is the result of the past and suppose I am very good so I'm happy and I immediately accept suppose I am NOT I don't like to accept that because immediately I am accepting the bad deeds that I have done in the past life so people are not ready whether we are ready or not that doesn't matter anything that is the truth that is the law and it is going to happen the proper pooh-bah are after that is called prarabdha now whatever the past like we have done now we are having that result in this life whatever we are doing now it is going on in a store that's called some chit Sanjay Sanjay that is going on in a store and it is waiting over there it will come up afterwards and then finally egami in future is going to open if we don't believe that karma Paulo then what happens someone is doing something good but he is not getting any result and someone did something bad he also was didn't get any punishment then naturally in the law of God it is impossible it cannot be it says in the then Krita Hani our kitab the algum critter hani operative yogam there's two words used in our scripture that if someone has done something good inside certainly is going to get the good result if not then something wrong so it cannot be what happens it goes to the next life or the next life or the next life it goes following with just like our shadow following us we did something secretly no one noticed and I am free no it cannot be is going to come back in different some form it will come and the result will be surely there so this is called Krita Arnie I have done but no result sometimes some people they come and say he was such in a bad person but see how nicely he is enjoying see Ramakrishna said it is because of the parched karma he did something good in the past life so naturally whatever he is doing may be bad going inside his bag and is storing those things he doesn't know he's not aware of that and so he is enjoying his life in this life because of the past good karma we naturally we see this type of examples are so many in our life ceramic kitchen is giving an example see the past karma fella it is going to come to you and you are going to suffer product up about the product particularly he said one blind person with a great faith went to bathe in the Ganga after the bathing when he came out all his past scenes that went out he was purified that time but his blindness continued because of the blindness it was already there and it continued that is the example of the perab the Karma then the master March I said yes it is like the arrow that has already gone and already shot so we cannot hold it the arrow has already gone so that is called prarabdha karma and occur toboggan so obviously this to do show that these two mystics cannot be done by the law of God so this can never be the prayer of the Sangeeth egami this is the Karma one little girl she was trying to catch her own shadow and she could not do it she was going on trying to catch her own shadow so obviously it was not possible she started running to catch that afterwards she got tired she started crying then one person sitting from the distance noticed it and Saint why don't you stop you just sit over there you see your shadow will come to you she heard that man sat over there and found that shadow is also sitting with all the similarly when we are trying to catch our karma it is just like catching the shadow we are thinking that we will do the work so perfectly and then we will get the good result or we will never do anything wrong same way we do not know how we are doing something bad in the wrong way so best is this to all give it to the guard when we sit perform the Karma but do not hanker for the result and that is the secret of karma yoga the action the Karma the yoga that is unification with the God it is possible when we are offering the same thing at the feet of God the master and he was telling it like this pleasure and pain are inevitable when the soul acts at the body and there is no other way the truth is that one must read the result of the prob karma the body remains as long as the result of the past action do not completely wear away sometimes some people they are lying on the bed for years together it's so painful even to see like that some people are suffering so much and they're begging to die when as to visit one person is to say please pray for me so that I can die immediately right now I don't like to leave it's so painful to leave the longevity some people they we always bless live long but leaving long in this way suffering and unless and until he was suffering you cannot die even though if you can try but you cannot die because Ramakrishna is telling the body remains as long as the results of the past actions do not completely wear away and he said the evil deeds in the past bird had to undergo that afflictions and the master said however much abductor may be experienced physical joy and sorrow he always has knowledge and the treasure of divine love this is the secret maybe I am suffering physically but at the same time I know that God is there the treasure of love so I completely surrender there was a sea Ramakrishna's direct disciple the Maha purush maharaja is famous in that name Shami Shivan and the G he was having that asthma trouble whole night he could not sleep used to sit on the bed holding a pillow because in those days there is no proper medication also so he's holding used to hold the pillow on his lap and then bending over that somehow used to take the rest and the next morning when the monks and the Brahma cherien's is to go to offer their program to the Swamiji and naturally these two works our Usami G and used to say I am fine mentally but physically I am suffering there are two I this body is suffering but the mind is enjoy that is the cichlid and it's sea Ramakrishna also see much a bhakta may experience physical joy and sorrow she always has knowledge and the treasure of divine love this treasure never leaves him take the Pandava brothers for instance though they suffered so many calamities they did not lose their God consciousness even once that is very important where can you find men like them endowed with so much knowledge and devotion so this is the secret of karma yoga karma fala is inevitable so to summarize we can say there is karma action we can simply stop and in the bhagavad-gita Sri Krishna very clearly said though nature will force you to work you cannot simply think oh I will not work then there is no result so I am free from the carnival ah no it's not that was the wrong or the meze interpretation of the karma and the action and that is why in the Indian society majority of the monks thousands and thousands of them they thought that if we are retiring and sitting in a cave only going down to the village to get some food and then quietly sitting and doing taking the name of God then there'll be no Karma wrong because the mind is doing the karma mind is all the time thinking the bhagavad-gita it is very clearly meant and prakriti kriyamanani the prakruti the nature will force you to work your gunas sattva Raja Tama the three qualities that is dear inside the mind when a king returns in the forest the forest become a kingdom and the capital of that King because the whole karma goes along with him so naturally this karma is inevitable we must have to do but how we will do in this way if we can do that we are doing it as a young young as offering to God whatever we are thinking whatever action we are doing physically mentally we are all offering to God every day we have to offer it to God and to say that whatever you have given to me I am returning back to you it is yours and that way one can be free from that karma otherwise there is no we must have to either enjoy or suffer because of the Karma now that this Karma with the intention that we should be very very careful why we are doing it you cannot simply sit quiet but with the intention the thought that you are having at the back of the mind when you are doing so obviously that karma whatever we are doing will be the good karma secondly the circumstances we have to remember where we are and that circumstances accordingly we have to do we should do that karma thirdly we must be careful about that my action should not hurt others I'm not doing anything wrong I am listening the music but the volume is so much that it is everyone nearby are hard and disturbed I said I'm not doing anything I'm just listening to the music but I know very well that simple listening of the music in that high pitch high volume disturbing others creating problem for others knowingly I am doing it there's also bad karma bad result will come so all this way we must be very very careful when we are doing some Karma see Ramakrishna whatever he is mentioning in this gospel which I named as Pancham Aveda whatever he said only for the betterment the spiritual betterment of the devotees so when he mentioned about the Pune janma the rebirth theory when he mentioned about the Karma follow the action and its result we must be careful that if we want some spiritual development peace god realization so these are the steps we should take very carefully thank you very much if you have some questions because someone was telling you sometimes we like to feel asking some questions please give some five minutes time if you have some questions then we can try to answer here itself yeah grace of course because again in that gospel see Ramakrishna oh I think we have already read that portion there ceramic is nice say the carnival ah of course it is there but at the same time for the devotees those who are giving the whole thing at the feet of God it is different why because who is giving the Falla who is giving the result either good or bad so that the same God supreme god naturally will can have that power to completely remove those things and that's why they say Kapil moochin the kabbalah means the Fate motional it can change a person can always get something good suddenly if the god will sit we cannot go and ask him why you have done this where it is of course so that is the that is the ceramic ISNA mashallah da day again and again they are telling that if you develop faith faith in the existence of God and develop the devotion the love for God then everything God will take care you need to bother about it the some people they say the whole world is full of misery and Salam o Krishna said no I don't see misery I always see the whole world is full of joy why should I suffer I don't care about anything because I know my mother is there I go to my mother whenever I am hungry anything that I need I go and I know the mother is there that fate is important the moment I am having that complete faith that God is there which has been called as mother by see ramakrishna father by Jesus when that is there then there is no problem small baby is not having any action whatever he is doing or she is doing is not creating any action that moment the moment that it comes attached with the ego I consciousness I am doing then the result begins so that way it goes on this is very interesting and very mysterious very difficult to understand completely but one thing is very clear if one is having the faith praying to God then all the action that he does always become good for him ceramic is Nagaina say when the father is holding the hand of the child you will never make any wrong step so that is the assurance we can say any other question devar she's over okay then and let us now turn
