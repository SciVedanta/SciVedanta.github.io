[300. Panchama Veda 300 - “Narendra asked, ‘What is Qualified Non-dualism?’.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QZcj3iMA58)

namaskar good evening dear devotees and friends today wednesday will be reading the panchama veda you'll be very happy to note those who are regularly listening this panchama veda that today is the 300th uh the class that we are giving today let us begin the this special class 301 with this famous loker tabuka venom we are reading the gospel of bhagavan sirama krishna and in this the master mahashaya sri maha he has recorded meticulously everything and sometimes we wonder how bhagavan's rama krishna answering the philosophical question so easily though he has not attained it in school apparently he has not learned the scriptures but as if he knew everything because he was the source of that that proves that even if you are not studying in the school or colleges even if you are not studying the books the knowledge comes from within that is the unique way to understand and then sramakrishna is to mix with so many different type of people different philosophers different uh the asparants different sadhakas those who were from different schools who used to listen to them and he is to remember all those today we will study we will uh the l to to some extent the ramanuja's philosophy and that was asked by the great afterwards great philosopher and the teacher narendra sri m what is qualified non-dualism as a pure philosophical question and how sram krishna as we were mentioning never attended any school at ease gave the answer so we know that narendra and girish chandra ghosh they were debating krishna himself asked him to do that and he wanted to listen that they should debate in english but before sirama krishna they've thought that no it is not necessary so they started discussing in bengali and they were slowly slowly going on in a bitter you know debates and the topics like can god be realized through human mind can god manifest in human form like this bhagavan siddharam krishna was persistently supporting narendranath and now and then correcting his statements when the narendra said the god cannot be realized by the human mind immediately salam i support you i support narendra but a pure mind can't realize god either corrected him so it is going on but when they started quoting the philosophers both the great chandra ghosh and narendra nath though narendra was very young that time but he started at the all different scholars philosophers and they started quoting from them here we learn from bhagavan si ramakrishna one point and he said to the master srima i don't enjoy these discussions srama krishna indication was very clear and he said that you should read think and quote those who have realized the truth not those to only from the intellectuals that they are giving their ideas intellectuals may say many things but it is their only words they have not practiced they have not realized hence the sudama krishna mentioned in his own expression i clearly see god see from here it's mentioned that i don't enjoy these discussions why should i argue at all now he mentioned that we have discussed in our previous class i clearly see that god is everything so this is called rishibakya the one who has already realized it's not under the assumption oh these thing that thing because of these we can assume nothing like that direct realization so the truth is coming whether you believe it or not whether you accept it or not it doesn't matter sirama krishna is mentioning i clearly see that god is everything he himself has become all i see that whatever is is god he is everything again he is beyond everything he is everything again he is beyond everything so this is a perfect philosophical statement if he is everything then we have already discussed that then he's exhausted no he's beyond everything the poor namada purnamidam purnath the vidantin they always they chant they'll say from the one you take one that one will remain like that i come to a stage in which my mind and intellect merge in the indivisible so that is the realization the highest realization of the brahman i come to state in which my mind and intellect so when they were quoting the intellectual people and so-called philosophers sudama krishna didn't like it the indication is we should not waste our time reading all those books and philosophies written by these people talked by those people those who have not realized it it's not necessary so that this book the gospel of sirama krishna that is the book all the truth all the statements that has come from the god himself and when he came in the form of suramar krishna he realized that highest truth and he said that so this is the way we have to understand again he is telling i cannot utter a word unless i come down at least two steps from the plane of samadhi so giving the hint when a person is merging with the truth there is no body consciousness there is no eye consciousness there remain nothing though we see the body standing we see that person is standing but that is only like a statue his real soul has already merged with the great one that is called samadhi unless and until one have a deep meditation experience of deep meditation one cannot understand it or those who are having are a little conscious about the sleep when you are sleeping when there is no dream at all the dream less sleep when you come back if you can remember there was nothing no manifestation of the world no family no house nothing remained where it was then so this is the question the surama krishna could go and merge to that pure consciousness which is all pervading everywhere but friends it is just we are telling unless and until we understand that realize that we won't be able to understand what he meant only where to gaze it is something like deep sleep where there is no dream and when there is no dream there is no mind the no body no mind that is the existence without any disturbance and after experience is joy so sudama krishna is mentioning that i cannot utter a word unless i come down at least two steps from the plane of samadhi when he is coming down first he comes to the consciousness then to the body then only he feels oh this is me again he can speak otherwise no the suramar krsna's words and that philosopher who is just arguing and it's conception only oh it may be like this it may be like that he said that he said that so from there he is building up something shall we spend our time reading those books it's not necessary those who likes to be scholar let them but those who want to realize god be very careful don't waste time that is the pure indication of bhagavan si ramakrishna it is not necessary i have seen that god has become everything and again he's beyond all this that is the realization we need not to doubt about it so this is the statement now suramar krishna mentioned like this again i cannot utter reward shankara's non-dualistic explanation of vedanta is true look at it sadama krishna is the embodiment of parliament of religion he is the unification of all different philosophies and thoughts in one line he is mentioning shankara's non-dualistic explanation of vedanta is true and so is the qualified non-dualistic interpretation of ramanuja can you imagine so this unification of the two great rivers they're coming and mingling in sirama krishna those who are ramanuja followers they're always at the loggerhead with the vedantin and the vedantis are also not ready to accept the ramanuja philosophy when he said that the non-qualified non-dualistic interpretation of ramanuja i agree to that i agree to non-dualistic explanation of shankara also who is telling sirama krishna and they are great philosophers but sid ramakrishna realized that realized whatever they were trying to explain quoting the scripture quoting the upanishad sirama krishna realized that this is and then he is mentioning then narendra asking what is qualified non-dualism friends here we may go through a little about ramanuja mostly we know about shankaracharya but about the ramanujacharia the when the narendra asked sudama krishna gave the reply before that who is this ramanuja his father was ashari keshava dikshit and the mother kantimani keshava dikshit they were sharbakratu they got that the title the sharbakratu they can do everything the the everything means all type of ritualistic things prescribed in the veda in the veda there are four vedas so you will find sometimes some of the surnames indian surnames that is the second name they say it is that the chaturbaidi chatur means for vedi those people they could memorize they could remember all the four vedas imagine so from there the title now the present days chaturbaidi if you ask him what a chatura veda that also he doesn't know forget about all the details but a time was there someone in their family they were capable to explain [Music] each and everything ritualistic part of the veda so chaturbaidi similarly three vedi three vedas dweeby two vedas only baidi is a single veda so they were that at the time of the yankees they had different positions they will be performing and this father of the ramanuja was sarbakratu entitled to perform all vedic rituals not that everyone could do you have to study you have to give the examination you have to prove then only you'll be given the permission to perform so his father was like that this day a three uh lived in the sri perum buddhur sriparum budu is a 30 miles southwest of the present day chennai or madras so this was a beautiful town so they used to live over there ramanuja was born but of course there is some controversy some say that he lived 120 years and but the researchers they said no it was only 80 years from 1077 a.d to five 1157 eighty the that you that was his life period his name is rama plus anuja rama means ramachandra and anuja means the brother the ramanuja is the brother of sri rama that means the lakshmana he was always rebuilt against the wrong thought and tradition so he one day wanted to feed a so-called low-burn person but he noticed that every day that gentleman from a distant place they'll be crossing their village and there's to pass by the ramanuja's house to go to a temple worship over there and then again going back and he used to do it without any food that person will go back again in the evening morning used to come and all the way he'll go and he'll finish the worship and again going back then only taking food ramanuja as a young boy he noticed it then one day he said sir when he was returning back he invited him sir can you please come have some food with us so naturally is a brahmin the high caste how can they feed a low cost ramanuja's argument was is the is it the wearing of a cigarette threat that makes one brahmana that was the ramanuja at that at that age when he was very young is it the wearing of a secret trait that makes one brahmana friends those who have read the biography of bhagavan sirama krishna you may immediately recall that when sirama krishna was bestowed with the secret trade he told i have promised to a low-born lady that the first food i will take from har that's called bhiksha mata it's a great in a in the hindu society it's a great respect to give the fast food to a young boy who has been given the secret trait upon ayana there was also objections but the society but the argument of the boy we can understand he must have said something like this and said if i cannot keep the promise that i have done i have made then i am not a brahmana i must have to keep my promise and if i can't keep the promise then what is the use of accepting the trade ramanuja also asks this question is it the wearing of a secret trait that makes one brahmana he who is devoted to god alone is a brahmana this is very clear he who is devoted to god alone is not the birth but it is the action that makes one brahmana bhagavan solama krishna afterwards when he was very famous as srama krishna he also mentioned like that fight on him if he is a brahmana by birth and has no devotion to god and i praise that person though born in a low-cost family low-born family has devotion to god so it is the work it is the mentality that will make him either brahmana or the lowborn this is ramanuja he became the student of yadava prakasha yadava prakash was a very famous scholar in those days of the vedanta philosophy he deferred with his teacher in interpreting the upanishad though he was a student but he developed his own idea his own philosophy and he could explain in that in his unique way so one day his teacher was explaining a passage sattham gyanam anantam brahma his teacher was an ardent follower of the shankara shankaracharya so he explained from the point of view of the shankaracharya he said the brahman is truth brahmani's knowledge and brahmara is infinity satyam gyanam anantam brahma so these are the way one can express brahman ramanujan interpreted and he said brahman is endowed with the qualities of truth knowledge and infinitude and then as a personification the brahman becomes a person and he has his own qualities and those qualities are truth knowledge and infinity infinitude but the shankara says it's not a person is only those qualities that through that we can try to understand brahman that is truth knowledge and infinity by this way we can understand that brahman but ramanuja says no it is the qualities these are his qualities then he said these are his qualities as a person but he is not those qualities so he is beyond those qualities bhagavan srama krishna in the modern day he is accepting both the viewpoints so why that you will say afterwards we will read that these idealistic differences makes him renounce that school of vedanta vedanta and accept another teacher yamuna acharya who was a vaishnava as his teacher so ramanuja from the advaithic point of view he came to the dualistic point of view and he developed his own school and what he said now we will read in the words of bhagavan srama krishna he said when the narendra asked what is qualified non-dual non-dualism it is the theory of ramanuja according to this theory brahman or the absolute is qualified by the universe and its living beings these three brahman the world and the living being together constitute one this is the so clarity in thought in bhagavan srirama krishna as i was telling he himself has not read any uh the philosophy he only heard but his realization that gave a very clear conception according to ramanuja this world first he said according to ramanuja what is brahman the one brahman then the world and the living beings all these things that is there the world means all other things and the living beings all these together constitute the one take the instance of a bell fruit now bhagavatam krishna is giving his example and to make it easy for narendra to understand take the instance of a bell fruit a man wanted to know the weight of the fruit he separated the shell the flesh and the seeds but can a man get the weight of a by weighing only the flesh he must weigh flesh shell and seeds together at first it appears that the real thing in the fruit is the flesh and not its seeds and the shell the shell and the seeds belong to the same thing that flesh belongs to likewise the spiritual discrimination the one must first reason following the method of not these not these god is not the universe god is not the living beings god alone is real and all else are unreal so that is the way they are the understanding then one realizes as with the bell fruit that the reality from which we derive the notion of brahman is the very reality that evolves the idea of living being and the universe the nitya and the leela are the two aspects of the one and the same reality therefore according to ramanuja brahman is qualified he has some quality so qualified by the universe and the living being this is the theory of qualified non-dualism he is also believing one there is not two but he is one includes this universe this brahman so that brahman and this world with the other fruit the trees and the animals and all this and the being also human beings so all these three together constitute ramanuja's one and shankara is differing shankar is telling no they are all just like the shadows the imagination it was never there so these are the two differences to aim now bhagavatam krishna after giving the answer to the narendra he is telling i do see god directly what shall i reason about i clearly see that he himself has become everything that he himself has become the universe and all living beings friends the ramakrishna missions philosophy is standing on this the sudama krishna he saw that everything is nothing but the same god manifested so the on the basis of that in the beginning his disciple narendra nadu afterwards became swami vivekananda was not ready to accept it then afterwards he realized it you know that particular time and he sat under a tree and meditated and that was in the uttarakhand in the india and after the meditation when he came out of the meditation his brother disciple he went out to collect some food and when he came back and said narendra we have some food and he never cared about the food and he was so happy to announce and he said ganges gangadhar was the name the swami akandanda so ganges today i have solved my life's problem whatever is there in this universe is here within this person one man so everything is nothing but the manifestation of the same brahman so this ramakrishna is telling i see god directly there is no doubt this is what bhagavan si rama krishna and whatever he said are nothing but the truth veda what shall i reason about the people will be telling these and that it is not necessary for me to do that i clearly see that he the god himself has become everything that he himself has become the universe and all living beings but without awakening one's own inner consciousness one cannot realize the all-pervading consciousness how long does a man reason so long as he has not realized god but mere words will not do as for myself i clearly see that he himself has become everything the inner consciousness must be awakened through the grace of god through this awakening a man goes into samadhi he often forgets that he has a body he gets rid of his attachment to the last and gold and does not enjoy any talk unless it is about god worldly talk gives him pain through the awakening of the inner consciousness one realizes the all-pervading consciousness suramar krishna is the great teacher and his attention only to inspire us all to realize that truth here in this life and in the punisher as they say what is that the consciousness that is all pervading everywhere when that is slowly slowly arising that is that the knowledge is dawning then what happens the person become a lover and that person goes on loving each and everyone he can't or she can't criticize others forget about hearting others so that is the expression of the realization so this is the way bhagavan sirama krishna is so clearly mentioning and to whom he is telling to the master marsha who has noted it but in front of him was sitting the two devotee one the representative of the monks narendra nath afterwards and the representative of the householders girish chandra ghosh both of them they were sitting over there and they were listening to him they were learning and what is that argument book reading writing and lecturing all these things are apparent one should be completely dedicated to understand the truth which is there within him within heart within the person and see that everything is nothing but that consciousness the discussion came to a close sadama krishna said to him master marsha i have observed that a man acquired one kind of knowledge about god through reasoning and another kind through meditation but he acquires a third kind of knowledge about god when god reveals himself to him he's devotee now one is reasoning and by that way coming to a conclusion the god is like this another he is meditating and going into a conception the god is like this but when the god himself comes and reveal himself to that person then what happens he knows the totality of god sometimes we are arguing that different schools are there and among the hindus there are so many schools are there why because interpretation differs that's all the ramanuja school interprets the truth in one way and the followers of the ramanuja they think that is the only way shankaracharya's school they interpret the same truth in another way and the followers of shankara they feel that is the only truth and they don't like to listen to the other group madhua they will be talking about something else completely different way and that group also completely different we know all of the hindus all of sanatana dharmi all they believe in the veda so all are going towards the same goal in the true different paths bhagavan nothing wrong it's okay if you think that that is the path that is your philosophy that is your practice go in that way god speed but reach to the top realize that god ultimately and before that you may be shunning others okay but after the realization then you will see that everything is nothing but the same so that is what sidama krishna friends you all know from the vedanta society of chicago we are trying to establish to one from here only one special place which we have given the name home of harmony it's a home for each and everyone all philosophy not only of the sanatana panties of all others also abrahamic religions they can also come and we will sit together and we will discuss what is your god and please listen this is my idea about god so this is the way we will try to understand each other that is ramakrishna's way and if we come to just we can remove our ego and open up our heart our understanding we will find that we are going to the same goal through different paths that's all and nothing else so that is why srama krishna in a unique way a really unique he said i accept shankara i support ramanuja you cannot imagine if you go to the ramanuja school and you they will they are not ready to hear the name sankaracharya it's so much so so narrowness forget about reading they don't like to listen to that name go to the shankara's school they don't like to understand anything of the ramanuja why what is the problem if we understand each other then we will see as bhagavan sirama krishna is telling the shankara he is giving that explanation of the same truth in his own way ramanuja is also giving the semi that is why bhagavan sirama krishna is the embodiment of parliament of religion he himself practiced that and we want to establish that thing in the chicago city itself maybe 2022 so with all the wish best wishes of yours that will if it comes true then truly truly it will be a great help for the humanity suramar krishna is the answer when we are differing and fighting in the name of politics okay in the name of economy all right because human being cannot live without fighting even the when there is no no one around two brothers will fight between them so that is the nature we have to go above that beyond that but at least in the name of religion we should promise that we are not going to heart we are not going to kill there should not be any bloodshed why is only the understanding and how we can be so sure after realizing so don't criticize other paths try your own way if you are a christian as swami vivekananda said become a good christian if you are a muslim become a good muslim if you are a hindu become a good hindu and without hurting others criticizing others disturbing others try my friends try my brothers to reach over there realize the truth then as bhagavan sirama krishna said it is all the same after reaching on the top we go negative not these not these not these then when we reach to the top and we see everything at the same this is the greatness and unless and until one he awaken the consciousness within he won't be able to understand the all-pervading consciousness which is god the discussions come to a close salaam krishna said to him i observed that a man acquired one kind of knowledge about god through reasoning another kind through meditation but he acquires the third kind the full when the god himself reveals his devotee if god himself reveals to his devotee the nature of divine incarnation how he plays in human form then the devotee doesn't have to doesn't have to reason about the problem or need an explanation so if the god himself is coming forward and doing it that is the main thing it's a realization and no one can help you know spirituality is one thing no one can help shankaracharya in his bible he said suppose someone is carrying a load on his head another person can help him taking that load on his head and relieving him by that way it is possible suppose the father has taken a loan his son can repay the loan that is possible but for religion you have to realize the scripture will help you will guide you it's the map the guru will help you there's a guide you he's the guide but you have to travel you have to go and he mentioned it depends on the person adhikari depends on the quality of the student to understand the truth that knowledge that he is reading studying including it depends on the student follow siddhi what will be the result depends on the student it's not the school it's not the how the rich library or the laboratory no it's not the best quality teacher qualified teacher no it is the student it is the person the upaya desha and kala the time the space and other things there's only supportive we have to try we have to understand and he is mentioning in this way the devotee doesn't have to reason about the problem do you know what is it like suppose a man is in a dark room he is giving the example he goes on robbing a match against a matchbox and all of a sudden light comes likewise if god gives us this flash of divine light all our doubts are destroyed a man is going on rubbing the matchstick on the matchbox and after few tries suddenly it gets that light and then all the darkness goes away there remains no doubt we can see everything with that light similarly when going on praying to god taking the repeating the name of god and that is just like going on trying to light the matchstick so this is the way why one should take the initiation because that is the matchstick that the guru will give you the name of the god apparently it is nothing as simple as that mastic but the simple matchstick can make a huge blast the same way when the guru gives that maha mantra one should go on repeating repeating repeating and repeating that means going on robbing it then we do not know when suddenly a flash will come and the mind will open up and all doubts will go away bit dante ridhaya granthi then all the grantees that is tying down that is all our desires sometimes desires as subtle desires are there the desire for name fame everything will go away and we will see that everything is nothing but the same brahman shame consciousness i am also the same what i was wanting what i was crying for everything is me and nothing but me so that ramakrishna is telling unless it is there doubt will be remaining and the debate will continue and the difference will be there so what we should do without wasting our time in debating and trying to prove that we are the best our paths are the best and then collecting people to support us and the converting people so that we are a majority and the huge number instead of that go on trying to realize the truth and be free the kings they wanted to grab a huge land so that he becomes a very powerful king ruling over hundreds of other kings and then where all those have gone the philosophies of the philosophies came they wanted to convert people where they have gone all they are now nothing so understanding this futility the temporariness the what we are doing it is person it is the important that one person ashankara as bhagavan sirama krishna all they are mentioning it is the person that should get liberated my father my father was the great devotee it doesn't matter at all my guru my teacher was a great realized person it doesn't matter at all it don't matter the am i truly trying and how we should try suramar krishna is giving the hint go on trying trying trying one day the match will surely give that light keep that fire go on repeating the name of god so one day your mind will be purified for sure and the light will come god will give the revelation sudama krishna asked narendra to sit by his side he tenderly inquired about his health and showed him much affection narendra to the master why i have meditated on kali for three or four days but nothing has come to it he is asking the three or four days i have meditated but nothing has happened master all in good time my child kali is none other than brahman this is a revolution is mentioning about kali even today there are people among the hindus they are afraid of goddess kali even among the hindu temples you will never find all gods and goddesses are there to manifest it in a beautiful way the kali image of kali is absent even they don't keep the pictures also they're very much afraid why oh she'll be cutting the heads of the people maybe by mistake when i'm passing by the side if that showed come on me that is all nonsense there is also ignorance that is why bhagavan sirama krishna friends this is a thing that we must understand why i again and again say that this is a the veda the gospel is nothing like a veda because it reveals the truth misconception about the kali and that was spreaded by some people who never wanted that the hinduism should really manifest so that is a different story now that we can why not so what is this kali nothing but brahman is mentioning that the kali is none other than brahman that which is called brahman is really kali she is the primal energy when the energy remains intact i call it brahman and when it creates preserves and destroy i call it shakti or kali see they're very clear when that energy remains intact when it is not activated when it's not working that is called brahman and when that power now knowledge is power so obviously when the knowledge is activated it's called kali that much what you call brahman i call kali brahman and kali are not different they are like fire and is powered to burn if one thinks of the fire one must think of its power to burn if one recognizes kali one must also recognize brahman again if one recognizes brahman one must recognize kali brahman and its power are identical it is brahman whom i address as shakti or kali so this is very clear one should not have any doubt about it one should not have even then if they are doubting that is their problem but those who are a true lover of the knowledge lover of religion forget about the hindu and muslim and christianity and all that if you are true lover of knowledge of religion of god and whatever name you call it there are two things one is knowledge and the knowledge in action this much and that has been wonderfully given the form the symbol that is shiva and shakti the kali the kali is nothing but brahman and siva is nothing but brahman it is only the symbolized in that way if we understand these the misconception will go and the idea the conception the knowledge without action cannot help me when that knowledge is active then only it can help me always i say when a doctor is sleeping that even if i am standing sitting by his side that that doctor cannot help me though i am suffering but when that same doctor he's awakened and the knowledge that was there within him it start manifesting then only he can prescribe some medicine and i'll be free from pain the same way if the knowledge is intact but inactive that cannot help us but when the same knowledge is activated working that can help us that's why bhagavan sirama krishna against all oppositions you can imagine in the 19th century beginning so much opposition against the kali bhagavan sram krishna worship god is kali and then he established it is nothing but that brahman the if you are reading the biography of bhagavan's ramakrishna that's why i again and again say that unless you know that person his words is teaching you won't understand it's so clear brahman and kali are not different it was a late at night girish asked hari pada to call a cab for he had to go to the theater as haripada was about to leave the room the master said with a smile mind a cab don't forget to bring one so all people are laughing so the haripatha the name is he is at the feet of the lord so he is going out that's ramakrishna jokingly reminding him haripathu is smiling yes sir i am going out just for that how can i forget it the purpose for which we are we have to we should not forget that and we should try to acquire that girish that i should have to go to the theater and leave you here master no no you must hold to both king janaka paid attention to both religious and worldly duties and drunk his milk from a brimming cup all were laughing girish i have been thinking of leaving the theater to the youngsters master no no it is all right you are doing good to me narendra said in a whisper just a moment ago he meaning girish was calling him meaning sirama krishna god and incarnation and now he is attracted to the theater say not indra it's a young boy you can imagine and just a as a teenager we can say that they are like that they're always argumentative doubtful and as the girish was telling the surama krishna is nothing but the god himself and now leaving sidam krishna at his own home he is going to the theater this young boy immediately noticed it and told it to the master whispering of course look at it he was telling you god and now he is leaving you over here the god and going to the theater not in the worst time sitting beside the master and the latter looked at him intently and suddenly moved closer to his beloved disciple narendra did not believe in god's assuming a human body but what did that matter sudama krsna's heart overflowed with more and more love for his disciple he touched narendra's body and said quoting from his song don't you feel that your pride is wounded so be it then you'd we too have our pride then the master said to narendra as long as a man argues about god he has not realized him you two were arguing i didn't like it friends i think we should stop over here and in the next again wednesday we'll study so this time we have understood that sadama krishna is emphasizing that we should try our best to realize god in this life itself the last sentence that i read from here he said you were arguing that means you have not realized god those who argue about god that means they have the doubt is the conviction there is god no question of arguing so when the god is there and the god has become everything and the god is everything and by that way when we are looking to our life whatever we do nothing but the puja that is why when the girish wanted to go to theater salam krishna said well please go. when he said i want to renounce the theater and immediately he said no why because that is also the same work only if you are turning as a missionary you will realize god when i whatever i am doing whatever if i am dedicating that without hurting others harming others cheating others if i am just working for my livelihood always that will be supported by the religion that's called swadharma whatever i am doing to support my family for that i am not hurting others i am giving my either intellectual knowledge or physical uh thing the way i am earning money but i know the god is there and ultimately i'll go back to god and i don't want all these worldly things in my life they are there i am living with that but i know they are temporary nothing is going with me not including my body and mind that also won't go with me i am that pure consciousness and i will one day go and merge with the consciousness that's all this is a beautiful way sirama krishna taught and today we have learned how he is making the shankara and ramanuja two great schools together today we have learned that brahman and the kali are nothing but the same thank you friends i think there is no question today so we'll be offering our pranam to that great lord and we conclude is [Music] namaste
