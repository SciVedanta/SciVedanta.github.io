[258: Panchama Veda 258 : Sri Ramakrishna And Tagore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amal9RxxQrc)

the he was born in may 15 1817 and he lived almost 88 89 years and in those it is a long life he passed away january 19 1905. this father dwarkanath was a very rich land owner also he was having shipping and banking business and they used to call the prince dwarkanath most of the time he used to go to london used to live over there and he had a lot of money and debenda nats mother that was debian yeah the devinda nathu was born in 1817 sorry so devindernath was born and and his wife was sarda debi the sarda devi was known for her reading habit now i read long back so i was from there i was from the memory i was trying to get it this sardadevi had a habit of great reading in those days the girls they never used to read sarida devi is to read a lot and it says sometimes when she was not having any other book to read she used to read the the dictionary she was very fond of reading dictionary also and very interestingly i'm not comparing just informing the mother of swami vivekananda she was also very fond of reading and she also used to read a lot so like this the ancestors they they were also rich people are very good people they came the nuts uh this father dwarkanath he gave the the the lot of money to start the calcutta medical college but that is a very famous thing that he did and he was the co-founder along with the raja ramon ray of the brahma shamaj that was the the prince dwarkanath the devindanath's father devindernath was a slowly slowly after the dwarkanath he became the owner but he was not interested to run the business as his father but rather he was interested to study philosophy and to start a new school of philosophy he started saba tattwa means the truth bodhini to understand sabah a union so like that he started with his friends then afterwards the he became the leader of the brahma samaj it is in 1842. devindranath started in the anglo-hindu college that just our mathurbab was referring so they both studied in that college keshav chandrashain was the again the very famous the leader of the brahma-samaj he broke out of this devindranath in 1866 that is the background that 1866 was long back now the takurveni is going to meet him that is the time he was leaving in a boat and on the in the house boat and the ganga used to leave and people used to respect him not only he was a very learned person used to read the the vedas very fond of the punishers and it is said in his autobiography he has mentioned that one day when he was chanting ishaba shamidam sarvam from the ishwa punished the very first verse he felt that from the heaven the gods are pouring that nectar on him that was his feeling that he mentioned in his autobiography so this is the background of the devin ortega but afterwards he failed that the vedas are not the good book and it should be discarded so he almost discarded the vedas and he started his own so that is the another thing and this devandanath thakur is going to meet and going to meet with his friend matarunath but devindranath you see when the siram krishna went over there he when he odd why i told the background of the devandana tega because this is his background he was a very rich person and naturally in those days the rich people means it is unthinkable unimaginable to go for the ordinary people like bhagavan siram krishna to go and meet him so he took the help of his friend another rich man and went over there but look at it the salaam krishna he wanted to see his body because when a person is meditating and practicing japa practicing spiritual austerity some signs come on his body which bhagavan sram krishna could identify so he asked him he is always about god i wanted to see devin dana's physical mugs and said to him let me see your body he pulled up his shirt and i found that he had very fierce skin tinted red his hair had not yet turned grey so devindernath was older than bhagavan suramar krishna the devin was born 1817 and sudama krishna 1836. so obviously the dividend was senior but still salaam krishna went and saw and divintanath such a proud jamindar but he showed his bare body sirama krishna saw it at the outset i noticed a little vanity in devendra and it is not that natural isn't not that natural he had such wealth such scholarship he knew four languages bengali sanskrit parshion and also english four languages he knew and such name and theme noticing that stake of vanity i asked mathur well is vanity the outcome of outcome of knowledge of or ignorance can a nuera brahmana have such a feeling as i am a scholar i am a ghani i am a rich sirama krishna indirectly indicating that though he was practicing austerity but there were some mistakes because the vanity should completely go away so that's why in the beginning i was telling is a completely different thing spirituality means awareness without ego that awareness without ego then he gets that complete the knowledge of god otherwise the moment a little ego is there in the mind of the person no he cannot so the sudama krishna indirectly indicated while i was talking to devendra i suddenly got into that state of mind in which i can see a man as he really is i was converged with laughter inside in that state i regard scholars and the book learn learn it as a mere straw if i see that a scholar has no discrimination and renunciation i regard him as wordless worthless straw i see that he is like a vulture which soars high but fix its look on a kernel bit down below the very strong word sirama krishna is using why because these people are the leaders of the society these people are the founders of the spiritual societies the spirituality means spirit and the flesh the worldly thing if the god we are trying to realize is completely spirit is completely divine it has nothing to do with with the worldly things and the ego the vanity the wealth the knowledge of the different languages all these things belongs to this world which is temporary which is not permanent and which is not true friends in the next page when we will read you'll see krsna's vedanta swami vivekananda mentioned he was a pure advaithin his knowledge was clear complete because he was god himself it's not that he started the book and some conception not like that as a that knowledge was from him so that is the difference here sirama krishna indirectly is mentioning about is vanity the outcome outcome of knowledge or ignorance so he is mentioning i found that devindra had combined both yoga and boga in his life he had a number of children all young the family physician was there does you see though he was a gyani yet he was preoccupied with worldly life i said to him you are the king janaka of this kali yoga suramar krishna is appreciating him being a rich person influential person a leader of the society he's still trying to understand the god and trying to use his time utilize his time for the realization of god's ram krishna appreciated that at the same time sirama krishna as he said i could see the mind of the person at that from there he saw it's not completely full so he said you are having both and two give him the appreciation you are like janaka janaka was a gyani but he is rama krishna is telling and okay this is to encouragement holding to one as well as the other he drank his milk from a brimming cup that is from the bengali at the verse he is telling i have heard that you live in the world and think of god so i have come to see you please tell me something about god the previously also when sudama krishna was visiting a group of people whom they called marwadis the people from maduras and the business community and sadama krishna there also he was talking with a scholar sanskrit scholar and he was asking him can you please tell me something about god so he could understand he trying to understand the understanding of the devendra naruto about the brahman about the god he recited some text from the vedas he said this universe is like a chandelier and each living being is a light in it once meditating in the punjabiti i too had had a vision like that i found his words agreed with my vision devinder reciting from one of the words of the veda srama krishna he is accepting those words because it is telling of his own experience own realization this is the speciality of suramar krishna it's not from the intellect but from the realization and he was also correct while reciting the words afterwards though he uh he discarded the vedas and wanted to start a complete separate path but it was not successful realized people only can do that and this ramakrishna saw anyway this universe is like a chandelier and each living being is a light surround krishna saw that in his own vision and i thought he must be a very great man he asked him to explain his words he said god has created men to manifest his own glory otherwise who could know this universe everything becomes dark without the light in the chandelier one cannot even see the chandelier itself we talked a long time devendra was pleased and he said to me you must come to our brahma-samaj festival that i said depends on the will of god you can see the state of my mind there is no knowing when god will put me into a particular state they when they insist it no you must come but put on your cloth and wear a shawl over your body surama krishna was not very much careful about his dress those who have seen his picture the very famous picture that we worship everywhere with almost the bare body so naturally the devindra is an aristocat person he didn't like it and he told that you should cover your body and you should come someone might say something unkind about your untidiness and that would hurt me that devendra is telling you should cover you know that was the aristocratic families of the in the then india mostly this to have the friendship with the rulers the britishers and like the britishers they used to put on the coat and shirt sometimes the also the trousers and sometimes the dhotis the traditional the cloth but over that a coat they used to put on and he was expecting expecting the suramar krishna will also do the same sudama krishna who was not having the body consciousness how can he do that so sudama krishna was very clear and no hypocrisy so he told the truth no i replied i cannot promise that i cannot be a babu babu means the aristocrat i cannot be a babu as stupid mean they are in originality is not that and they are superimposing something to show that there's somebody in the society that is not going with the spirituality so sudama krishna will never accept that so suramar krishna told i don't like to be a babu i can't become babu babu barbuna in bengali he said then no hypocrisy what i am i am if you like it is okay if you don't it is okay that is called the truth constantly holding the truth the tsunami krishna's impression was mixed from the study we can say i was telling the background and trying to tell the background of this devinda nattega whom sirama krishna whom we call lovingly takur so takuri is meeting the teger the tiger was rich and he was educated and he was also spiritual people used to consider him and takur is only spiritual he was not rich he was not that too educated and no question of aristocracy in the the term of the society so a completely different person going to meet another person why when he heard that he loves god and he's trying to realize god so friends from the whole thing this episode what we should learn forget about what devendra and ramakrishna we should learn if anyone even today the god is eternal it's not he was only at that time and not now srama krishna is there he is eternal he is god and he loved to visit us he loved to come to us if we are loving god if we are trying to realize god isn't it so that is the teaching that we got from here so he said no i cannot promise i cannot be a babu devendra and mathur laughed then the next line very interesting the very next day mature received a letter from devendra forbidding me to go to the festival and he wrote that it would be ungentle manly of me not to cover my body with a shawl and all the devotees to whom suramar krishna was telling this they all laughed so this here it ends the taco meeting the taker so though the this two person both are we are trying to consider that both are spiritual look the difference that this is the difference the spirituality means completely without any connection with the worldly things name fame money knowledge nothing like that it has nothing to do with that that's why the shenanigans they don't try to disclose their past because the moment they say that i am from such and such university and my family background that my father was a rich man this is that immediately people considered them in a different idea different thing different view but the sannyasi has nothing to do with that family connections or the university or the certificates of that knowledge he should be judged with two things purity is the basis what is the purity unselfishness and love the surama krishna is telling that teaching us that now he is introducing another person so first we saw devendranath is not liking the traditional hindu way he wanted to develop another path another philosophy based on the veda then he became disgusted with the veda he couldn't get much thing so he also disgusted the veda and started of his something new his followers they broke away because they wanted to continue with the veda so they became two adi brahma samaj that was of the devendranath and no new brahma samaj under the leadership of the of chandrashin so here it ends now another person was a traditional hindu very orthodox hindu he was from nepal and he was the ambassador of the king of nepal to the british india so suramar krishna is introducing him there is another big man captain suramar krishna used to call him captain but he was not captain he was actually the ambassador of the nepal though a man of the world he's a great lover of god to maimna mahima charan he said talk to him sometime he knows the vedas the vedanta the bhagavata the gita the adhyatma ramayana and other scriptures by heart you will find that find that out when you talk to him mahima children also was very fond of reading memorizing quoting and it's to feel happy in that way so sudama krishna is telling you will find that person also almost the same you like him he has great piety once i was going along a street in the barangar and he held an umbrella over my head he is also a rich man he is also well established and on the in the high society person and he is the ambassador of the king of nepal then we can understand but ceramic is telling when suramar krishna was going this person without any vanity without any pride he was holding the umbrella on that suramar krishna that shows he's so genuine so sincere about his spiritual life he invites me to his house and shows me great attention he fans me massage my feet and feeds me with various dishes once at his house i went into samadhi in the toilet and he took care of me there though he is so particular about his orthodox habits he didn't show any abhorrence for the place friends these one one sentence one word later this very important this person you know the traditional hindu if they go to toilet they will change their clothes they will again take the shower and they will go to the temple so they've considered that in that way so that is the particularly the brahmins they will never do it if they're wearing some clothes and going out in the street after coming back they will change the clothes they will wash the feet and and then if possible take a shower then only they will go inside the temple otherwise not so this type of person he is helping sirama krishna who went into samadhi in the toilet without any hesitation that means his love for surama krishna was truly genuine this is telling this is one picture now the second picture that you will get again he has many expenses he supports his brothers who live in banaras his wife was a miserly woman at first then naturally sadama krishna saw and then now she is so burdened by the expenses of the family that she cannot spend all the money she would like to captain's wife said to me he doesn't enjoy worldly life that is why he once said to say he would renounce the world true every now and then he expressed that desire the captain so that gentleman inside he said devandranath in his past life he must have done something very good so in this life the arch for spiritual life was there though he was very rich even then he had an urge but at the same time for some reason he was not happy with the traditional hinduism they wanted to start a new the captain he was also having the arch for spiritual life but he was following the traditional hindu way he didn't left the hindu thing or started a new thing or went to something else no he was following the traditional hindu life so this side by side the cerama krishna giving the two picture and this person was having some trouble because he has to spend a lot of money and all this but he expressed many times that he wants to become a monk captain was born in a family of devotees his father was a soldier i have heard that on the battlefield he would worship shiva with one hand and hold a naked sword in the other this is the background of the captain's family devindernath's family his father was a fabulously rich man and the businessman and well associated with the britishers so that was another time this is another time captain is a strong upholder of orthodox conventions i like to want your attention over here the two pictures side by side captain is an orthodox hindu because of my visiting keshav chandra shain he stopped coming here for a month then just one or two para before we read the captain was so respectful to bhagavan srama krishna that he never hesitated to went inside the toilet to help him and don't think that it is a our modern toilet nowadays no it is not like that the ancient toilets that the in those days in the 19th century beginning it was there so in that place he went and he holds ramakrishna when sudama krishna was walking on the calcutta street even though he was such a rich person and he was holding the umbrella just like a humble person on the head of sudama krishna that devotion was there at the same time orthodoxy so so narrowness just ramakrishna went to keshav chandra shane as keshav chandrashin all you know he was also that deviated from the hindu path and he started another group of the brahma-samaj it's not christianity it is not hinduism but in between something like that sudama krishna went because they were trying to realize god they were that's all for sudama krishna concern is is it really searching for god loving for god with which path how does it matter sincerity for realization of the god that is the question but the this person who was having so much respect for sudam krishna has stopped coming after visiting the for a month he said to me keshav had violated the social conventions he dined with the english had married his daughter into another cast and had lost his own caste the very strong the supporter of the caste systems the kesha shane but he this daughter was married to a king's that family in coach vr so that's why he is not liking the why should he do that i said to captain now this ramakrishna what do i care for such things keshav chants the name of god so i go to him to hear about god i eat only the palm what do i care about the thorn so this is sirama krishna those who are the followers of ramakrishna so that we should notice we should understand for suramar krishna that devin dana teger the completely a different system that he started and following it is not liking the hindus traditional hindus swan krishna went to visit him wanted to see whether he is sincere wanted to notice whether he is making the progress or not and this is called love unselfish love love without any boundary and that is the symbol of purity that is god what is god swami vivekananda said l-o-v-e about sudama krishna he said l-o-v-e love personified and love for all and that love for all but at the same time those who are trying to realize god trying to become holy trying to reduce their ego he is liking captain and he one visited the devendra not tegra both are the lovers of god so sudama krishna is interested to see they meet them but two were completely too different way this is sirama krishna he is embracing each and every one and trying to rectify each and every one helping them he told what do i care about such thing kishap chants the name of god keshav is chanting or taking the name of god so i went to him why do you see kesha i answered him captain remains stubborn and he said to me why do you see kesha captain used to love sudama krishna but this narrowness i answered to him rather sharply now sirama krishna he said but i don't go to him for money i go there to hear the name of god now this is srama krishna he said and how is it that you visit the viceroy house and the advisor is the british viceroy and is an ambassador of nepal naturally he has to go a lot of businesses and everything and how is it that you visit the viceroy house he is a mletcher means the not hindu so is the militia that is the term term that the traditional hindus days to use those who are not a hindu so they are militia how can you be in his company then i underlined that silenced him a little not that he completely accepted but he silenced him a little but he is a great devotee against he's not criticizing but only trying to understand what is the good qualities and what's the bad qualities a narrow orthodox hindu and a completely critical about hinduism both persons ramakrishna is visiting and that is the uniqueness of surah krishna but he is a great devotee when he worships he performs aarothi with camphor when he recites hims he becomes totally different person he becomes absorbed to mahimajaran in the light of vedantic reasoning the world is illusory friends from here i will just read this passage and we will discuss afterwards see the sudama krishna he didn't study the veda in the traditional way but his realization that tallies with the vedas experience and that is the uniqueness why the hindu accept veda because it is the truth all the experiences that the pure-hearted rishis the god that was recorded that is recorded in the vedas how it is proved the people the avataras like bhagavan sirama krishna when they meditate when they realize the same truth without knowing the punition without reading the upanishad but it goes in the same line we can understand whatever it has been expressed in the upanishads in the vedanta it is true the sudama krishna from his own experience from his own realization is telling in the light of vedantic reasoning the world is illusory vedantic reasoning not from the dualistic reasoning unreal as a dream the supreme soul is the witness the witness of the three states of waking dream and deep sleep these things are in your line of thought mahima charan used to study the vedanta the sudama krishna is telling it goes in in your line of thought the waking state is only as real as the dream see waking state is as real as the dream the two persons ram krishna mate and master mashay recorded sirama krishna's opinion about them and his experience about them one is an orthodox hindu but a little narrow-minded it doesn't want to go beyond the the boundary of the so-called hinduism another is a breakaway from the hinduism a completely different person so both are rich bo both are well established in the society well both are educated and both to some extent religious though their opinions and their practices are little different sidha krishna after mentioning these he is coming to conclusion from the point of view of the vedanta and he said that the vedanta reason what's reason it says that it is the supreme soul is the witness the waking state is only as real as the dream let me tell you the story that agrees with your attitude friends we will conclude over here and we'll read this story of the beautiful story that explained the complete vedanta in this two pages that today we have read that this is the thing that we learned we should not be completely narrow minded and at the same time we should not give up the traditional path it has values the traditional path has values how because so many people practicing following the traditional path they have realized the truth and the scripture that we read that is the vedanta the upanishad they are all true they are enshrined the truth why because the realization of the bhagavad-gita goes with it as one divinda was quoting i was the chandelier suramar krishna told i saw it in my realization and at the same time he was appreciating the in the very devoted way of the captain he he follow but not appreciating his closed mind now he is giving the conclusion from the point of view of the vedanta this world this life is and the dream are the same so spirituality and the world so if we become spiritual we should not be as devendra was so much careful about the dress not about the spirituality so this we should have to understand thank you friends thank and uh in the next class we will study the vedanta vedantic view of krishna so the first question is from kamal chaudhary he's asking when tapu says the goal of life is to see god what happens he mean by seeing here and what happens after seeing god uh can you read it again so when taku says the goal of life is to see god yes i think his sentence framing what does he mean by seeing here seeing the god yes god's realization and seeing he's here actually realization and then sudama krishna said god can be seen god tag can take the form you know that one the lady old lady used to come to bhagavan si ramakrishna agar mani devi if you read her life she was a widow from the age of six or so and she was a great devotee of shri krishna and she prayed that krishna should be her son and that her prayer was really become successful with the blessings of sirama krishna she saw krishna as a son so this is seeing the god can be seen in whatever form whatever name you like to god can be seen and what happens after seeing that means god realization there remains only love and joy and nothing else because after the god realization after seeing god and the person the realized soul understand this world is transitory and world is really nothing so obviously his whole mind goes to god which is spirituality which is that atman the brahman and all these things of the world he loses the test and no connection with the world only joy joy and joy come on swadhari is again asking also could you kindly explain what do you mean by awareness without ego the ego means ego is associated with the body and mind i that is the ego me and mine that is the ego when the i consciousness is there me and mind consciousness is there related with this uh also associated with these worldly things how can i god go to god so that exactly i meant bhagavan's said that if there is a small another trade is coming out and it won't pass through the eye of the needle so that is the ego even a little ego it will never allow us to realize god ego is the last boundary ego is that wall that separates us from god and me in reality we are god but why we are thinking that we are not because of the ego so when the ego is completely abolished then only we can realize god the next question is sima vishwas she is asking today's generation does not believe about tradition how we can motivate themselves so shimaji the so no we cannot conclude in that way because today's generation i have seen so many young children so many young people they like our tradition they love our tradition they're only in so many people they are coming etc but anyway some people yes so that is the nature of the young people you know not that they don't like it but they just like to show what is it if we can explain them with the goddess kali puja is coming today is wednesday this coming saturday is the kali puja then who is this goddess kali why she is black why she is having the human skull as the garland why she is cutting the head of the people and why the cutting the hands the shivered hands are hanging from our west so all this if we can explain to them they will understand otherwise if we take the literally if we say we don't know all those things and you need not to bother about that just go and bow down to kali naturally the educated mind young mind they don't like that that is the reason this devendra and raja ram mohan rai and the keshav chandrashain and they were leaving the traditional hinduism because they could not get the answer to all these and our pandits the so-called learned sanskrit learners they couldn't answer and they slowly slowly it is becoming very clear because of bhagavan's ramakrishna's teachings the next question is from madhumita she's asking how do i practice doita and advaita bhavna at the same time i think you know as a practice you should choose one it is better but as a knowing we know the dwaita takes us to advaita how the sudama krishna said again and again if you choose dwaita the dwaita will take you to advaita what is advaita or means negative nil no and dwayta means two no two there is only one so obviously when i am worshiping my god my god will show me that there is only one god and there is nothing else and i too am belonging to that god the example is nicely gives that the waves millions of waves thousands of waves of the oceans they are separate some are big some are small but all belong to the ocean ocean is not the waves but the waves belong to the ocean isn't it the different name different form if you give the different waves but the waves ultimately goes back to the one so when we are worshiping krishna or kali or durga and one day the time will come i will see we will see the worshipper we will see that is only one and there is no two thank you very much let us join this mantra and conclude [Music] by [Music] friends today is the veterans day so before conclusion that today's this shanti this peace i like to prayer for peace i like to offer those great souls who dedicated their life for the betterment of others so that we remember all those great veterans thank you very much
