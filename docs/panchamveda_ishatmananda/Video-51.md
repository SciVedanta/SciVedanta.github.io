[52: Panchama Veda 52: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFtiy7zavjM)

you let us begin written um today those who are attending regularly this uh class the panchama veda today is the 51 class so 50 classes we have already completed today is the 51 class now here in the last class sirama krishna is in calcutta and he was observing the people in calcutta and he is mentioning his observation i find the attention of the people fixed on earthly things they all are rushing about for the sake of their stomachs no one is thinking of god so this is a observation of bhagavansi ram krishna of the people who are living in calcutta that means the householders so this observation the keen observation of bhagavan siram and we find that this has the reference in our scriptures also the difference between the pashu the animals and the nora the people what is everything is common they also feel hungry they also feel sleepy they also are afraid and they also have the desire to develop their family all things are there everything is there then what is the difference between a human being and animal dharmeen ahina pashivahi samana without the dharma without the religion without the thought of god so this is very very important bhagavan sirama krishna he has taken the form of a human being but he is god himself he has created this universe he has created the human being he has given the intellect and at the same time he has given the delusion that is the maya and this maya suramar krishna is telling acting in two ways biddamaya avidyamaya biddya means knowledge illusion of knowledge and then when that knowledge that is also illusion when it comes to human being what happens it takes them to sadhu-sanga satsanga in the holy companion and in that holy company they always cultivate higher thoughts and what are the higher thoughts about this life and after now this life we have seen those who are little elderly we have so many experiences of this world and we know what is it now this is the thing that is always there in our mind then what afterwards what is going to happen afterwards so that is the question bhagavan sirama krishna is pointing out this thing about those people who are only thinking about their existence those who are very poor those who who cannot support themselves but then of course they will go for their earnings how to support their family how to get some extra money but those who are not so much what is their thought something but not of god and sometimes they will be criticizing god also they'll be disbelieving god and they think that they are very very intelligent so this way on those type of people who are thinking in that way sirama krishna is not happy with them and he's telling that is mentioning that it goes only in the the whole attention only goes in the stomach only food that means how to survive how to enjoy those things but we know that in our scriptures and our lifestyle in our society it has been divided in four astronauts four and the whole life has been divided in four different parts one is chaturasama it says chaturd asama chatur means the four astrama the places or the lifestyle first is the brahmacharya and second comes garhastha then bana prasta this garasta this is a very very important and it's this restaurant this is the highest asthma why suramar krishna is not criticizing he is only making us conscious about our thinking when the people are earning a lot people are getting the social respect they are in a well-placed condition they don't think about god at all and by that way their whole mind goes to only the body look at the animals their joy everything depends on the body only food only food and only food so over that only they are enjoying their whole mind is their thinking everything is nothing but survival only eating surviving sometimes they are angry fighting all this but the human being should not spend their life like that that is the greatest advice that one can give to other bhagavan's ramakrishna is giving this advice to us but no one should misunderstand that he is criticizing the srishtastrama this chaturasama among these four this garasta it is called swishtasrama then once there is the stories are there narada was very proud and he used to think that he is the greatest devotee of god because he can take the name of god constantly whenever he is getting up from his bed and till going to the bed in the night he is going on singing and praising god's name so he used to think that i am the best devotee so one day he told his master the the god i am your best devotee why i am taking your name constantly i never do anything else except taking your name constantly repeating your name remembering your but god said no i don't consider you as my best devotee have a devotee over there in such and such place go and see then you will understand immediately narada got curious and he went over there he observed the person from the morning till night then kimber can report it to the god what you are talking about he never takes your name he only repeats your name takes your name just offer a pranam to you in the early morning then he is running after his work and then after that when he comes back and the night when he is going to sleep just before that he will be taking narayana narayana he will be uttering and he will sleep and you say that he is the most important devotee then the god said okay forget about it will you do one thing what can you take this as a small uh the tumbler full of oil and go round this place without splitting even a small thing from that oil another said okay he took up that went round the whole place came back and said happily not a single drop split from this oh that's good but how many times you repeated my name remember me what do you say are you kidding it is not possible i my whole concentration was on that that nothing should spill from there how can i take your name then the lord said look at that person he is performing all his duties so difficult constantly thinking about his family and other responsibilities attending all those and at the same time taking my name at least twice and you could not take remember me once and you consider yourself so that is the reason the monks who have left their heart and home they are supposed to take the name of god constantly because they have already left for that but the householders attending all the responsibilities the monks sometimes say i am not going to visit that man oh i won't go over there i don't like this i don't like that but the householder cannot say that because he knows that i must have to go that is the relation i have to develop i have to keep every day he is going to the office and the working places not all people are friendly but still he is maintaining the balance and all through his life and so many different responsibilities he is maintaining at the same time he is thinking about god so bhagavan siram krishna is one place he is telling bish mon boja 20 we can say what mon so that heavy load here carrying but still there remembering god so bishman aj householders agrihasthi that sudama krishna he is appreciating these people but he is making us aware that the life is my human life is for something else so don't go after money name and fame and then waste all your energy in that people go again again again exactly till the end of their life they will be going for that and then they are not at all happy ultimately they are not happy why because they have not taken that advice of bhagavan si rama krishna so that is the reason sirama krishna is doing telling this and here sirama krishna is giving an advice the master continuing here one mr bishwas had been sitting in the room for a long time now he left he had once been wealthy but had squandered everything in an immoral life finally he had become indifferent to his wife and children as because he is not earning money he can't he's not having money so naturally he is now avoiding the responsibility referring to mr vishwas the master said he is an unfortunate wretch he is giving that so look at this man he is not performing his duty a householder has his duties to discharge his debts to pay his debt to the gods his debt to his ancestors his debt to the rishis and his debt to the wife and children there's so many the panchayat as a household has to do so it is not so easy that is the reason in our country they used to give lot of attention when they were brahmacarians and that time they used to go on telling them dharma i am promising that i should practice the dharma and this is the dharma responsibility so this responsibility the moment i am accepting i must perform it so dharma here he is telling that he has so many the rishis that means the teachers they are depending on the householder the god the worship everything that is for on the householder and sisters and they have given the life they have supported you to leave now you should not forgive forget them you have to remember them and do some something for them so this way and at the same time to the family and of course to the society you have to pay the taxes so the government can take care of the society all these responsibilities come on one person there's a householder and only a monk must not save you must have to save some money who is telling it sri ramakrishna who never could touch the money but so practical he is asking the householder to save some money the chitranjan bosh he was very rich person they say i do not know how far it is true that he used to send his clothings to london from calcutta to london for washing so that was the fancy he used to live a life like that then afterwards he became a patriot he started loving and then he donated all his things to the society he never kept anything for his wife and finally ultimately his wife had to suffer a lot she had to depend on the society's money for survival that is not correct suramar krishna is telling if the wife is chased then her husband should support her this is the practical teaching of sirama krishna and the spiritual teaching in the veda we read something that is all very good but what can we apply that in our day-to-day life in our practical life that is cerama krishna is translating and given to us that is why the panchama veda this veda this knowledge this is spiritual knowledge and what is that you must have to take care of your wife and children if you're a householder you must have to take care of the family you must have to take care of the society your friends your ancestors the guard and also those people who are doing good for the society and not earning and that is the reason you have to give them support through donation and so so this is the responsibilities if you are not doing it you are not practicing spirituality and he is telling only a monk must not save the bard and the monk do not provide for the morrow but even a bird provides when it has young it brings food in its bill for its chicks this is the way sirama krishna is explaining now the balarama bush in whose house suramar krishna went he was feeling bad because he invited that man biswas and he wanted to tell sirama krishna what is the truth and he said mr bishops now wants to cultivate the company of holy people and once he was bad he has lost all his property his money in andaman there was a lady she used to come she was a bengali lady and she kept her son in our astra destitute by his home but her surname was something that was not bengali surname so one day when she was sitting before me and just talking i told if you don't mind your son's surname is a bengali surname your name is a bengali name and you speak bengali but why your sun name is not bengali surname is a different type of surname then she told this is a very peculiar thing she told swamiji my husband was a very rich man and she he was having such a huge property now the drinking and also the games dies and all that he started play playing and that way slowly slowly he lost all the property he started taking uh the money from different people now all other people stopped giving money the loan he used to take from other friends they stopped it ultimately he started taking loan from his own servant who was working in that field and then finally when he could not repay in andaman you know it's a different type of society then he said what to do i cannot repay you that man claim i want your wife as my wife you have to then i he give that it is not mahabharata it is in one and i thought instead of living with this man who constantly beat me and insult me cannot give a little merciless food it's better to live with this man the servant who belongs to different caste so that's why i have married him but he is not interested to keep my son so i have kept that boy with you so this is the what your husband is doing now he has been employed by our previous servant now he is the master and the master has become servant he is now working and earning money so this is the time that master is telling they are wretched people even they got so many things they can't keep it no one can help them no communism no materialism no nothing can help them because they want to destroy they are bound to destroy because of the bad thoughts bad thinking so that is why sirama krishna is not happy with this type of people and balarama said mr vishwas now wants to cultivate the company of the holy people after all those then the master smiled and said a monk's goes to the four principal holy places with him coming to lu the the monks they carry the water bottle sort of thing it goes to everywhere actually is made of wood and it is bitter wood so that's why master is telling it goes to all the holy places with him but still tastes bitter though the kamanduli is also traveling along with the master at the colon with the monk to all the holy places but it is not transforming it is not getting any effect so when we go to the holy place pilgrimage center we have to strive to be holy otherwise we never can become a holy just because visiting the place won't help sometimes that's why when i go to hindu temples i see so many people are coming donating helping whenever i got get this opportunity i just quote suramar krsna's try to remind them when you are coming to a holy place think of the holy things try to remember god and whatever time you are spending over there utilize that by that way so this is the master is telling a monks commando goes to the four principle holy places and here there's a note they are telling the kedarnath in india the kedarna that is in the himalayas dwarka is the west and rameshwara in the south of the india and the puri in the east so these are the holy places suramar krishna mentioned four holy places and those who are going on pilgrimage they know chaturdam charidahama that is different kedarnath iii these are the four holy places in the uttarakhand now people they go i also went after the sannyasa yamuna 3 is the source from where the yamuna is coming out that's a beautiful place but very difficult to reach over there from one side is flowing the very ice cold green water and another source is coming the hot water boiling hot water and there are three pawns on the top is impossible to reach it is so hot boiling and the second one is little less so the people they take the rice and then they'll be putting the rice inside that water immediately it this boiled cooked and that they offer to the goddess and take food and the third one is little less more or less so one can go and bathe over there so that way but then when that water is flowing both the water flowing side by side one is boiling another is chill both the water going that is a unique place if you can go i don't know whether anyone has gone or not but unique place but at the same time is difficult to reach over there of course i am talking about long back must be that they have developed the roads so this is charidharma four dharmas and these are the four holy places that is kedarnath dwarka ramesha and puri the master is talking about some frequent the company of holy man in order to smoke him krishna's observation because in the uttarakhand in the north it is so cold the swamis the monks they are not having the proper dress proper clothings they will be smoking that to keep their body warm and the devotees in the name of having the holy company they will go over there and develop the habit of smoking like this it was the auspicious occasion of the jagadhatri puja the festival of the divine mother sriyam krishna was invited to shurendra's house in kolkata but first he went to the house of the manmohan in the neighborhood now when one is reading the biography of bhagavan si ramakrishna he will know about all these characters this man mahan and shurindranath very interesting characters the master was seated in the manmahan's parlor he said god very much relishes the bhakti of the poor and the lowly god very much relishes the bhakti of the poor and the loli just as the cow relicious fodder mixed with oil cake so this is a one thing very very interesting it may be that he's a poor person he cannot offer but he is lowly means humble as a wealth it doesn't matter with the god but if you are lowly if you are humble if you don't have the ego then your prayer will be answered by god he loves this type of people and then again immediately he is telling king duryodhana showed krishna the splendor of his wealth and reaches but krishna accepted the hospitality of the poor vidura god is fond of his devotees he ransacked the devotees as the cow after the cuff now how the wonderful way he is explaining as the cow is running after the cubs similarly god is running up to the devotee but we do not understand that a devotee means is a one who loves god when we are loving god we don't care for anything else so this is the thing that we must have to remember and then he is telling caitanya used to shed tears of joy at the very mention of krsna's name so that is the symbol of love when we love the god when you love krishna then how it is possible to understand that the moment we uttered the name that the tears rolled down sri caitanya mahaprabhu used to shade tears of joy in the just in the very mention of the krsna's name god alone is the real substance all else is illusion so this is the ultimate vedantic knowledge what is vedanta brahma-sartya jagat mitta all these uponishas that we read so many upanishads and all people are reading upanishads remembering the punishers quoting from the verses of punishers and the veda the whole veda but actually what is there only one half a sentence it can be mentioned brahma satya then next jagat mitta now how this brahma which is satya the truth at the same time the same brahman is transforming into this jagat this universe with all these varieties this is the unique idea of the vedanta we the people animals birds insects plants trees everything is nothing but that brahman taking different shape the moment we get this idea we get the advaitic knowledge or dwithik one knowledge what is that god is perverting everything and the same thing through the knowledge we are approaching gyana marga through knowledge through discrimination and then the same thing is happening to a devotee who is only crying singing dancing cooking offering the food to god and then ultimately he sees that god is all pervading and he says wherever my sight goes tatra tatra krsna's fury there and there and everywhere i see the lord krishna only see the devotee and the gyani both are reaching to the same goal so this is the specialty of the vedantic knowledge now here the man can realize god if he wants to but he is madly craves the enjoyment of the lost and greed the last and luke are lost in greed that is the problem all other responsibilities all other things are necessary he should do he should perform with a knowledge keeping in his head that god is the only substance and all else is illusory next he is telling bhakti is the one essential thing sidano krishna at this time in this modern days he is propagating that bhakti because the knowledge and the karma is all very difficult so here he is telling bhakti is the one essential thing who can even know god through reasoning i want love of god what do i care about knowing his infinite glories that the moment i love god i get everything sirama krishna again telling that suppose you go to a landlord and you inquire how many the jewelleries the landlord is having how much money he is having in the bank or how many papers he is having all these things are not necessary if you can develop relationship with the landlord then the landlord will call you maybe that he will ask you to sit by his side maybe he will tell you all about him so if you want to know you will get all those things if we want to know how the god is creating all this can i get a little power of that so that i can also read the minds of others and horoscope and all these so many different type of supernatural power people are cribbing on all their running for that but without loving or caring for god so sudama krishna the god in this modern age he is reminding us this god alone is the real substance all else is the illusory man can realize god anyone can realize god that is the beauty of krishna he is never discriminating or telling that these are the criteria the only brahmana only the person who is altering the womb or the person bathing in the ganga or he must be a hindu nothing like that caste creed religion language no bar anyone can realize god if he wants to only that sincerity should be there now all the religious unity we are talking going on different meetings is are going on parliament of religions all different type of people are coming from different faith they are sitting together they are exchanging the notes and then expressing their own views all those things are going on but look at this suramar krsna's war only one sentence if you love god there is no difference and that makes the whole parliament a religion if you love god then complete so that is the bhakti is one essential thing who can even know god through reasoning you are the judge ramakrishna has now come to shurindra's house and he is talking with the brother of surendra who was a judge in those days in the it was a british rule and an indian becoming a judge in a court that's a great thing so he's telling you were a judge these that is very good the shurindra's brother surrender was the devotee of rama krishna and he was also very highly posted government officer and he is telling here he is to his brother you are a judge that is very good but remember everything happens through god's power so this is the way one can become humble and very simple only to remember that everything happens through god's power it is he who has given you the high position that is how you become a judge people think it is they who are great the water from the roof flows through a spout that is shaped like a lion's said it looks as if the lion were bringing the water out through its mouth but look at the source of the water a cloud gathers in the sky and rain falls on the roof then the water flows through the pipe and at last comes to that through that mouth of the lion in the olden days in calcutta and on the rooftop because it is flat roof the water is accumulating on the roof and coming out now also the people have the long pipes previously they used to keep only the small pipes the water is coming out and at the end of that pipe just for the decoration there will be the mouth of a tiger or lion or a cow or something like that the deer so naturally people used to say from the deer's mouth the cow's mouth of the lion's mouth but all water is the water from that cloud so that is the very important thing so many powers are manifesting some can sing well some can dance some a master in mathematics a very good scientist and the moment they become famous immediately they forget that the power is coming from god they forget to become humble rather they become very very egoistic and the moment they become egoistic they lose their power again and once again they go back after their death because of the ego they enjoy all their good deeds and then again go back to square one and that is why sirama krishna is mentioning these and he's now the surendra surander's brother who is the judge he is asking a question to sirama krishna brahmo samaj preaches the freedom of women and the abolition of the caste system what do you think about these matters so this is most of the people they'll be talking about the social problems social problems and the spirituality are totally two different things so these we one should understand siddha krishna in a very simple way now these people are also religious people they claim themselves religious people very few are now left brahma-samajis now these brahma-samajis they were taking up the social issues and they were talking about that the one person came and he was telling the all over in america now the churches are having this problem they are now trying to solve what to do because the new ways in the society always and the excitement so they like think some people they think they will do once it came the hippie movement the whole american europe hippie movement they started thinking we should go back to the nature we should live like that few people went like went like that it was good and it has bad effect also now another movement has come all over the people they want to leave together same sex and all those things one person came and told what would be your opinion no opinion whoever will come and give donation they are our devotee no problem for us you give donation and then listen to us and you are a devotee no problem so that is social problem there is not a spiritual problem but why they say like that because most of the religious people they go into that social problematic things they think it is the religious people should solve the social no one thing one must be very very clear man making character building that is what swami vivekananda said not solving the solution the solving the problems of the society no we should not be involved in that that time the freedom movement was going on sir swami vivekandar was a lover a patriot passionate patriot of india my country my people india used to arter like that and sister christian is telling we started loving india respecting india just by hearing the word from his mouth the way he used to speak and to alter the word india he was so much we know all about that but the same swami vivekananda said to the ramakrishna mission nations you are not supposed to mingle into the politics you are not supposed to do that you are supposed to tell what is good and what is bad you are supposed to inspire people to be ethical good moral spiritual then the social problems it is they will solve not we so many times the people will be coming why you are not joining us now we should go these place that please you know that movement was going on before in the india that transformation came in the political life so people were all agitating and why you people even if you are hindu you are not coming and joining i told have you seen the type of cloth i am wearing that is the difference so sometimes we also cannot distinguish sometimes some monks they will be plunging into the politics they will be doing that it is not a work of the monk so when this question came to sirama krishna is so clear spirituality and social reformation when a person is getting the spiritual touch if he is inside the society he is a householder he will certainly do something for the society but the spiritual person is not so here he is telling in a different way he is answering men feel that way when they are just beginning to develop spiritual yearning when you are just beginning the spiritual the religious thoughts are coming you are thinking about god now you think about all this then he giving the analogy a stone raises clouds of dust and one cannot distinguish between the different trees the mango and the hawk palm and the turmeric everything like same but after the storm blows over one sees clearly after the first storm of divine passion is quelled one gradually understand that god alone is the highest good the eternal substance and that all else is transitory these we see in the life of arabin the gosh the arabinda ghosh was a patriot he was a very rich man's son and that rich man his father arabindo's father never wanted that his son become an indian though he was born in india but very early age both arabinder and his brother they were taken they were the father took them to london and they put them in the school and he was growing up as an european some people they used to boast about that my children my son are just like that that it was also the special way the britishers developed to rule the india they put in such a way some of the people started feeling following their lifestyle and behaving like them is the best way in the society few days they were having that but arubinder was destined for something else though his father tried well but afterwards after education after becoming the is when he came back i see us when he came back to india he started loving india he started serving the society and ultimately we know how he was fighting against the britishers and britishers captured him and sent him to prison now in the prison the whole thing changed the patriot arabinda became a rishi arabinda he entered as a patriot but when he came out he was spiritually developed person then he said this is not my job my total life focus is too totally different so that is the difference here suramar krishna is telling because he is giving the answer to that person and it is related with the present-day movement and those days it was the movement brahma-samaj they were talking about the social reform and all those surama krishna said when you are trying to become a religious person what is religious person highly moral person when a highly moral person he is coming to the god the first thing that he feel oh all these bad things in the society we should remove it that the first wave that comes that we must be removing all these bad things in the society so the society becomes all right but can you really do that bhagavan sri rama chandra he killed ramana and he tried to establish dharma by that way krishna not one ravana hundreds of them and he brought them in one place and totally abolished them again that yodana everywhere this way everything always it will be there in the society because this thing is coming from brahman and one part is the total is the maya the illusion and one part of maya is gyana biddamaya another part of maya agyana avidyamaya it is between everyone all these two are with between everyone and it is easy to follow the abit the maya because it takes you down when the water is flowing down it is easy but when you have to send the water up you need a palm the sadhana the austerity going to the guru taking the name practicing austerity getting up early morning and taking the name of god and all those things at the pump why to send back the water up or to the god so that is the reason the surama krishna is telling the moment it goes when they start traveling towards god as because they are moral people very sensitive people good people they start feeling for the others so they first think we should do this we should do that we should feed people as good but the ultimate spirituality is something else and stressing on ultimate spirituality this type of problem will be there in the society swami vivekananda who inspired the whole india to wake up to work for the poor the downtown the illiterate then again that same vivekananda is telling do you think you can solve the whole society's problem no it is like the dog's curly tail when as long as holding the tail it is straight the moment you leave again the the tail will come down there's a story again the one person got a ghost but the condition was he should go on giving the work to the ghost the moment he will say i am tired of giving you the work the ghost will kill him that this man was going on he was so happy i have so much of work to do no problem hey ghost go and do that go and do that go everything was over and in the twinkling of an eye now this fellow was thinking oh my god what i will do there is no other word then he ran to that monk who gave him that blessing he said sir please save my life what i am to do i completed all mine and he is just doing within one minute one second he is completing then the monk said see the over there that our dog is lying with a curly tail bring that dog over here and when the ghost come ask the ghost to make it straight and the ghost also thought it is nothing he made it straight and left again is curling against curling all through the life he is going on the ghost became tired and said will you please allow me to go i'm tired of it and the man was also happy because he has already got so much of things so that way life is if we think that we are going to solve the problem of the society impossible now the middle eastern's problem we are solving the middle east problem then it will come to somewhere else somewhere else somewhere else it will be like this constantly then what should we do we must be very very sensitive whatever comes on our way whatever possible for us we must help we must do that solve that and that way we must make our mind prepare our mind for the higher spiritual realization and what is that god is all pervading those who are killing they're also the same god those who are dying the same god now if you say that people will wonder what he is speaking maybe so many people are listening because the live stream is going on in the youtube it will be there and they will be thinking what the swami is talking about it is and it is called lila and this leela it is so difficult to understand why this is the leela of god is the play of god then one person said who is suffering just because of the play of god all human beings are suffering then the sudama krishna said who are you who are these human beings god himself and that is why the rubindante in his poem you are giving the pain you are feeling you are suffering in your own mind what am i going to do is the god who is giving the pain it is the god who is suffering in his own mind who is giving the pain and who is suffering god so that is called leela how one can understand this faith faith faith is so easy it is not a mathematics or chemistry of physics that you go to a person and immediately you get your idea clear doubts clear no you have to go on doing the tapasya the sadhana constantly then only maybe by the grace of god you can get the pro so problem solved you can get all this idea so this is the reasons ramakrishna is telling don't pay your attention to all those things it will be there the problem will be there solution will be there now they were talking about the women education almost all the women are educated now the problem is educated women are not listening to the society's victim that is the problem whether the women should have education or not now the debate is going on then the one problem to another another to another then those all related what to do now some people they are talking about the it is not necessary for the women to join in the army for the combat force because this is difficult life killing people immediately another why not whether do you think only women will be here and eating the barbecue and no so obviously problem and the solution solution and the problem it goes on like this they are telling for the betterment of the women why you need not to come and fight all this you better be there no we'll go and fight they are taking after the boxing and all that so many other games are also there but no boxing actually so this way if you think is there any really any solution no some people they are so good they are telling them but they won't listen now this is the way society goes the problem will always be there now what a spiritual person should do this is the question our life span is very short and that is why sirama krishna is very specific if you want to realize god you can but only thing that you have to understand what you have to do what we have to do fast faith that there is god have faith faith faith that there is god second faith again i can see him i can talk to him because rama krishna has promised that faith again i can see him i can talk to him i can mix with him i can be with him promised and then third effort what is that effort the sincere effort to pray to god i want to see you i do not know how i don't have that much capacity to perform please help me see ramakrishna again he is telling in the olden days the guard of the train they were they used to have one type of lantern three sides are closed only one side is open with that let's just like our modern day torch they used to see and they used to show the light et cetera et cetera siram krishna's time that was a very unique thing now in the night he could see the faces of all passengers that they were traveling the
