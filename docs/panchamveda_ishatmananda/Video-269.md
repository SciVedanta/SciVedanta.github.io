[270: Panchama Veda 270 : Be Restless For God](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqVMsxPNnuQ)

dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening we'll be reading from the gospel of the quran krishna panchama veda but before that let us start with this mantra srabana mangalam he is giving us the wonderful the example of spiritual life in his in his own life and at the same time he is mentioning from different scriptures different stories and guiding us in the spiritual life moreover the very difficult thing that he says in such a simple way now we were reading the last time one must have faith and sincerity hypocrisy will not do to the sincere god is very near so see this is so simple the god is very near the good is the great assurance and what we need sincerity genuineness faith if we don't have the faith then no question about the spiritual life god realization but if we have faith those who don't have faith if they have doubt there is different class they will be coming afterwards whatever we only are concerned about those who are see so what are the two things necessary faith faith in the words of the scripture and what is the scripture here right this moment the gospel of sirama krishna the panchama veda and what he says god is very near how to realize god he said that you can realize god with your sincerity in hindi there's a again and again to get inspiration myself and at the same time to tell all other friends and that says mo where you are searching me my friend i am so close to you see so nicely i'm so close to you why you are searching me very difficult places in the pilgrimage and do these do that that's of course all right but what is the truth so close god is so close to us so near to us that faith because the great souls after realization they are telling us that god is so near to us then why we can't realize god then he is telling you to abhimilanga if you truly search me here comes the word sincerity first is the faith then comes the sincerity that sincerity is the main pal look at it the word how that the last means search the laws in a twinkling of an eye that much this is a story and you know those who are following my classes in the ashtabhakra that there also the king janaka when he heard in a twinkling of an eye one can realize the brahma the brahma-gyana the knowledge of the brahmana so the afterwards he got his guru dashtabakra he went along with him then what the guru said very tactfully very nicely after becoming brahma-gyani there will be no difference between guru and the shisha the disciple and the master no differences so you give me the guru pranami that you are supposed to give when you receive some spiritual advice you are supposed to give something to the guru for his livelihood give me that and what he gave he was so excited the king janaka to realize the brahman he said guru you want okay this whole kingdom that i have i give it to you then he added i give my everything to you please give me the knowledge then what the guru did guru told where okay very good i accept all your gift now wait here till i come back what then janaka was thinking in the beginning he was restless he was thinking oh maybe that this man is going to cheat me then no since i have accepted him as a guru i must have the complete faith on him then he was having the faith then slowly slowly he started thinking where i will go i am now thinking that i have given the whole kingdom to him and moreover i have given this body to him i don't have now authority to walk from here out no i cannot unless he says disease moreover why i am thinking the mind i have given to my guru i don't have right to think even the janaka stood over there and meditating standing meditation we can say and slowly slowly his mind became tranquil and he realized the brahman so this is the technique how the great the wonderful words and the words of inspiration what is the spirituality bhagavan krishna said restlessness this austerity for the spirituality austerity for the god realization is the restlessness for god so this is a wonderful word restlessness to see god to realize god what type of restlessness bhagavan siddha krishna gives the example of a child who failed that he has lost his mother and wants to go back to the mother one must have the yearning of a child in the page 673 of the gospel of sirama krishna that we have already read that portion last time i read it again one must have the faith and sincerity hypocrisy will not do to the sincere god is very near but he is far far away from the hypocrites one must have forgot the yearning of a child the child sees nothing but confusion when his mother is away you must try to control him casually i'm sorry you must try to casual him by putting a sweet meat in his hand but he will not be fooled he will only say no i want to go to my mother one must feel such yearning for god ah what yearning how restless a child feels for his mother nothing can make him forget his mother so after describing this suramar krishna is to observe the whole society wherever he used to go whatever he used to see he used to utilize those for the spiritual teaching almost all of us we know the yearning for in my personal life also when i was a boy of maybe seven or eight years old so i was traveling with my mother and some other family at a tram you know and i was curious to see what is happening uh in in the driver's cabin it is closed if on the glass you can see i went to there and then somehow without here my four family members they got down in one stop the tram contacted in those days it was all a very empty not much crowd so the conductor noticed he came and told boy well you'd like to go i turned back and didn't see the mother and the mother got down that neck before star and that i can remember immediately flash them inside the mind oh i have lost my mother what will happen to me the whole world the curiosity the about the driver how he's driving the tram so everything lost then that conductor was telling i i will help you i will help you and then your mother will surely come but i was restless i wanted to jump from that running tram then i can feel many of you must be having that type of a feeling so this is actually what happens this is we every one of us we know that the yearning when we feel that type of weirding for god so without god i cannot survive that is the ultimate condition and that is called the restlessness restlessness for god sometimes we are restless to achieve something in some worldly things maybe some litigation legal litigations are going on so we want to be successful we are very restless what is going to happen every day we are inquiring so many things but for the god restlessness and sudama krishna he brings our mind to that so he is not telling anything else very basic thing to realize god if the god is with form or without fall religion this bad that bad that is not the question at all question is whether you have a faith that god is there sick like a child who wants to go back to his mother are you eager are you restless that is the main thing suramar krishna is mentioning after giving the example he is telling he to whom the enjoyment of worldly happiness appears tasteless he who takes no delight in anything of the world money money name creature comforts sense pleasure becomes sincerely grips taken for the vision of the mother to him alone the mother comes running leaving all her other duties so if we are trying and we are not getting the realization of god the what is the problem we are not are not that way restless to realize god now the question can anyone have this type of risklessness no why because in the bhagavad-gita we find so it comes from our previous birth our actions as a result it come bhagavad-gita chapter 6 loka 37 arjuna asks re krishna oh lord if a person who had faith is or her spiritual goal what will happen to that soul when arjuna is asking this because he was doubting i am not enjoying this world okay for god realization and then i don't realize god too then what will happen to this life total wastage i couldn't enjoy and i couldn't realize also so that was the question of that is very good question and lord is giving the answer with the full authority because he is the god himself in reply the lord krishna is telling part very beautifully he's mentioning here in this world and not in the haven after the the is a word of consolation and encouragement whatever little that we are trying over here to realize god nothing is this will take me to the next life and from there if i am sincere to the more higher and higher lord krishna is giving the assurance he is telling this is the no my dear there is no destruction for them no on them who were trying to realize god in this life but failed to do so what will happen to them first he is mentioning after death he or she goes to the world of righteousness many people they like to know what happens to those devotees who those who want to realize god and doing the giving full attention in that after death what happens to them if they are really sincere if their mind is with that prayer that i like to go to god they go to the world of righteousness who are those righteous now suppose i love god in the form of bhagavan si rama krishna masha radha shami biba kananda after the many many people millions of them they are doing after the death we will go to one pillar place and we will again we will have the company of the those who love krishna they will go to that krishna loka by kunta they say or vishnu loka or who are trying to realize god without form they will go in their own way here the lord krishna is telling after death they go to the world of righteousness and living there for some years because the birth so tiring they don't like to come back again so they like to be over there happily but after then the karma fella is exhausted you get the pull back to this earth take birth when they come back what happens take birth in the home of the pure and prosperous so when one is born in a very good family where they have sufficient to maintain to eat and all that thinking oh there is no money for the next day what will happen or very rich but at the same time poor in their thought constantly thinking how to get more wealth how to cheat others how to do this business how to do that these righteous people never take birth in those families this is the assurance of lord sri krishna so those who are having this birth may get assurance that we are better very better better off there we will start second he is mentioning or he she is born in a family rich in wisdom rich in is taking birth in a family reach in wisdom his father is a great soul so the lord sudama krishna is coming over there they're not very rich but they had sufficient to eat and at the same time they had the richness of wisdom his father his mother they were really great people so these are the souls and then the sri krishna is commenting though such a birth is rare why because the avatar the god comes with richness is there richness in wisdom and third he says there he she comes to in touch with the knowledge acquired and strive further for perfection after the birth in a righteous family and they have sufficient money to take care of their their daily life so through this suddenly that knowledge started opening up and they feel attracted to go for sadhana but the god realization buddhism so this is the way bhagavan sri krishna is telling us so when we get the restlessness for god because of our karmapala some people they're trying to realize god that is also their past karma and they are born in a good family now a time came when their the karma followed he felt the arch to become a monk so they left the heart and home and became the monk and they started life again over from there or those who are in the household but feeling though this is sufficient this is enough i don't like to spend my time for earning money dude whatever i am having it is sufficient i will spend my mind and the time reading holy books listening to the whole eating controlling my senses controlling my mind so these are the groups we can see we can find them we call them devotees but the very great one those who refuse everything i have seen a monk in our that they were still there they're so sincere to realize god they're going on trying this not to day one or two it goes on years and years and years together the same life getting up in the morning meditating taking the name of god and going to the food and little just mixing with the other monks then going and attending the prayer reading holy books constantly when they were told that you should become some in church they humbly refused no no it is not possible for me because their attraction to that life is so genuine so that is the way we can understand their advanced soul not that they are disturbing anyone criticizing anyone or commenting about the administration nothing like that why because their mind has already withdrawn from all these and that is called restlessness and that comes only from the previous life certainly we cannot grow that so bhagavan suramar krishna is telling be sincere have faith ah that restlessness is the whole thing whatever path you follow whether you are a hindu a muslim a christian brahma title point is restlessness this is bhagavan sirama krishna no narrowness you have to become only the follower of my philosophy then only you will get the realization he never said that the sampradaya that is the community no it is not there the narrowness it is not there so that is bhagavan that's why he is becoming so popular every biography his life or reading the gospel of krishna immediately become attracted the foreigners the neighbor knew about the hinduism by chance they get some quotations from the gospel of sirama krishna after reading that they become so happy immediately they started inquiring about ramakrishna reading the book i met one young boy that 17 18 years young boy is secondary school he came and he was trying to wear a dhoti like the bengali fashion like the indians so some he purchased that because he saw the picture that he purchased and then managed it somehow and he came very happy you know how he was calling sirama krishna takur if you if you the here naturally we have to accept the previous birth he has born over here in america in an american family and they are traditionally christians faith but still how this boy only 17 18 years old is getting attracted to surama krishna he had now he is reading he purchased those books and constantly keep the gospel of krishna in his hand and whenever there is a time he will so this is the proof of the past life god bless him may he realize god but this is the way always it is so important besides there are errors in all paths sirama krishna says everyone thinks his watch is right matter of fact no watch is absolutely right but that doesn't hamper one's work if a man is restless for god he gains the company of the sadhus and as far as possible correct sadhu's help friends this is also very important sometimes we are sincere we think that we should realize god and we try to get that at the advices but unfortunately this is the word i should use unfortunately we go to someone who cannot properly guide so we don't understand where to go do we see the temple we see the person there so we talk to them then they get attracted to that and then slowly slowly we go to a narrow lane and we think that we are on the right track okay god bless them but those who are blessed they come to this broad daylight the openness like the ocean every paths are leading to the same goal to accept this to understand this it needs broadness it's mentioning i kept that these two lines underlined and mentioned it is important there are errors in all paths we are only unnecessarily and thinking my path is the best but are you sincerely following it there are errors in all paths then he is telling if a man is restless for god he gains the company of sadhus who is a sadhu in other places suramar krishna said whose mind has completely gone to god jar moon is the whole soul his whole thought his whole life is dedicated to god that means there is no selfish motive there is no the his selfish the agenda nothing is there only pure love only love love for each and everyone who is trying to realize god who is coming to god he's trying to become good so that is the main thing and it is possible they correct themselves with the health of the sadhus the sadhus will guide them so don't do this you should not think in this way you should not behave in this way they guide like this here in america it is very difficult because we are all so gentle courteous someone is doing something wrong we feel hesitated to tell that but sometimes the guru should tell to guide them maybe in the beginning the disciple or the devotee misunderstand them but afterwards they will understand they will appreciate they'll be grateful so this is the spiritual path then brahma samaj the sudama krishna stood up and lost his consciousness the sudama krishna who was talking his mind was always on that high level of spirituality though his mind merged into that in the evening every evening the followers of the ramakrishna they sing they are composed by swami vivekananda himself the beautiful song kandana bhabha bandhana bandana then after that the first line is oh god please make me free from the bondage of worldliness please make me free from the bondage of worldliness that's the first line ami bibekanda himself and to whom we are praying bhagavan srirama krishna who is so eager to give us liberation so every evening if we have the time if we play that cassette it is available in the youtube also believe mart that cassidy is there if we sing that song and if we sit down partial consciousness and began to dance in an ecstatic mood ecstasy the word that we use but we don't understand that the ecstasy is completely different they forget all around things and they become so happy the happiness is coming out they don't understand what to do they start dancing that through that the dancing only they can express their joy boy the young man he realized he saw the goddess kali leaving the whole world this is god is currently standing so the young man and the great joy that he got he came and to express that joy he prayed to bhagavan srirama krishna can you please teach me a song time you cannot meditate you are full with that you are mixed in that only the feeling is joy and tremendous joy and that happiness this different corners of the temple dakshinesha going on singing that the song that suramar krishna taught him that his mind was so high and he was teaching he was talking to those people so stoop in worldliness and thinking them learned people so sirama krishna the god himself was trying to bring them on the right track of righteousness and the moment rilakka started the and went to that merged in that and in that ecstasy he started dancing it was a never-to-be-forgotten scene master mashay never to be forgotten sin once you see this you cannot forget it and when you read this once ramakrishna faith in his life and words and you can imagine we can imagine that particular scene the sudama krishna is dancing he is forgetful of the body and he's dancing in great joy and the whole joy is expressed through that and when we see that because the little kind we cannot forget that the master masha is mentioning it was a never to be forgotten seen bankim and his angry at him in amazement was this god intoxicated state the devotees also watched him with wandering eyes over the master touched the ground with his forehead saying bhagavat bhakta bhagavan he always threw different words indicating that you have to realize god the bhagavat is the scripture giving you the knowledge and bhakta is the student who is learning that knowledge and what is that ultimate goal to become the god yourself and that you acquire then you become god yourself bhagavat bhakta then the bhagavan the scripture then the devotee and the god so i have to become god myself that is the teaching salutations to the ghani's yogis bhaktas salutation to all you realize god sincerely sirama krishna is with him that is hinduism those who talk about hinduism should understand this in the complete embrace and doing everything sharp gracia lingam that's a word that has been used embracing each and everything embracing them not for the hypocrites they are the different class so they whatever will happen to them we don't have time to talk about that think about that so we are for the sincere whatever you realize god crying for god praying to god christian see he's coming the lord came in the form and he destroyed the demon they say so ravana ravana was a very powerful but egoistic person the lord went and destroyed him and lord came in the form of sri krishna and he sri krishna collected all this we were disturbing the real religion and destroyed them but bhagavan srirama krishna the same god that lord visnu in the form of sri ramakrishna he never killed anyone he was not having any weapon in his hand his greatest weapon was humbleness used to be so humble even a egoistic person standing before him is to feel oh what shall i do he's so humble so genuine so sincere and so full of love and sincerity so what is to happen the people who is to come to examine him this to get slowly transformed into the high spiritual temperament we have heard how the bankim chandra was conversing with sirama krishna then after these when he talked and he showed that it's not only mere words but it is in his life then the bankim started thinking seriously he is asking sir how can one develop divine love the sudama krishna giving the reply again through restlessness the restlessness a child feels for his mother that means first you have to have the faith in the existence of god second a genuine urge to realize god and that urge will lead you to the restlessness as a child feels to go back to his mother god please come and show me teach me who are you how are you how after the realization i don't to know it please come before me and teach me tell me if we are genuine go and pray to god with the sincere heart and with the tearful eyes as because god is truth the god can take any form god can and the god can teach me appearing before me or through someone else if a man can weep like that like a child for god he can even capital see him at the approach of the dawn eastern horizons become red then one knows it will soon be sunrise likewise if you see a person restless for god you can be pretty certain that he hasn't longed to a disciple asked his teacher sir please tell me how i can see god come with me said the guru and i people to a lake and both suddenly the teacher said the water after a few moments he released him and the disciple raised his head and how did you feel this disciple said oh i thought i should die i was panting for breathe the teacher said when you feel like that for god then you will know you have his vision let me tell you something by floating on the surface to bonkin the lord is telling sirama krishna is telling what you will gain by floating on the surface it doesn't to get the real gem you must dive deep dive you must dive otherwise you can't get the gym listen to a song then he started singing the famous song deep dive deep oh mind dive deep in the ocean of god's beauty amar moon so that is the song all listen spellbound again siram krishna began to talk to bankim there are some who do not want to die they say won't we become deranged if we go to excess about god referring to those who are intoxicated with divine love they say these people have lost their heads but they don't understand the simple thing god is the ocean of amrita immortality once i say to narendra suppose there were a cup of syrup and you were a fly where would you seed to drink the seed up narendra said i would sit on the edge of the cup and stretch my neck to drink it why i asked what is the harm of plunging into the middle of the cup and drinking the seed up narendra answered then i should stick to the syrup and die my child i said to him that is not the nature of the nectar of satchidananda it is the nectar of immortality man does not die from diving into it on the contrary he becomes immortal so when we are going to god and forgetting all other things sometimes people may think that is it good to behave like that suramar krishna is giving the reply to those banking bowed low before the master he was about to take his leap look at it the bankeem chandra he came and in the beginning he was not doing showing that courtesy because he was not knowing what is this sriram krishna he thought he is a priest maybe we will talk about something maybe he will ask for some help money and all that usually the priests they do but now the having that wisdom from bhagavan si rama krishna he is slowly coming to him accepting understanding him then bankim is telling sir i am not such an idiot as you may think i have a prayer to make please be kind enough to grace my house with the dust of your holy plate so this is how sirama krishna used to slowly enlighten the heart of others it is not converting a person the conversion converting i am throwing my idea ideology pressurizing others to accept it it's nothing like that rather is transforming them it's not converting it is transforming them and how they are transfer oh follow me listen my word only nothing like that only be good be genuine be sincere and try to do good to others love god so that is the transformation from a selfish person he becomes a very good person and then understanding that this world is temporary that same person become god itself so that is the transformation that is genuinely bhagavan that's why we always say if we go and talk to the people if the people understand it that they themselves will be transformed you need not to force them so here he is telling the please come to visit my that's nice i shall go eat god wills i shall go if god wills that there too you will see devotees of god that one came is telling that i will arrange this type of meeting in my home and you will find some devotees over there too this master suramar krishna is smiling how so what kind of devotee are they are they like those who said gopala gopala keshava kesheva all started laughing because they heard the story from bhagavan si rama krishna i will read the story again over here this is a very interesting hypocrisy the majority of the people they will be showing that they are so genuine and so religious minded and they will be having some marks on their forehead and they'll be covering their body with the holy clothes but in reality they are not so the god will never go to them the sirama krishna through the story is giving us that caution don't try to behave like that be genuine and he's telling a devotee what is the story of gopal said master ramakrishna is smiling let me tell you at a certain place there is a goldsmith's shop the workers were known as pious boys numbers they have string of beads around their necks religious marks on their foreheads and bags containing rosaries in their hands they repeat the name of god aloud one can almost call them sadhus only they have to work as goldsmith to earn their bread and support their family many customers hearing of their paity come to the shop because they believe that in that shop there will be no trickery with their gold and silver when the customers enter the shop they see the workers repeating the name hurry with their tongue and doing their work with their hands no sooner do the customers take seats in the shop then one of the workers cry out keshava keshava kishaba keshaba is the name of sri krishna but it has a meaning k means who is all this who are these people a few minutes later another says gopala gopal gopala gopal another name of sri krishna but go means cow also so that fellow is indicating that the cow hearts cowherd after they talk a little while the third man cry out hurry hurry hurry in the meantime the customers have almost finished their transactions then the fourth explain exclaim hara hara hara now hari is the name of krishna again and it has another meaning hari means shall i rob of him haran sir rob of and the master over there their owner is telling okay okay do that the customers are very much impressed with the devotion and forward and feel themselves quite secure in ending the money they are sure they won't be cheated but do you know what lies behind all these the man who says keshava keshava after the arrival of the customers who are they krishna is mentioning so lastly bankim took his leave but he was absent-minded when he reached the door he discovered that he had dropped his shawl in the room he was in his short sleeves a gentleman handed him the schwall why the bankim he was a great soul he was a great thinker he was a great patriot at the same time he was a devotee also he tried to understand lord krishna in his own way in his own fashion that is the reason as because he was having this background the god bhagavan sidha krishna spent so much of time to break the bondage or we can say to remove the cover from over the mind of the bankeem chandra so that is the love for god you know the god he loves the devotees and when he sees the genuine people he comes and helps and we have to understand that sometimes some people will come and tell us something and we start thinking it is true this is true that means the god is sending his information his guidances through that person and here the gods bhagavan siddha krishna himself and he is guiding so bankim was deeply thinking about that and he forgot about his shawl the extra cover that usually the aristocrat of the bengali society they used to put on them so that he got back of the devotees of other house sharat and shannal were brahmins but other belong to the lower caste of the goldsmith and so the two brahmins quickly left see after listening all this the sharath and the another person the shahraz afterwards became the disciple of sudama krishna and the monk of the ramakrishna order as the great soul and the channel another person see how the in the western world we cannot understand but in india it was so much so as because that though other was highly educated person he was holding a very responsible position even then because of your his birth they were not ready to take food into that family where srama krishna himself was taking food so this is the narrowness about the god so why he mentioned because this is the way the brahmins and the non-brahmins and all these the sudama krishna the master the sharat and shanna had been coming to the master only a short time and did not know how fond the master was of other the master used to say that the devotees form a separate caste by themselves among them there could not be there couldn't could be no caste distinction this is the uniqueness of the ramakrishna nation no caste distinction no religious differences no linguistic differences because we believe in vedanta which teaches each soul is potentially divine in the words of swami vivekananda other entertained the master and the devotees with a feast it was quite late in the evening when the devotees returned home and cherishing in their hearts the image of the master in a spiritual ecstasy and remembering his words of grace wisdom the last para of this chapter bankim could not make it though he said since bankim had invited siram krishna to visit his home the master a few days later sent girish and aim master master to his calcutta residence at the time bankim had a long discussion with these two devotees about the master chandra ghosh he was also very famous so he told them that he wanted to visit suramar krishna again but his desire was not fulfilled that this is the story of the conversation since god wants to help us but only if we are unfortunate we don't understand that thank you friends and if there is any question let us listen so there is there is one question from millie agnes uh he is asking prana mara since you discussed different faiths i would hope to know if mixing religions is okay or is it better to follow one path only since some paths will mix thank you oh this is a wonderful idea but mainly that is uh the mixing different paths that depends on the person who is trying to do it there is nothing harm if you go to any path any religion devotion is always there so you are taking the devotion from all religion hinduism then the what's called the islam christianity all they talk about devotion to god but to go to the root faith is the first thing as we were discussing and all are telling god is there conception of god is different in different religion and hindus will say god is all pervading consciousness but the god can take form and also can be without form this is hindu conception now you take that god is there first second the genuine approach to god like a child to the mother no the you are crying to god and saying god i don't know who are you how you look but i have heard that you are there will you please come and show me how are you and if you are sincere he will come the god will come and show you and suppose you think that i will i like to have the a god as a little baby on my lap and i like to love that god in that form you will get it or in the mother form or in the father form or any way you like to see god so you can choose different religion but those things which all religion are but faith is yours genuineness and sincerity is yours and as bhagavan si ramakrishna said if you are sincere if you are genuine and if you are praying wholeheartedly god will surely reveal as you want to see god in that fashion thank you the next question is from srimad bishwas she is asking how should we pray the prayer you know as prayer is opening your heart to god any fashion you can the one person used to go and complain to the god why you were not listening listening to me and why i have to come all the time and sit before you and because i am so busy i don't have time so wherever i am you should be with me like that used to pray he was a shopkeeper he said when i am there sometimes the the customers are not there i can talk to you he used to go on and what type of talk he used to say look at this nowadays there is no customer i am not earning money what will happen he developed friendship with god he used to converse with and that was the prayer the prayer means opening up your heart and whatever way you like to communicate you can do do it genuinely sincerely and with faith thank you so let us conclude with the pranam mantra niranjanam nityam anantarupam [Music] bhaktanu kampa [Music] [Music] [Applause] so
