[119: Panchama Veda 119 : Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MwnlihUHnnU)

let us begin the reading from the Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna and also the explanation after chanting this mantra terbuka thumb rhythm dr. G venom Kobe be rewritten calm Asha pom soups rahbani mangalam srimad athim booby Goonan te borre dodgin aha now the page 293 of the gospel of ceramic ish nuh we were studying and here tell me if you have any more details salam Krishna is asking ish on with ishan he was having the conversation now he is asking mission if you have any doubt then you can ask me Ishaan said you have said everything when you spoke of faith now if some person the people who are trying to develop the spirituality they're practicing though obviously they also develop this conception so they can understand the subtleties of the teachings or otherwise this is not like other subjects when a professor is speaking the students are understanding that it's a different type of understanding and here when we are listening even in hint about God hint about the truth hint about the path that we should follow practice that should we should do everything immediately it dawns in the mind Ishaan he said you have said everything when you spoke of fate faith is the basis of spirituality so basis on that the Ballentine they have the faith the belief everything is nothing but the Brahman Advaita Vedanta they speak in that way they believe in that way nothing but Brahman the devotees they say God so these two the faith must be there believe must be there then I am practicing ultimately reaching to that ultimate realization master God can be realized by true faith alone and the realization is hasent if you believe everything about God if we believe that God is everything though naturally our behavior our action in life will be totally different once a hard story a man heard the command of God that he should see his ideal deity in a ram he at once believed it it is God who exists in all beings we have the stories in The Punisher that the brahmacari was axed by his guru to take all the cows and the bull for the grazing for one year and come back when it grows into such an such number and he went over there all alone and constantly pondering over the teachings of the Guru one day he hard bull is addressing him telling him now let us go back and we are reached to that number we can go back now to the sama so this type of stories when you hear then we wonder is it possible it is possible because in everything that God is there God can speak God can tell you through different ways methods a guru said to his disciple it is Rama alone who resides in all bodies the disciple was a man of great faith one day it dogs nasty piece of bread from him and started to run away he ran abduct the dog with a jar of butter in his hand and cried again and again o rama stand still a minute that braid hasn't been buttered so this way the faith goes when he is believing for us it is a funny thing but when he sees that he believed that what mendes faith Krishnaji sure had another devotee we see that speciality of sri ramakrishna when he is telling something immediately gives the example also and in that example his always tried to give whom other people didn't know Krishna Kishore as the devotee used to visit Sri Ramakrishna so all they knew him the dead Krishna sure about him he is telling he had a great faith he used to say by chanting ohm Krishna o rama one gets the result of million sadhanas that is the faith once i have chanted the name of God holy name of God and pure so that faith gives a wonderful piece in the mind you were absolutely right when you said that through faith alone one achieves all about the ish on Sam Krishna's Telling You shant said but we are householders master what if you are this is very important in this avatara the ceramic ISNA is always inspiring that devotees the householders also who are clear sees those who are putting their mind total mine complete attention and accepting that this world is truth and accordingly they work they are some sorry samsara that which is constantly changing but unfortunately without understanding that even though every day our experience tells us that everything is changing when you look at the meter our image we see that I have changed mind is changing thought process is changing decisions are changing around me the whole list world is changing even then something is there unfortunate i cannot see that i cannot believe that I cannot accept that that is called griest e that is called some sorry here see ramakrishna stealing what if you are if you're a householder doesn't matter why through His grace even the impossible become possible he's grace H capital that means God if you have faith that God will do it and with that faith if we pray in SE tient Lee everything can be achieved but we don't have the patience and we do not like to do that that's why we go everywhere try to get from the air from the air but here it he says Salam o Krishna with great Authority His grace through His grace even the impossible become possible we wonder when you read the Bible the same thing that Jesus Christ also said with man it is impossible but nothing is impossible with the Lord so this is the faith and the master is telling this world is a mere framework of illusion someone said a Shankar don't heart Dottie that Eve is the framework of the illusion the dhoka means maya and another one said why this world is a mansion of Mars is full of joy here I can eat here drink and make merry he said a sham char modular kuti could he means the house the palace emikai died and modality i am eating drinking and enjoying this day and that should be the idea when everything is God then why should I be afraid of it when I was not born this world was continuing when I will die it will continue to flow it will move without me then why I am breaking my head so that is the idea God is doing everything I am a baby on the lap of the Divine Mother I need not to bother about anything if one can develop this attitude totally free free from all the bondages one should first realize God through spiritual discipline in solitude and then leave in the world only then one can be a King Janaka he's mentioning about the King Janaka we know all Indians the stories about the janaka is there the King Janaka was a king but a realized soul the moment we think that we have to realize God we always think we have to give up these worldly things but the janaka demonstrated that even if you are in this world and you are performing the responsibilities like a king even then you can be realized you can realize God you can realize truth with that attitude you can rule the whole country so that he says but before that you have to practice the spiritual discipline you have to realize the truth this realization the word realization is very important it's not the intellectual conception it is just direct perception intellectual conception the naturally I think like this if something else happened I cannot hold the truth I cannot hold that in my mind or maybe may not be like this thoughts will come but when the realization comes whoever says whatever I know it is not true those who have visited America lived in America when they go back when the people talking about American a wrong way you said no I have seen I was there even in the all the media if they are talking about or writing about America in a different way so no I lived over there for 30 years 40 years I lived there I know everything of it so even if you are reading or tailing even if the guru says who has not visited America only about read about them so that is called realization so when we realize God we were saying whatever about God our faith our believe our conviction that will remain as it is that is called realization the ceramic Krishna is telling one should first realize God and through spiritual discipline in solitude how to release God through spiritual discipline what is the spiritual discipline we drawing the mind from the worldly things that's all what is the spiritual discipline the spirit and the non spirit the non spirit at all these that we see all around us including my body now when I am withdrawing that and putting in my mind the truth it becomes like this and then leave in this world only then one can be like King Janaka what can you achieve otherwise then he said father take the case of the Shiva he has everything kartika ganesha Lakshmi Saraswathi that means if we think that Sheba is a householder he has a family he has a wife and children but then sometime he dances in a state of divine follower chanting the name of Rama and sometimes he is observed in Samadhi so he's giving the example of janaka example of Sheba the Sheba is a God and eat even then we the Hindu we believe the Sheba has his family after few days they will be durga puja and ma Durga will come with all our children for children two sons to daughter we are all getting ready to accept them receive them so all this all over the Hindus are doing like that of course this time we are not inviting Shiva Shiva from his house only the mother is coming like that in Hindi they say Mikey so the girl is coming to her mother's to her parents house he or she is free so that way is completely the Shiva is a family person but at the same time whenever he wants he goes into ecstasy so that is possible if you realize God and then it is possible now we will begin the chapter 14 is a Sunday September 23rd 1883 and today in September 27 and 2016 and today is Tuesday but we are reading an account in this month in September 1883 happen of course it was Sunday master Mercia given give is given at their very details about this he said ceramic ish nuh was sitting in his room at the Chi nature with Rakhal aim and other devotees now those who are not acquainted with the Ramakrishna life Ramakrishna's biography so naturally it will be difficult for them to understand who is this Rakhal who is this aim etc and other devotees that is why it is better to read the biography of Sri Ramakrishna also that is so important and of course it is for those who are sincere to understand the spirituality rachal means afterwards he became the first president of the Ramakrishna martin mission Shami brahmananda and Serrano Krishna told he's my son that means he is having all the qualities of the Father the Rakhal he was a son of a very rich man a German doll and landlord his father was very very worldly type of person but his son he was constantly thinking about God he wanted to come out of that how it is possible so that the Wonder the ceramic Krishna said that even if the seed of one tree falls in a wrong place that tree will come up the similarly the holy soul wherever they come they retain they continue and they manifest and who was recalled ceramic ISNA through his that vision the spiritual vision he could see the past present and the future of everyone he saw him and he understood that he was the friend of shri krishna so he that Rakhal was very very favorite to sri ramakrishna but he was the son she used to consider him as his son naturally the Rock Hall neighbor serves Ramakrishna sometimes I ramakrishna told Rakhal will you please bring a glass of water for me no I cannot sometimes the Sun they behave like that with the father and the mother because they have complete faith in the father so they can behave like that they are not afraid of the father whereas the devotee will never do that way so rock hall and in the master Masha and other devotees haja haja there's another character whenever there is a holy person nearby there will be I am the person completely opposite and Serrano Krishna is to say otherwise he won't be able to judge him the goodness of that man and he said Leela pasta hana jotul a cootie lay not Utley due till a and cuddly we know that this to character and because of that only see ramachandra and all these things happen so when someone is opposing criticizing behaving totally opposite way a spiritual seeker should not be disturbed it's ok let he more hard continue like that it's good that I am getting the opportunity to look at me to control my anger to subdue my ego I will go in my own way why should I react so this is also very very important has ramaj i sat on the porch outside master was conversing with the devotees that was the picture when we close our eyes then we can see the Hazama Hassan where is sitting those who have visited the dictionary still the same room and the same setup is there and we can just transport our mind to that situation this is excellent to him why didn't he come narendra doesn't like even you now it is he was telling the master merger norinda even is not liking you sometimes when the people are preparing his mind for the spiritual development is a young man or indra you as withdrawing his mind as because he used to like master mache very much and for the betterment of his spiritual practice he was withdrawing his mind because master measure used to like the moment he is liking his company is versation though obviously not in there was avoiding slammed Krishnan noticed and he said nowadays not in the doesn't like even you then he was as to asking why didn't he come to see me at others house how versatile Narendra ease now you see see Ramakrishna has come for a mission and he is preparing Narendra to lead that mission he will be the spearheading of this tremendous force spiritual force that will cover the whole world so he is preparing him but the other people won't be able to understand naturally did go against him oppose him create problem for him ceramic dish no knew what is going to happen after all this it is 1883 say I am Krishna passed away in eighteen eighty six so from long time he is preparing the ground and he's introducing Narendra and many other cases you will see he is asking the young devotees to go and meet narendra how versatile not in their ease he is gifted in singing of course unfortunate that that time this recording system was not developed otherwise we could listen he had a wonderful house and he could sing just like any other mastro's and the singing it was a master in that in playing on his 21-day he wanted to sing a song and he wanted that someone should accompany him on tabla there is no one no one was knowing that then he said ssardon and the G come and see I will teach you within five minutes he taught him see just like this you do like this he learned habla so at least for that song he could support the Narendra he was that way so versatile and he's very good in his studies whatever he study it goes straight to his heart he can understand it the import of the that we are reading so many things may be a big volume of book we are reading but it has one or two lines only which is important to understand and those who can do that they are the best students what actually it's picks up off the narinder was very good to it he is ceramic ISNA is introducing narendra he is independent and doesn't care about anybody so that is also a quality of a spiritual aspirant if all the time we are depending on someone else he can never realize God because I have faith in God so whatever happens if I die okay no problem next level see so no independent dependency completely independent and it says that they move in the world the world like a rhino never care for anything even the tiger or these and that all around they are afraid of the Rhino rhino never cares so similarly the spiritual aspirant particularly the Hmong should move in the world like a rhino not depending on anyone his versatile independent does not care anybody the other day he was returning to Calcutta with Captain in his carriage captain big Narendra to seat beside him but he took his seat opposite he didn't even look at captain the captain means again those who don't know the biography of Sri Ramakrishna he was the ambassador of king of Nepal to the British ruler in Calcutta his officials can you imagine an ambassador of an independent country in those ten time and noren there is a young man only 17 18 years old so obviously calculation should be oh I am mixing with the very high society person I should mix with him I talked to him and all that maranda never cared about that the no calculation because I don't care about the world so who is these people he's not hating but his calculation his mind is somewhere else so naturally not at all careful about all this bling but we become very very careful because we think if I go and mix with him talk to him some benefit i can draw afterwards so that's why the Spiritualist parent so he is introducing narendra that he is actually a sannyasi in making what can a man achieved through mayor scholarship what is needed is the prayer and spiritual discipline say that in the spirituality the scholarship is nothing but most of the people they always think about oh he was a student of such-and-such University he was the student of that college he was the student of that bit professor he has nothing to do with the spirituality spirituality totally different thing and the great great scholars they are coming they know so many things even then no comparison with a truly monk what him man achieved through the mayor scholarship what is needed his prayer and spiritual discipline the spiritual discipline as he was talking about Narendra he was showing he was giving that this is the spiritual discipline gori of in days was both scholar and the devotee again immediately he is giving an example right from there that society that is the speciality of cinema Krishna he sometimes quoting from the old piranhas but most of the time giving the example of the present-day society person he is there very much there if you can if you like you can go and see him so like that way he used to give the example and he said go D go D means upon death he was a great scholar and he is he was from a particular place called in days both the scholar and a devotee he was a worshipper of the Divine Mother now and then she would be overpowered it spiritual forward when he chanted a heem to the mother the pundits would seem like earthworms beside him I too would be overcome with ecstasy he was telling that his faith in the mother is so much when used to chant that mantra hari really lambo the really like that used to do and all other pundits the scholars Sanskrit scholars are known as pundits Thunder is the Bremen those who understand that Brahman upon deeds but here only mere scholars they are underst they have learned the veda and the philosophy and intellectually they have grabs those things so they can go for argument sometimes dish to that was the system in India from the long there's a history of this callers constantly having their dialogue conversation d bit on the path of religion they never classed they never killed each other so that is the speciality of India again if you like to really say something about the philosophy you have to prove it and how you will prove quoting from different scripture at the same time you have to show it in your spiritual life then only people will accept you otherwise not the Shankaracharya much after the Bhagavad Buddha he came and he once again revived the Vedanta philosophy because the Buddhism the nihilism there is nothing that concept it was all around the people the people who are confused and what is truly they should follow they were not very much so that condition Shankar Acharya team he went around every corner of India he SAT with the other pundits he had great dialogues long dialogues debates defeated them different a book the conversation was there debates were there and reestablished once again Vedanta here also cinema Krishna suffering that point sometimes in the debates this gory pond it is to remember the mother the divine mother whom he is to worship and through that power when used to get that power all others is to become just earthworm and at the first he was be courted worshipper of shakti and he will never believe the Vishnu or others but Saddam Krishna didn't like that and he was happy that he used to pick up the tools she leaves with a couple of sticks because till she will see levees belong to bishnu and he is a devotee of Kali Shakti shakhter so you'll never touch the vision that till Salim even the eve it was this is that he used to pick up with help of the couple of sticks so as not to touch them with his fingers they all laughed then he went home when he came back he did not behave that way anymore salam o Krishna appreciating that the narrowness salam Krishna could never appreciate when he came went home and came back that means he had the time to ponder with that now he has overcome that limitation ceramic esna was happy he gave remarkable interpretations of Hindu mythology he would say that the ten hands of Ravana represented ten organs and kundo karna was the example of Thomas Ravana of Rajas and B vision of Satwa that is why we vision obtain the favor with Rama the dead Pandit the scholar he used to explaining that way same reason liked it so one thing if anyone anywhere is getting success and he is to truly spiritual sidamo krishna is to appreciate him he always is to remember and his to go to that person and at the symptoms sometimes he'll be quoting the others who were not that good just to make a comparison not to criticize them to have the comparison after the Masters midday meal while he was resting rom tarick and some other devotee aright from Calcutta dr. rom that the ram chandra dutta he was also a great devotee of the ramakrishna when no one knew about ceramic ISNA rom that was very much is working hard to introduce him in that society hero to a book about ceramic esna also and he introduced the ceramic rishni with the Narendra also used to tell him why not come with me so this way Rama death and Tareq then another disciple of ceramic busines who afterwards became a Zanussi and his name was Shami shivananda in our order the xiaomi shivananda the below the second picture and the that is Siobhan and aegean nikto gopal tarick and several others were staying with Rama need to go pal a devotee and Tareq that Shivan and afterwards he used to do lot of Jabba continuous java if you read those wonderful stories then another brother does direct brother disciple he stopped eating he told why you were not taking food someone told him if I stop for eating then naturally I own be able to take the name of God so I am not eating let me continue even if my body withered and I die no matter but they were all present it is not possible you were just killing yourself with a suicide then he suggested ok I can eat if Tarak Dada that is my editor he was by age elder so if he comes and touch me and his seat with touching me as long am I am eating he should touch me so that he's going on repeating the name of God without Phil that will come into me so see how they were so eager hundred-person concentrated on that particular idea I must have to realize God and para was regarded as a great monk great Sedaka so this steric nick de Gopal personality and several others were staying with Rama a householder disciple of the master de tocqueville was always in an exalted spiritual mode tarick's mood to was always in drawn he seldom exchanged words with others rom looked after their physical needs Rakhal now and then spent a few days at others house if someone is practicing spirituality serving him is also a great work of spirituality because he is practicing the spiritual life his mind is concentrated he is not taking care of other things so the devotees who are coming and helping them to continue in that he is also getting the benefit of spiritual up treatment so that rom he was elder than all these dear world young boys but as because they were sincerely trying to develop their spirituality rom told you better come and stay in our house I will take care of your food and other things you need not to bother about earning money and go for cooking and all I will take care of that he will get in right time the food you practice you continue Ron to the master we have been taking lessons on the drum the drum means in the that they call it the both side the drum and because of the sometimes the songs and all that they play that is very famous in Bengal master to rom need to gobble to rom no sir he plays a little master and tarick rom he knows a good deal he was a very good he could play that immediately master is commenting see Ramakrishna is commenting then he won't keep his eyes on the ground so much because the moma and you are doing that someone is playing some instrument or singing or doing all this type of thing so obviously his attention will go to that too and the people's appreciation slowly will drag his mind from away from God so the taaraq the afterwards Swami Sivananda he never wanted to look at the people so he used to look at his feet all the time that is the traditional way of developing the spiritual life the monks are supposed to look at the the toe constantly his own toe when he is walking and living in the society so that he should not have the eye contact with others the moment you see something the reflection of that is coming in the mind though obviously different type of thoughts will come so he used to the master ceramic ISNA he knew that he is going to become a monk but the boy was not Sosa Ramakrishna the great teacher the Guru he was concerned about our team and he said then he won't keep his eyes on the ground so much if the mind is much directed to something else it doesn't dwell deeply on God so that is the training the one should not have that type of thing again rom I have been studying the drum only to accompany the kilter when someone is singing the kid think it's a special song of the big on the Krypton and there the accompaniment is not the tabla but the coal they call it the particular name of that particular instrument musical instrument is cold it is having one side too small and another side bigger but both side they can play I think many of you have seen it Master I hear that you two are taking singing lessons is that so this question he was asking to the more m-master knows aim no sir i just opened my mouth now and then he was afraid then i just opened my mouth now and then the master have you practiced that song Oh mother make me mad with I love if you have please sing it the song expresses my ideal perfectly Saddam ignition is expressing that song is expressing my idea salamo Krishna's ideal what is that ma Oh mother please make me mad mad for what Matt for you and when a person become insane mad only one thought goes on in his mind that is the reason he is not giving attention to the external world outside world we have seen the insane people the mad only on one thought his mind will go on rotating harping and that is the reason he cannot pay attention to anything else salam o Krishna is asking the Divine Mother please make me mad like that with the idea that you are only the truth and there is nothing in this world oh my day mapa gold curry I recoja naima iana beach rd day ma puggle cody am i deem up our goal curry please make me mad for you I don't like to have the discussions about this spiritual life gianna bechari and going on discriminating having the arguments with the god is there or not if the God is there which path should be followed which path is good and which is not I don't want to understand all those things don't like to waste my energy in that I know you were there and I like to be only one pointed constantly thinking about you cinema Krishna told that that is my idea and the song expresses my ideal perfectly then the conversation turned to has risen people winds which see Ramakrishna did not like there's a 295 page this this one line only but so important when you hate some people but whatever may be the reason what happened Saddam o Krishna again once again you those who are reading the gospel you will see almost in every teaching immediately he is giving an example of the people who are around not that he is bringing the example from someone's quoting from someone sometimes but mostly he is trying to give the example of the local people around people immediately you can go you can check you can understand and that is why he's telling Saddam Krishna never like that that he is hating some people Ezra had the habit of master to the devotees I used frequently to visit certain house at kimitaka the boys of the family were my age the other day they came here and spend two or three days with me their mother like Ezra used to hate people then something happened to our foot the gangrene say teen on account of the foul smell no one could enter her room I told the incident to Ezra and asked him not to hate anyone so this is the teaching so when we are hitting someone for something so that same thing may happen to us each and every action has it equal and opposite reaction so when you hear hating if we don't if we can't go along okay have the distance make a distance or just keep the distance from him are hard that's all but don't hate toward evening see Ramakrishna was standing in the northwestern corner of the courtyard he went into Samadhi coming down to the relative world he began to talk to divine mother Oh mother let me talk about D and chant the Holy Name I want to sing thy glories give me a little strength of body that I may move about that I may go to places where thy devotees leave and seeing thy name missionary work he is introducing the missionary work and the God himself and this time the same Krishna the same Rama those who came to stablish the Dharma in this modern days Rama and Krishna came in the form of Sri Ramakrishna not with any weapon but with the Holy Name of God he was changing the hearts of people so he'd said he was praying to mother give me the strain so that I can go and do that in the morning see Rama Krishna had been to Kali temple to offer flowers at the mother's feet now this to condition of the mind when someone is completely engaged constantly in that higher realm his mind is not coming down so obviously you won't be able to attain anything in this present day world so cinema Krishna was begging to the Divine Mother please bring down my mind so that I can go and talk to people sing your glory etc why because his mind was soaring so high going to the Navy culpa Samadhi and when he is coming to teachers what he is teaching bring your mind and give it to the God so also you can have the wonderful joy our mind is always touched with a test with these worldly things for whatever we are trying to do constantly is coming up the question the problem of all the devotees who are trying to do meditation is this and so many varieties of things are developing some people are teaching to control your mind you must consider it concentrate on your breathing and the Buddhist way of meditations are becoming very popular different type of processes the meditations are developing for why to control the mind and most of the time we try to do that some people in the name of that earning money also they are giving some coaching training to concentrate their mind while their own mind is not concentrated they are concentration only on the money but still they are teaching so all these things are going why because only one weakness that I cannot control my mind so that is the reason people are so eager they are ready to spend money to concentrate whereas see Ramakrishna he is begging to the Divine Mother please don't give me so much concentration and my mind going to as the nearby culpa sabha culpa nearby culpa those who are regularly at in the classes and many of you you know that this terminology of yoga be culpa concentrating the mind to the help of some object and nearly week alberni means negative there is no object at all where I myself is becoming the object of my meditation that means i am brahman so this is a different topic again the ceramic ISNA was praying mother still a master still in an abstracted mode sat on the small couch in his room and continued his talk with the divine mother and master message was wondering the master intimate relationship with the Divine Mother see more he was wondering that he is talking with the divine mother before him that he is watching his seeing that both women's ramkrishna is talking with the divine mother and the master the poor soul he was there he couldn't see the Divine Mother so that he is mentioning and then next another day Wednesday September 26th 1883 there was a few devotees for most of them came on Sundays and all these people who had their say Ramakrishna to master have you seen nor endure lately he is incurring about Narendra gain with a smile he said to me he still goes to Kali temple but he will not when he truly understands Narendra commented about ceramic ISNA why if you are taking the help of an ID of a god in form that means you are in a lower stage so narendra is because he was studying the vedanta and all that and he was also very much engaged associated with the brahma samaj who we are not accepting the form of God so obviously he commented see the master take otherwise rather he was enjoying that he commented like that and he mentioned it too many places that narendra said he still goes to kali temple that means he's in a lower stage c ramakrishna is a hostage I don't go to Kali temple I'm in a higher stage and he will understand that Carly and all other things are nothing when he will understand these are realized this the Salam o Krishna was jokingly mentioning that his people are very much dissatisfied with him because he comes here now and then the other day he came here in a hired carriage and shooting the paid for it narendra aren't almost had a row with cylinder about it so obviously as it is in every family if a young man is visiting the monk so naturally they also fear that he's developing the attitude of him on maybe he will leave the heart and home someday family so how all is they afraid if that young ball goes to a bad company there's okay okay but when he is going to a holy place becoming trying to become a holy person they had the respect for the holy people but not their own son so that always it happens the master lived left the couch and went to the northern beranda where hazara Keshari Rakhal can figure the devotees were sitting master to him how is it that you are here today have you no school the one gentleman came over here and he was telling was a great devotee and he always comes to the stem to hell when all this and then the other person who brought him over here he came from India the other person his relative of rain maybe he was introducing you know he goes to office just get the signature and come to the astana and hold the spending in the astana helping them I told do you think you were doing the right thing the cinema Krishna is also so cute careful if you have to come to a stoma to help das drama that should you should not take that advantage just by giving a signature in the office to get the salary on that particular day what you do you are not doing the work so by that way sadhana Krishna is giving the example and stealing asking the master how is it that you were here today have you no school then my aim our school closed today at half-past one so in the afternoon i have come master why so early he's very inquisitive he wants to know whether his disciples his followers are practicing truth or not and badar sugar visited the school he owns the school so the boys gate a half-holiday whenever he comes with da jagger and master ceramic is immediately mentioned why doesn't beat the sugar keep his word if one who holds to truth and looks on the woman as his mother does not rely if one old stood truth and looks on woman as his mother if one who holds to truth and looks on oh man as his mother does not realize God then till she oh ok so that is the eve one who is holding the truth and looking at the woman as his mother restraining is all senses and even then if he is not realizing God please come and blame till she as a liar it is a very famous that in the settee virgin adina Paris 3 mar 3 semaines as say re na mele to Lucy choo jabong so that he is mentioning over here so i was wondering why not realize god so anyway so subdivision that truthfulness adina the modesty / stream our threesome on controlling of the senses a savory normally after practicing this three if you do not realize God then come and tell Tulsa dodge that you are a liar satomi badge 18 on rhythm that is in our scripture they always mentioned suit a variety and that is the national motto of India everywhere dimension Satyameva Jayate a truth all his not Don truth nah unwritten Shami Vivekananda also said everything can be sacrificed for the sake of truth but truth cannot be sacrificed for anything and Bhishma in mahabharata when they were telling that when didn't you marry and then you become the king so that the kingdom will be good no one is there to rule the kingdom then Bhishma was telling parita gem trail opium rajim devi shuba a pune yet bap yogi Gotama etiam not to settle catan Jonna why you are talking about this small Kingdom even if the three world you're given to me there is the heaven this art and the netherworld that this three world if you give to me and if you keep the position of the Indra or the the god i am not going to give up the truth once i have taken up that truth i will hold to that so that is what cinema krishna is telling about with the jogger why he gave the word to
