[14. Panchama Veda 14: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q4nt01YjrKQ)

now we begin with the the gospel of the Amish Benjamin vida and the first milker tava com rhythm dr. teavana kavita kosh ahaha struggle among golem sri vinayaka dahm ooby greenup de hula garden are we were reading the conversation the forgiving see an amish neighbors have not slowly we are entering into a wonderful chapter verse in our distance during that three things we had two three desire three longing that you have to unify then only you can hear us go what are those three things as the mother loves that child that desire along with that the gist work our husband and the whirling man his whelped this three things three type of desire when you Nihar the in only you can get my scarf we find the world the last time we were reading the last class denture we have two such off early then only we can reverse go mango God will openly where to get a Cosmo where he was searching me I'm already with you the any sales who'd you give to a given una but vertical Gosnell if you are truly seeking me asking from me searching for me within a moment we will relieve myself cordially though up amigo so ceramic distance during the search in should be with God with our all heart how the district things united together when person went to Jesus Christ how should I have to pray to God what is the system of playing God so that I can have ice God he don't go down to the water he was baby and then the moment is it was below water inside the water he was at him and for a long time he gave to what the event was almost dying for it for a year then he left and right this so that was the prescription of Jesus Christ as he were longing for the year of the brief for the oxygen when you were little water similarly he had to feel that having to die without God then only we realized or just to go sunday and you found again that won't do and Saddam tishnar in his own ways to him and then he is dealing yoga sarlona some duck tongue is a another thing it is telling the board is a very jealous lover if you are loving anything else yanka become the other as long sargunam some doctor Sargam everything some tectum completely you are giving away baba achma nocatee till then you will never realize God sutter was to put it dani shay me good today last class we discussed about this when we giving away everything then only you see God it's not that it is a pattern risk largest nothing of his latest if as long as the movie is going on we are all looking at the pictures and the movements and the emotions that is coming out of that and we don't know at the back of it there is a wide screen over which all these things are moving unless and until you remove all the pictures that is moving under screen you only able to understand the screen to get this thing to know the screen what we have to do we have to stop all the pictures that were moving so that is the reason here also it says that unless and until you do this here we find it was Sunday and ink in on his third visit to the master this is his third visit the fast second in the third visit itself so many knowledge we have God here is describing he had been profoundly impressed by his first two visits to this wonderful man sometimes people will be coming to the person but unless they are waiting they won't be able to appreciate unless their mind is ready it is impossible to appreciate the inn was waiting that's why he could appreciate but his Dominion his frame is ready Siddharth see you who brought you over here he never visited again because he came to see only the scenario the part that induction a ship they have developed the flower girl the trees the Ganga and our neat and clean list of a German rods and also the temple to that better get lunch but three more he looked around came to see dr. Schnurr make him saw him talk with him and now he's impressed he had been thinking of the master constantly and of the arteries simple way he explained the deep truths of the spiritual life never before had he met such a man simple explanation that he is given but from these we can understand the master martial also see Ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch the real room was feeling with devotees it was Sunday so that is the reason here also and the sunday is only people the car because most of them there at justly some work so obviously they cannot she had taken advantage of the hall who had taken advantage of the holiday to come to see the bastard in had not yet become appointed with any of them so this is a violent when the mask devotees are coming to the master differently for people are coming some educators are not someone reach some are not and some are highly placed in a society people some are not but all they are coming and sitting together that is a eunuch see it was almost absent in those days unthinkable Brandon in the non grounding sitting together side by side unthinkable reach in the floor sitting together side by side unthinkable but almost aren't noticed this revolution took place in the small room say Ramakrishna attraction a ship seamonkey joining the group but not appointed and slowly with fine they are developing a friendship Brotherhood they are beginning so close to each other so here in had not yet become accountant with any of them so he took his signet Horner the master smiled as he talked with the devotees he recognized look at the gentle the curtsy when a person is entering is very new only before he has to IC has visited three more sleep Ramakrishna we have stan is the personality of 18th century 19th century even in the cut see the moon moment the person is coming you have to smile at him if you have two clashed at him so that you were recognizing him that you were here I seen you this is very absent nowadays in our society majority of the people didn't understand this and if the person is important you never look at you to make it understand that is involved so this is the theme is in our Krishna and sin artist who was sitting on the small couch and he is addressing his words in has noticed he's mentioning here particularly to the young man 19 name nor internal who was the college student and frequented the promise lodge his eyes were bright his wards were full of spirit and he had the look of a lover of God how in could understand just because Reynold of course he was very very handsome Shami vivekananda afterwards they smell tuna he was very handsome but does it mean the handsomeness means that lover of God no his eyes shoes is all we deem constantly if you look at the eyes of people in fine there's some of the people who when they are looking you can understand this to simplicity even because he is a teacher is a master he hands so obviously just by seeing the phrase just by seeing the person here this this is the internet where you highly inflict your person three more what is this Brahmo Samaj it was started in kakaka in 1828 mainly it was an opposition to the ground him we can say that ruling or practice of the spirituality it's not against the English they are accepting the Brahmas they accept the way they only in this thing and why this because in those days the missionaries this to spread that this way then how the God is unforgiving can come in the more tea in an statue how it is possible it was in unthinkable for other people to answer so obviously you will find from this in tourism from this action religion because of this typical Brandon ISM because they standing between God and the devotee and it is their profession and to make obviously to make the profession more prosperous profitable they always say you cannot directly go to the God you have to go to me that is the rod and they go on keeping so many rules and regulations try to maintain that we and this is the reason but decent amount Chinese and give out the Brahmo Samaj that was also created only for their then in the proximal ass then arya samaj all they were coming out as he out from the Hindu for but all there he knows only because they believe in Veda Weaver is believing in the bagel Hindus this grandma's nemoj on 28 loudest 1828 it came out and Raja Rahman drive was the founder Roger no longer actually trust it was thought the whole Denise aha doctor doctor measly truth Botha need to understand some of his congregation so fast it was dr. mutiny Sabah then afterwards Dorinda not Kapoor the father of ruben de nada when he took her then he gave the name Brown someone because they were too worshipper of Grandma not run bomb brahmana so from that and slowly slowly it came out and afterwards him in Rana digger he load the code of practice of the brahmers and it was in 1860 see these people they started working before sin our business 1828 and surround is 1936 1816 they came out totally from the Hindus Wow because in those days in that traditional English education for the taboo but the promise they say no girls should get education and in those days in the traditional imprison the moment your daughter is six years old you must have to kill her to manage the Brahmas they know as long as she can study and let her select her own ozlem except tricks at all modern thoughts came and they were talking to some extent they would all be invited but obviously they have deviation deviation deviation it came and so many stories that there and particularly in character of course it is not the whispering all in those days Calcutta was the main people educated people wealthy people is to leave over there so happy what they did in the society that was reflected in the whole society and they were the name followers of Brahmas not ah main thing was that attack by the so-called missionaries on the traditional Hindu way of worshiping also many gods and goddesses and they used to it that way when tlie on goddess Kali because the goddess Kali's she is black she is cutting the head of the people having the girl of the scar and all this thing so it was so easy to criticize it's difficult to get a sex krishna a good-looking person and we know how only that these to criticize the Kali and of course in the name of Krishna also so many slanderous and all things disraeli it was difficult for Dean Hindus particularly they were not in a situation position to counter and all the educated people right from our raja ramachandra dickham came out slowly slowly some got converted into Christian see directly like mother children dr. the famous writer poet and Reverend krishna mohan bundaberg da who was a banerjee bundaberg there's a Bromley and you are so proud he never left the title his surname run Dakota he is to say Reverend Krishna mod wonderful time but I was around in now I'm a Christian in pain because of him most of the Christianity in God because of him so this is the history background where Saddam o Krishna is a gun and then gain in their education philosophy education policy they wanted to implement and the road if the this policy education for the sea can be implemented I am sure within three to five years there will not be a single idol worshippers in India so that was the planning and then that they were planning in eighteen eighty to a 20 18 28 29 30 at that time so the advent of the God in the form of Sri Ramakrishna to protect the the traditional hanshin our Vedic religion these we have to understand otherwise we already able to and this boy we chose in August is talking this studied Bernard and he is the representative of deviant younger generation or a home where connected with ground so much people is to tell is is to feel shy until that I mean do it is not today is it that long back there the atmosphere were such any educated people this to Shankar feel shy to tell the time to do some of them were of course traditional and there's a lot of and mentoring him to that this drama Shabazz they brought tremendous change in the society surili and that their this nominal he is a member of the Brahmo Samaj who do not believe in worshipping in idols and images which constantly studying Vader and then discriminating and mainly a came to the Bible and their house and this young man is sitting over there and salon tishner is talking with him in case that the conversation was about worldly me who looked down on those who aspire to things the master was talking about the great number of such people in the world and about how to deal with them Master to Narendra how do you feel about it what if we will save all kind of things about the spiritually minded but look here when an elephant moves along the street any number of cards and other small animals me what can make a noise but the anything doesn't even look back at theme it people speak ill of you what will you think of them many of the other mothers also when the Sun has becomes an erc they were coming to the Astana and then be criticizing the suggestions and asuma and sometimes our mother saying had I even know it earlier I would have gave my child when he was at just new book but these mothers are so devoted all the time didn't bring the fruits a son cooked food and touch the fate of the generations but not liking her own son to be convenience so that is a bit peculiar the mother's affection little it other school and we will say the Mishka pranaam will support them but not my son she should be with me so this tremendous attraction for the child that is surrounded history you should have type of attachment for God so here Nara is asking we have seen this also there's so many people will be to the sizing good people when a peculiar not doing anything so here narendra is if the moment he asked what do you do I shall think that dogs are barking at me then master smiling oh no you must not hope that for my child everybody's loving God dwells in all things but you may be intimate only with good people you must keep away from the evil Nigel God is even in the title but you cannot embrace the tiger on that account you may see why run away from a tiger which is also a manifestation of God the answer to that is those who tell you to run away are also manifestations of God why shouldn't you listen to them this is a very sometimes is a pedometer and in with anthony's or creation has come from the bremner or in a simply warm you can see if God has created everything that every being everything is nothing but when a petition of God in that case tiger all the people who are connected clear they are also the manifestation of God then why should I talked with them develop friendship with him here c'mon Cyril kishna is giving the answer and through a wonderful story in one astronaut the master the hulu it dr. disciples their God is residing in help reveal salvo quoted in improving the God is there with a disciple he next day he went to the roof the jungle to bring some move and suddenly he heard some people particularly good Curtis who were there shouting said whoever one element is coming in his gun it has become man who's coming whoever but he took not my guru say God is in every meal this element is also God what should I go away from my god then the person who was sitting on the link of the telegram the ma hote he was also shouting go away go away but this pillow on so obviously of course he was not killed he was tasked by the animal and he went unconscious and the people got him back to the Astana any became conscious when they asked him who are you were standing over there where other people are bringing everything running heavy why should I be safe my guru saved the God is in everything so God is also getting ready man why should I be away from God the Guru was there he said bad the person who are sitting on the different he's also gone why listen to me so this is the way we have to understand then in Bengali ceramic ishness say octob to poke a hole again why should you have to be a fool to become a devotee you need not to be a fool you have your own judgment you have to understand when how you should implement what take of teaching that depends on you this is very essential when I was there that Middle East and there was a young people all their parents they requested me trying to give you a lecture tour young children particularly those who are willing to join the college or they are in that class 10 11 12 first year so we don't know how to love it so I was getting in this way so these are the things that you have to understand Frost because life is yours you can make it you can ma read in English they say it can make it you can mod it you can destroy it suffering will be yours but being a member of the human society when you are suffering you are bringing their suffering on the society also when the peoples are there standing showing the clutter that we are homeless are they helping the human society none that the liabilities as they call in accountancy a second guard duty they are not as they there and the other people obviously cannot truly maybe parting with their own will to make them survive just to helping them that way wow so this is the way I was talking to them there is one young man stood up and say suppose I my way and he got her I think in in America or in Kannada majority of the people they are all Indians who are working over there in the mentalist their children are all coming into joining this university of america and canada and the boy got a chance over here something he is to 11c now i am going to join in the college nobody will be there to guide me if there is a problem then who he helped me my parents are not their elders are out there who will help me I told you in her computer you have to help yourself you have learned all these things you have learned how to leave now when our people are teaching teachers are teaching how to scream but then wavering the water in vector swim teacher cannot all the time all you to sleep it is not so this is the way you know that you are a human being so surround instance teaching like there when you were listening weighed anchor God isn't everything it doesn't mean that all bad people they are also God so I will go and have their company and then you buy all the battles pounding know that is the thing you have to learn I went to in whispering God your signal speaker there's a like colleague our destination is a very famous place tah-dah repeat I went to the deer and the moment there is a colleague means Tantra and Tantra means there should be a burning place God and the people should be there and when in the burning car people are burning the dead bodies you are doing the trapezius all over there and of course you have to drink them to small get to do this punch em car etc etc but it is really necessary Isis on the people sitting over there and one gentleman is a little bit early he's a wonderful boy singer singing virgin goddess Kali all alone I went in said I side and when I talked with him so you seem very well when he have learned he just glanced at me and he saved don't be here Irving go away this place has a peculiar thing that it attracts then keep those people over here and we are at war or everything lost good so that when you know what their young people over there in search of religion this thing that they are all grapes articles and they will have their company and in depth company what you are learning all these bad things so that is the time you have to use your own discrimination your own internet there is not nobody you have to help yourself so cinema business teaching that this is the way you learn let me tell you a story then you save this to you then gun person sale said if a wicked person is about to do how or actually does so should we keep quiet then now the spiritual people are supposed to be required and they should not fired and they should not also do anything which is not like spiritual so obviously we will see they are very humbled I and people they recognize thing oh he is so humble his voice is almost you cannot listen and if they are not talking that means they're very very religious person this is not like this so this is our history is telling the story again why was truly the first Tony he saying and then he said this type of people are very dangerous he saved coating upon our Allah water means neither God and with the water you can do anything suppose there is no god and goddesses suppose there is no holy place you just take a little water you can what should water because water has no figure and that is the reason argo Narayana the Hindus they don't believe in an image they take the help of the English only for the concentration I told it again and again that is the original thing and that is the reason all the solution at the time of provision you will have a preacher full of water even the people at the religious people products religious people anything only means indicate they will give some feature even the South India they will be breaking the coconut on the last time when I went over there I saw the chariot and they were breaking the coconut in America and the other shells of the coconut that was all over the road I was thinking at least some for devotees will go and pick it up and cleaning no one went the girl in our guard up it is Indian so we are so happy to make it everything in target the people so even even in there any car we have not learned this thing we are breaking the cohort on the road and then when it is all scattered they are so happy we are religiousness but without me I was almost ring to go and pick it to show them that you should not relent this and why they are breaking the coconut they don't know it's not of the coconut it's part of water it to show that the water is a symbol of know for what is no fun in whatever featured on whatever thing if you think it takes the shape of that and that is the reason water is the symbol of without any form so here ceramic wrist is killing our goal line but the filthy water you cannot use for the puja for the when we were performing then you must be very careful about that so that way he was kidding about this then this person say say if you wicked person is about to do harm or actually does so should we keep quiet is there very very practical question when a religious person is over there all in the practical Oh tease what should be their duty all india bharat russia it became weak because of the wrong interpretation of ahimsa non-violence what is non-violence even the soldier they're all sitting and green java without practicing the target without practicing the ballot without practicing the martial art and when other people are coming then we go and say please don't do this to the Sun what happened I was going from calcutta to delhi and one remote area one devotee came to see me off in the station in the bunker and the screen is there my particular place which was booked for me one person drunkard he was lying over there he was a porter and he was lying over there the furniture in vain because it was almost dying so he winked and say oh please get down because this is Brooke for up tchami G he will go and he used all the filthy languages in New and he saved damn with your geometry and he came and he said see this type of worthy is telling what to do then the devotee way he also because his a devotee and that too along with the sannyasis so he was so wild and gentle and that was the reaction again I told you are not listening to the words of the Havana cigar busines the model you have to be within the Whitaker language that you understand are you entered into them and I shower head a dog immediately jumped off I am here with a folded hand he looked at me and he said Swamiji merry life with Shiva can I do say any service to you then there's a what about you better take this water bottle wash it three times fill it with good water and bring where he obediently he was doing he's a good man but in under the spell of intoxication but do you only understand this type of language I'm not criticizing anyone but according to the situation you have to behave not just like a holy man means constantly as ceramics as a new mooing constantly very humble way or no you have to be at home according to that an inertia straße in his written very categorically mention a bonito gurdas chamber shastra body kenapa Chaitra da ragga rita charity art ardena the aggressor auto da he and who what is a prototype look at our karma they have analyzed all the system of life time of life condition of life in the society so stick step replacing every time they are very specific oh man and God after time aggressor this and who are they those who are giving the Orson administering poison attacking with weapons taking a ring you well other than all the wives these six type of people are at the time how you are going to be here with them there's also one whom are odds with the Lord leader of the Hindu society very clearly is telling in manas Matheny it is safe our to tie them iron down the moment you see the aggressors are approaching you an odd eva kill them or bheega bheega run each other without any discrimination simply kill them that is amusing is a religion teaching witness no as you are into society you have to be strong of goals we have to keep in mind these things as now we are dealing and all other civilized people will be shrinking what type of religion is this teaching to kill others as because we are protected by the pollution as because we are protected by the administration as because we are protected by the present a society but think of that society when you have to save you otherwise there's no one and that is the reason in America they are so fond of and fighting for the arm attached they like to keep the guns because that was the weapon with what default and he just began a part and parcel of their life though it is not necessary now because in every corner there police people up there and emily kate is famous 911 so obviously you need not do but this is the teaching this is the scripture that i am quoting long back when there was nobody when these to go and that is the reason the buddhist particularly the book this wrong they discovered karate judo and all shots a free hand combat because wendy is to go when they were attacked they had to protect themselves we cannot all the kind wait go for calling the pollution so that is the reason we're here it is taking but salam tishnar is when he is speaking is a modern society sitting almost near the katate what is his teaching wonderfully he is killing listen to story is true astoria stealing a man living in society should make it sure and I think the world sure anger original a man living in society should make a show up anger to protect himself from evil minded people but he should not harm anybody in anticipation of how likely to be done by him so then it says a story again the story of a snake and diploma charity the holy man the holy man the blonde attorney when he was about to cross a meadow then the cowherd boys came running to him saying said to go there is a person as think it will attack you and in difficulty the prematurely say thank you for the information but you need not to be afraid I know a mantra and thus they won't be able to bring him out to me and he waved and truly the snake came to buy it then the greenwich rd or new doctor and could talk we assume good dog we just named touch this name why you are having people and by this way you will only harming yourself the more bad work evergreen having others and more and more bad result is coming on your life I will give you a mantra you go on will be there don't harm others and you read list back on the slick receive the money and as was instructed by his teacher he went on repeating the mantra slowly slowly became very very docile and humble now these boys the power they noticed it so in the beginning they were throwing the stones from distance when they saw no reaction from the same they were in here then Duke rehan and we'll live desk it against the ground and then left it over there the poor creature because the Guru say not to hurt others and he was practicing mantra she lived left there and it's a white after one year when the holy person came back this boy stole all that sneakers it has dialed in the man said it cannot be because i have given a number i know it won't die he went called the snake and hearing the price of his guru his master distinct him out crusted it before seeing him the master say why you were in this condition but don't you need now aight aight i flew at a food perhaps I am NOT taking the simple food that I'm taking so I have reduced etc he couldn't even live in her the people who aren't him giving him soo I am elevated so then is guru say you fool I asked you not to harm others but it I asked you not is you should his and make people afraid were coming to harm you and that way you have to survive so this is the teaching that we must learn them in this creation of God there is a big variety of things main animals trees plants and all the animals are good some bad tell a ferocious animal please prepare for sweet as nectar and others fear fruit as that is poisonous likewise among human beings there are the good and delicate the holy and unholy mainly divided into four classes this is the observation of ceramic now the one sri krishna also classified people in four groups arta jai guru art RT and Gianni these are the four types of people at their there are so many people although friendly look again or the same but according to the thinking capacity mental attitude they are four different groups one is distressed art one is impaired another race will seeker for traffic another is Gianni he is the known is trying to outrun this guy on E is the best and once in our businesses there are four types of people among the everfree we may count the sages like nada main image you have four classes those bound by the vectors of the world one class there's the water in Sanskrit the secrets after liberation moksha then the liberated booked eva three nita but Momo shoe mokta and nectar mocked up and big deal those who are free from the bondages of this world or attachment then locked up but they're just like what many malls but they're great people of course there are another class Tesco nicktim lecture ami de Vega Nanda nick de means they are completely free free from the world they are not anywhere just with the world no attraction for anything in this world still to come still they take the form of a human being still they live like just what many people and then they show us that this is the the way of life that one should be that is detail but the two people what is worker another is no book she what about yours among the elder to be free ceramic instilling let nada those in bondage a sunken worthiness and forgetful of God not even the mystic do they think of God the seekers of the liberation want to free themselves from the attachment to this world now here the psychological some people not that the people don't like God almost all of them in all country in all religion they will believe in God far they are believing for some reasons as fish he has seen because of the four reasons and among the people very very few will be there who really want to realize God really want to live for God salaam Krishna storybook death and then he's giving a description how the world people are he can do anything and everything only for themselves I was the after take it was observing a movie a villain she was there he was surviving and all the people who are working for him if necessary he was killing them he got in a sedation and one girl she used to bring all the information for this person and she was to love this person then ultimately one day when the police surrounded him the girders with that man with and she thought that both of them will live but finally to her utter surprise and that was the main thing of the whole movie the two eyes of the girl looking at that man whom all to her life perhaps she loved life son protected betrayed betrayed her how hold her Justin strong so that the moment the police should the first bullet will eat her he never hesitated for a moment that this girl served me so well no because worldly person for him only I should survive and no one else I don't care so these are the worldly person if we are mixing with him we are bringing harm to us forgiving of God God realization spiritual life but we have to understand under whose company with whose company there glee when leaving because the morning what man is no nice company as the same and he is in Prince wishes circle economy so this is the people who only live for themselves then one devotee when Sri Ramakrishna was describing in that way one devotee is asking self is there no L then for such a worldly person is there no help for their worldly person look at it this is the beauty of the Hinduism beauty of the Sonata Madonna the neighbors say that eternal hell is a non conception every one has a chance and here he says master certainly days from time to time he should leave in the Campagna holy men look at him he's not telling that he should forward in a grounding family or I should do these trusting for 22 months of dreams nothing later very soon suggestion he is giving imperfect situations is doing from time to time not that all the time all is that time to time he should leave in the company of holy men that the last few classes we have already described coating from different scripture who can record us only men not that the person who is having tragic aesthetic clothes and leaving the man Deacon Gardner and then also going to solitude to meditate on God some people are going into salute you the moment will be summer all they will try they're going to salute you and more solitude with to catch fish so many people have been drinkin all alone and then catching fridge and the home no that is not designated of course that is physically solitude but psychological solitude is yes in our mission is very specific go into solitude to meditate on God that is the very freedoms of you to further know he should practice discrimination this is the four points we must remember all the time doesn't want to be good good people what we have to do controlling of all these these things it is all afterwards outwardly but the four main things first we have to have the company of holy people means is magic spirituality is nothing but inspiration the person decide the students who are sitting over there a teacher comes and he is fixed in such a way that each and every one they get inspired you can be a very good student you can learn yes you can do this the work the way they will tell Halep they were inspired he did not explain the subject they can help themselves that way installation is dancing when the people they're going for the world are our needs them the military people the main thing is inspirational the way will be go on telling them they feel encouraged even to give their own life sacrifice their own life for gaining their family that is the power of inspiration spirituality is also like they're so holy people means getting inspiration to become holy and he has to practice the discrimination what is good and what is bad and finally pray to god this is very variable in our and this month in when we will be meeting I don't know how many of you go when you'll be meeting for the retreat spiritual retreat dear we'll be discussing mainly on prayer because this is very important how to be spiritual so on that the prayer salamat richness a sadhu sanga ninja gosh which are and proud nahh partna means constantly talking with God the Muslim saying he is stealing has not just possible docket God and as less as possible talk with the worldly people and whatever is coming with your mind dog he'd go talk with God and talk with God as he he is there things in our mission is a very important war looking at the k'da get a visa one gentleman you must have hard about the tremendous power of faith will close today here and in the next class we will discuss about the bretaña and faith no none of the two time is therefore I veneers if anyone want to ask any question then we can try to answer that question on this topic tiffany has Castilian but the people god bless we are not in any company practically have not seen those people in the history also a fire there are some people so dangerous this type of people are so dangerous it cannot think of it and we rest assured that we have none of us a practice we are nurturers each and every one of us amongst remains trying to give the blessings of God trying to understand religion trying to be reaches people but intensity of our that drive a little less or more that's all yeah that is a biche rasa that is that that thing will be discussing our two words it is not just out of emotion sometimes the modern society they will be thinking about the others all these people at industries it is going served in not out of emotion out of knowledge because of the philosophy and because of the faith what is that faith God is there residing in the personals and they named bling and serving him so this new man is service to God and that is a field that is a relief that is a philosophy that is adorable so if you understand this then we'll go when going and serving in a pre-work every thought every prayer transforming you for the better way to live in return that is the introduction modern introduction of charming vivekanandan still operational this is called karma yoga and there we were green not in a higher position some people when they see look at the poor people will be throwing money like that it's not like throwing his drink of worship and all in almost in all civilized society there were government branches of their department is there taking care social security in America in our India also there are social departments are there
