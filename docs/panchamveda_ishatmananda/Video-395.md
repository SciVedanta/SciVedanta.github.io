[396. Panchama Veda - “Take Shelter With God And Pray To Him”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGLQwCF-_0c)

namaskar dear devotees and Friends let us begin studying the panchama Veda jivanam Kobe we read them angalam srimadatam aha today the topic that we will be discussing the take shelter with God and pray to him that is where the bhagavan is giving the stress in spiritual life never the complete dependence the complete dependence on God is the ultimate of all sadhana all spiritual austerities this is called nirvaratha very difficult because of the ego so I always think that this will be good that will be good I should do in this way I should do in that way so complete depending on the god the will of God the absolutely the pure mind where there is no ego at all they can do but that is the ultimate in their spiritual life the religious life most of the time we make a mistake by thinking the spiritual or religious life means that a protection from the Providence protection by God our life we have business we have Services we have many other things we have to protect that our property our wealth our jewelries and of course our lives so for that we are taking all care of course at the same time if the Providence if the God is protecting us that is not religion it is only the beginning of religion that is why in the bhagavad-gita the bhagavan SRI Krishna he mentioned the four different types of people Imam Jana the four different types now when we are talking about the nirvaratha the complete complete dependence on God there's only the gyanese can do gyani means those who sincerely seriously they like to realize the truth they like to know about themselves majority of the people they go for and the fun of it the psalm they are very good singers so they will bring them or have a nice Bhajan and they will burn the incense sticks they will dance a little have the Prasad and chit chatting socializing that is the beginning of the religion we can say this is that is not the seriousness he is very very serious about the religion about spirituality some people putting on some dress and them chanting something and giving some talk and afterwards they're just discussing these are all in the on the surface only but religion goes much deeper and deeper that's why he is telling the nirvaratha the complete dependence comes when the there is no ego that is the very very difficult because we are all bound by the Maya and very very peculiar if we think the when we talk about the ego we are always associating with this body I am this ah whatever I say so I am the powerful man I am the powerful person I take the decision like that what is this I if it is associated with this body the body when it was born I was not knowing at all the body is changing so fast so quickly only a few that a Time Has Come when this body is having some facilities I have become the president of some country some State and the top leader of some the clan of people and I am thinking I am the top of the war no not like that so the ego also we have to judge so this is the way when people think about the path of Guyana you know in Hinduism there are four paths those who are regularly attending you all know the one is the Guyana Path of Knowledge and one is the path of bhakti the devotion one is part of Karma and of course the meditation the dhyana what is knowledge this we have to go on thinking that when I say I what I mean this body but the body is constantly changing what I mean the Mind mind is constantly changing then what is this eye this Bichara a constant judgment that is The Path of Knowledge and by that way we understand this I is the root cause of all suffering when that goes away the eye goes away and calms the faith in the existence of God the God is doing everything through me I am the agent and I am blessed the God has chosen me for this work so this is the first thing and second is it goes to free from the ego it needs the stages of sadhana through stages of sadhana only we can reach up to that some people they make mistake you know out of excitement they think oh it's a great Scholars have come and they're preaching about the ultimate vedanta there is no Universe you are not there you are the pure and you are the Atman oh that's true I am the Atman they feel like that and they think that is the path that we should follow and we have completed the science we are in Engineers we are doctors so why to go for other devotion that is for the lower type of people wrong completely wrong it has nothing to do with the university certificates this is goes according to the mind what is your mind is thinking only those who are propagating preaching they're also thinking they are giving something new wrong because that is already there and have they realize themselves that is also doubtful because the way the people they are going for the ego how much the people are listening to me how much how many people are following me these are the traits of ego the symbols of ego associated with the ego cannot say that I have realized God so one should be very careful the preachers must be very careful teachers must be must be very careful and that is the reason bhagavan sidama Krishna you'll be ultimately we will read he'll say this is a very very difficult to say that I am the guru or I am the giving you the religion no so the spirituality it is the ultimate is complete dependence nirvaratha comes when there is no ahamkar the complete negation of the ego complete negation of the ego to achieve that stage you have to go step by step practicing so sudama Krishna taught us the various stages of sadhana and he said in the beginning you must have to have Duality because that is the way you can begin some very fortunate one those who have already completed in the past life all this the main practice very very rare of course bhagavan ceramic himself never spoke about the advantage of vedanta in public he chose some among his disciples and he used to tell them in a secretly is very difficult it was not available because there is a chance of people they will misunderstand it so we have to follow the instructions of bhagwan's ramakrishna and no other person why because he he is giving us the right direction and what is that you will reach over there and that is the ultimate thing but before that you have to judge yourself what is your mental condition do you really feel that you are Atman then you cannot work you cannot go to further job maintain your family it is impossible Sometimes some people they think that and they it says that the people they come and say that I am following so and so that is very difficult very very difficult so this we have to understand and see stages of sadhana and we have already a rate from the gospel of sirama Krishna what he meant that in the the stages the beginning one must think the Nama Rupa a Guna of God the God is having a form he is having a name and he is having the qualities god with form and attributes so that is the way they should we should think if one takes shelter with God and prays to him with great longing God will surely listen he will certainly make everything favorable everything favorable so when we go to do something which is good for others then everything becomes favorable and we think oh I have done it and people will be saying oh you have done it and Society will be recognizing you and you go back to the ego and thinking I am capable to do it and nobody else wrong that is why in the upanishad when the gods were celebrating their victory over the ashurers demons there appeared a personality and the Lord Indra the god of the king of all gods that he said who is that person standing over there at the door oh ugly Agni this fire god can you please go and inquire you know that story in the position and the Lord went over there the Agni the fire you know hey who are you why you were standing over here he said that I will answer afterwards but who are you you don't know me I am the fire god the what is your capacity I can burn anything this is it can you burn the small piece of hay he kept before him look at it the Agni the fire god he tried his best with all his might all his power he could not do anything he couldn't burn that small piece of hay then he came back he'd hanging on his chest and he was ashamed and he were humbled then the another person that is by you is a weaned God terribly powerful and he was saying to know about that person same thing happened who are you I am the wind God what is your capacity I can blow anything can you please blow this piece of grass the wind couldn't do anything he also became humble and came back reported to Indra and the king of Gods he himself went over there to inquire this is very peculiar very something it is it should not be like this who is this and that person vanished in that place came um that is the first time in the upanishad we find this name umaimavati he was like the glow like a gold that means it's a pure that is why glowing and he said you fools because of the Brahman gave you the power and you could win over the war and now you have forgotten that and you are celebrating and thinking that you have done it you have become egoistic that is the way the upanishad is teaching us till you have to give up the EGO then how we will think that whatever we are successful and that is because the God has given us that power that humbles us so this is the way day to day life we have to minimize our ego I am successful is good Within Myself I have to go on praying to God oh God please don't me egoistic it is you only through me you have done it I am successful because of your grace so this is the way we have to then the faith and tremendous self effort if both are together working then the success comes and bhagavan sirama Krishna giving an unique example to the story I think we read that story again let us read this story and this is a very unique story how a person just because of the love for his son who was dying took up an impossible mission almost impossible mission what is that a man had a son who was on the point of death in a frenzy he asked he asked uh remedies of different people one of them said here is a remedy find it must Reign so fast it must rain when the star Swati is in the ascendant then some of the Rain Must Fall into a skull then a frog must come there to drink the water and the snake must cheese it and when the snake is about to bite the frog the frog must hop away and the poison must fall into the skull you should give that patient a little of that poison and the rain water from the skull if if if if so many Apes and there should be a particular moment when a particular star is descending then it should be rain then rain water should be collected in a skull human skull and that's called when where it is there the Frog should come and the snake chasing the Frog should come over there when it is going to bite frog hopped away and the Snakes poison will be mixed in that the water that water a little should be given to the patient so just imagine the impossibility but with great faith the person went out and he was rain water the father Satan Eagle to sit out eagerly to find the medicine when the star Swati was in the sky it started raining and fervently he said to God oh Lord please get his call for me searching here and there he at last found a skull with rain water in it again he prayed to God see he is trying to do the the person a human is trying to do he is searching but at the same time he is praying so both are going together not that just I will see it in the corner of a room and pray and things will be done no I have to take up the work and I should go and try to do and when I am trying to do I should go on praying too I will complete it I don't depend on anyone there is a different path but here if you are praying to God you get an extra strength and truly God helps he says again he prayed to God oh Lord I beseech thee please help me find the frog and the snake since he had great longing he got the frog and the snake also in the twinkling of an eye he saw the snake chasing a frog and as it was about to bite the Frog the poison fell into the skull if one takes sheltered with God here bhagavan sudama Krishna giving his statement if one takes shelter with God and praise to him with great longing God will surely listen he will certainly make everything favorable so this is a great faith the moment there is something we all lose our faith instead we should gain our faith more stronger we should make the faith more stronger if we constantly pray to God whatever I am having my intellect my physical strength I am dedicating it to you oh my god the please help me so that I can at the healthy body mind intellect serve you there's nothing wrong I want to serve you and for that I am praying that you should keep me healthy physically mentally intellectually so that I can properly serve you that is the prayer of every Monk what they are doing the same prayer only and when you are having that prayer fervently with all faith then the god also helps if one takes sheltered with God shelter means having the faith complete faith in the existence of God and praying to God I have no one else but you so please help me and praise to him with great longing God will surely listen and will certainly make everything favorable the captain who was there he was very happy friends were reading from the page 793 the English book and of course in the Bengali book it is 852. at the Bengali kothambraitha complete the volume it is 852. now Masters the god makes everything favorable perhaps the aspiring doesn't marry thus he is able to devote his whole attention to God so when someone is married the obviously the responsibility the work that God does the if one is trying to realize God and the God will make in such a way that even if he is married or she is married they will get the divorce or the husband or the wife and will die something that you will make alone but we start crying and what is this now the if you are truly looking and or thinking to realize God one should take it as an advantage Narada he lost his father much earlier he never knew who is the father then he was born and the his mother was working with in household and Narada was growing up over there slowly slowly then one day when he was almost a teenage boy he was capable to look after himself the mother was bitten by a snake and she also passed away now when we hear this story how we feel oh my God what a bad fate of the boy he lost the father he lost the mother too Narada he took his mother and to The Cremation ground and after putting her body on the fire as the Hindus they do then he thanked God God you have completely given me freedom freedom from all responsibilities suppose the mother was there and the only son the naturally it had to look after the mother suppose the mother is leaving say 90 years or 100 years then the sun won't be able to go away you have to take much care of his mother by that way he is born Sometimes some people when they are not having their children they are thinking oh we should adopt a child or we should have some pets why because that is the opportunity God has given you maybe in the past life they were having some desire to become a householder so the husband wife family this house and then slowly slowly God has taken away all those now you are completely free now whatever the work that you are doing to support your life that's okay and after that why don't you concentrate on God reading about God visiting the holy places having the company of the Holy people and meditating as maximum as possible what is the opportunity God is giving but we think oh God is so cruel he has taken away everything from me all other people are so happy the one the elderly lady came she was crying why my husband has passed away the what is the age 85 and after 85 and everyone thinks in that way I am not criticizing but now at this age the I have experienced what is this life what is this at the family life now it is over thank God you have given me complete freedom I am free from all uh this bondages now I am giving my mind to you now prayer is keep me healthy so that I can concentrate and I can give everything best that I am having to you to your service that needs the complete faith in the existence of God that's why when we are reading the gospel of sudama Krishna the Pancham of Veda it is varieties of people are thinking in a varieties way because their aptitude their thinking capacity and the way they look to the life all this depends the bhagavan sudama Krishna through the gospel through this katamrita through this panchama Veda nothing else but God he is giving us the directions and naturally only those can appreciate it those who are having the desire to realize God is a great word in Sanskrit mumuksu means those who are longing for God realization and it is not in this life they have experienced the previous lives also and they understood that it is nothing but Foley all these things that we see is all worthless everything is going to be destroyed someday the history is the proof of that even then we think that we should have these we should have that so this is the way we should understand and then only we will be truly get the benefit of reading the gospel of ramakrishna otherwise just reading and having some stories these are that's good but the true the Seeker of God they will understand the inner meaning and they should stick to that Krishna said in the beginning you should have the faith in the existence of God and that faith will come by having the company of holy people then you should go to a secluded place and ponder over that what I have learned then let me understand this properly so you are utilizing your time in taking the holy name of God in meditation in prayer and in service I am doing these and that in the Holy place by this way I am purifying myself even if you don't do the things will be taken care but I got this opportunity so I am doing it I am I should be thankful to God you have given the opportunity so this is the way one begins the God has a form I concentrate on that particular form God has a name and I repeat that name God has his in his life so many things that he has done so I am remembering those also those gunas the qualities his love his affection his Purity his service his truthfulness when we going on thinking in that way those qualities are coming in me too so this is the way I am becoming humble and slowly making the progress as I am progressing ultimately I will completely depend on God and I will realize that this God is nothing but me I am that I am the self I was only thinking that there are two there is two differences nothing is there I was thinking there is two there is only one but because of my wrong thinking wrong way of looking at things all these years I was suffering nothing to be afraid of nothing is going to lose I am that pure Atman I am already free I don't have any bondages I was thinking I am bound so I was suffering so my thought become purified and that way one realizes Oneness Oneness with God Oneness with the Atman one is with the Brahman whatever the Hindus they always give the the freedom the in that freedom the yogis they are free and they have set up the way in this way the my goal is Atman param means the Supreme param means the highest means the best the only one parama so my goal is Yogi will say he is withdrawing the Mind from the objects of this world and concentrating and what is his goal para Mahatma a devotee the he will also think my prayer my tears and my all effort is to reach to that one who is God bhagavan or ishwara is the name only and one who is going on discriminating judging his goal is Brahman so Brahman Atman ishwara they are all same in the bhagavata it says and bhagavan sirama Krishna said caitanya mahaprabhu said after the realization one can understand all are different names but actually this is the same is mentioning but one cannot succeed unless one renounces the last and gold only by renunciation the ignorance destroyed the last in gold the tremendous desire that we are having that is the last that is the of course the the word last is used for something else but it is the desire the different type of desires are there the strong desire for the worldly things and to satisfy that desire we need wealth we need money we need gold so sudama Krishna coined this one as lost and gold Kama kanchana means desire and kanchana to fulfill that desire the kanchana comes last money comes lost it is the desire only first is the desire and different type of desires comes Sometimes some people will think that let me start in asthma that sometimes they go away and then they'll be going to different rich people and they will go talk to them and they'll get some money and so many things they will go on doing why with only for that then after doing all those things that oh what I have done who is going to look after this it will be completely so so many people there are religious people forget about the householders of course in their mind the householders they want that they should have the property they should have the will after them their children their progeny they will get it it's okay but even the monks even the renouncers they are also thinking in the same way and then so that is why one should be careful why I have come over here pu just whatever the responsibility the organization is giving perform that and be free consenting your mind in the higher thoughts studying meditating so sudama Krishna is mentioning it is lost and local lust and cold the sun's Rays falling on Lanes burn many objects but if a room is dark inside you cannot get that result you must come out of the room to use the lanes the Sun Sun Ray the wonderful way the bhagavan cinema Krishna says if your room is dark though you are having a lens and Sun Ray is outside and your room is dark you cannot use the cleanse so what you should do you should come out of your room and then use the lens to burn utilizing the Sun Ray to burn something to light up a fire so this is the way the lens is already there in our mind we can use that but instead we are constantly going inside the room and closing the door and window it is becoming dark and we are thinking oh we are only very cozy and it is okay for us the sum of the people they do not believe in God what do they do the whole life you see only food and just somehow surviving it will be eating will be drinking they'll be making Mary Making they are having some socializing that much and that is the way they spend their life and they think and constantly having the ego and that with the when they go to the party they will see somebody else is having more gorgeous dresses and more attention they are getting so he will be feeling that my ego is hard because of that and then all these things goes on in the society life and some people are so happy with that they think without that how can people live that is called the dirt room and the sunlight is there God is there the great Masters they have given you the lenses but we are we don't know how to use it so it needs the particular person it is not the the religious groups linguistic group or the country nothing like that it is an individual person and the attitude Sometimes some Americans who are coming over here talking to us so enlightened they're eager to know about the truth but only difficulty that I have noticed to understand this truth intellectually we understand but to realize it in our life practice it in our life it takes lives after lives you have to have the patience if you don't have the patience you'll never realize it again he is mentioning that someone wanted to have the drinking water and he was digging the well and after going for two or three feet he left that again he went to somewhere else and started digging every time he goes to two feet or three feet he loses the patience and go changes the places by that way he was going on digging or the oh whole area but not getting a drop of water so spiritual life means you understand that this is my path and by this way I am going to get the water that means the blessings of God go on practicing that without leaving the practice morning getting up and then going and sitting by meditation then chanting then working then reading then serving so all these routine days together should go and in the bhagavad-gita if you read it says the satwa in the beginning it is bitter but at the end it is so sweet but you should have to have the patience to practice that otherwise everything is lost so when we are reading the gospel of the ramakrishna we must learn that sudama Krishna the Lord is giving us the Assurance the God is there and our effort a little immediately the flow of God will come towards us but we have to have the patience and every day with great care we have to remove all our desires of course the food and the clothing and the shelter is all necessary but slowly slowly you have to understand this is enough can I talk to other people can I be with them do I appreciate others goodness these are the way we have to understand if I feel jealous about the goodness of others that means something wrong I am not fit to become the spiritual person I have to be careful I don't care about the appreciations of others I don't care anything of this world somebody is getting success in something let him be maybe God wants him to get that I am completely different and I have something to get from God and God has kept it for me he is not going to give it to anyone I will get it for sure so these are the convictions maybe one year and maybe 100 years it doesn't matter for me I'll be waiting for God so this is the way one is the history he is decided very strong the feeling I am going to get the realization of God I am going to know about myself but for that if I have to practice Patiently I will do that so this is the way we have to think but some people live in the world even after attaining Guyana he's telling that most of the people they are living in the world because of ignorance but some people they also live in this world but after attending the Guyana what is that Guyana I am not bound by this ego I have re understood this ego is the cause of all suffering whatever I am doing it is because the God wanted me to do and because the God has given me the intellect and the power to perform and I have done it and I am thankful to God because he has chosen me for that job humbleness should be there other spiritual life is not possible so he this is he mentioned the some people they live after the gyana they see both what is inside and what is outside the room because they can understand what is the samsara things are going on and they can also understand the way the God works in this world if you you will find so many people in every religion in every society in every time in every country every places you will find some people they are constructing the temple the churches the synagogues the mosque and they will be arranging the Puja and all that good but at the same time they're very egoistic we are doing it they will give their own name so that is the problem understanding so we should have to read I use this word have to you should have to read the gospel of sudama Krishna understand this subtlety of spirituality otherwise we are really performing so many things really doing so many things as because you do not know we are not going to the goal rather going on in a circle thinking oh I have done this so obviously I will get the darshan of God the blessings of God I have constructed this huge Temple I have donated so much of money to the God nothing can help unless we truly become humble otherwise nothing can help so this ramakrishna is mentioning so there are some people even after the knowledge they leave why only to give guidance to the people they are true gurus the light of God ilu means the world therefore with the light they can judge discriminate between good and bad permanent and impermanent the ignorant who laid a worldly life without knowing god unlike people living in a house with the Mad walls with the help of a dim light they can see the inside of the house but nothing more but those who live in the world after having attained knowledge and realized God are like people living in The Glass House they see the inside of the room and also all that is outside the light from the sun of knowledge enters strongly into the room they perceive everything inside the room very clearly they know what is good and what is bad what is permanent and what is impermanent God Alone is the Doer and we are all his instruments therefore it is impossible even for a gani to be egoistic the gyani means who has already realized God he also cannot say the oh I I I why because it is the god the Supreme Being who is doing everything it is not good to be a guru by profession there's Sometimes some people there are many many Clans are there the mainly they will try to instruct people in exchange of money so they are professional Guru profession means by that way they are that is their way of surviving no no that's why Swami Vivekananda said one should learn religion from a renouncer those the person who has renounced everything a person having the family his children his property he may claim that he is a religious person but it is very difficult truly difficult so people don't understand a people means ignorant people again because they don't have the Judgment they go for according to the advertisement they go and hear there are some people they'll go on telling oh you do not know my Guru he is having these he is having that so they always there may be educated people but at the same time they behave like the ignorant not understanding what that particular person is doing is a professionalism his father was a guru and now this he is a guru then again his son will be the guru with this this is a profession it goes on they are leaving on that sudama Krishna is very clear he's telling it is not good to be a guru by profession one cannot be a teacher without a command from God he who says he is a guru is a man of mean intelligence that's why in the ramakrishna mission they never the I have that our the my my Guru the 10th president of the ramakrishna order srivastrami bireswarananda ji he never appreciated don't call me as Guru Guru is Sri ramakrishna whenever people they like to talk like that we always remind them it is always the guru is bhagavan and we are only the bearers of that knowledge or that light that much and we are blessed and we think ourselves blessed because he has chosen us for that that much but the all power is in the hand of bhagavan sirama Krishna and here sirama Krishna is mentioning have you not seen the balance the lightest side goes higher Lighter Side in the balance Lighter Side goes higher what it means the heavy when someone is heavy with ego he is going down and the one without ego goes up then the trailuku was Seated on the floor and to the north of the small couch he was going to sing siddam Krishna say to ah how sweetly you've seen started singing this is a Hindi the Bhajan it means I have joined my heart to thee all that exists are thou all that exist are thou and the Beautiful song when bhagava Swami Vivekananda he was refuting to accept the Dwight vedanta everything is God how that can be the young the Narendra 17 18 years old and obviously he was not ready to accept this bhagavan sudama Krishna quoted this using everything that you see in this world the grasses the birds the animals each and everything is nothing but God but otherwise where from the came the manifestation came from God you know that in the philosophy all the different religions why the different the the other day that one was asking so why the religions are different the because of the explanation the some people they explained what they explained only three the Creator creation and the relation between the Creator and the creation who is the Creator God or Jehovah or Allah or bhagavan ishwar and what is this this creation he has created how he has created dear the deeper has he created out of something or from himself if we accept that there were other things like the materials which the god the intelligent inter that he utilized then there is a very difficult question in the philosophy the two existence is always clashes and it will just get destruction it will be destroyed someday it cannot be so the vedanta comes forward gives the perfect answer by saying whatever you see as the creation is nothing but your imagination they use the word Maya the Maya Shakti they're like this like this there are so many philosophies because they are explaining the creation the process of Creation in their own way that's why they differ so this he is telling the everything that you see is nothing but you everything I see is nothing but you so I give my mind to you said though he was a dualist apparently and he said if you can see God by closing your eyes in meditation can't you see God with open eyes the unique statement everything that you see but nothing but God and how it is that you are hating so religion can never hate a religious person is nothing but full of love and sympathy he can never hate if somebody is telling don't talk to them they don't belong to us he is not a religious person we will be having some the society maybe a religious political group or economical or whatever but not religious religion means love because God is love whilst ramakrishna listened to the songs he was overwhelmed with emotion then the master Moshe is mentioning the sirama Krishna was thinking to go to Calcutta somebody invited him so he was thinking who is going to take me to Calcutta so who is going to drive to some the rich people is to send their the horse-drawn carriages or sometimes he'll be hiring one and they will pay for that so whenever you are inviting a religious person you are supposed to pay because he is not having his own money so that is the reason the people to get the holy company if the householders are visiting they are supposed to bring something for the holy people because they don't have anything but when all people come to him a day how you will feed them so obviously like the part lab they will be bringing some food or donation and that becomes an asthma that he will give the food or the fruits or something as a prasada because he he cannot spend but other people they give that way sirana Krishna is mentioning who is going to pay for me who will be bringing the this hot stone carriages in the meantime when he was planning to visit Calcutta it was evening time all the as the all the temples in the Dakshin Asia they started they were getting ready for the prayer Narendra came the moments ramakrishna saw the Narendra he changed his plan and he said to master Marshall Narendra has come how can I go to Calcutta now I send for Narendra how can I go now what do you think he's asking master Mastery was always with him so to be in the company of a holy person also it needs a great patience because the holy person he is changing his mood according to his thought he will be changing so if the person who is close to him or serving him or giving his company if he is behaving rudely roughly then that creates problem that is the reason Master wash a very humble though very educated Highly Educated very intelligent but at the same time he was very patient and he is telling as you be sir let us put it off today no problem everything depends on cerama Krishna if he wants to go Master Masha is going if he doesn't no problem so master all right we shall go tomorrow either by boat or by Carriage to the other devotees it is late go home now because Narendra has come and he will be talking with the Narendra he is asking the devotees to the go so that he can give full attention to Narendra she was brooding her and it was making the Narendra the flag bearer and afterwards in the week came to know who is this Narendra the sirama Krishna when he is giving full attention to Narendra the naturally the some people of that time they were misunderstanding why he should give so much of attention maybe he is a son of a rich person so is it is not the someone mentioned you love rakal naren because their parents are very rich well established in the society so you are trying to get all the benefits ran to the mother Kali and he asked the mother mother do I do that only for their at the social statuses then he came back and said you Rogue I'm not going to listen to you mother said I see Purity in them I see Narayan in them the god Narayan they are holy they are pure so I love them so that is the way we have to understand why this person when the devotees they come they misunderstand many uh mostly the how these holy people are working unless and until they are also practicing spirituality and purifying their mind it is difficult to understand the holy people and particularly like say ramakrishna the God himself thank you friends we will start a new chapter and the next Wednesday so it's a long question Vijay is asking even though I offer the results of my job to Divine mother's feet I find myself planning a lot while performing the job he's planning okay first part second or should I leave it to Divine mother and go with the flow as I sometimes no matter how much planning I do something completely different happens please guys you are correct you know but it's really really difficult to completely depend on God don't try that so now both you keep you have to pray to God so please as we were reading the story you must have heard it that the story the person to save the life of his son he was going to find out the medicine which was almost impossible but still he was going with a great home the God will help so because of his that Faith the God will help in that situation it was raining it was dark and it was not a very good place we can understand because the skull are there the snakes are there natural it is not very neat and clean place so even then he was going over there that means you have to have the effort so plan yourself and then pray to God God I have planned to do this work in this way will have blessings on Me Guide Me that is the best way and if you are sincerely praying to God whatever the little the The Faults Are there he will do in such a way everything will be perfect and you will be successful have faith a prayer but use your intellect and effort thank you is saying I enjoy your classes see you in Washington DC on March 31st thank you aparna looking for that then Vijay is saying is asking I have trouble seeing Brahman in a narcissistic person while dealing with them at work please advise how to see Oneness in a world with these kind of people so see that is the last you know the when you see the the Brahman in everything that is the ultimate knowledge so you can understand it will take long time just practice and again I I would suggest that when you think that person ah you know the difficult to accept him pray to God the garden is very difficult for me to adjust with that person and every time he's thought his way of life a completely different than me there is a conflict so please change him so that I can't go in my own way and by that we will find either the god which change his mind he will be favorable friendly with you or he will go away in some other places according to his work ah Karma follow and somebody else will come in his place who will be friendly it really happens so pray pray and pray to God onion you're always asking my question is when and how did you think of becoming a sannyasi and in brahmachari days how did you cope up with severe training so this is you know depend on the when you become a monk that a tremendous urge comes in the mind we never care for anything that's truly the wind that idea came the thought came you know you are leaving all your known people known place which you you were so comfortable so suddenly you are going somewhere you do not know what those people how they will behave with you and how the things will be but these thoughts never comes in the mind they with complete faith they will go if that attitude is not there one cannot become a monk one cannot become a sannyasi because if you adjust oh I will go then whether there is a whether or the or it's called the ACs are there are not a good food conditions are there are not that people are there or not if you calculate in that way I don't think that they can become the sannyasi even if they they won't be able to be successful as a good sannyasi thank you we share the three-part question you should ask one of the other yes so the first first part is what is purushakar what is ego are the same why is it said that what we are doing good or bad is done by God first question I'd say that first thing ego ego is the eye highness that all the time we are feeling I am doing it this is my family this is my country like that that is called ego but when we judge the where from it is coming from this particular body Associated but the body when I always give that example when I use a small little baby of say few months and somebody took a photo and after 20 years if they are showing that photo to me to identify do you recognize who is this little child you won't be able to recognize your own body so how one can be so egoistic thinking this is the body and then after some time you become old and then they're strong all those body will go God forbid then somebody will be the bending somebody cannot walk somebody is not having the teeth the same body is completely changing and going to be destroyed how can you associate that body as I what is this ego constantly changing so the mind if you judge in this way then the ego will go instead of ego self-confidence will come with the faith of God this is the ego part and about the purushakara the self-effort as I was telling again and again and it has been supported by the Sanjaya the great personality of the Mahabharata so he said in the last verse of the bhagavad-gita it's called 700th verse he says where there is the God's grace and also the effort of the human being success is there so we have to have the effort these are the what else was there second question I don't know if I'm emotional or not but worldly attachments are gone slowly whenever I see my Shiva or or Here shiva's song tears come in my eyes is it a sign of bhakti of course of course but at the same time the the tears and the devotion and the love for one particular God is good but why Shiva why Shiva that you have to ask yourself so what is the quality in the Shiva just the name you have heard from your childhood days you got associated that no Shiva means sacrifice and Shiva that sacrifices Purity the word Shiva means auspicious and what is the auspiciousness the auspiciousness is unselfishness the unselfishness is auspicious Purity and that is peace so that is why the Shiva he is living with so many other beings about whom we cannot think of The Ghost and all other so why because that is the way a peaceful person can live with all people cannot just so if you love Shiva you have to develop the quality of Shiva parohito pritam Swami vivekanth is writing about the Sheba just for the good of others he was ready to sacrifice his own life and that's why he drank as the story goes in the mythology it took that poison himself to save the others the Sheba means sacrifice Shiva means unselfishness Shiva means love so if you love Shiva like Shiva you have to have these three qualities then only you are a true votary true devotee of Shiva thank you last part I worship Shiva as my Prabhu father sometimes I feel that I and my father are different but sometimes I feel we are one but I want him as my Prabhu which one will I choose or is it okay the Prabhu means the master so that is a different way of thinking as a father he is of course a guide but at the same time a close one so a servant is afraid of his master but the son is not afraid of his father do he is a careful of handling the father father may be angry Etc so it depends on your mind but as I said the Shiva is nothing but unselfishness try to develop that thank you very much srinivas had asked you
