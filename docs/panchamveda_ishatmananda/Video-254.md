[255: Panchama Veda 255 : By What Kind of work can One Realize God?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxuZhy8HKe4)

good evening dear devotees and friends today is the maha panchami day in america and it must be the shasti in india so we will study the the gospel of krishna the panchama veda the page number the 6 45 i am going to read in the 644 45 46 these are the pages the some of you are writing that what are the page number these are the page number you can follow from here so let us begin with this mantra krishna he is talking with the devotees the last time we read suddenly ram his nephew who is too attained on him he came to visit because the then the landlord the owner trailer kawabu asked him to get away from the dakshinesha so israel was not allowed to enter into that property sram krishna went up to the dirt gate main gate and talked to him and said so what to do i'm sorry then he said though he used to serve him a lot but he used to put different problems also because he became very egoistic he started thinking that i am serving and hence you are surviving if i am not serving then where you'll be so this is the mistake that a human they do it is god god gave us the opportunity to serve but we forget that is maya that if he was living with bhagavan the god himself even then and so many years and he was physically serving him even then he could not understand so how to explain it this is the maya even so close if we are with the god we cannot understand that is god arjuna also could not recognize sri krishna and here we find this person and then he could feel that something wrong he has done but so much of attraction for the worldly life the god has created this world god is out of this world now the two things that he has given to me us one is god himself another his creation this world the world of full of many different things and we feel that if we can achieve this we will be happy just now half an hour before i was giving a retreat a talk in the north carolina people devotees and the subject was happiness so this is the happiness whatever we think whatever we desire we think if we get that it becomes successful to achieve that our desires are fulfilled we are going to be happy no so that is exactly what bhagavan's rama krishna is teaching us almost in every page everywhere in every conversation by in different ways he's trying to teach us you have to disassociate yourself with this world but live in this world only disassociate with them that is the technique we have to learn how to live in this world but we do without becoming worldly the worldliness should not be there and what is that worldliness desire to grab did a desire to pause us desire to have and why all this come because of my ego and ego makes me completely associated with this body and mind and naturally with the body and mind this me and mine so this small little thing that we if we can understand then we are living in this world but very happy friends those who are those of you who are following that astabakra they're also ashtabakar's teaching that you should not be associated with this world and be happy yoga vashishta there also the bashist muni he is teaching his disciples ramachandra and telling that this is only one the god in everything so don't differentiate so that is a big ana drishti that this world is nothing but the god if we can understand that that is also and that the dualistic way we see god has become everything so how can i criticize how can i heart how can i do anything that is hurting god so that is the sadhana and in the bhagavad-gita it says there are three types of sadhana the sattik rajya sikha manasika control of the torque the control of the tongue mana seeker sadhana these are the way slowly in different scripture they are giving us the way how to proceed towards this wonderful situation where we will see that we are nothing but god sirama krishna is talking with everything depends on god's will now when we are differentiating us from god everything depends on god's will and majority of us we cannot think that i am that i am that supreme god no it is very difficult and if we say just like that it will be hypocrisy and truly if we are thinking you know it is god and everything is god's i am his son i am his daughter i am a servant i am his friend all these relations we develop that is also the man can work iman man must work only then he can see god the work must practice austerity that is called work and what type of austerity in the bhagavad-gita in the that a 17-8 chapter it says you have to control your tongue guru prague and when all these elderly people the knowledgeable people the respected people we should serve them physical tapasya controlling the words i should not hurt anyone by telling anything harsh any using harsh words always positive thinking everything belongs to god so kaika physical and through the word and also through thought every time i must be conscious and that is why it says abrama always be alert why because i am going to realize the truth i cannot become i said today morning i am good and then noon time i'm doing something whatever that cannot be each and every moment you have to be careful if you want butter you must let the milk turn to curd or yogurt so that is the last time we read sirama krishna was giving the example you have to go away you have to sit somewhere you have to go on studying your own mind then you have to practice so this is the way the development comes how much of the scriptures can you read the master is telling to the the there are some type sometimes it is that we take the fancy of reading different scriptures that is not the spiritual austerity that is not the sadhana sadhana is completely different the spiritual austerity every time my mind should be alert am i doing those things which will help me to realize god going on reading the scriptures and and there's so many thousands of scriptures are there and particularly the sanatana dharma the hindu dharma it is having so many varieties of scriptures even if you go on through the list it will take two three days there are so many 108 upanishads then 18 the puranas the mahabharata the ramayana then again the tantra the books of tantra bhagavata so much unthinkable one cannot complete it the four vedas impossible then what should we do take that that's why bhagavan's rama krishna is telling how much of the scriptures can you read what will you gain by mere reasoning try to realize god before anything else have faith in the guru's words and work and what is the work have faith in the guru's words bhagavan sram krishna himself is the guru in the ramakrishna mission we never considered ourselves as guru we give the mantra that has been that has come down traditionally and we give that mantra and begging to the supreme lord bhagavan si ramakrishna to take care of that particular soul he is the guru in reality and he's the god he is the guru he's the guide ma saridamani devi also is telling that the guru and what if the guru says this you have to work or what is that work always alert that your mind should not go to the worldly things and what is the worldly things love and attachment to those things which are temporary considering them as permanent this is the worldly things means i should not eat i should not talk to anyone i should not go to these i should not do that not like that suramar krishna himself used to go to the theater in those days and there all these dramas this to have used to go and enjoy that and he used to go to different places even the the museums used to go and that time in calcutta all the new scientific museums were coming up he used to go and visit used to see and he they also used to analyze look at this the human the skeleton what is there in the skeleton all these bones are there and on the bones they will place some and the flesh and then these they slowly slowly then he will give the example how the potters are making the images the gods and goddesses for every place used to go but used to spiritualize that particular place or the incident that happened over there so that is called living in this world but not of the world and if you go on reading the books you may enjoy but ultimately you are not reaching anywhere that's why bhagavan's rama krishna is telling what will you learn of god from books as long as you are at a distance from the marketplace you hear only an indistinct roar if you have visited the village market and all other places only the that open nothing is there and in the villages when you are slowly going you can hear the sound that means many people gathered in one place so when you are from distance it is like that and slowly but it is quite different when you were actually there when you entered into that from distance you hear only the sound but when you enter into the market though the people are talking shouting and then in the marketplace what they do all the sounds are there but you don't listen to that because your attention will be to find out that particular shop where you will you can get your particular item for which you have gone to the market so that is the thing then you hear and see everything distinctly you hear people say here are your potatoes take them and give me the money everything in details from a distance you hear only the rumbling noise of the ocean go near and go near it and you will see many boats sailing about birds crying waves rolling one cannot get true feeling about god from the study of the books this feeling is something very different from book learning books scriptures and science appear as mere dirt and straw after the realization of god now when we look at a map oh this is the africa then i can go to that africa like this like this so when you see the africa that particular map is nothing but when you go over there is completely different the people the places and all the environment that everything is so different so realization and intellectual understanding are completely different that is exactly what bhagavan suramar krishna is trying to say that if you go on reading books only intellectually you will go on understanding it may be like this it may be like that like reading the maps studying the map but if you go to that particular place visit that place meet those people that realization has now compared with the map map cannot give you the one thing needful is to be introduced to the master of house the there why are you so anxious to know beforehand how many houses and gardens and how many government securities the master possesses the master means maybe a rich man and if you want to know about his property if you go and develop a relationship a friendliness he himself will show then he's telling the servants of the house would not allow you even to approach these and they would certainly not tell you about their masters investments therefore somehow or other become acquainted with the master even if you have to jump over the fence or take a few punches from the servants so he is telling that somehow you have to meet the master and he's just describing suppose they are not opening the main gate so you may have to scale the wall and maybe that the solvents will beat you they will punish you even then somehow or other go to the god here it is not like that but the intensity eagerness to meet the master there may be many difficulties when you are trying to realize god there will be people in the beginning they will say oh it is not possible they will never allow you you are not doing anything not harming anyone you are only living in your own room even then the neighbors the why this man is not coming out why he is not mixing with us why is not playing cards with us we are we are all one type and why he is different constantly that they will go on criticizing you if you are meditating some people will say oh maybe that he's developing black magic let us go and protest earth these things will happen then slowly slowly a time will come they will start ignoring you but lastly they will go on accepting you so these are the three steps in the beginning the physically mentally or your neighbors your the all people and they will be against then afterwards they will simply not caring for you there is also another way that you are thinking oh i don't have any friend whom to talk where to go so these are the the surama krishnas you have to go on pursuing there may be many difficulties you have to go on pursuing the servants of the house would not allow you to approach and therefore somehow or other become acquainted with the master even if you have to jump over the fence or take a few punches from the servants then the master himself will tell you all about his house and guardians and his government securities and what is more the servants and the doorkeeper will salute you when you are known to the master he is giving an and a picture how to realize and but the third step when you have reached to the god started feeling about god then all they will come and they will start respecting you and that our when the ramakrishna mission was forming in those days in the beginning it was exactly this and the great uh the mind saradanandaji swami saradananda one of the direct disciples of bhagavan's ramakrishna and in his the great book the my the master the great master he has written this when organization spiritual organization is growing up the people around they were not understanding what actually they are doing most of the time they are very humble people not disturbing anyone and not forget about going to the people and disturbing them they were living together meditating in their from the early morning all this thing but they were not happy they were protesting complaining to the polish company to the government officers against them so many things happened there he has written these three steps you have to overcome for the individual life and organizational life first is the opposition second the completely ignoring third acceptance a third step for an individual is very difficult and if the people start coming and appreciating you and praising you the ego may come back the ego that through the spiritual practice that we have eradicated that may come back that he is telling devotee now the question is how to become acquainted with the master they all are laughing then obviously the question is that is we know that we have to go to the master but how a surama krishna that is why i say that work is necessary he says that that is why i say the work is necessary it will not do to say that god exists and then idle away your time no you must reach god somehow or other call on him in solitude and pray to him o lord reveal thy self to me live for him with a longing heart your roam about in search of the many things of this world like a madman now be a little mad for god let people say this man has lost his aid for god why not renounce everything for a few days and call on god in solitude that is advice leave everything and go to solitude and call on god friends this is a very practical advice majority of the time we are with the association and when in the association different type of discussion comes thought waves that touches our heart and naturally different type of the thoughts arises in the mind but if we go to a place from if we become this telling better go to a place where people don't know you so obviously there will be no one to come to you to talk to you or to help you so when you are in that challenging condition your dependence on the god will increase that all the the ways they say but in the household of life as bhagavan siddharama krishna in other way he said he's talking with the householder take a few days off go to a solitude even if you are going with your friend or wife go with them but to the condition that today i am not going to talk at all both of the same mind there will be the breakfast that will be the lunch time that will be this everything will be ready just warm it and eat but not going to exchange any word okay try that and go see it under a tree take a chair and sit in the open just look at the sky try to think that what is your mind is going one day and one night next day okay you will feel the difference so that is what bhagavan's ramakrishna is telling that you will feel the difference if you once you do like that then increase it to three days increase it to a week 15 days that will be sufficient a change will come when you can leave all alone in the company of god not that you are going on texting or in the computer or the smartphone nothing will be there only yourself maybe some of the good books and you are chanting the bhagavad-gita or some other chanting but that's much so that is the way if you are then you are taking the walking in the afternoon every step you have to take the name of god every step and that is the way you are practicing in the householder's life so nascenes are supposed to be all the time but in the householder's life also you have to live like this we are in the organization in the ramakrishna mission we are in the organization and that is the reason we have to keep some touch with the society we hear the news or movie what is happening or everything and read the newspaper all around what are the things are happening because we don't go out to the society to mix with people we don't know anything but is an organization so obviously you have to be alert and this time we organized a durga puja us to me that that is saturday everything was arranged our volunteers worked day and night and different type of people they registered as because the system was up to 50 people you can take the inside so we counted 50 people the slot was made and we requested the devotees also we cannot uh either break it you have to come register otherwise sorry our very close known people we had to say sorry to them everything was ready and prashad was ordered flowers were ordered everything was ready and suddenly yesterday the news came that the governor he has restricted this norm and from 50 to it has become 25 then again it if you are not connected with all this how he will know the people should write to you immediately you go to the link open that check it it is yes then in the mornings we have to talk to those office you confirm so those who are in the organization have to keep the touch with the society because we are going to serve the society 250 people the registered half an hour half in our time now we have to say sorry we had to write to them that sorry we cannot perform it will be puja will be there you have to enjoy it join the puja online according to the situation what to do we have to cooperate with the government because they are trying to help us there there's a terrible thing going on the kawaii 19 the terrible thing is going on so we have to cooperate with the government and the best way they are thinking they're also human being they also do not know what is going to happen only the scientists and the doctors they are thinking that if we can keep people away not much of mixing then we can save people they are not going to punish us they are going to save us so we have to cooperate this time okay the mother wants our puja like this we will do like that so this is the way we are going but at the same time we are not of this world so this is the the trick that's why bhagavatam krishna said understand that vedanta knowledge that there is only one all-pervading consciousness and nothing else and everything that is happening all around you so much of tension so much of these and that all is temporary after after few days everything will go away so don't disturb yourself you have to constantly go on towards god so this again and again is telling what you will achieve by simply saying the god exists and doing nothing about it there are big fish in the haldar pukur that's a the pond he is mentioning is birthplace but can you catch them by merely sitting ugly on the bank of the pond prepare some spiced bait and throw into that lake then the fish will come from the deep water and you will see the ripples that will make you happy perhaps a fish will jump with a splash and you will get a glimpse of it then you will be so glad so how a very another rustic way very simple way that he is giving us the example the pond is nothing but our mind at the fishes that fish that he is talking about our soul and we are trying to catch our soul but that mind itself is so much turbulent so you have to wait wait wait and go on giving feeding with the name of god then when we are going on throwing the name of god and slowly slowly that the particular that atman it will come and then it will bite before that if you are before the realization before catching the fish you can get the joy when the ripples will come on the water then you can feel oh that that is true big fish is there that is the joy when you are meditating trying to control your passion trying to control your desires and your mind is becoming tranquil then you will enjoy oh that is so good without anything i was happy that must be there that is something is there otherwise how the happiness will come then ultimately you see the glimpses will come the light will flash you can see the god sitting on a beautiful throne within your heart and you can see you are serving the god and that way and slowly slow it maybe for a second maybe for a minute maybe one day maybe after three months again a little but you are sure that something is going to happen and with great patience you are sitting over there to catch the fish and that is the way one goes for that is the beautiful way bhagavan's ramakrishna is milk must be turned into yogurt and the yogurt must be churned only then you will get barter to mahimna what a nuisance someone must show god to a man while he himself sits idly by all the while someone must extract the barter and hold it in front of his mouth all are laughing what a bother someone else must catch the fish and give it to him sometimes some people they think the guru will do everything no it is not possible that's why bhagavan suramar krishna is telling it it's not but of course sudama krishna the avatar of the god himself they can't do it suramar krishna could do it sirang krishna did also mashaladhamani devi they truly did it but this is the way he is telling that you have to strive you have to practice now friends you know all over the particular in india the spiritual people our devotees they are householders but so eager yesterday someone told swamiji i am going to practice 2000 japan after 12 because they say night 12 o'clock is a very good time for meditation and if you are repeating the name of god and meditating you will be benefited mostly at particular time from 12 to 2 noon time also 12 to 2 a night is much good so that she was telling that i am going to practice see how eager the whole day work and then again keeping that at the vigil that somehow i should be awake and from 12 to 2 i should do the job then i will go to sleep this is the determination this is the practices and this is what suramar krishna is doing work you have to work what means this type of practices a man wanted to see the king the king lived in the inner court of the palace beyond seven gates no sooner did the man pass the gate fast gate then he exclaimed oh where is the king but there were seven gates and they must pass them one after another before he could see the king this is the shabta bhumi he's hinting about the sapta bhumi in the yoga there are sapta bhumi and also gyana there are sapta bhumi and in the bhakti also the sapta bhumi's are there the seven stages so when we join the the monastic order then the people they are curious hey why you have come like this it goes on and that is the fast gate then second slowly slowly you are seeing no this all so good people everything is so nice very simple no tension so you are passing through through through through and the more you are proceeding more you see the glamour of god so many things will happen people will come and praise you they'll be eager to touch you they will be eager to give you some gift they'll be eager to listen to you to talk to you one must be very careful oh no this is not the final gate i'm just proceeding so one two three four like that it will go and one day you will feel totally distaste this world will become completely testless the name fame and all his beauties tasteless and he will be eager to listen to the voice of god listen to the celestial songs and see those celestials the beau the beings the gods and goddesses that is the sixth bhumi and finally marching with that in the joy that is there and that's called the god himself or the brahmana himself complete joy to it this is to attain god the master is telling it's not that god can be realized by this work and not by that the vision of god depends on his grace still a man must work a little with longing for god in his heart if he has longing he will receive the grace of god here sudama krishna is eunuch that some people are thinking only by discrimination only by analytical way only by following the path of the gyana the i should read only ashtavakra i should read only the yoga bar sister and the panchodashi all the books the ghana knowledge that i will read the vedantic book by that way i will realize the god of course you can but not that those who are following the path of devotion they are crying to god praying to god cooking for god and that one lady she had sent the photo and she worked for many hours to put a new shoddy the the women's dress indian's women's dress to put on that small photo it's a big shoddy but very nicely she did it and then she was so happy she also made some the girl end of some you know that plastic things but it know it looks good and that she has put to the mother mud sardamani devi and she took the photo and sent it to me and she's so happy is it not the god the company of god and she was telling it took me three to four hours i couldn't manage that heavy and big shoddy how to put it then ultimately i was praying to mother the mother i don't know how to put it on you and you should look good i feel that you know that the tradition in the hindu that this is the time the durga puja navaratri they will purchase the new clothes and exchange the new clothes give it to god also so that that is the joy one who is discriminating another who is meditating and third one he is putting that long cloth the shoddy to that frame of the photo but the joy is the same and much more when she failed as if mother was telling why don't you put the shade in this form and she kept in that way it is thought only crossed her mind she did that and failed as the mother whispered to her and she was so happy isn't that the happiness of spirituality this is the spirituality someone is cooking and giving it to the mother and when they are there praying to mother suddenly a flower fell down on that particular plate and they feel mother accepted it okay sometimes people may laugh oh look at this they're all superstitious no why they get the joy the inspiration and more and more service for the mother service for the god so that is also increasing this is the way one goes on that is why sirama krishna is telling that it is not that god can be realized by this work what means a path and not by that but the vision of god according to the vish ramakrishna the vision of god it depends on his grace we feel the god is around us the god is always with us something which i was thinking that is not going to happen to me some more other some people came helped you you can feel that god is helping you it is possible but at the same time if you see god please reveal thyself before me that depends on him whether the god will reveal himself but still a man can work to attain god a man must have certain favorable conditions the company of the holy man discrimination and the blessings of a real teacher the three things company of the holy man this is very very important most of the time we go to the people they're very popular and they dress up like that and they are very good talkers they can talk nicely as because they are having the command of the sub the the language and they will be pawning they'll be using utilizing that language in such a way that people are mesmerized it may be but the good teachers are entertainer of course the good teachers are entertainers but all entertainers are not good teachers the sudama krishna is to talk and people is to go mad listening to that that was the entertainment used to sing used to talk he used to dance he was a very good entertainer but not that all entertainers can be a good teacher that one should be careful and it depends on the past work also past karma the past karma fella and he'll be associated with a good person and who is a good person unselfish person i'm only having love to help you to guide you to give you the informations about god that is a good person and no personal agenda no hidden agenda is purely unselfish so that is ramakrishna is telling to attain god man must have certain favorable condition the company of the holy man the capacity to understand that discrimination the analytical capacity should be there majority of the people they don't have that analytical capacity they only judge from outside from other things no and thirdly the blessings of the real teacher the sadha guru what is that reality teacher god himself if the god himself is blessing that's why in the shankaracharya also said that as if without the blessings of god these three cannot come so when those who are really good people they get these three then he is telling perhaps his elder brother takes the responsibility for the family perhaps his wife has spiritual qualities and is very virtuous perhaps he is not married at all or entangled in worldly life he succeeds when conditions like these are fulfilled the bachelor people they're free they don't have the responsibility so that way they are they can match all the money they be said those who are bachelor the 50 percent you have already completed because the bondage so that is the reason and those who are married as because you are already taken the promises so that is your dharma to keep those promises to take care of the wife take care of the children take care of the family that is you you have to do that and along with that luckily if the wife is cooperating with you then he's very good but if the wife is not cooperating sometimes the wife is completely different she wants to go to social life dancing eating or maybe there may be another type of that she is attracted to or attached to some other uh type of practices when the husband is another so both of them are different then also problem comes but if both of them coming into one person are guided by the one person following the one path is very good but i have seen the husband wife husband is vedantin the wife is a completely vaishnava but let's go okay they're adjusting in their own house that is good it goes on like this so that is an adjustment you made but when both of you are in the same that is good so that is the ramakrishna is telling you need some favorable conditions so these are the conditions he succeeds when conditions like these are fulfilled in a certain family a man lays seriously ill he was the point he was at the point of death someone said here is a remedy but it must rain when the star swati is in the ascendant the star shati then some of that rain water must collect in a human skull then a frog must come there and the snake must chase it and as the frog is about to be beaten by the snake it must jump away and the poison of the snake must drop into the skull all these conditions you must prepare a medicine from this poison and give it to the patient then he will leave the head of the family consulted the almanac about the and set out at the right moment with the great longing of the heart he began to search for the different ingredients and he prayed to god o lord i shall succeed only if you bring together all the ingredients so this is the support of the god oh god i'll be successful if you only help me as he was roaming about he actually saw his call lying on the ground slowly presently there came a shower of rain then the man exclaimed oh gracious lord i have got the rain water under shaati and the skull too what is more some of the rain has fallen into the skull now be kind enough to bring together the other ingredients he was reflecting with a yearning heart when he saw a poisonous snake approaching his joy knew no bounds he became so excited that he could feel that the thumbing of his own heart oh god he prayed now the snake has come too i have procreate most of the ingredients please be gracious and give me the remaining one no sooner did he pray thus then a frog hopped up the snake pursued it as they came near the skull and the snake was about to bite the frog the frog jumped over the skull and the snake's poison fell into the skull into it a man began to dance the man began to dance clapping with hands for joy so i say that one gets everything through yearning through the prayer prayer prayer when one is very eager god also help so that is what bhagavan suramar krishna is telling friends without the help of god without the help of the destiny nothing can happen but because of your ego we forget that and we always think that we are doing it in the quinoa punished that is the first time they mentioned about the goddess durga uma himavati there he say that explain that the devas they vanquished in a one in one war at the ashuras and they were they became very boastful and indra was celebrating the victory then one yaksa came and he said he didn't say anything he was standing near the door and the the the from the throne indra noticed it and sent for us the bayou why you came and he asked who are you sir i will tell that i will introduce but who are you then naturally why you failed insult you don't know me i am the great by you and what is your work what is your power oh i can blow anything and the man kept a straw and said can you please blow these and the wind god tried so much but couldn't remove that straw then second came also the agni the fire he also could not burn it so that is the way the god always teaches us the supreme lord then came that the power of the supreme god the muhammad in the form of the uma uma haimabati in the upanishad also they are praying to the goddess friends this now the durga puja is going on it's a great festival and what is this the power worship what is that power the primal power the primal energy god's power out of which everything has come and what is that god's power it they the all the rishis they say it is having three qualities satya raja and tama through the permutation and combination is going on creating things then it has the two power also that is one to cover another to remove that cover superimpose on that cover so like this is called maya and that is the power of god associated with god eternal like the goddess because the god's power but the god has no end maya has in the beginning maya no beginning it is eternal but my eyes ain't when when by the grace of god we can understand it is not true the god is only playing with me the sometimes the father will put on a mask and will go to the little baby and frighten baby will start crying and then the father will remove the mask and will say here i am son why you are crying so it is like that the god is like to play with us he is putting putting all the trouble and that is the power now we are worshiping to that power and the power has been given as the conception of mother mother is always kind mother is always helpful mother is always considerate mother is always soft that's why the hindus they call the power of god as mother they be and this debi is known as the durga or sometimes mahamaya the 55 names are there in different names and different forms in different times is saving the children so we are we should pray to the divine mother before the sri ramacandra he went to fight with the ravana then is he worshipped the goddess durga for the strength give me power mother and be by my side help me in this great war with the ravana before the kurukshetra war arjuna also worshiped goddess durga and pray to that mother mother please bless me so that i can be i can be successful in this huge war so every time we see that the power is necessary caitanya mahaprabhu is considering this power and the sri ganesha and in the india everywhere and those who are worshiping the power they are known as shakhtar because the power the sanskrit name of the power is shakti and those who are worshiping this shakthi are known as shakta so this is the time if we are praying to the mother why because special time the whole month particularly these five days today's panchami shasti shami this five days then if we can do it on the namomi day nami night the mother is slaying the ashura and where's this ashura all our bad desires kama kroda loba matsuriya and our desire and our that the thing the devotion is covered under this and if you can remove it the ashura will go away and what is this ashura the darkness the ignorance the ego if it goes away then the knowledge will dawn and that is exactly what bhagavan suramar krishna is teaching us a man cannot realize god unless he renounces everything mentally everything mentally we have to renounce a sadhu cannot lay things up and then he is telling if we cannot physically if we cannot renounce at least mentally there should not be any attachment with it so that is the thing otherwise it is impossible to realize god mean mentally we have to renounce it i'm having a car i'm having a house i am having a property i am having the money as long as i am there i must have that no problem but at the same time oh i should keep it for my next generation these that all calculation even before the lying on the deathbed the people are thinking more about the distribution of the property among is the the predecessors are the answer they that will be really very wrong so one should we draw the mind and say god you gave me my the power and so i was successful now all this left over that all belong to you i don't want all this i want only you and that if we can call that god as mother it becomes very easy to pray mother i like to be on your lap please hold me and give me the soulless give me the joy give me the happiness and let me see your own face that would be the prayer so renouncing this renouncement is necessary and this renounce means mentally that will also help thank you friends so there is one question one question roy is asking i would like to know how can i take diksha
