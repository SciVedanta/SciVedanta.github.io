[327. Where does God Exist ? - Panchama Veda(327)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vh256Rnl24s)

namaskar dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening let us start reading the panchama veda by chanting this mantra as usual while discussing with the devotees he remarked why doesn't man's mind dwell on god so he is asking this question and giving the reply also why doesn't man's mind dwell on god so immediately he is giving the answer you see more powerful than god is his maha maya the maha maya is power of illusion so that is he always feel that is more powerful oh we can understand that he's so powerful when you are thinking that we should do this but we can't do something or other in our thought it comes and it deludes us so much of ego so much of another as we call it the immediate emotion that makes us bound in this world where from it comes we don't know so that even then we are bound by this each and every one of us and very few can go beyond it so sometimes we feel like i feel like thinking in this way what is this maya that i am hearing some sound and i am thinking that inside the room there is a ghost the child is thinking in that way then a mother comes and says let us go and talk to the ghost so we both are there so don't be afraid and we'll go and talk to the ghost and she enters that room and put on the light there is nothing when you say you see there's nothing so you are imagining the ghost and then you are afraid and similarly we are imagining this whole world our friend our foe and all these relations and we are suffering and why because that imagination where from that imagination came the god's power mohammad why it is that is his play the divine play in sanskrit it called his leelah why leela that we cannot answer no one knows god himself divided into so many varieties and playing in his own way so that is the vedanta but how i an individual like to go out because at this moment i am thinking this body this name this mind belongs to me and i am suffering automatically i have to go beyond this how that is bhagavan si rama krishna is advising that you have to go beyond this more powerful than the judge is orderly say everyone is under the spill of the world beswitching maya and whose power god's power how can we go beyond this power by requesting god or realizing god with the help of god only god can save us from this terrible maya just imagining and suffering this is very peculiar sometimes we have seen the doctors are trying to help those people they are just imagining that somebody is criticizing somebody is trying to harm somebody is doing this all imagination they also sometimes feel but they cannot go beyond it that is the muhammad and he is telling in this way that he too comes under the spell when the god assumes a human body even the god assumes a human body is under the spell but there is a difference why he himself the god is playing him but any moment he can go out that he is telling the ishwara court is divine incarnations for instance can liberate themselves whenever they want to this is the difference jeevakoti ishwarakati what is the difference knowledge what is that knowledge the ishwara kurtis are the abutaras are the god and naturally the power of god is very much present in them and they are aware about this like the story the child and the mother both are entering into the dark room the mother knew that there is nothing the no ghost is there but the child was thinking ghost is there so that difference both are their mother and the child ishwara koti jivakati the child may be representing jivacartis and jivacartis the individual like us we are afraid of suffering afraid of death afraid of losing so afraid of failure so wherefore all these fears are coming imagination and there is actually nothing so that srama krishna is trying to this knowledge he's trying to give to us and how he is giving it ishara koti's divine incarnation for instance can liberate themselves whenever they want to but the jiva kurtis cannot jivos are imprisoned lost and gold this desire the terrible desire and to satisfy the desire money so this do binds them the again the girish ghost is mentioning if a man is so strongly tired and and food then what is his way what he will do now because of the maya the terrible maya that is controlling us the human being why human we are talking about the human being why not about the animals why not about the other species because we can understand that desire to go beyond these has not come in them this is only in the human mind that to a very few manuscripts means trying some time and who manusyana among the human being because they have the mind they have the thinking capacity they have the discommunity faculty they can judge they can understand even then among these group forget about other species among this group the human being only handful of you they want to know about god who is this creator why all this they think in that way and what happens afterwards manusyanam sahasri sukhasi they try to sit day they try to become successful successful to know yata tamaphi siddhyanam and those who are trying among them only a handful even among those small group a very microscopic people they will be able to success so that is the power of maya the delusion the so many people are trying in so many ways and they are actually deceiving themselves they are thinking this is the way i'm going to realize god and his ego slowly slowly cover and he thinks i am all right whatever i am thinking is all right so this is the problem that girish goes is stealing but our hands and feet are tired what do you will do then bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning he has nothing to fear if god himself as the guru cuts the chain of maya now here there is a chance as we were discussing the who whose power is this god's power who can control this terrible power god himself so what we should do what is that veda what is that knowledge what is the scripture this teaching that you have to go to that level where god will help you to go beyond this he will remove whatever the spell the maya it was there he will remove it and he will see oh it was all nothing was there i was unnecessarily afraid of all this and then what will come fearlessness abhayam abhaya means there is no fear at all why i'm not going to lose anything because i don't have anything to gain too so that condition is called god realized condition so who can do it bhagavan sri ramakrishna giving the hint he has nothing to fear if god himself as the guru cuts the chain of maya and master maha commenting is bhagavan srirama krishna hinting that he can cut the chain of maya as guru of course that is true the sudama krishna giving the hint and he's saying see if it is god then there is no problem if the god becomes the guru then there is no problem for you too and only we have to have the faith the srama krishna's way the path that we will come to know that next we are starting another chapter at rama's house it is saturday may 23 1885. sri ramakrishna was sitting in the drawing room of the ground floor of rama's house dr ramachandra so that is this it is a rama this ramchandra datto he was a doctor and he was very devoted to bhagavan si ramakrishna he was the one who is to tell people giving the lectures also in those days when suramar krishna was not that way popular are known to the people in those days is to say he is god he is avatar in his own way because of his tremendous faith he used to argue he must be the god otherwise it is impossible for him to so that is this this is rama this is rama's house suramar krishna also used to like him he was surrounded by the devotees and was conversing with them sri ramakrishna muhima sat in front of him im master masha to his left pultu bhabhanath nithya gopal haramohan and a few others sat around him it was about five o'clock in the afternoon the master inquired after several devotees about several devotees the master to suramar krishna to aim hasn't the younger naren arrived yet presently the younger nothing entered the room though when the master was incurring about him he entered so the picture that the masters our the mindanao gupta is drawing is so unique as if we are we can see the movie then like that the ceramic is sitting in the ground floor the drawing room people are around who is on the left who is on the right we so close to sir krishnas ramakrishna must be sitting on a higher something so near to him and all these people now slowly slowly other devotees are also coming krishna is a presently the young entered the room what about him who said sirama krishna kishari isn't girish gosh coming what about narendra so kishari girish narendra the sudama krishna remembering them and he wanted that they should be also be there this is the god's will sometimes now we don't see bhagavan sirama krishna he is within us inside us but when you go to the devotees house when we are discussing about the religion the i try to imagine as if the ramakrishna himself has come and all devotees are sitting surrounding him are trying to understand what is religion and he is guiding them and this panchama veda the gospel of krishna every word of it he only the guiding only the knowledge and unique way the veda they give only the aphorisms instructions that's much but here the who is the embodiment of veda that parama purusha that brahman in human form the knowledge in human form the truth in human form bhagavan sirama krishna he's seating and then he's inquiring about the devotees asking them to come why here that maya will be withdrawn from their minds he wants to help them it is is maya that has but some people they have understood it they like to go beyond this they are called in sanskrit mumuksu they are the true students of truth they like to know the truth and go beyond the suffering and god as guru at present bhagavan si ramakrishna helping them and he's encouraging about them and he is happy that they are coming where is kishari where his girish gosh is narendra a few minutes later narendra arrived and saluted ramakrishna sudama krishna to the devotee it would be fine if kedar were here he agrees with girish now sirama krishna that was a how he is to teach he will be asking the devotees to discuss among themselves within themselves so so that he will listen and then rectify or guide them the same way even today we are doing we have different type of other small small groups called study circles and we ask them that you better read some of you will read and and the others will discuss some will raise the question and others will answer try to answer if not then you better note down the christians and doubts and you call it one swamiji contact one swamiji and then discuss about that asks the question to the swamiji the one group is there in colorado they do in this way and many other places the minnesota and the nashville and all these places they study and then they question the answer discussions are there the same tradition but here the god himself and now we are taking the help of that god and his instructions which is now enshrined in this particular book called the gospel of siram krishna so we are reading from that book and trying to understand the religion properly rama had arranged a kitten with folded hands the musicians say to surama krishna said can i begin if you give the order so the suramar krishna said okay the musician started the kirtan kirtan is a specifically it is a description of lord krishna that is called kirtana now kali kritani is also there about the mother kali but the when it mentioned only kirtan it means is the song about the krishna but not only song is a storytelling time with the music that they will be describing what the lord krishna did and what happened and the all this so that is almost like graphically they will be giving you this telling you the story through music and melody so suramar krsna's listening to them as siddhan krishna heard the sound of the drum he went into a static mood while listening to the prelude of the kirtan he plunged into deep samadhi now we understand that prelude means they are going to give a particular portion the krishna he is now coming to meet the people of the raja dharma and then if this will happen that will happen they give a brief description about what they are going to sing and sometimes it will be all this the joyful and sometimes the krishna is leaving and that also painful all they will first say and then they will start describing and singing with those who have heard it this is really wonderful and those who can understand the language of course and that language not only language that there is a very special type of tunes are there when they are singing now here the moment they started telling the prelude immediately suramar krishna went into that samadhi why because the hints about that so this is called the mind is completely pure what is this purity there is no pulling back to the worldly things why i'm sitting with these people i have to talk to them and these are the things nothing like that the mind is completely free the moment he heard about that description his mind went into that particular time and he lost his present physical condition completely so that is called samadhi his mind is now into that condition where they are describing so deep samadhi he plunged he placed his leg on the lap of the nitta gopal one and who was sitting near him the devotee too was in an ecstatic mood she was weeping the other devotees looked on intently the devotees were watching bhagavan sri ramakrishna feel how a blessed they were so they could see the transformation how a human transforming into god we have seen the pictures we have seen the images that sometimes the they make the image of the shiva shiva meditating and we know or this is the posture this is the meditation but when we see a someone who is going into that deep samadhi that is eunuch he was talking with us and now suddenly as if he's dead his body is only left over there no sign of life where his mind has gone then again he will come back that was so we can that's why the bhagavan si ramakrishna means it is a really really unique character and no no when in the history of the spiritual spirituality we don't see these in anyone's life those who can understand the seriousness of this and master mashay giving us the casual description sirama krishna was there he drank the water he said okay start the music the moment they started the moment he heard immediately he went into ecstasy for getting the outer consciousness then when they were describing about the lord krishna and what he is going to do his mind was transported into that time the time of the lord krishna and from he was really weeping crying why because of the emotion because of the love then after that slowly he came back to regaining partial consciousness sirama krishna said from the nitya to the leela and from the lila to the nitya nikta and leela and leela to nitya now friends these are sanskrit words that this terminologies they use to mention one that is purely the brahman and pure brahman there's no activity at all that is called nitya and nitya can be again said the sat it is all existence and nothing is there no leela lila means different activities the leela represents this the universe this world these activities this samsara that we see that is called leela so many things are going on happening and nitya is completely nothing is there why because the satya raja tama these three qualities and completely equilibrium condition there is no changes those who are following the this like this lecture or having the background of the vedanta will understand that there are two conditions that there one stillness the consciousness is there of course that is conscious but no activity at all which has been wonderfully depicted in the lord shiva and kali the people that describe not knowingly properly the about the goddess kali killing these that is all stories but the true thing is the sheba is the pure consciousness inactive kali active to that same condition nikta and leela if we call the lord siva who is lying down as a dead person pure consciousness but no activity that is called nitya and the same consciousness when acting called kali so nitya leela we can say leela as the ma kali so srama krishna is mentioning it goes from here to there and there too here some of the vedantins absolute vedances like the ajata bada and all that they don't believe in the leela but bhagavan srirama krishna now we will note how he mentioned he said from the nitya that means the absolute to the leela then phenomena and from the leela from the activities to the nithya to the absolute beyond any activity and vedanta they say the whoever you may call it god or the brahman or the paramatma whatever it may be when it is without any activity the three gunas that they have noticed satya raja and tama the very good quality very bad quality and in between satya tama and raja that changes position immediately activity comes the leela is a full of that permutation and combination of these three qualities then along with that the two powers they will cover the actual thing original thing and superimpose something else on that it goes on when all these five is active that is called maya why is a word they have used and sometimes some other philosophers they call it prakriti but some differences are also there circle differences the maya so surama krishna is mentioning ever maya that when we are in the activity of course it is activity but of whom same god here slowly he will take us to that situation that position he is telling nitya and leela and what is your idea he is asking nit to gopal and nityogupal was a blessed one when the god was into in that form he was keeping his holy leg on him the feet on him and he was getting the touch obviously his mind got completely purified when the surama krishna is asking him what is your idea the from leela to nitya from nitya to leela what is your idea nityagabal said both are good both are good we will come to know what is sudama krishna's idea what suramar krishna thought about it then sadama krishna closed his eyes and said is it only this does god exist only when the eyes are closed and cease to exist when the eyes are open friends these are truly the very important words now majority of us almost all the human society they have developed a sort of philosophy a sort of practices we call it religion and we call it darshana or the philosophy whatever every corner every human species are having this without this it is impossible they cannot survive without religion and there they think in their own way some are very primitive type some are trying to develop but these vedanta is the highest form of that it is not boastfully that we are telling that this is the highest not the all this slowly slowly developing a group of people in the in the in india they got the opportunity to research and slowly they brought this into this height and then even then then some people were thinking that there is no creation at all like the ajato bada or jaat you know some the virantin students they know this terminology or jaata it is not created some say it is created but like this like that etc that completely confused if the god is this or the creator is this which is there is no changes and from that one creator all these things have been created so who is creating how he is creating what is the material with which he is creating these questions it was asked long back in the rigveda time a few thousand years back people were asking this that is the human society constantly using their brain their intellect and then trying to understand the truth somehow surviving we have the money and then let us earn some money and then then someday we'll die and that is not the life of the human society human is completely different they are not satisfied with all this they want a permanent happiness and for that they are going pursuing and different type of spiritual leaders are coming giving them different ideas but the best and the easiest at present bhagavatam krishna and there he is mentioning that these and that must be the same because the creator has created this creation out of his own the one is the the leela and so many varieties variety came from what from that one so he is mentioning and mentioning in a different way he's mentioning if you close the eyes that means you are not looking at the world and his creation and his varieties and going back to the one is that only way the god is only there so today's discussion where does god exist the moment you ask this question to any religious group immediately they will point the finger to the upstairs the to the sky god lives over there god is not living here god is not living here the what is all this then god is only living in the sky god is only living in the temple in the churches in the synagogue where the god is leaving not outside that this is the way we have to understand this is a high time the 21st century the people are sending the rockets to the moon and they like to be there permanently the rockets are going to research the sun they're going so far and scaling one after another difficulties their intellect has become so sharp even then about the god if you are doubtful and then we say that god is only this much and not that that is your egoistic way of thinking whoever will say like that that's a bhagavan si rama krishna he's embracing each and everyone some people said it is good and good for them who like it it's okay but what is beautiful is this every moment of our life we are living as god with god sirama krishna is teaching this the does god exist only when the eyes are closed and cease to exist when the eyes are open the leela belongs to him age capital leela belongs to him to whom the nitta belongs see how he is explained that's why this is this book every page every line and so excellent and the highest teaching is giving you should do this this this this monday you should do like this tuesday you should do like this up to friday or saturday then you take rest all these sorts of things are there and we are bound and thinking that is the religion then after that what the lord of bhajans are there songs are there singing dancing closing our eyes and doing some gesture posture notice the understanding and the moment you understand that you become completely changed so friends we will continue with this ramakrishna's words he is telling the leela belongs to him to whom the nitta belongs and the nitta belongs to him to whom the leelah belongs to mahima my dear sir let me tell you mahima river sir both are according to the will of god when the surama krishna was wanted to talk this mahima charan is because he reads some scriptures and he used to feel and he used to think that he's a knowledgeable person he knows the scripture when sirama krishna is saying something interrupting him he mentioned this sirama krishna is mentioning to mahima my dear said let me tell you then there is a dash he wanted to continue this sentence before that the mahima said rivier said both are according to the will of god in the day just to express his opinion krishna some people climbed the seventh floor of a building and cannot get down suramar krishna never accepted that or never pay any heat to the statement that he mentioned it is belong to god it's just that way people are talking but what is that god it belongs to god and it says we love god what do you mean these are only simple words now sudama krishna is explaining and so wonderfully some people climb the seventh floor of the building and cannot get down but some climb up and then at will visit the lower floors who are more strong more acceptable those who have that capacity to go up and coming down this is the thing once you go up to god somehow withdrawing the mind closing your eyes not mixing with people avoiding them avoiding that i won't eat this i don't eat that oh he's eating this he's a sinner i don't talk to him so all these things we are going on doing and where we are going then sudama krishna said go up to the seventh floor and then you have the capacity to come down and he sees the ground floor and the top seventh floor and in between all the floors are made of the same thing that is his idea it is god is everywhere when the mind goes up as seventh floor he said means you know the yogis they say saptha bhumi then from the sapta bhumi the muladhara swadisthana then manipura and it like this it goes up to the sahasrara the sapta bhumi the seventh floor and when one goes to the seventh floor he goes over there he can't come down that much is capacity but suramar krishna wants us to be god himself we go over there and then we march into no not like that he's telling you should have the capacity to come down because there is no fear of losing each and everything the muladhara and the sahasara belongs to the same god everywhere this god uddhava say to the gopis he whom you address as krishna dwells in all beings it is he alone who has become the universe and is living beings buddha was a ghani ghani means those who go through the path of knowledge so he is mentioning to the gopis gopis means the the in the in the they were all devoted to krishna and uddha were giving the advice the whom you are talking like the krishna actually he dwells in all beings that means he is the paramatma his atma dwells on all being in all being he alone who has become the universe and it's living being when the krishna was there a few people could understand him that he is the paramatma and he is that param brahma in the human form very few majority of the people couldn't but at the time of ramacandra very few because the condition mind's conditioned the god means something very big very powerful and somewhere in the sky he leaves like that some conception then slowly slowly as the intellect is developing and realizations developing they came to know that that power about which we say that the god it can take the human form can be with us a few the krishna could understand they could understand lord krishna the this is the way they hear the one person that's the great friend of krishna he is mentioning therefore i say does a man meditate on god only when his eyes are closed the only one time to after 24 hours maybe hardly one hours or two hours we are closing our eyes and meditating of course we should do that in the beginning that is the way we should learn but suramar krishna asked us not to stop over there 24 hours it should be the presence of god when you are talking with people working or giving a talk or doing something it's only god and god and god and god nothing else so this god conception should be always in every moment that is his teaching i say does a man meditate on god only when his eyes are closed doesn't he sees god anything of god when his eyes are open mahima i have a question to ask sir a lover of god needs nirvana sometime or other doesn't he now mahima reads some scriptural books particularly upanishads and he cannot come out because he is not accepting sirama krishna as the god himself as rama ramadatta he accepted mahima is taking time for him so he is arguing and he is constantly coming to that path of knowledge and his thinking is not that then suramar krishna is giving the answer it can't be said that bhaktas need nirvana according to some schools there is an eternal krishna and there are also his eternal devotees krishna is spirit embodied and his abode also is spirit embodied krishna is eternal and the devotees are also eternal krishna and the devotees are like the moon and the stars always near each other you yourself repeat now he is now giving the clue to the mohimacharan who was a little proud about his knowledge of advaita some people they feel in that way so muhima he was mentioning that what about the nirvana means completely cessation total annihilation of the ego and in reply sirama krishna gave the devotee and the lord they are also eternal and that eternal is the self also sat chit ananda sat means eternal eternal existence so obviously when your ego is completely gone then only you will see god and the god in the form of krishna and you feel that you are with him and you are same knowledge but you are enjoying you are not merging so this sudama krishna is indicating mahima's he is asking that is also true it is possible but so why that you can't get the enjoyment when you are with the god so he is mentioning this then he is mentioning what need is their opinions if god is seen within and without if god is seen within and without anta yeti if i see the god inside and outside why i need the penance then again it says and if i don't see the god the manifestation of god the divinity inside and outside then what is the use of doing it penances beautifully it mentioned and it goes on saying like this [Music] go to the knowledge to the shankara is the embodiment of the knowledge and he will tell you what he was searching everything is that and only with that knowledge you can go beyond the bondage of birth and death so suramar krishna is just giving the hint what need is there of penance if god is seen within and without it you have already received it then what is the use of it then one of we have heard and i told you many times then the in beluremont when the condition the economical condition was very poor then the swadhus were not getting the monks when not getting proper food the sometimes the doctor will prescribe a glass of milk and say and they will bring that prescription and show it to the in charge of the kitchen we call them bhandari and the bhandari maharaja you say oh you need a glass of milk of course doctor has prescribed then he will give a glass of milk and he will sit before him and ask drink drink then he's drinking when he has finished the glass half glass are you getting the strength a glass of milk means what for a few few days you have to drink but bhandari maharaja knew that the situation you won't be able to provide that as a doctor has prescribed he will do that and he will ask him and after drinking have you got the strength he said yes mara if he says no oh you know you see you have drank the whole glass of milk and you have not got back the strength so if he says yes you say oh you have got back that strength so no more milk and if he says no oh is of no use even after finishing the whole glass you are not getting the strength so that the funny story stories are still there for that we are here in our time it was not like that it's much earlier very very poverty-stricken time but they were very joyful people these two have fun like that you have already realized the god inside and outside why then the austerity and if you have not then why the austerity so this is the way they always discussed and then srama krishna is mentioning the the devotees listen silently to the master and sramakrishnan laughing what is the thing you enjoy most mahima smiling nothing sir i like mangoes mahima is trying to avoid you see you can understand though he was sitting in front of god and this person starting the scripture to realize god in the form of brahman in the path of knowledge but he was not understanding when the sudama krishna wanted to know what is his idea instead of surrendering he said oh i don't know i like mango this is krishna didn't mention anything he liked him but he was like that master sirama krishna is smiling all by yourself or do you want to share them with others see this is the intellect of bhagavan si rama krishna this mahima and others they were well read well versed in the scripture and sirama krishna when he is talking with these people how wonderfully he is putting the words now i like to eat mango immediately he is asking all by yourself or like to share with others and mahima smiling i am not a not so anxious to give others a share i may as well eat them all by myself the master but do you know my attitude friends we will close over here this is the attitude of bhagavan sirama krishna and those who are following the path of bhagavan sirama krishna those who like to follow the path of sudama krishna so these he is the embodiment of the god in in person in the human form what is his attitude he said i accept both the nitta and the leelah the eternal and also the creation doesn't god exist if one looks around with eyes open after realizing him one knows that he is both the absolute and the universe it is he who is the indivisible saccidananda again it is he who has become the universe and its living beings one needs sadhana see that is the reason the ramakrishna mission when swami bibacan established he gives this he said that when you can see god by closing your eyes why can't you see god opening your eyes isha basham is the very first verse first line it mentioned isha medam servum each and everything there is no difference only the these are the holy thing these are the godly things all nothing like that this is the hinduism when you talk about hinduism we talk some people are becoming so narrow they don't know anything of hinduism and they are thinking all their ego and then they boost up their boasting in that way and they're thinking they're great in those nonsense they don't know about hinduism hinduism is excellent and when the that will die every all the best thing in the world even the human society will go away isha shamidam sarvam whatever you see is nothing but that god that is the knowledge of the rishis and the same knowledge in the present day in the modern time the god in the form of bhagavan srirama krishna describing do you know my attitude i accept both nithya and leela and that is the saccidananda whom you call sachidananda the ultimate goal of the gyanis he has become and bhagavan sri ramakrishna's teaching he gave it to swami vivekananda and swami bibegananda after becoming swami vivekananda when he went back to india he started a new monastic organization and he gave a beautiful goal and what is that atmana mokshatam in sanskrit and the both you have to realize yourself at the same time you should serve the humanity why because that is the living gods and goddesses you have to understand that this is the unique way the now 125th year of this organization ramakrishna mission this whole year they are celebrating so many different ways this type of ideas are explained defined by the holy monks and we have also celebrated here and we'll be continuing but this organization is unique because they are the first vivekananda he forced us to do this and this is because vivekananda's guru sirama krishna's idea was attitude was to see everything as god friends will stop over here and then the next day we will slowly go to another one neet sadhana he mentioned and then he will be mentioning that this is possible only by those who go to the holy person who are the holy person we will discuss about that so ashish is asking a question he's saying i have a question about hari nam lord hari has descended down for us in many forms for for us how is then that kitten is only identified with krishna those say krishna he became a very popular god as because he accepted different type of mental attitudes that sometimes you know that human being they like to love god as their children the santana bhava they will be having that and the ma jasoda used to love krishna according that then the bundu bhava as a friend then as a beloved as a lover then as a you know that master so like this so many other i think that other day the i gave the talk on this so all these five different attitudes of the human being that one can flow to the krishna so he became very popular god and the description about him obviously the different poets singers writers they wrote like that all are same but the krishna that attitude of the krishna or we can say the god who manifested as krishna became very popular first secondly the ordinary people can also come and accept that you don't need any other things for the vedanta you have to study you have to do for the krishna just take the name of god naturally many people and they become popular that is the reason rishikesh is asking when devotees around sri ramakrishna were in an aesthetic mood what terminology can be used to understand the devotees of sri rama krishna what terminology can be used to understand so that is the same terminology means they were also in that ecstatic mood they were also having that feeling when sirama krishna the god sitting and naturally whatever he his thought was there that was touching the hearts of the devotees that they also feel the same just now as i was reading the master master described when suramar krishna went into deep samadhi and all devotees also they were also the influenced by the same and they were enjoying the presence of the holiness and they were not talking they were gazing at the fa to the bhagavan srirama krishna and they were observing him and they was looking at god so naturally that they were feeling that joy we can say they too were in ecstatic mood miranda is asking why do we often get entangled in worldly affairs leaving japan and and dhyana aside it's very painful it pains my heart i pray to mother to save me from temptation good that that is the only way you know virendra because we are fighting against god's power we are trying to reach god but as if the some people they are they are just fighting with against us they won't allow us to reach to the master so what they they are the powers of god and that is called maya and today's discussion as bhagavatam krishna is mentioning only the master who's all this maya that's the only he can control so you are doing the best thing right thing praying to the god and in the form of mother mother is also in the the god in the form of mother you are praying to her and obviously when she will listen to the prayer you will find all these apparent things that is not allowing him to do the japan will all will go away you will get ample opportunity to jumper and meditation thank you aruba is asking as we are suffering from our karma why god has not given us good thought so out of the this is good and bad both god has given and he has given us the discriminative capacity also and he has seen the teachers also and he has given that the scriptures now it is we have to do that sometimes the bad thoughts are coming we have to fight against us our mind and how to fight bhagavan's ramakrishnan said at that moment you should loudly call and guard and dance and clap your hand and take the name of god then those thoughts will go away the moments those thoughts go away then you are free again so that is the way and that is called sadhana so this is the way it goes but once you understand this is only god then there'll be no problem are you just like a little baby never cares about what is happening around just sitting on the lap of the mother and enjoying whatever the mother is doing or giving to the baby the same way you have to think in that way that i am your little boy so please allow me to see it on your lap and protect me that should be the prayer and things will change thank you friends let us chant this mantra and conclude [Music] is [Music] [Music] namaste [Music]
