[301. Panchama Veda (301) - “Sri Ramakrishna and Vedanta”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EbM_Rl0PMD4)

so he is telling through the path of knowledge when said he is trying so he is thinking in one way and the path of another meditation is thinking in one way but he acquires a third kind of knowledge about god when god reveals himself to him that means the direct perception when the god is revealing himself then there will be no doubt everything will be very clear if god himself reveals to his devotee the nature of divine incarnation how he plays in human form then the devotee doesn't have to reason about the problem or need an explanation so that is exactly what happened with the bashadeva the bashadeva was meditating when the you know in the bhagavata the creation of the bhagavatam the the veda of yasha he was instructed by the narada they're not told that you won't get peace and listen until you spread the message of the lord in this way so after listening from the narada about the god then the veda biases meditated and in his that pure mind the whole thing was revealed by the god himself so there was no doubt there was no question so that is the reason when the people are meditating and the god is revealing himself that is exactly what this ramakrishna is telling and there will be no doubt do you know what it is uh like suppose a man is in a dark room he goes on robbing a match against a matchbox and all of a sudden light comes likewise if god gives us this flash of divine life all our doubts are destroyed so these are the example that and we all know in a dark room where there is no other thing but a matchbox we are trying to light that that means we are going on trying to realize god every day we are meditating we are praying to god reading the holy books listening to the different discourses and going on in that way suddenly and we are asking the swamis we are asking the the people who are expounding the scriptures they said what type is a realization when the god comes what happens all this inquisitiveness but the moment when you are going on trying trying entering suddenly if flash and then there is no doubt the completely whole everything is very very clear so this is what suramar is mentioning that means then aparaksha anubhuti is not depending on anything any explanation any help anything direct realization but now the question those who are not completely having the faith is it true the god will come then for them it is not when there is a complete conception complete faith that god can take any form and whatever form i like and i like to see him in that form he will reveal himself in that form sometimes i want to see god as mother the mother durga kali sharashati lakshmi any form and the same god will reveal in that or sometimes as the krishna rama shiva bhagavan vishnu in that form also so it depends on the person who is praying the atman the brahman is all pervading consciousness that is exactly what siddha krishna will mention he will give the hint in the next para it is all pervading it is all consciousness but for the betterment of the individual self it takes the form and it is true there is no question of doubting now how can you say no doubting because of the proof what is the proof do you mean that you have realized it no but in the proof there is called shabda and the shabda we can believe those people who have truly realized how can you believe them because of their life completely unselfish life full of love full of concern for others the people are suffering because they do not know the what to actually they should do and that is the way they are suffering and when they are suffering at that moment say we can say that the god is guiding them so this is the way we have to understand now here we find the god himself has come down and has taken the human form and he is going to house to house and explaining that this is the way you can realize god and what he is telling pray pray and pray when we look at that person his life is so pure so simple so open his only concern to guide those people who are suffering why they are suffering they want to get the joy but they are thinking that they will get that joy the permanent joy just by accepting the worldly things so this year things are going on discussions are going on surama krishna acts narendra to sit by his side he tenderly inquired about his health and showed him much affection narendra to the master why i have meditated on kali for three or four days but nothing has come of it and of course narendra's meditation is completely different in our meditation then we know that those who have read the biography of swami vivekananda even when just he was a child he was not knowing even he was not aware even at that time he used to see the light in between the two eyebrows and slowly slowly used to go into sleep why afterwards bhagavan suramar krishna explained he was a rishi is one of the seven great rishis who could restrain their individuality even in that cosmic place so that's saptha rishi the concept of the sabtarish in the hindu tradition sanatana tradition the one of them so obviously his mind was so pure and in one place ramakrishna very clearly mentioned that narendra rachal aburam they are pure they are already the realized soul but whatever they are doing only to teach others they are just taking birth in a family as we take then they are going to the school as we go they are growing up in the neighborhood as we do then they are slowly slowly all their behavior just like us suddenly not in their manifest it's a great power we say oh how it is possible the many of the at the contemporary of bhagavad-gita that's why they could not accept it why that boy was with us he used to come to us he used to sing in our houses why suddenly people are accepting him and no the manifestation they were not ordinary certainly ordinary person even sometimes our brahmacharyans who have joined under us we have seen they are growing up we used to guide them suddenly one of them is becoming great scholar it was there already in the past birth so by that with them it manifests so this is bhagavan sirama krishna knew this boy who is now talking in this way why i tried to meditate on goddess kali for last four or five days but nothing happened krishna didn't know hey what is this for only four days you are meditating and you were asking the success he never said like that rather he said all in good time my child then he is mentioning kali is none other than brahman that which is called brahman is really kali this is a revolutionary statement the kali is brahman and brahman is also kali the great philosophers they will have a great debate on this so what do you mean by this brahman how it can be the kali is it from the point of view of the non-dualistic or qualified non the qualified non-dualistic and or the from the dualistic view what you are mentioning there is a great debate it continues always whether rama krishna was a advaithin or vishishta advaitin whether he was a advaithin or vishishta dwaitin or duitin because he's to cry to for god he always wanted to uh pray to god and inspire people to pray to god so always it happened is he a duitin or sometimes he'll be telling so as just a few days before also he studied that if you have to get the complete weight of of a bell so you have to uh the bill fruit that you have to weigh with everything the the kernel and the shell and the seed everything then only so it is the conception of the uh qualified and uh non-developed thing the people will be but sirama krishna is beyond all this so we have heard the senior swamis they are mentioning he was beyond all these that's why sometimes he has mentioned that this experience of this mentioning him that suramar krishna has gone beyond the veda this is the veda is nothing but the experience of the rishis and suramar krishna said that he has experienced much much more than that charity sorry so this is the way when we look at it ramakrishna is mentioning the kali is brahman brahman and kali are not different he is again and again mentioning this brahman and kali are not different they are like fire and his power to burn if one thinks of fire one must think of its power to burn if one recognizes kali one must also recognize brahman again if one recognizes brahman one must recognize kali brahman and its power are identical it is brahman whom i address shakti or kali friends say those who have read the biography of krishna you know on this particular point he taught his own guru vedanti was not ready to accept the kali concept of kali most of the people in doses even today also they will be thinking the kali means he is cutting the aid of the people and all that but kali is nothing but the manifestation of the power the brahman when working that is called the power of brahman is kali now we will come to the some of the discussions maybe we will just mention over here while while we are discussing the gospel of surama krishna that totapuriji a vedantin a pure advaithin never believed in this but one day he felt terrible pain in his stomach and it was impossible he tried to meditate and he was a great yogi so obviously he could take out his mind from the body but that day he could not do that he tried hard then ultimately he was thinking see this body what is the use of this body for the realization of the brahman the atman i have already done it i have realized brahman now this body is giving me so much of pain that and that is why i cannot concentrate the mind so let me destroy this body and thinking in that way he thought that he will go down in the ganges and kill himself and make the committing suicide but that day the whole ganga the huge ganga at that time there was no water at all and the poor man was walking and the water was only knee-deep and he was a huge big person he couldn't do anything then standing over there he was when you were shouting what is this this is a great miracle there is no water in the ganges the sudama krishna then told him why you were not accepting the power the power the mother can do anything that means the power of that brahman can do anything it is possible you have to accept it and great totally accepted that and then only he went away shankaracharya the same thing happened with him the power and it that story goes in this way that one lady was sitting with a dead body her husband dead husband that shankara was supposed to go through that and you know in kashi and that's all narrow lanes that the famous the kashis lanes the shankara told the mother can you please take that dead body little one side so that i can go to the ganges then that lady told why don't you ask the dead body to move well i can understand that because your husband has passed away and you can't think properly how can a dead body move you have to take it and why you always say that everything is consciousness if that is so it is there's no power in the consciousness that can help the dead body to go away so why what is there then the shankara understood it that this is the power of god it is possible the power should be accepted as we accept the intellect the consciousness at the same time the same consciousness also manifesting and that manifestation according to bhagavan sirama krishna is the shakti the power of the kali so that is what he is mentioning over here so this is the one thing that we find and in bhagavan srama krishna also the same way gave this knowledge to his beloved disciple this narendra narada narendra not never accepted goddess kali because he was at that time influenced by the brahma samaj brahma samaj always is to say that it is only the parabrahma and nothing is there and these to criticize goddess kali a lot that's why in those days there's a mostly the educated people is to avoid the kali temples now and this narendra was also the member of the sadharan brahma samaj founded by the keshav chandrasen he never went to the kali temple and you know those who have read the biography and you know that a time came when the narendra suddenly they became poor they was not having any money so narendra was thinking what to do he tried his best to get a job he couldn't get anywhere no one could help him then ultimately he had to come to his guru the bhagavad-gita and he requested can you please request your mother you always say that if you pray the mother will listen can you please pray on my behalf so that i can get a job and you know that beautiful incident the great incident that changed that narendra to vivekananda this ramakrishna told why should i pray you better go you don't accept god kali that's why you are suffering go and pray then the narendra went and he saw it is not that only that image the stone image it was truly that goddess kali and instead of and he was a pure soul naturally he was not afraid sometimes people when they see the manifestation they always most of the people they have those who have the fast experience they said we are so much afraid he went and he saw the goddess kali the manifestation of the brahman in that form and he prayed not the job not the money not the social position but the knowledge and liberation that three times he did not one time not that the justice he went and he saw his his imagination not like that as because narendra was always the very very critic and everything he used to judge and then accept sirama krishna forced him to go thrice three times you go and pray go and pray grow and pray three times the same thing happened and there was no doubt then sudama krishna and he came back with great joy and when you are full of joy you like to sing to give that expression because there is so much wailing within the heart what to do you feel like shouting and then he came to suramar krishna and told can you please teach me a song that i can sing and what song siram krishna taught most of us we all know it was nothing but the advaitin advaita concept of the goddess kali that you are that tara sometimes you are in male form sometimes female form sometimes nothing you are sometimes white sometimes black sometimes yolo and something no color so this is the way that song goes it is the conception of the vedanta so their power and the intellect they are all the same so you know in the nasa here where from this uh conception of creation came the vedantin they always go to the nasa dear shukta this is a very famous uh the verse that has been composed and in the beginning i will only read three lines from the translation it says in the beginning there was neither not nor ought neither no nor yes whether it was there or it was not there no one knows so the moment you say it is not there that means the conception of that particular thing you are having some people when they say there is no god but they are indirectly accepting the existence of god because when you say god is not there it means what you have the conception of the god idea about god and then you don't find over here so you say the god is not there so that is why it says that in the beginning there was neither not nor art there was neither sky nor atmosphere also that means there was nothing and the expression this is the beauty how through words you are going to tell something which is unspeakable you cannot explain it is impossible it's only the the feeling is only the realization that the rishi who wrote that nasa it is not a composition that one after another he just chose the words and mentioned not like that that we can understand how difficult it was for him to express his own realization in true words in words and through words he was expressing there was neither sky the conception of the biuma boma means the space when the now the in the rockets people are going to the space and they're experiencing that nothing is there all around suddenly there'll be some the stars from the distance passing like that like that but how far it is everywhere wherever you look it goes goes goes and how big it is is there any end where the rocket can take me over there and oh this is the end of the whole space no that is called the bioma the sanskrit word broma means that space but unlimited so it says there was no neither sky nor atmosphere nothing was there above what then enshrouded all the streaming universe now he is asking this question and afterwards he will give the reply then where was this universe the rishi who is composing this or expressing his feeling his realization he is asking this question now when there was nothing where was this universe so there is a beautiful song in the in the followers of the goddess kali they are called shakta as because they are worshiping shakti the power it's not the knowledge those going for only for knowledge are called the bedan theme and it is the knowledge without any manifestation is brahman the brahman has to us but we will come to that so these are shakhtars and there is a great scholar and also a uh you can say a devotee of goddess kali and when he composed and he is asking this question when there was not this no universe was there where could you get the the skulls the mother the goddess kali those who have seen the picture you know that there's a human skulls and that's hanging as a girl so that the person is questioning but universe was not there human beings were not there how could you get those calls brahmanda chilona mundo mala kothai peli in bengali he is mentioning asking this question here also the same the vedantic rishi is asking this is from the rigveda the very fast spiritual book we can say the rig veda there it is asking what then enshrouded all the streaming universe there was only pure consciousness and nothing other than pure consciousness why they are mentioning pure consciousness they could simply mention but again and again repeating the word pure consciousness now the same consciousness when it will manifest will manifest its power what is that power three qualities satya raja and tama these are the three qualities that is called the power and these three qualities permutation combination so many things will come good bad at the at the middle so these are the things they'll go on so pure consciousness that is must be there that power must be there satya rajatham must be there but not manifested when the pure consciousness there is no manifestation and nothing was there then it says then there appeared the fast desire the fast desire is called the will the will of that consciousness now if you ask why no one can answer so the swami vivekananda nicely give this answer the hindus are bold enough to say we do not know why the desire came in the in that consciousness why the wave came in different language they expressed that that wave came in that it was a completely tranquil as if we can imagine you know the consciousness all pervading consciousness we cannot cannot imagine then we can imagine that must be a ocean and when you go to the deep sea and there is no ripple even if there is no strong wind no ripple even just water water water as if you can work on the water as because it is very deep the sunlight is going but cannot reflecting and coming back so the what is just like black water in indian language it will say kalapani the color means that black why black because the sunlight of course going but it is so deep it cannot come back with the reflection so that is why the more the shallow the water so the sunlight is coming back the different other colors come there's a deep black water and no repo as if you can walk on that in the daytime i i have traveled in that bay of bengal and then sailed over that i have that experience so i have seen the water in that way so there was nothing the pure consciousness suddenly a gusty wind comes and that without movement suddenly that water swells up huge the big big uh the all the water will come and the waves after waves where from it came desire what is the desire the wind here in the case of that the tranquil water of the ocean suddenly swelled up because of the wind and here it says the pure consciousness the fast desire came i'm alone i like to be many the moment that consciousness as if thought in that way that is called the seed of the creation and the power manifested and that is exactly what bhagavatam krishna said it is kali it is not you cannot differentiate it as you cannot differentiate the fire and the burning capacity of the fire can you we cannot so obviously it is just like that that desire that will that power the satya raja tama that is manifesting creating preserving and once again taking it back everything is happening the same way we can think the tranquil water of the ocean suddenly a desire came it swelled up and it came as a one after another the rose and then ultimate suddenly there is no wind it goes back to the water again and the same tranquil water not even the ripples forget about the waves so that is same way the creation manifestation sustenance and goes back to the same from where it came it goes back to the same so what is mukti for what for we have left our heart and home and trying to realize that brahman and we are constantly striving to get that understanding that this manifestation this body this mind and this name the form and all associated with all this is very very temporary as the waves of the ocean the big wave medium wave small wave and then the crest on the top of that wave there is a again the white crest is there that is also water and they will be as if if we can imagine and if some of the movie makers make it as the waves are competiting and they are telling see i am strong and i have the wonderful crown on my head then suddenly there was no wind the desire goes back and they all again go to the same water and where the big wave small wave nothing was there the this manifestation is same like that according to the viewpoint of the vedanta then sunama krishna is telling now as because you are within the realm of the maya the word maya means the power of god you have to accept this and in the beginning itself if you deny without the proper preparation no growth of spirituality will be there that is the idea why sudama krishna is telling this because of this this is the way it from the object object means non-manifestation and as an example again we can say there is no repo on the water of that ocean so ob means manifestation no manifestation what was there water what was there in the beginning consciousness how big it is unfathomable unmeasurable you cannot measure it is so big and that is the way it's called brahman the biggest everywhere binghati brahman this brahman is going on everywhere constantly growing on increasing as if the more you go it is there there there there there in a big field when you look we see the sky has come and met on one point on the field end of the age of the field now let us go and touch the sky over there if we try and you go go go go the more you go the more the sky and the field will also go back isn't it that is the experience regularly we get the same way the consciousness the brahman how big it is if the question is also a foolish question a wrong question unmeasurable you cannot you can immeasurably you cannot go and touch it anywhere anywhere so that then it comes and manifests itself and it says that manifestation is kali and when this is brahman neerguna there will be the hindus the traditional hindus they will say the surama krishna he is today giving the hint of the vedanta the brahman without any aspect aspect means no qualities and qualities means sattarara jatama and without the sattarajata no activity doing what is there nasa the asukta that rishi is asking where was this universe it was nowhere you cannot say yes you cannot say no what what you can say nothing unless that realization and after that realization you become full with joy but you cannot express that the then it comes swaguna then the manifestation comes the kali comes now you can go you can pray and you can talk you can pray for the vision everything all begins so here it says the it comes from the object and the means manifested first is the causal aspect cause anything happening must be a cause and the causal aspect is the ishwara brahman from that brahman the cause what is that cause the desire what is the desire i like to be many when that conception come in that this vedanta will give the name ishwara ishwara is entire potency latin in divinity that is the desire and that from the desire only all activity comes now we are here suddenly we felt oh let us go to assam place maybe it is so cold in chicago let us go to tampa that is a good place the desire come the desire only now i express that desire to the friends they also agree then we go to the airport purchase the ticket take a flight and go over there and enjoy everything comes after the desire and the desire is not manifested it is there in a subtle form that subtle form of the desire to become many in the if we can have the idea of the mind suppose the brahman has a mind suppose and there in that mind the desire has come i am all alone everywhere i like to be many the moment that shakti comes it is called ishwara that power comes that's called ishara it is our latent manifestation that is the individual that is called causal aspect then comes the hiranya garbha what is the hiranya hirano means golden as because you know that this philosophy that we are studying it is all from india and india was having lot of gold and in the ancient time then afterwards the people from different places of the world the people came they took out all that now not much but the indian you will find all this traditionally at the time of the vedic time also the gold was there and this particular the material was loved by everyone so they gave the name the gerva the um cosmic woon is like a gold egg hiranya garbha the cosmic egg the cosmic life that also not manifested subtle form first is the ishwara with just thinking that thought all potency is there then in a subtle way things have started taking shape subtle way not fully manifested and that is called hiranyagarbha or sutra atma two names the second stage that is called hiran nagarba and this causal state and then iranna garbha or the sutrathma or the cosmic spirit then the third step what is the third step gross aspect it's called biraat the fast is ishwara then hirano garbha or the sutratma and the manifested form is the bird totality of living things bhagavan si ramakrishna went to pluck a flower and suddenly he failed oh no i should not because all this flower garden as if worshiping the great god all pervading god in his language birated puja is the worshipping the all this garden is worshiping that great god pirate what is that virata is a sum total of all the manifested thing so this is the brahmana the nirguna and the brahmanas swagona what with quality and the same brahman is coming in this form and we understand that slowly slowly it is manifesting and it says the gross aspect is the biraat a subtle aspect and the causal aspect the it says in this way ishira is the causal aspect of the manifestation the atman is the foundation of the microcosm as seen from the individual point of view our own mind is not able to conceive god the individual comprises body and mind both finite and limited this individuality when given concrete form is called jiva and this jiva in turn can be classified under three distinct aspect first is cause the last big now we were that name that we give ishwara then hiran nagarwa then bidata it comes to individual now and the individual the name and form that is called jiba and the jiba case what is happening again three states what first is the causal aspect what is the causal aspect called pragya is the jiva during deep sleep and in the deep sleep in the susupti when there is no even dream what remains the consciousness but it is not original but the reflection but consciousness is there is a body and the mind cease to function at the time but still i remain there what is that i that is called pragya it is that knowledge it is that consciousness it is that that concept that is there i am there who am i that is the question goes on and that is me when the all the time the vedanti in asking who am i i am that consciousness how can i prove that i am the consciousness in your sushupti state what is the state when your body is not functioning because you are sleeping your mind is not functioning because you are not dreaming but still you are there and that is called the susupti state in sanskrit and exactly that is called prague against it then comes the subtle aspect what is the subtle aspect what is the state in the tradition that time the the dream state swapna it is not even the gross i'm lying down people are looking at me that i'm sleeping but i'm working a lot i'm dreaming i'm running i'm visiting i'm talking whole world is going on and sometimes in the dream we are those who are the speakers they are practicing their speeches they are thinking so many people are sitting before me i am giving the talk and those who are then everyone in his own way they are dreaming and the dream world is as real as the present world awakened world in the dream world we never think that it is a dream and that particular state has a name in sanskrit called that that is individual aspect in that individual called jiva in the jiba the causal aspect the very subtle aspect is called pragma and the second subtle aspect is called taijasha then third is the gross aspect the name and form and this world is manifestation and that is called and in the cosmic it is virata and an individual it is vaishwanara and the cosmic when it is hiranyagarva it is called the taijasha and in the causal it is ishwara it's called pragma the pragya tajirasha that is the jagrat condition so this is the way the manifestation comes out of the non-manifest and is again resolved back into the non-manifest this is the the cerama krishna is in a very brief he mentioned like that i address as shakthi or kali it was late at night girish asked haripatha to call a cab for he had to go to the theater as haribada was about to leave the room the master said with a smile mind a cab don't forget to bring one so is very particular you know sometimes some people they will go out and they will forget what for they came out it was and in those days maybe the seven o'clock or eight o'clock in the evening was the night so and the hari brother also was supposed to go and the girish stole can you please i call a cab and he going out maybe hurriedly he's going out and then he will forget what for and then he will go to his house ramakrishna will have to wait and giri should not be there girish is also leaving for his own the the office the theater is so particular friends that is the sign of concentrated mind it is not only that when i am sitting and closing my eyes and then i'm thinking i'm meditating some people they will go on telling nominated it has become a craze though i can meditate for three long hours but look at his other behavior he'll be putting his shoes in a very scattered way the left will be here the right will be here and then he in in this cold country they all come with the court and they'll be hanging over there the separate rooms are there and without taking that though it is outside cold i don't know how they forget but after three hours meditation the great meditator is going out without picking up his coat now it is our duty to keep that and we are mentioning over there lost and found please step and that person has totally forgotten where he is because he will go is inside it is all warm and when he goes out the body is warm so don't feel like that then he's going and sitting in the car it is also warm and he forgets the coat was there and after three hours meditation so that mind is not trained up one must be the small little thing just one line the surama krishna is mentioning him mind a cab don't forget don't forget to bring one all are laughing haripatha smiling yes sir i am going just for that how can i forget it so it is feeling that a little bit insert so ramakrishna is reminding him so he is giving the answer in that way but we should learn from how the lord is behaving so particular for everything you know that in the andaman there is a nice gentleman and the very i loved him so much he has passed away we used to call him the adidas his name he was almost the founder of that the adidas was very much excited because he got a check from from his office because he's a retired person maybe for some reason he got a check and we had that time the 50 orphan boys you know you know always the boys are boys so they went to that elderly person and told that we have to uncle we should go with you it is a check and we sh we should go because alone if you are going if somebody snatched the chick the what will happen of course he understood but still he wanted to get there that'll okay then those boys told we are going if we walk from here from our astra and the bank was almost a two mile you have to and if we walk then maybe on the street something happened we are children we cannot fight so you better hire a cab and that was also okay okay there's nothing there maybe 20 rupees we can spend so the six boys and the babu and the cab all the way why for the safety of the chick to deposit in the bank after reaching over there dr who called me over phone and said swamiji can you please send the check i left it on my bed so that is the way i look okay so you have gone spending the 20 rupees again and in the taxi and maybe by this time when you were reaching there they asked you to stop somewhere to have some snacks because that was a great thing depositing 15 000 at the rupee in the bank so that why i'm going i must not forget that in a funny way one of our swamiji used to say see i never forget you know why because i always note down everything whatever i have been asked to do in a paper then in a dramatical way he said but the only thing i forget that piece of paper where i have noted everything so this is very very important and sadama krishna is the most perfect nothing should be the girish that i should have to go to the theater and leave you here master no no you must hold to both hold to both king janaka paid attention to both religious and worldly duties and drank his milk from a breeming car janaka raja mohan like that is a it goes in bengali the saying that he used to drink from both the worldly and also but he was a realized soul the sudama krishna this is the beauty very ordinary thing okay no problem you please go ahead you have that you have to reach over there in time but sudama krishna again even in that when the girish was telling i am sorry i am leaving you over here in my own house and i am leaving and suramar krishna mentioned no you go and then immediately he said all this time you were listening the spiritual talk and the high vedanta philadelphia and now you are going back to the theater to do your like a janaka he said all laughing girish i have been thinking of leaving the theater to the youngsters now listen to this immediately the sudama krishna answering no no it is all right you are doing good to many friends swadharma the most of the time the people that think the what should i do when they look at their swamis they think oh my god they are so happy they don't have any responsibility they're so free and they don't have any bosses and not like that in an organization always hierarchies are there and the life is different but the thing is wherever you are either in the household you are doing the business or in the job wherever you are as a maybe an administrator maybe a king so whatever you must not forget that that duty is your spiritual practice that duty that is called swadharma in bhagavad-gita it says swadharmi nidhanam sriya para dharma when as a brahmana he should not go and behave like a shatria a shatria should not behave like a brahmana oh no i am not going to do anything because i will meditate look at that person how calm and composed that will be a terrible so thank you friends we should stop over here in the next wednesday again we will start from here so that is the ramakrishna and the vedanta in nutshell we discussed and whatever we do that is our prayer we should do like that any question uh one question from bobby maloney asking if the ultimate goal is realization why do some people keep coming back after achieving this realization is it due to leftover desires or to help others also manage i came to know from facebook today
