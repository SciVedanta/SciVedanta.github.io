[22. Panchama Veda 22: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZIyoi9tpMI)

30 in our last class and third we decided that we will discuss about Shri Ganesha to some extent before we begin with the Benjamin vida the gospel of ceramic esna the birth of Ganesha as we find it is very interesting the Ganesha is a human body elephant faced God is very popular and loved by millions and millions of people particularly Indians the Ganesha usually is having four hands in one hand he is holding a lotus there is a symbol of enlightenment in another hand he is holding an ax or a trundle Trishula the Trident and cutting them for to cut the fate of karma third he's holding and not do as a sweet ball actually this is the reward of the tapasya but no one will find that Ganesha is eating it and the all the places he's only holding it distr tapasya holla he gives and another is showing the abaya that's called symbol of blessings of some time it will be some rose that is the symbol of binding and the big trunk there is a symbol of strength and at the same time discrimination when the elephant goes with that long trunk it can even remove a needle so that is the symbol of discrimination and there are two a task is there elephant does one is full another is broken the full task the symbol of it shows the symbol of non-duality only one task we will be coming to the story's different table stories at the air explaining why it is one white is to like that large ear is the wisdom the symbol of wisdom Lord Buddha and all they are having a large year the symbol of wisdom they all listen fast and then only they take the decision first they'll be hearing from others egoistic people their ears are small they don't like to listen they don't like to take the opinion of the others the ego so much and the large Bailey is the symbol of brahmanda everything within him what he's chased crossing the left shoulder like a cigarette trade snake there's a symbol of yoga he's a yogi and very peculiar is a huge body but the carrier is a mouse why the mounts actually our senses our jeevers senses constantly leaving leaving leaving leaving constantly eating something and trying to enter into everything is a very bad habit and that is the reason Lord Ganesha holding it controlling it Hinduism basically a symbolism anything and everything that you see is a fast and foremost is a huge philosophy wonderful philosophy fathomless philosophy and at the same time that philosophy which is so subtle that for the ordinary people they have made different type of symbols the Ganesha is a symbol of unique symbol of the whole in reason hinduism believes in two things one is consciousness and another is physical action the consciousness reflects through the mind and the mind generates thought and work and our senses it works we will find out afterwards how in the different purana they are giving the description of the birth of ganesha how it happens we find that Dinda Linga purana it says that God we're desperate in heavens because of the problem what was the problem any good work they try to do unsuccessful they can't be successful why but that they're causing they say in the story they're causing ashura diva and ashura whole of Hinduism full of different stories of divine ashura this neighbors as if they are very good people they're educated people around people and the asuras are all bad and this way they have depicted and a surah and they were or sewers whatever they are doing is all successful and the day was what you are doing at totally failure what they will do they went to the merciful one that is Shiva the Shiva he accepts everybody and tried to help them so Shiva is easily approachable she were they are going to Lord Shiva and all the divers and assurance they they are praying to Shiva now she will say to the divers what is your problem what do you want then they saved our problem is we are not successful in any of our efforts but the OSHA ders are becoming more powerful what to do please help us so that our obstacles of our life removes then the Sheba said Soviet ok that will be done then the Shiva looked at the poverty and Parvati from our mind created creates one beautiful god that is gonna hanisha big nanaar Chaka and the ganesha means now it is this is the creation the divine child it's called the drivers were fulfilled with joy and serenity in the Linga piranha is describing like this then the child was born the Parvati the Holy concert of Lord Shiva the Shakti primal Shakti of Lord she is creating a divine child this Brahma is giving the name you are the Lord of the Gunners all creatures you are the Lord of the gonna suck ganapathy ganapathy now this wonderful God is coming the Divas and jurors they're constantly exists existing within our mind now if we explain the whole thing now here we find that the dual nature mind one is dt another is Aditi non-dual the drill is dt means dual aditi and they will be writing as if the two lady wives mothers of diva and ashura so dt and aditi one is dwell or another is non dual so that is though oh shoulda never bother about the obstacles did dashed against obstacles the table on the other hand are sensitive enough to realize their own Worth and want to overcome obstacles instead of getting crashed by them who are the Asherah selfishness our own selfishness we only like to leave we only like to get the name fame everything in this world when you are born we are all simple all children are simple doesn't bother about anything in this world they're so happy with a small thing of doll or a chocolate or something eatables they're happy how come so much of desire from the past birth it is coming whole love desire and creating problem so here the more there is desires that like to enjoy in the these worldly things and the same thing will reading the khatam rita bhajan omelet in the gospel of sri ramakrishna in the prana Krishna's house Tucker is sitting all the neighbors are there and still they are eager to listen to see Ramakrishna what he say about God what we will say about the religion then he said Ishwara and his creation these are the two things the creator and his creation majority of the people they go for the creation they only think that the creation is real and no one think about the Creator the Creator is more important than the creation that's why Sri Ramakrishna instilling some are you you are trying to know about how much money the landlord is having how much he is property that he is having how much these and that that he was having all his wealth in his word resurgent that you want to know why don't you go and first see him meet him and then develop a friendship with him brother brother brother good with him then he himself will tell everything somehow or other you go and meet God realize God you will know everything about God here also we find the same creation and the creator deity and Aditi diva and ashura and the same our mind within our mind so that is why some people very few people they like to come to God why because God do not allow them to come why because he gives them so much of desire full with desire phul they are dissatisfied they are going to different places but neighbor come over here never come to the god then the person one devotee asking see Ramakrishna what is the way out Oh what is the way out ceramic ishness ate only two words holy company and prior holy company and prayer this is the only two things up there so we will come to that in the padma purana now they are describing in a different way they're describing that one day mother Parvati anointed her body with turmeric in our country the people that particularly ladies they will apply the turmeric paste and mother Parvati she a zip and applied the turmeric paste and she was waiting over there and the same thing the same story in a different way they are telling in this way the mother Parvati wanted to go for bathing then she asked the bull of the Shiva that you the Lord Shiva's that Ghana is the one of the major gonna do you be here in the gate so that no one enter but at that time Shiva interred king and naturally Nandi give de way to Shiva because nundi is devoted to Sheba not to Parvati and Parvati got hangry she then created from her that paste one small child a very big hurry with you early to make him very strong elephant head next day when she was going for bathing geox ganesha she gave the name Ganesha you protect the gate and before she became Shiva had seen some of our people than they bring Lee and all that go and tell Parvati that I'm coming and ganesha didn't allow them to enter so obviously there was a fight and very peculiarly which was unthinkable for Nandi bringing the small little boy defeated them then the wind back totally Britain and then they reported to shiver and told one little boys they're very peculiar human body but elephant hate so powerful it is impossible to defeat him we couldn't enter we couldn't tell mother that you like to come we are sorry did the Shiva himself Kim both to him not knowing each other the Son and the father they were not knowing each other so obviously she refers ducks to him go away but he didn't give away the shoe he told my mother is bathing until she gives me the order i am not going to listen to anyone Sheba got angry and killed the boy cut his head and when he was dying the ganesha shouted mother and that risk the Parbat is here she came out but furious wanted to destroy the whole world now came the other gods particularly Vishnu and Brahma and pacified her and they told we are going to take care of him he alive again then the Sheba gave the boon ok whoever you see the fast bring his head and then I will give him the life again that's why the again the Ganesha became the first day saw an elephant brought the aid of the elephant and elephant head so this is a another version of the story and in the Hindu mythology this is very peculiar they will be telling the wonderful stories very very peculiar stories totally unbelievable almost the modern there's mind they don't like to believe this type of stories but they like to listen to them we go attractive and at the back of it there is the philosophy and this was the story the mother another version says the mother she created that out of the turmeric paste and then took it to gaga that was flowing in the heaven and put it inside the water immediately from the Ganges from the Ganga came out very powerful effulgent ml boy the male body a boy then the Ganga claim it is my son and the mother / boot was telling how can this beat is my son I have created I only be in your water the Ganga claimed no I give the life you have created the body but I give the life then the Brahma came and he said okay he will have two names gong jia a nagging apathy why ganapati because all the Gunners the followers of sheba as because he is the son of Sheba she will be the master of all the ganas so obviously he is ganapati as because the ganga gave the light sir ganga now this is the stories of the creation this is the whole story now come out the spatiality why he is like this so peculiar body and all now here we find so many wonderful way they say that we find that the by Ganesha the Parvati is the supreme energy in the human body the supreme Banerjee is asides in the mooladhara chakra now comes the philosophy the ganapati is a story very fascinating very attractive now comes the philosophy how it is and it says that the first and foremost thing we have to understand where from the Ganesha is created and who is creating the primal energy and who is this primal energy and it says in the human body the primal energy it resides in the mooladhara chakra the fast best thing and it is it names as Kundalini Shakthi Kula Kundalini Shakti and this is so powerful and it purifies everything in the Bhagavad see Ramakrishna and all the Yogi's and in our Indian tradition they say the moment the Kula Kundalini Shakti comes up towards the head one after another the energy feels the heart of the human being and we have changed we have seen the changes is not only hypothetical is practical and we have seen the changes when someone is meditating this primal energy is going up hey everything is changing at waubonsee Ramakrishna giving a wonderful description when it comes to the heart how it becomes when it comes to the throat then in between the eyebrow and then afterwards in the center of the Haid sharra what changes comes this mooladhara Shakti's all impurities go away that's why the Ganga the Ganga gave the light means what it has the purity unless and until human mind is pure it can never get the blessings of ganapathy Kaname say everyone and who is everyone Brahman artman the Brahma artois everywhere so ultimately the human a Hinduism goes to that one thing all is nothing but the creation of one being and that name is brahmana this Brahmin covering everything all over and that is the reason this Parvati when she was bathing then she became by this story what does it mean that means when this energy Rises consciousness also becomes manifested what is that consciousness that is the Shiva Shakti or the knowledge about which the veda speaks continuously and about which the Upanishad sales what about Gita says the Guru's the same art Mata talk that is the consciousness this consciousness comes close secretly certainly unaware of the person who is meditating trying to become a spiritual aspiring suddenly the consciousness come so that is there and wipe our booties the story depicting that she is going for bathing that means very secretly and when we are practicing sadhana not before everyone secretly moni bony Pony raghavan serum Krishna sea weed in our heart within the forest away from the vortex of the city life and in a corner of your home where nobody is there when you are alone and that is the secrecy look at the story and then if we can understand the real meaning of the story the wonderful philosophy comes out this is the Ganesha and this perk rity this hour Parvati she is applying turmeric you look olive and this is the yogi see that in our own body mooladhara chakra is yolo color that's why the shakti it likes yellow your leash Marsha a domani Devi suddenly she is telling I love yellow color flower mooladhara shakti the primal energy buruma ability she likes you Lou color and the Shiva the consciousness the shaktra white color mother said cocoon likes white color I like Yolo color flower look at it so how as if it is nothing just that she likes your local unknown because of the primal energy because she is the Shakti Maha Maha Shakti so like this we find the physical world it represents the Devi the Devi the prakruti she is representing the physical and the Sheba is totally sattva-guna why the Shiba is cutting the head of the ganesha when a person is trying to become holy meditating practice practicing austerity one after another power comes after Sydney majority of the spiritual experience the fall of that because of that only Sheba is the Guru Shiva wants to help and ganesha when he got the blessings of the primal energy the shakti of Sheba he was getting the power then as if it became it developed on Gaara I can fight I can challenge even the God as if so the story is giving another meaning the spiritual meaning and what is there if you are practicing the spirituality you are surely going to get some power the moment you get the power you have to be very very humble otherwise it is difficult the wave from where the power is coming power is coming from the primal energy from the Divine Mother from the divine source we forget and with that we are even challenging the God the Shiva Lord Shiva is sending fast his own people to fight with you to try to make understand that you should not behave like this but this power is so much they don't like to listen even to those so the sannyasins to come the holy people they come the holy books they tell but these people become so egoistic they're good people they have got the power blessings of the primal energy Shakti but the moment eshakti comes thousands of people will go see at their feet ogre they've all these and then he start feeling I am the creator I can do this I can do that and that is the last stage of sadhana then default the Sun nursing's the last hurdle of a life of his own AC wise and Nancy anyone who wants to realize God the last hurdle is um cara that's why were once I ramakrishna say gotcha me gotcha me means the unripe ego unripe ego means this body and associated everything associated with this body this is called unripe ego and that we all know I Mia Mia Mia everybody is telling it is me it is me it is me and mine well you didn't know what you can do next day they don't know but even then they'll be going on telling like this this is very peculiar gotcha me see Rama Krishna is telling you have to remove the koch army then only you can put park army and he is Ramakrishna as a guru removing the this thing hum Gaara which is binding him down with the world sometimes he is removing that that one by trashing by scolding or were touching or by tailing in different ways Shiva in the story of the Ganesha what he is telling what he is doing is cutting the head it means the hunger I I I consciousness and because he's guru fast he had send his own people but this person on listen to that then the Guru car because he is compassionate he wants to help and then cart the hail and we always and some people in Russia I read in the newspaper they're complaining the Hinduism always in everything after all the stories all the gods and goddesses they are only teaching about fighting writing and writing so that should be banned even the Sri Krishna he is encouraging his disciple to fight and everywhere it is fighting ma Durga mahakali Ganesha Sheba everybody is holding the arms and armaments what type of religion is this it should be banned and majority of the Hindus also do not they don't understand what is this and now it is some of the people some Hindus to boost up the Hindu at the hydrology they're depicting Rama and Bhagavad a Swami Vivekananda Hall like a hero they are standing there of course heroes but not to fight not to kill others but to fight their own lower instincts so all the arguments that we see not to apply for the outside it is for the inside you had to fight at your own mind lower instincts and the shiba when cutting the head of the his own son look at it the person who is after the sadhana after the blessings of the mother getting all the yogic power queasy the son of Shiva his spiritual and he is developing but only one place that eager I ego I can do I can do they in the Lord the supreme lord the she becomes and then as every move the jager the wind is removing the ego as if cutting the head and then once again giving the egg back and bringing him into life how giving everything that's why sharma vivek on the same what good is God to give the definition of God began to say unselfishness is God and this unselfishness gives everything whatever you want then he saved the by practicing unselfishness we could get everything but we don't have the patience to practice it through an unselfishness we can get everything the name frame prosperity whatever you want but we don't have the patience to practice it the moment you realize God whatever you want he will get and the same thing through story again in the Chandi we find one King one businessman they went to the jungle and they worship the goddess Durga when the ma Durga appeared before them and she told what do you want the businessman told I don't want anything but mukthi but the king told I want the big Kingdom and both were given the blessings so the jagged and the paramo are our dad mikata both can be achieved by realizing that unselfishness is more paying but we don't have the patience to practice it so this is the story that we find if we don't honor the Ganesha we fail in everything the story begins with that in the Linga piranha why the gods are not successful they are trying to do everything but they are failing failing in every step and they went to the sheba and the shiva looked to the Parvati what he created a small wonderful child as a Ganesha and then afterwards what this Ganesha Ghana Aisha ghana means everything Aisha means God Yabusame doms Algrim Aisha means God the God pervading everything if you try to insult someone cheat someone how can we expect that God will bless you because that is also God a part of God manifestation of God in different forms and that is the reason sharma vivek and is telling my gods are those whom by mistake you call as man human my god are those then he said once they were my special object of worship at the poor the downtrodden the illiterate the oppressed because they are also God's manifestation of God is also there but right this moment they are in that condition if you go and help them the god in that beings will be so happy and you will get the blessings this is kalki onna and this is the knowledge that we have to understand in this fashion other ways we cannot now the ganapathy they'll be telling the some stories having the to task elephant asked to one is broken why then again they lose story and they say that once god Ganesha was going suddenly parachute on que para shulem is a great devotee of Shiva and Sheba gave his own ax to Peru chirag to stablished religion by destroying the evil stablished religion polym he was moving like that and the story says that Ganesha came on his way parashuram said you go away now i am going so you go aside so i should go i am senior then the ganesha said how can that be if you like to go then i also like to go and i have come fast I should go fast so allow me to cross then you come rosharon got angry and he was the dead person like that and he challenged the Ganesha Ganesha was the son of Shiva parashuram was the devotee of Shiva the Sun naturally having all the power of his father more power than the devotee then the Ganesha fast bitten him it is a first opportunity Ganesha written him then he roasts up and to kill that boy Ganesha it through the acts Ganesha's immediately looked at the action and identified this is the gift that my father has given to him if I deny this I can but it will be insult to the father it is all powerful so I must have to give the respect to my father's power that he has given to the parish Rama so with one task he accepted that and it broke that is the story sami be waken under he is the son of Sri Ramakrishna see Rama Krishna himself entered into him he was Ramakrishna himself he went to Kashmir and naturally the wind the God anywhere the people are attracted to him a personality like Vivekananda and people they were all were coming to be waken under he kashmir there was another four key / kill means they follow the mostly my doula g but to some extent the Hindu Idol urged the mixed so these four keys are expected in India and this poor kid was there the people the disciples of the they were attracted by the Vivekananda started visiting Vivekananda fakir was not getting anything so slowly slowly became agitated then one day he was also having some power spiritual power miraculous power then he said oh you people are going to that person ok I will curse him and he will develop tremendous pain in his body and he will lead this area Kashmir with it do this then he gave the curse and truly become the started feeling so much a pain stomach pain he had to come down and we become the game for the teachings of the ordinary people he came to the MA Shara Domini TV and complained to her ma you Taku this time it is not my type where it is now you're talkin my your Tucker has no power look at it so ordinary forked over there in touch me he cast and I really had to suffer and I yet no other way but to come down Taku didn't save me then the answer of the mother that tallies this gonna this the story of the ganesha mother say the power of that for key is also given by C Ramakrishna who has gave the power of the 40 whatever he says cards that is come to true what that power who gave God himself and who is the god say Ramakrishna now son tell me when you are suffering is it not the suffering of that same see Ramakrishna are you separate from Saddam o Krishna when you are suffering it is ceramic is nice Aubree but he is keeping his words because he has given that power to that 40 folk it through his austerity got that power now that power he has applied on you now you have to suffer look at it similarly we find ghani she's suffering because Ganesha's no word no separate then the Shiva himself Shiva himself is suffering because he has given that boon to parasurama so these are the stories and the second story they say the ganesha the tradition he was writing Mahabharata and the biasa rishala birthday is very intelligent he was going on telling the stories after stories Ganesha when he was writing with the ordinary pain it was not moving so fast so he broke half of his task make it a pain and then started writing that that means it shows that the God Himself is giving away all his something for the development of the human being this gonna potty according to the Hindu tradition this is the speciality of the Hindu after telling this I will stop this gonna potty according to the North Indian Ganesha oven shows married to two daughters of Brahma one name is booty another shitty the ganapathy in the southern and eastern part of India he is a celebrate why celebrate because he saw mother in all being matra baba mother in every being so naturally when the marsh our other money they be someone asked her usually we see in all our scriptures when the God comes with the shakti and they do their job over here establishing Dharma in their own way but before they go away give away their body they sent back there shakti this time we find the ceramic Krishna kept you over here you are the ceramic ish no sir TTYL then the answer of the mother you know son this time ceramic is no game to rise the power of mothra shakti and he looked upon each and every being as the goddess mother and what his mother purity this purity in every being the same thing I will remind you is sade about by Tommy vivekananda each soul is potentially divine that is Mothra Shakti what is mother it is not a lady body who is giving the birth of child no purity that is called Matt Rita and that purity means he loves everything that purity loves everything it cannot say no to anyone that's why this matra shakti everywhere this time see Rama Krishna has come to rouse that mark rejecting that purity jesus also is telling I said that those who are pure in heart that it is there how we can't find it that's why I ami is telling potentially divine you have to manifest it everything is there but you have to manifest it potentially divine in the sealed the trees their potential but if you only put the seed in the art give little water get oxygen then the light sunlight then only it manifest similarly within the heart of every being potentially purity is there and that that purity should be manifested then only we can the Ganesha he was celebrate in the southern and eastern India but northern India they find that Ganesha is having two wives what were those boody and shitty with this shitty that means the moment you realize God or develop the power of God you get this Tooting fast intellect but thee and what is the intellect that he can get he can become fast in the class he will get all the certificates in the universe from the University is about diamond no intellect means he can discriminate from bad and good that his intellect and sigdi means the moment the person is having that intellect he successfully new everywhere so good thing that is totally different is the power to discriminate there are some people who never attended school but they had the tremendous power I don't I won't go to the name of Allah and see Rama Krishna who never attended school but people say that there he's God obviously you have the type of but D the knowledge there are many other people discrimination is perfect to understand what is good and what is bad why we are suffering because of these thing only we do not understand what is good and what is bad majority of the people everywhere you go they will be following only so when some people are telling what is the difference of a leader and the followers this would thing if the book d may be applied in a good way or bad that is different but they can take the decision and they can motivate the people and they will all follow you so why this difference one person can control thousands and thousands of people while out but thee so this would be if it is properly channelized gets the sydney city means spiritual success so these are the two & y celebration the people they'll be selling the Ganesha celebrate because of the mar 3 gana everywhere the mother how it came one Ganesha was playing and he was a small little boy and naturally as is the nature of the children they are playing with a cat the cat was there and when the cat was trying to hide it will drag the cat from the tail and then sometime beat the cat and like these that after the all the plague Ganesha went to mother and found all over her body scratches the Ganesha rocks mother what happened it is you son you have bitten me so much I had to have all the bruises and that the kratch is all over I am now in great pain because of you you have bitten me Ganesha was taken aback I was playing were there with the cat then the mother say divine mother say but what they say I am in that cat this is Hinduism and remember the story of the mass era de Mona Devi when she was coming away from the gyre Ambati she was also had a paid a cat the premature you were there was not liking the cat and she say to the brahmacari i am going away please take care of the cat Ramachari perhaps head home hearing that the way he replied mother understood that he may be giving the food but not with the care dane she said remember i am in that cat this is Hinduism and why we worship the cow the animals the trees the heels the river because in everything we'd like to and he must try to see the manifestation of God and nothing else sentient and in sentient leaving or date in everything we must see the gods manifestation and that is the story of Ganesha and he's so big particularly his belly is so big almost half of it is coming on his lower garment why because he is the brahmanda the Ganesha is the full so the symbolic Hinduism we have to understand I'm sorry today almost the whole time is over at the Ganesha and this ganapati bappa rhetorical father why ganapati bappa father he just like father takes care of us sometimes calling punishing but always with a watchful eye that's why he is Baba at the same time he just like a small child we feel like taking care of him he wants the play he wants to go here and there and sometimes he find in our you know Hindus a broad-minded they don't mind so anyone can do anything they'll be painting an apathy in different way and there'll be animated pictures also with the Ganesha all the children but the people who are doing it must read the inner meaning of the Ganesha otherwise they'll be making giving a wrong knowledge to the our younger generation the ganapati bappa the Ganesha is a symbol unique symbol of Hinduism he is the fool he's the whole and that is why he's gonna party all we belong to him only this gonna he is very powerful that's why the trunk of the elephant very powerful and if we can understand that we can understand the gonna be now let us pray together booty and today you will conclude they have got this paper with you you see they must be there and distribute many of you must be knowing it even then when they have prepared is better to buck rotundum aha cayo sorry Oh cote some up brother nearly bignum kurumi table sir ever carry issue sir david ah dr. Tunde baha i am as we were explaining the very powerful that is ganesha the trunk and then huge because the brahmanda mahak i am but his power is Surya 40 the clothes and cloves of Sun is so powerful some up Brava that is his effulgence and what he can do they need wig gnam he can remove all the obstacles from our part sarkari asu's our Buddha in all of our efforts we must pray to the Ganesha every morning when the Sun is rising thousands of Hindus devout Hindus they'll be standing by the side of the Ganga and seeing the sunrise they'll be chanting this buck rotundum mahak ayah surah yo cote sama prover nearly bignum kurumi diva celeb Akari asus arabada home Shanti Shanti Shanti hurry you that's it Sri Ramakrishna are economists to the nikah coming saturday i will go to the maharashtra bundle they are organizing a program it it seems it should will to be here at lemon temple in the depo it will be in the known time i will go over there at two thirty something like that and speaking on the Ganesha they are also for 10-15 minutes so this today as you promised we have discussed about the Ganesha but we could not touch the wench I'm of a depression Amrith next day we will again read and in our english translation book this portion I do not know why it is not there in a chronological Bengali khatam with the gospel there is a chapter full chapter the ceramic ishness visiting prana Krishna's mukhopadhaya house that shampoo cool the wonderful conversation is going on between the ceramic Asia and the devotees but that is not there in English I do not know whether they have translated and added in the afterwards in some other chapter but next day we will read that one right from the Bengali and then you will discuss about that
