this chanting rhythm dr. G venom could be be written cal/osha straw burn among golem srimad artem boobie Grundy a hula dodge a llama here table means God Todd that God we are going to discuss today mainly the emphasis has been given on the god conception of god romans ramakrishna again and again he is mentioning about the couple who is this God is it a creator is the sustainer can he take the fall can we see him also many questions are there all the time 14 our minds so this cupboard is very clearly mentioning about the God Kadam Rita the words the teachings the son ones that he has given so that believing there is God believing that he gives the sermons to guidance to help us and if we follow that our life becomes completely full peaceful happy and contented so that is exactly the word we gain from spirituality and religion Master Pasha who noted is mentioning about a date Wednesday October 1st 1884 Saddam additional errors set out from - nation for adverse house in Calcutta sluggishness to live in termination and a few hours days to drive by the horse-drawn carriage and two young boys are accompanying him Narayana and Kannada we're with him in the carriage in an extracted moon deceived and this is very important he is going to meet the devotees in Calcutta and that was his system to go and meet the devotees to talk to them and to inspire them to guide them bring over there usually the holy people and mostly the camp it is Calcutta that regard the majority of the people is to follow the bushnell government and the British neighbors they will always take edge of oman and go in the name of god so people always they used to consider that they are very holy people because stick in the name of God when they have gone to the market or anywhere they'll be coming there suddenly see Ramakrishna in the Tigers in an ecstatic mode he is telling shall I count the beads how shameful that would be so this is a very interesting the sentence how shameful that would be this emblem of Shiva has sprung from the walls of art it is self-created and not set up by man's hands now the two things where I see that suddenly the Saddam additional certainly he is mentioning shall I take the name of God but counting the beads that means I am showing to the people that have taken the name of God so it says that in a Bengali way and that way they say if you are counting the beads you are the third great devotee that means you need some support to take the name of God and if you are counting the your finger you know that in the finger will count in a second great but the first is he who can constantly remember God so this is the gradation when you begin we begin with the counting the beads and if the bead is hanging in my hand that is a reminder to me that I have to take the name of God this is in the beginning but why you should all the time every moment when we are taking the breathing and like that we are not conscious about when you're breathing in and breathing out there's not not natural the taking the name of God should be also like that natural normal constant every moment so that is exactly what cinema business telling and then he's giving hint hint about himself so why do we take the name of God to realize God why meditate on God to the others God and what the God will do the God Himself will do so he is mentioning like this if Papa were our she isn't Bengali the same that is from the originally it is coming out the Shiva usually the people will give a shape of the Shiva maybe one with the mod or on the stone like that but not hot enough and no one is creating so he is mentioning he is God Himself those who have read the biography of Saddam Edition you know before the birth of Saddam additional his mother she was in along with her friends before a small Shiva temple still there in his birthplace kamaboko and when she was standing there suddenly no other other ladies couldn't see she only saw a great waves of light is coming out from the small Shiva temple and entered into her purse and she said look at that you get and she fainted she was entered into the person and Sheba is nominal so he is mentioning in that way that this is the Shiva they arrived at others house where many devotees including Keita Barbara Ambuja had assembled we also follow the same tradition whenever the devotees am writers we always say invite other people to if I alone go and talk to you and have a cup of tea known in my daugthers and there always what I follow I always allow them to chant and talk and socialise and the food and all but little maybe half an hour forty minutes we will have some discretion some people is the question will come this astrologist whatever is telling is true I don't believe I can behave like these things will atleast happen so the waves will within the minds of the human being who in reality whether they know it or not believe it or not gods so that is exactly what we also try to do because but once the Ramakrishna he taught us this is the way you should have to work missionaries work now other people have also come when the master inter orders join room to receive killer and Vijay saluted him these are the famous names those who are again and again later by graffiti no kita and be joy the joy was also spiritual leader and kita was here the person was too in an office in Dhaka in those days even presently Bangladesh capital so he used to work over there but people is to come to him because he was a Brahmin and the branding in those days is to talk about the religion that God our people is to come to him so cleaner and be joy be joy - he was a devotee and he was the family lineage from wish number but he at that moment he was a teacher of Brahmo Samaj but still he was also giving the teaching of the religion and theta 2.so killer and Vijay they were all there and there the Narayana brother absolutely and here we find Saddam efficient is asking kita and be joy to bless his two young boys who accompanies Ramakrishna why because they are also religious teachers they also teaches religion the simplicity is so humble and Salam vishna respect those who are teaching the religion who are teaching religion following religion practicing religion so easier asking them to place these two young boys and he is telling his heart only kindness about the nareul the one boy about him his day you see he is utterly guiding us this is a very important quality to become spiritual guidance simplicity everything should be taken very otherwise many of the people whenever they hear something immediately they will start thinking why he glanced at me like that what he told me this why he was mentioning that how will this unnecessarily they will go on thinking and creating problem for themselves and problem for others around him so here is a kindness the eyes of the devotees were fixed on the two boys because cinema business appreciated them he took them along with him so naturally they were also noticing mastered together and other devotees it is good that I have made you all here otherwise perhaps you have gone to the Kali temple to see me and this is through the wheel of God however we have to maintain selamat intensity this is because the wheel of God from here discussion begins now the gather with folded hands it is a very good devotee we love God it is all you will receive actually accepted see now the distance the god himself to build up guards durable ceramic richness mind but he didn't continue with that discussion he asked a person there was a vegetable Chara the he asked him to sing the pajamas in the version prepared the mind you know when we were thinking about God and other the good versions that prepared the mind he was asking which and by future dongsaeng and this gospel of ceramic is negative so big volume most of the party songs so the times in so different way as sanam additionally it into extension started dancing and they also started dancing at the devotees and here he came he comes down killed and several de Vil routine stood up they were about to return home cater saluted the master and bade him goodbye master should go away without reading author goodbye because we have all come to other sounds and without giving order that we are going away how can you go wouldn't that be an act of discourtesy surrounded look at it so careful about everything so when a man is trying to realize God becoming a spiritual only visiting temple on to each and every time in every step of your life you have to be very very cautious am i doing everything right why because that helps the mind conscious when you sit for meditation that came also the same conscience will come now I'm sitting for meditation and I should meditate and now I have got to behave as they are so when we enter into somebody's house we always ask when should you see they won't mind if I sit anywhere but that is the curtsy that if they have kept a seat for me I should go and sit over there and when you good you know when you visit any astronaut you always will be the the charity but there may be their junior by age and seniority but still whatever he will say we even thought of that so this is the courtesy and that gives the mind at training saddam krishna is asking a person like him but cleaver had something else in his mind that will come to know afterwards so he wanted to go away why because the order was arranging food but this is the thing that hinduism that into society they were so much attached to that particular idea food and look at amo krishna's teachings when god is pleased the world is pleased he's very clever history mr. Ramakrishna your God if you are pleased to speak to state director sir if you are pleased than everyone everything is pleased you are still so in his Saints we are all still say he's giving in the fallacy I am not feeling well besides then he is mentioning I am a little nervous about my social conventions once before I had trouble with our unity and master Mercia he is giving the food not that he is mentioning other belong to the lower cost and gather the Brahmin is not able to dine with him or eat at his home so that master Murshid is closed and key that they will see that the killer was mentioning I have some problem I am so he wanted to avoid the food previously he and his own community didn't know about that but that was the situation that I think last year we were having the retreats in one of the retreat packed this discussion and like this in September we had at our fall banquet there all our Shan is one of them at that they were telling the Hinduism at the time of the Vader Hinduism at the time of the pollution Hinduism at a time of bhagavad-gita Hinduism before cinema Krishna Hinduism after scientists so though all this total in recent picture before Saddam additional this was the problem all over the society because we were suppressed by the Muslims for a long long time and we forgot everything about our originality and many ways of oppression in the society and lawlessness in the society so obviously the original people did God go into the backward and those who doesn't know anything they will take the lead and that happen in India so all these things that we see now you should not touch these you should not eat that you should not go there all these things came into the Hindu body because of this misconception and sadhana Tichenor came to revoke that and how he is removing he is not going on thinking we have to fight we have to do this no social reform he is changing that by practicing himself he became so much accepted by the debating society he is a spiritual leader religious leader a God himself and now when he is doing this then there is no problem so this is what's in Amish names mentioning so now each needs to receive different type of places where their holy people are not supposed to go holy people are supposed only to stay in the temple sometimes going in the forest like that and he used to visit museums surrounding to go and see what is happening and what are the things then he saw in that a shifting Museum there's a human skull human boom and he was to see this is a human and we are so proud of us and this is in reality this is human daddy esteem and some blood and flesh so why should you be so much equating I am so and so in reality this is the original is to teach these devotees is to go to the gym and to see and seeing anion he remembered the divine mother durga he everything even in the animals the presence of the divinity is there used to go to the movie theaters in those days and in the observing that how the people are acting and he noticed mostly the religious books so there is to perform and will be crying and all the devotees is to seriously take those things and learn how it should be the devotion so if we were in every sphere of life he was changing from the ordinary worldly thoughts to the spirituality wherever you go you can change because you see everything completely the spiritual viewpoint and Saddam is not asking him just then when the discussion was going on and this man was trying to give a just an author came author was a deputy magistrate in those days a deputy magistrate means the big officer in the British time an Indian becoming a deputy magistrate was a big thing so will he came naturally they could not say no other King and asked the master that you go to the dining room for the meaning was really ceramic crystal stood up now hearing fine saddam mr. stood up and saved a dressing caterer and we join these two the spiritual leaders they were educated to take food in the house salaam district you selves to the bed not others others were also do it don't particularly this to come come with me if the god can go why can't devotees the god is going to take the food come come come with me they followed him and part to the dinner together with other devotees sri ramakrishna is breaking unnecessarily we cannot seek together because we are brown man and Warren mean higher Brahm mean so many varieties of brandings also Bromley's those who are worshiping in the temple they will never sit with other Brahmins who are practicing medicine now they are go around me we are higher ground Brandon among the Brahmans also this is really ridiculous and about others forget about slowly changing it deformation without changing anything so sonatina can the same the do drop the Deirdre is helping the best flower to bloom without making any noise but rain is making the noise we do draw we do not know when it comes that helps to bloom the flower the just like that slowly slowly he is changing the birds in the society and said after that that man is asking the caterer is asking people want to give me food what should I do Lord what is your command in this matter this is one thing that is to be really very interesting to note the neither a Brahmin he is completely depending on Saddam additional he is addressing him as Lord the master of all and please tell me what is your command your body after this guy what is your command so this command and master's Ramakrishna this is a very important step that is mentioning one can eat food even from an untouchable if the untouchable is a devotee of God after spending seven seven years exit is telling from his own experiences one can take food from the untouchable if the untouchable is a devotee of God now the food is back there was a retreat do we allow our retreat that ever that young Shani Supriya he lived at retreat and there on five verses Shankar Acharya again and again taking the old and he's doing this is my field - illusion that even if the untouchable as realized car he knows the B that is a guru it doesn't mean that to become a guru one should be prominent and one should read the Veda not like that whoever has realized God and this is true Hinduism we should understand that and that the people are criticizing Hinduism so this thing should be told to them this is real in reason other things because it is a long long time things that we got more than ten thousand years of war with the system so naturally different other things also in turning to this body but that is not the original or in Alistair's gathered in a low voice door please transmit power to me many people come to me I know the killer because he's a Brahmin he reads out the spiritual books people come to them this is one should understand there was a young person in Assam he used to read gospel of Salaam just a minute I stood up eagerly and very nicely and it was a brown name and he knew before reading he will be taking the water and all those things that people started touching his feet offering food and giving him prana me all days then when I came to know him I told him don't do it because after five days you won't be able to control yourself if you start feeling that I am the spiritual leader and the moment the person is coming and touching your field know it for sure you have to hear something from him and you have to give something from you the what is not the good thing that you have done that appreciated him and you have to share some bad acts that they have done this is the law you cannot avoid it be careful so that is what Saddam kishna told to show me me bacon the reindeers very young so tour mother you have to first equivalent then only you can share with others before the Malaysian you are sharing what is it so one must be careful of we don't see anything that we think of nothing is happening but in reality it is happening and that's why sometimes we find a few days that person is progressing all people are appreciating and then suddenly before because our spirituality gone and then just like a try live in form so this same these are the teachings Salameh yesterday when he said it with some power master everything will be alright one gets along well if one is sincerely devoted to God everything will be alright if you are sincerely devoted to God you came through the editor of the Bengali paper the bongo by marci entered the room editor of the witnesses from the bar she was a very famous paper and at the time of the freedom movement it took a great lead it is to write and publish another small small everywhere different people different languages all around India all over India these two published so this Bengali paper thought entered the room was the editor the conversation turned to personal God and God without for the people that we can find if religion actually one fact that stands out prominently and that is that there is an idea our infinite power towards which mankind struggles which cannot be realized except to self-abnegation of self renunciation the king some all religions are the feeling of the infinite it is true that each religion possesses its own doctrine creeds and rituals there is one region which is common to all religions that is God God is the center of all religions I just was trying to understand the circuit of the goddess st. nobody's didn't believe in God Jainism they don't believe in God the belief not in God button button Dharma this Chinese Dharma leads to liberation they think and what is this Dharma Dharma is strict st season renunciation and morality now it is naturally if we understand this Jainism is the highest practice the last practices to realize God it's not the common religion it cannot be so jungle of the mauryan he made it a state religion so afterwards it was imposed on the modernity people general masses otherwise only a chosen few those who were practicing religion very sincerely they used to practice like that this James the strict asceticism we cannot imagine what they profess to deceive them they will never brag the fruits they are not supposed to because the fruits are ending from the tree who am blocking I am hurting the tree so I have to wait under the tree till he falls down and I had to the thing that is already there otherwise not is it possible for ordinary people to practice and this renunciation they sometimes they renounce everything and they will never care for their own body even they'll be walking barefoot without any clothes never baking anything and this type of renunciation we cannot imagine and also were already very high morality so these are the three things that is the basis of the Jainism and when a person can practice these three is for sure that they are going to realize God there can be and not deliver realization but it is not for the common people to practice it's not so if we try to practice that of course of that slowly slowly they have moderated they cannot just etc but that is exactly what Jainism is Buddhism also they also follow thermal not God and but dissing Dharma is cosmic law and order Karma cosmic law and order it will go and Jainism the Dharma he came just like the Buddhism but Therma means this asceticism renunciation morality now for the Hinduism I'm not going to the atomic religion and they all believe in God with the consecutive God is a creator and also but I am insane and go to the Hinduism behind the objects of this phenomenal world lies a changeless permanent reality the supreme Brahman this is the concept of all Hindus of what even we see is the phenomenon this world the renovation at the back of it there is something which is changeless the parameter particularly r32 vedanta that explain is very nicely the if there is no unchangeable thing how can you observe the changes so when I see that when body is changing the body is not seeing the body it cannot be something else is looking at the party and observing that it is changing I was a little boy and slowly and green and all the changes I can notice and nowadays it the modern society the parents should be going on taking the photograph every day change and that we keeping on the wall and when a person comes and says oh I was like this and then we can see the whole how we use a Google but the truth is changing when my body is changing mind is changing thoughts are also changing everything is changing but who is observing began to say it is the heart man which is observing and what is this artment changeless and they keep the name supreme Brahman absolute problem what is this brunt one all the time expanding and in what is it consciousness all pervading everywhere consciousness is there it is all pervading ceramic is not using this the truth of in tourism is making it more easy for each and every one when one attains Samadhi there is cinema business except in the yoga yoga the terminology is Samadhi and what is this Samadhi enlightenment not attainment of God enlightenment the yoga of the Patanjali production became the potential world's upon that it is a god and he said if you accept God to be easy for you to get the Enlightenment not that you have to accept God you can get realization all the Enlightenment without God but also if you accept God it will be easy for you through meditation on God worshipping God all you remove will be one pointed that will help you to realize what enlightenment what is they like that but I am Artman that is the betterment and that is yoga and Salam which will look at it that is why he is the God of unity in diversity he said when one at in Samadhi the highest ultimate goal of the yoga they alone comes the knowledge of Brahman the ultimate of Gianna marques and one attains we shall have got this three and one achieves the vision of God the piece that God the plumber and the enlightenment of the Yogi's are all same so that is exactly what Saddam Oh Krishna serialisation the Supreme Brahman which is at the back of everything which is nothing but the consciousness which is all-pervading not having any form but can take form if we want that here comes the ceramic is Nagaina and he says God has for him he is boundless this is a uniqueness astonished but thousands of years the Hindu philosophers default on this point is guarded with for or without one and they always will go only one view with fall and some will say without fall and sometimes in and even find that Twitter the Twitter will say it is only data only do it you are not going to believe in anything else except God is completely separate and we are completely separate and we can never become God that is absolute to eat the easel data means to do are to throw it ISM after your separation God is completely separate we are completely separate and then what will happen so if you go on praying to God meditating on God worshipping God working for God the levy that will be graceful to you and from the cost case you have to wait just because you are worshiping the God willing to give the blessings not no chance up to it to see the pure on Twitter this is negative twenty minutes to then there is no to there is only one so if it is only one and there cannot be two this is a Hinduism and individual ramen which make we see stir the waiter is it a qualified now the see that the fire from the fire the sparks are coming out they are also quiet part of fire and sparks are having older and just justifiable all the qualities or the potentialities and naturally you cannot say thus far which is small it is not private is also fire so that is our ramanuja so Twitter the sister Twitter or Twitter and in the heart rate that they say this is like this Shankar Acharya tone down that our Twitter and he say yes a treat of course but you have you can go through devotion because devotion the love the concern the southeast it is so natural every human being there are some people they love to serve others can I look for you can I even bring this to you there isn't and if you said no you should not do anything sit straight and all the time do you think that I am Brahman and not the body they won't be able to make any progress in the spiritual life but that is why the slowly slowly all these things accomplished nothing he combined and then he is solving the problem of for wheat form and formless and very simple with God as well again he is formless how many respects he has we cannot comprehend him why should we see that God is formless only the discussion came because that gentleman who entered into the room the editor he was mentioning about the promised Ahmad that time Brahma so much they were not going out of English him they had a body but at same time not induce but the peculiar situation and these to say these to read the punishes and also the bathers their peace was to be there but at the same time is to see the God we thought we don't believe because the Christians the Christians were ruling that time and the Christians say how can you believe in God in different form something for something six some time Dean and so many years these are all God's and educated people mostly educated in English medium schools so they were confused and slowly slowly in the whole society they become to group one on each okay and traditional induce and another educated modern induce and this modern Hindus it becomes are just simple practice that I do not believe in for so all these to select that and many of them they started getting converted into pure Christianity to stop that again different movement started in the human in the morning in the society and Arya Samaj prarthana Samaj Brahmins emerged all this so much the whole thing they say we believe in the Vedas but not in the way that there are so many gods or goddesses again in the Verona and Agni is ok but God is having all the qualities but not for so that was the struggle which Saddam occasion in one line is mentioning God can has the form and also the formless when we need we do not stand much struggle was going on and for so many thousands of years hundreds of years and people they were completely they were separated if someone is a pedantic they will never allow that waiting to come over there and do anything will never ever go to visit is a completely different even to give the marriage to the daughter to somebody's house they will ask what is your religion they're all Hindus there are brand names suppose a Brahmin family Manning the daughter to another in Germany and but they will go and ask what is your religion and if they see it is a sorry thank you why because we are operating okay so like these that was the society we now we won't be able to understand why I am talking because to just to understand the society TV in society and sedan vishna mentioned it to whom at ordinary person and editor of the newspaper and editor the newspaper if he gets convinced and he has the power to write then through him thousands of people will know and this is Saddam vishna so that's why now I am giving the table they are recording it within 10 minutes getting the online available and maybe different people sitting in different places they will put it on and all we were listening to you it's not just me had no opportunity for that but he never cared for that too because he was God I mean you this is going to reach out to each and every corner and anyone sincerely striving to realize God is going to listen cinema Krishna because that is true religion the broadness God is everything everywhere God has fought a kingly is formless how many aspect he has we cannot comprehend him why should we see that God is formless only that there is a question the moment I see the God is formless then what happens I am dick taking God that you cannot take the fall if we say God it's only this thing I am imposing those things on God God is all-powerful charissa all pervading can take any form how can you see there he's all-powerful all-perfect means anything we can do you notice sometimes there we are having their difficulty with the curse me the plot of land in India and the province is a part of it with the Pakistan and the India is going on for 70 years and every time the Indian Prime Minister's of the President or the authority directive go over there to celebrate in gaining lis pendens day and the blood will be highest rate over there why because this is our world that is the reason and the small part is there another gardener physical natural predation China is claiming the death part is ours and when the Indian Prime Minister visited going China is protesting hey that is our part why should you visit they don't know that we will go if I don't if I can't we see as a prospective Indian Prime Minister that means that bog doesn't belong to me I can't go anywhere otherwise in our map I cannot show it similarly the moment we say God is all-powerful and that very moment we have to accept God can be informed God can be without form it is God's power we have nothing to see you in drew that is the one amazing thing about the Brahmo Samaj there even a boy will be a sword see his God as wellis he is making fun of them the members of the party Shivaji do not object very much to God with fall they are allowed to attain ritualistic worship if it takes place in respectable families Brahmo Samaj there is first beginning so Adi Adi means the beginning and then they are the split so there's a Canada then finally the third one solder and Brahmo Samaj there's Rami be waken and the winner is young he was the member of solder and Brahmo Samaj that it was the prestigious the knowing you go to the solder and reminisce imagine then and the time came in began particularly when educated people this to think I have read the books of all of England under standard norm but reading the other windows books means is the prestige in the society then they'll be asking having read the art of in this mother or urban disease if you have not read there are okay so you have to be neat whether you understand or not to say I have and not only that if you go to the higher society Indian and they'll be certain what book you are reading now that is the culture and when you go to the other societies like the farmers and others they'll be telling hey what about the the greens how much grain is coming what are the things that you'll use it if it is their top but if you go to that the family like they're respectable families you have to talk about that you have to know otherwise you won't be able to communicate and you have noticed that most of the schools nowadays they are teaching the young boys in different games because when they become grown up if they are in a very high position maybe someday they have to go and have a meeting with another CEO with the table tennis are maybe the God and if you don't know how to play God if you don't know what for us it is the back because of the cricket but it is not bad this is something else you have to know so all these things otherwise you won't be able to mix in that because same we hear the Brahmo Samaj RT Brahmo Samaj divs to accept God with warm to some extent and then they had they allowed their members to be seen the ritualistic things that happening in other respectable families but next the no you cannot go the master smiling how nicely he has booted even a boy sees formless god the Shyvana babu does not believe in God the adi then the person is denoted Shobana he was also another detail of the drummer semaj he neighbor ki the God as used forms for the sake of his devotees this is a medical statement kata is making and BJ and all others they are sharing different experiences to respect it love it devotee sees God wit for Drupal had a vision of the Lord he said why don't you yearnings move that is a story of the true God and the Hindus that believe that it is not simply a story that's the fact that the distri the when a devotee he was the amazing God the God appeared before him and he saw think the devotee noticed the yearlings is not moving then are you not original are not believing come before me like that there's so many stories are there that there was a decoy as another two three minutes and he under disguise he was listening to Avila bata when other people all over the India they will be reading the part of Earth and explained and other word predict they always say so there they were listening and there the teacher he was explaining this Krishna and his brother Balarama with all different the Treasuries they always come out their mothers will put the on jewelry and particularly Krishna is having very very precious stone that will be on the top of his a and his mother decorating them and they come and play and that we play the flute also when all people winter with this man after that they come like that yes they come and they play it is written in the world so I am Telling You as is really costly yes then this man who was calculating instead of going here and there it was risky if we go and catch these two young boys who were alone coming without the company of their parents it will be so easy for me and all through my life I did not do all this world I'd be so rich so he asked where they can come just leave hurt this man the punty told if you go to a deep jungle the Liebherr would be there to stay away and when we left went it was happy the somehow I could get rid of him and he will go to the deep jungle they didn't go and suffer these men with great devotion but the funding told a few people can hear the sound of the flute because the little boy is playing you have to be very attentive and the boy he stresses like this his brother is like this their completion select East so all description this man was going on remembering teach and everything the Pontic same he was not thinking anything else constant meditation on the form of God and then complete attention not a single sound so that he should not miss the sound of the flute the krishna's claim then only you people to understand from which side these two boys are coming see you ain't in the deep jungle and he was waiting there was open up so he inside the jungle meter the price didn't play so this ground is necessary to play they be coming over here so let me sit under a tree hiding myself and wait between whole night past then the day broke and in there are a dawn he sound is coming somebody's playing the floor and so sweet his mind was going to the flu but isn't no I had gone to grab those two wires and to snatch all those the trilogy's from them I shouldn't meditate on the sound he was at was going to sleep so he woke up and slowly he waited truly asked for the description of the pundit that the teacher of the bhagavata he saw that her brothers are coming he went Damon to counter dagger and he said hey give me all the generalities that you are putting on and otherwise I'll kill you the Paladin the interpreter was standing quietly and the Jew nian one he don't see I have a flute that I can game but the jeweler is it belongs to my mother mother give it to me I cannot give it all this fluid what do we do it that's good I don't need the flute but I mean all the jewelers if you don't give me then I will hardly then the Krishna the little boy I say then you have to come and snatch it from us you have to touch me otherwise I cannot give it to you because my to be careful about all this the trailer is if I need in whatever take to my mother so conversation when this man we to take those things the moment in touch the game immediately he became just like stone his complete body and Steve but he joined the mind he stood over there then after some time we see and two boys practically and say hey you wanted to take away this thing there is no much time I have to go back come tomorrow same thing up in the second day then come tomorrow and the third day then he said you want this thing I will give and he truly gave many many gold and other things very costly that man came back to punt it and said so I have got all this you see they have given it to be and I have seen these two brothers they're so beautiful and the so gentle so courteous and I cannot I cannot forget them whenever i closing my eyes I see them standing before my eyes thank you the point it would matter truth have you seen it I don't say it like that but do you think then he showed all this jewelry is very costly but it can you please take me over there and he told come I can show it the both of them doubly waited for the night next morning then these two voice came and seeing him in tournay we give but things to you what you are putting in when this our teacher he wants to see you both he is not believing that you
