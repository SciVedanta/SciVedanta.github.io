[88. Panchama Veda 88 : The Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02LktqOPcOM)

religion where if you are interested to know what religion really is they try to without knowing the what religion try to do something some practices some good thing comes of course but when we know about that that is very good so we know that we are proceeding to the right path so that is the reason the God Himself came took the form of Sri Ramakrishna and he distributed this knowledge about which from awaken the saint star pacaya dharmasya he came to established religion how he stablished religion through knowledge and what is that knowledge the wisdom that he himself realized that he himself created and gave it to the the long long back to the Rishi's in the hearts of the Rishi's and that has become the Veda the realization of the Rishi's the pure hearted people well from that knowledge came from God who gave that knowledge to God to whom he gave to himself who in the form of Rishi's received it and then distributed so that is why this operation similarly in the modern age in a very simple way he is giving the same religion same truth same understanding same knowledge only blessed people can understand that and that is the reason the writer of the kilometer who noted down the words of C Ramakrishna he is telling just like the Rishi he noted it down and gave it to us he never added or subtracted anything from those words as he said similar same thing he produced so these are the words of the God himself we will come to know that but in such a modern way sometimes the incidents are happening the songs at their dialog are there so is more interesting but the same knowledge of the Veda the same knowledge of the God and who could give that God Himself the ceramic isne the God himself and his words are like the nectar please chant up to me double guitar rhythm dr. G venom could be very rhythm calm of sharp 'him stubborn among golem Sri madam who Bakunin de bourree dodging AHA this his words are just like Amrit the nectar now what the nectar helps we become immortal how one can become immortal not by physically but spiritually so that is the beauty of the Qatar omelet and this is possible only for those who can understand it like it and this is impossible for those who did some good work in the past life the past karma in our previous discussions we discussed about the four types of the Oshin by de bhakti Raghav opti gianna mr. bhakti should devotee these four types of devotions are there now our stage mostly by deducting with the rules and regulations and systems we are practicing the devotion to God but the first and foremost thing for devotion to God is faith the God is there and then only we can develop but the devotion the faith the love that comes when you come in direct contact with someone who is loving that person knowing that person otherwise it is impossible that's why Raghavan see Ramakrishna said satsanghis are dussangha when a man who has dedicated himself to for that ideology realized that living the life he only can Kindle another light from his own heart from his own light so kindling that light here the ceramic isne the God himself he has come to Kindle the light the lamp of knowledge and he is telling it was at about five o'clock in the afternoon the master Marcia giving the record see Ramakrishna was sitting on the steps of the prophets branda Hara Rakhal aim where near him has drama sure about him we all know this has Roger was a very known person among the devotees of sri ramakrishna he used to read a lot of Scripture now many people they read lot of scripture and they cannot digest it properly that is again another problem we'd like to know we must know the scripture but after reading the scripture the truth the teachings if we are not manifesting that practicing that in our life you know what is the use of that so that is the has remark I used to read a lot of scriptures but he only knew the scripture he never practiced see Ramakrishna is giving more and more importance on the practice so that he can realize it Asura is sitting over there and along it Rakhal Rakhal means the name of the his previous pre monastic name was recalled Shami brahmananda ji he was a great devotee and then him it means the master marsha mine renard Gupta so this three they were sitting and Hazra had the attitude of Ibadan tenth three ma master ma she is giving us that information the hosta had the attitude of Abaddonn team and what is that be hunting in one word he is telling I am he he means the god mostly they say I am that tha t t capital that that means it is not he or she but master Masha is mentioning here I am he that means I am the god I am the brahmana then the master sri ramakrishna is mentioning talking to hogr addressing him yes all one's confusions comes to an end if one only realizes that it is God who manifest himself as the artist and the believer the good and the bad the real and unreal that it is he who is present in wake and in sleep and that he is beyond all these see how clear what is bed anta this is Vedanta now ceramic isne is giving him wonderful explanation definition of Vedanta what is Vedanta God has become everything God has become everything this is the important thing and what type of everything then he is giving their all these different pairs good and bad God has become good and God has also become bad real and unreal so that way if we can understand the end there is no confusion Hegira is lead reading lot of scriptures he reads the Punishers the Veda and so many other things he can quote from there can decide from there but what is the use if you are not applying applying it in your own life so Serano Tichenor applied that and giving this God alone is the doer everything happens by his will H capital everything happens by his will the moment we can realize that understand that good and bad we can accept that beer that in a calm mind we doubt an agitation and that calm mind reflects the God and here the moment he said immediately Raja because Asura had the idea that I am I have studied a lot of Scripture but my brother this person is Rama Krishna has not studied anything so how can you say all this I am the person I have the authority because I have to read the book so I should say so he was telling immediately almost counteracting his telling but it is very difficult to understand that take the case of the sadhu of bouquet large Youkilis is a place so he was telling take the example of the shadow of bouquet Lars dear in those days in bucola something happened a sadhu a monk he was practicing meditation and he went into Samadhi but the local people ordinary people ignorant people they couldn't realize that they were not having any idea so they came to him and they saw that he is just like date so they wanted to put him and they dug a hole and then put his body over there in cover then someone told no no no we cannot do like that because a Hindu one so again they brought him and they started beating him with a rod so if them his life is there he later all these things happen ultimately he came down from the samadhi but because of these fools so what up so much of torture they didn't his body he passed away that it was a news in those days because of the some ignorant people a sadhu he has died over there now about the God what is God's the ramakrishna saying the god alone is the doer and about the brahman that a says I am he it says asana dirham veggetti Shia nor Ahtisaari bata is a wonderful way of explaining giving more than these one cannot explain this is an something that you have to realize it is not an object that we can judge we can touch we can see we can feel no it is not an object so naturally only thing by which we can understand that is some idea what is that those who have realized they're telling RC know Durham Bridget II sitting he goes far away dooda dooda means far but he is sitting and then shayana when he is lying down he jati servitor ha he is everywhere and this is the conception of the juggernaut temple that in Puri in Kaka India the juggernaut he is sitting because he's not having any legs of course again we make the mistake we always think that God has legs so they have made some golden dicks so they will put that golden legs and then they will take because some people the thing without ladies how one can go and God is not having the legs they'd have not read these they have not realized God is everywhere already so oisin adore Umbra jetty when he's sitting he can go far away because he's already there and shayana yachty sarvatah when when he's lying at that time he can go to any place so this is the main about the God God is everywhere all-powerful he can create and that's why see Ramakrishna saying God alone is the do are we think that we are doing there's a mistake the moment we can realize that we are not doing anything that is the realization I am NOT doing and sincerely we can believe that and then this person he went into Samadhi what is that Samadhi we know in the yoga version that says tada Caracara tada that means that that that the brahman the consciousness acara Academies the form a carita he is taking the form of that brahman that our car our car it that is called that samadhi when we meditate what we do we try to remember God within our heart that God the name of god or goddess that our guru has given in the mantra that we try to imagine within our heart when we are trying to imagine what happens and we can always man imagine God within our heart and by that way we forget ourselves we forget the surroundings so obviously what remains only that God and when it goes so deep it's called Samadhi cut a car Akari Taha in that they are total that's why they say you must remember God meditate on God what is the meditation though we are taking the name of God that is the hell by which we can counter the other thoughts what is the use of the diksha the mantra diksha why one takes the name because by that one can counter the other thoughts the name of god or goddess were countering the other thoughts but by that way when we are driving the worldly thoughts our mind is calm in the calm mind we are trying to reflect by imagining that god or goddess or my sister devata Devi is sitting within my heart and that way I am becoming God and Goddess so that is our new manji he showed that within his heart there is nothing but Sri Ramachandra that is called meditation that our car our car eat AHA that is called yoga darshan and bhagavad-gita says brahmma city what is meditation Brahman is TT his remaining in the Brahmin he is becoming resting remaining in Brahmin how to thought transforming himself the beautiful way the amélie brought them she wrote a beautiful poem and the name of the poem is the prism and there only you see one or two lines I am quoting fast a harsh of peace in the beginning the harsh of peace at the poets through their imagination trying to explain this fast a harsh of peace a soundless calm descends and then till art was lost to me this is important till art was lost to me the old surroundings it was totally gone so that is called the Samadhi in that Samadhi the book bouquet last among the referred over here by the Hegira he went into Samadhi in few lines be words this is what is Samadhi see Ramakrishna stealing man must reap the fruit of his own karma though he went into Samadhi but he had that type of painful depth his body should go in that way that was his karma voila that was his past and that is why we find like this we find so many ways very holy person very good person but death is like that and we wonder why it is happening it's because some karma Allah is there result is there but in the meantime see Ramakrishna is giving an example that in the olden times the kaviraja they used to prepare one type of May listen inside an ardent part and when inside the ardent part the cover is to cover with thick layers of clay and inside this to put some medicine some herbs some golden parts and all those things then this to cover and put it into fire and there was a time after that time dish to take it out and break that because medicine has already been prepared ready so they don't use they don't need that ardent power similarly this body is nothing but like an ardent part and within our heart when the God is deciding God is manifesting God is showing they notice the use of this body whether it remains of goes it doesn't matter so similarly we find that simcha Ramakrishna is telling the gut that monk about whom the discussion was going on in the vocal our idealized God he was in Samadhi and therefore though his body has gone in a very difficult way a painful way he had to die in a very painful way because of some ignorant people even then it was nothing because he has achieved everything the sadhu Abu Kailash was in Samadhi there are many kinds of Samadhi see Ramakrishna is explaining and then he is giving his own example my own spiritual experiences tally with the words I heard from a sod  Rishikesh there's also a very famous place in India the Rishi case where most of the people the monks they go I to in my life I went over there to Rishikesh and spent some time the mostly the shadows go over there but still now we can say the Rishi case has lost that charm of quietness because of the relation growth people are going over there reciting over the air and the hotels have come armed and so many other things that calmness is Lord but still so many people they meditated over there so Rishikesh is having one of the monks of the Rishikesh was commenting as a samadhi and what type of samadhi what are the experiences one gate when the samadhi happens Sri Ramakrishna is telling that that experiences standing with me I had the same type of experience how is it sometimes I feel the rising of the spiritual current inside me as though it were the creeping of an ant as though that the Shakti is creeping like an ant inside that our sushumna and second sometimes I feels like the movement of a monkey jumping from one branch to another again sometimes it feels like a fish swimming in water sometimes going down sometimes coming up like the fishes they enjoy swimming in the water and similarly that power is coming up or going down and taking this turn taking that term only he who experiences it knows what it is like and in another place the Ramakrishna say is like the movement of a snake that from the Kula Kundalini and it comes up to the sahasrara through that the channel and it moves like a snake that is the feeling you expressed in somewhere in Samadhi one forgives the world when the mind comes down a little I say to the divine mother mother please cure me of this I want to talk to people immediately after these he is a ceramic isness giving an statement and this is very important who is see Ramakrishna when sometimes we asked we talk or discuss here is giving the hint none but the Essure koti can return to the plane of the relative consciousness after attaining Samadhi Ashura koti those who are reading the gospel they know the different varieties of people up there and those who are realizing God striving to realize God they are also having the categories and among them the highest one is Scirocco t they are the god but still they have come down to show the practice of spirituality show the practice of austerity so they are called is Shahrukh ot and say Ramakrishna is telling only this type of people after attending Samadhi can come down and survive see Ramakrishna came down and see ramakrishna is talking praying is a Scirocco t know the answer is still after few lines some ordinary men attain Samadhi through spiritual discipline but they do not come back but when God Himself is born as a man sometimes some people after practicing spirituality they reach to that Samadhi state but they do not come back they die after that we have read in other places of gospel is twenty-one days they can survive in that condition why they can't survive because they attachment to the body that is gone and that is why sometimes the doctors didn't know some of the patient they lose that appetite don't feel like eating didn't feel like surviving that is a disease so unless they are having that desire to survive to lead to eat is very difficult for the doctors to keep that the patient alive after the Samadhi knowingly with a spiritual knowledge these people they start thinking one who has realized God Hartman start feeling though what is the use of this body the ugly body the dirty body filled with bones and all other things so they don't feel to keep that body alive and naturally they slowly the body which is sustaining on enough on the earth that body means only food and drink that only can help to sustain the body so that was heavy but it sure could he can come down now the God none but the circuit he can return to the plane of relative consciousness after attaining Samadhi but some ordinary main attain Samadhi through spiritual discipline but they do not come back they initially but when God Himself is born as a man as an incarnation holding his hand the key of others liberation this is very important when the God is taking the form of a human he is coming as an incarnation he is holding the key or the others liberation then for the welfare of humanity the incarnation returns from Samadhi to consciousness of the world he comes back after Samadhi see Ramakrishna used to go to Samadhi again and again and he we are talking about the monks one only in their life very very fortunate people once only in their life they risk to their Samadhi States and after that Samadhi those ordinary people after 21 days they they leap the body we sure could he come back and father's to talk about the samadhi to the people but only God is coming down from the samadhi with a key to help others to get that liberation and more master moshai who was noting the dialogue the conversation of Shri master master means the Sri Ramakrishna he is thinking to himself - the master master main.c Ramakrishna hold in his hand the key to man's liberation Marshall the money they received he is Kapil emotional the kepala means the skull that means this our forehead but it is not the forehead it is our all past actions past karma and that all the past actions past karma are the result of karma that can be wiped by God would that God Salameh Krishna usually the Hindu the Buddhist all they accept the karma fella but here the karma fellow can be changed by whom God and who is that God that's why see Ramakrishna he can do and undo anything so if we have only the faith that he they are talking her like this the Hofstra is telling in one way the one thing needful is to please God what does it matter whether an incarnation of God exists or not Hazara having that conversation he the argument the one thing needful is to please God what does it matter whether an incarnation of God exists or not then it was the day of the new moon gradually night descending and dense darkness enveloped the trees and the temples etcetera he is giving the master Marcia giving the description of the place now look at it the ceramic isne he gave in a statement and statement of fact that only God when coming and taking the human form he is holding the key like an incarnation Master Marcia householder he immediately understood is the hint that Sri Ramakrishna is holding the key but the Hajj romanza he started so much of Scripture he lives in this nature so near the next the immediately after the door of the Ramakrishna used to stay and he used to seem see Ramakrishna the God himself day and night but that or didn't come to him and he commented oh only we have to please God somehow don't care about the Incarnation this is there would be yogam the Rama when the God is pleased on me or someone what how he helps he gives the true knowledge understanding understanding what the words of God that is the way we should have to understand the master went into then there he is going there now the ceramic kitchen is stealing yes God can be seen and he is not mentioning the name so X is mentioning X has had a vision of God but don't tell anyone about it tell me which do you like better God wit form or without form formless reality then the master he is telling sir nowadays I to think God without fall but I am also beginning to understand that it is God alone who manifest himself through different forms yes Master Marshall who was influenced by the the Brahmo Samaj and he was to say can God has be to with form and without form that out was there now after coming to see Ramakrishna spending few days listening to him how his thoughts are changing he is understanding that God can be with form and without fall but my likings without fall then see Ramakrishna sterling will you take me in a carriage some day - moti shields garden and he is mentioning about it because the master he was describing this mater shields garden it is in the Calcutta only still that garden house is there and there was a there's a pawn still that pond is there it has not been changed anything it is still there and he used to come over the earth Ramakrishna Stu come over there to see the fishes and the wing he is to see the fishes enjoying inside that water immediately used to think all these Souls like those fishes are all swimming in the presence of the Brahmin and as if the Brahmin is that water is a huge pond and all different type of fishes the G bartmess all these souls the souls of those beings they are all playing here inside the water a brahmana and he's to see that immediately used to remember and go his mind is to go to there and before that here we must read an account is a very interesting whichever attitude you adopt you will certainly realize God if you have farm three from or formless it doesn't matter but if you have farm filled with Shasha the faith is is a one thing that comes after a lot of experiences when we are experiencing something then only we believe it is possible and in this way we can do a faith can come when I like someone respect someone believe someone and then accepting his words are hard words so that is the fate after experiencing it is very difficult now how many times we can experience all things we cannot experience so those who have already experienced if we are believing them accepting their words so it is very easy so then the faith is coming holding that faith when you are striving will reach to that conclusion to that truth also you may believe in God with form in are without form but your faith must be sincere and wholehearted faith must be sincere and wholehearted sometimes some people they come they take diksha and then after the taking diksha they will be thinking oh if I could remember that God all God is it would have been better because I like that is the weakness of mine suppose you get mantra of that God again after some days again they will start thinking oh if I could get that mantra or that God is all there if I could go this is the weakness of the mind the - well cinema history is telling when accepting accepted under two percent and put your mind and soul on that and they all otherwise all your energies are flickering away and it is becoming week time is very short in our life and now if we go on testing with a large buddha sometimes people go to buddhism and some days they would meditate and after fingers they will come back owner it is not helping then I will go to some like that they are going on changing changing changing what happens to them no success Sri Ramakrishna himself is telling a story then one person he wants to get a drinking water so he is dug in a well and he is tugging after some time you know what it is not coming leave that again he goes and start once again from the surface to dot that like that he is going on ducking the holes in different places but not getting the water so he is mentioning like this the whole hearted then he is giving an example of a person he was a landlord chumhum only there his garden house is still there in so just add adjacent to the teenager Shambhu Malik used to come on food from Bab Baha is a very far to his garden house at Dakshin Asia one day a friend said to him it is risky to walk such a long distance why don't you come in a courage carriage at that shampoos face turned red and he exclaimed I sit out repeating the name of God what danger can befall me see the faith I am taking the name of God and and starting going starting my journey taking taking the name of God God will protect me nothing is going to harm me that is the faith we take the name of God but at the same time we don't have that hundred-person faith the faith in the words under story the ceramic is too that if you parrot ills and parables of the Ramakrishna when book is there very interesting stories that there and that gives the explanation of so many high ideologies one little boy he was a poor boy is to go to school and from his house to school in between there was a jungle and he used to be afraid and is to ask the mother when please come and give me the company so that I can reach to my school mother was a poor lady she had to go for work and she told I cannot go God don't be afraid my son in that jungle your elder brother is living and his name is Madhu Sudan go and call mother Sudan Dada Dada means elder brother madhu shootin Dada I am afraid come and give me the company so that I can cross the jungle hundred-person faith in the words of the mother mother told that only to give some encouragement and the childhood go and really that happened he went and he started crying mother shootin Gaga mother told you are living somewhere here can't you listen to me I am afraid I cannot cross this and I am left I have to reach to my school then the Madhu show than the Krishna came and day after day he is to give the company to reach school and at the time of returning back from school and they stood a lot of chatting one day the mother she asked are you afraid now no why should I my elder brother Madhu Sudan Dada is there giving me the company the lady she couldn't realize the truth she was thinking the child somehow in the mentally she is thinking that he is getting a company there's good at least he is also going to school regularly and I am also free to attend my duties one day so happened that the teacher in those days the port is to collect some money the health first any function his mother died so the final ritual was there so he asked his disciples and the students please bring something I'm inviting some guests I like to feed them so bring something and he asked this boy what you can bring Peter I don't know let me talk to my mother he came back and told his mother again the mother was in difficulty and then she told why don't you talk to your brother maybe that he can help you go until mother Sudan he will give you something you can carry that again the hundred-person faith the child went over there and told mother Sudan Dada this is the problem mother cannot give anything but can you please give me something without taking something I cannot go the Medusoid on the other gave some yoghurt the small quantity of your garden to you take it the child he couldn't understand so he brought it I gave it to the teacher but teacher became very angry this little whom I am going to feed there are so many people how can I serve in any way angrily he just gave it to on one plate and when he turned that he saw that again it is full again he turned on other plate at the plate other for every time it was full even after feeding all those people it was full Poornima de poornamidham this is all full all the time because God gave it then the teacher understood something miraculous he told the boy who gave him my Dada my elder brother Madhu suden where does he live in the jungle can you please show me why not every day he is coming today also he will come he always helped me to cross that jungle because the lonely place so I will go and call and he will come you can also come along with me the teacher understood and he went over there the boy was calling calling calling this time God didn't come vain he was crying the teacher will misunderstand me he will think that I am lying why didn't you come then a voice came you are pure hearted and you are having 100% faith but your teacher is not so I cannot show myself to a teacher but he is very lucky that he has come along with you just because if we accompany he could listen my voice so this is what's ramakrishna told in this modern age we always try to get the experimental result but unless and until you have that sincerity to experiment it how can you get the result first and foremost Ramakrishna is telling God is there you can see God anyone can see God but you have to be sincere and you have to pray and God day and night and you have to forget yourself and whole the whole world all around you then only you can see God are you following that if we are following that if we have two hundred percent faith in the words of see Ramakrishna it is natural that we'll be able to see God then see Ramakrishna was talking in this fashion then one day the ceramic isne when he sat one lady came she was the maidservant of the temple but she was not having a good life when she was young but in even now she is practising see Ramakrishna used to encourage her to give donations through donations to give me because she earned some money by in a bad way but now see ramakrishna told you better go and serve the holy men donated for the good causes then he will get the blessings that lady went and saddam okay she is talking with him talking with her have you seen there have you been to Brindavan Banaras all this very famous places of Hindu pilgrimage so have you been there and any other holy places bhagavati that lady and she was very happy and she told how can I say that this is the system in India not to the brag about I I went over there this thing happen nothing happen the only very humbly they say but I have built a bedding place in their holy places like Banaras you will see all the steps somebody has donated the name is also written with an intention that holy people they are putting their their standing over there walking over there so their blessings will come with that faith only they do and my name is inscribed on that slab master indeed so he was encouraging hard nobody is said my name srimati bhagavati darcy that is inscribed over there and i put that over there master with a smile how nice but this lady couldn't understand the what this master is she is slowly developing coming to the purity just by donating but that doesn't mean that she could go and touch the god now what happened emboldened by the Masters words bhagavati approached and saluted him touching his feet like a man strung by a scorpion sri ramakrishna stood up cried out Govinda Govinda a big jar of Ganges waters stood in a corner of the room she hurried there panting and washed with that holy water the spot the met servant had touched the devotees in the room were amazed to see these things then bhagavati said as if struck dead sadhana Krishna consoled her and said in a very kindly tone you should salute me from distance some of the people they came to Sri Krishna when we are discussing Krishna's life and on fourth and fifth we observe and we know that comes I used to say in some type of very the bad people and they came with an intention to harm through Krishna but one was putana she came as a witness and she was telling please give the child I like to give some milk to him and afterwards she was killed by the Krishna and very painful death because the holiness touched by that whenever the darkness come to light what happens it breaks so that's why it cannot be if you purify yourself then only you can come and touch see ramakrishna is telling jesus also telling the all that has been created by God but the same God has created both the purity and impurity those who are taking impurity and their mind is covered with that they cannot go near to God unless and until they are cleansing them themselves Jesus told pure in heart can see God can they shall see God but purity is necessary this lady is slowly becoming pure Salama Krishna is also encouraging it's not the untouchability that we must understand sometimes the modern days when we read like these without understanding anything immediately they will take all cinema Krishna that because that lady and she was poor and she was not remain and she touched and what is there no wrong thing we have to understand the thing in a different way so this ceramic isne wanted to console her it is not that she was not he was not liking her she he was encouraging her but at the same time it was not the time the preparation in heart mind was not ready final to touch God so naturally it was not that lack of putana then afterwards in the Bhagavata it mentioned when they were burning the body a putana a wonderful fragrance came from that body why because it was touched by God though she had a very painful depth but at the same time she was free from all the scenes just here also he finds the ramakrishna is not giving any harm to the glady rather he himself is taking that and he was feeling so much of pain in his holy body he ran and he was washing that particular spot of his feet where she touched with the ganges water and then he was consoling her saying with very kindly tone you should salute me from a distance because you are not ready yet in order to relieve her mind of all embarrassment the master say tenderly listen to a few songs and the way he ceramic esna was treating art and see Ramakrishna was singing to pacify that lady want the very famous song see ramakrishna sang Appa naughty moon a politico ji Onuaku category dwell know my mind within yourself enter no others home if you got sick there you will find all you are searching for so we are going here and there that lady is going to different the holy places to get some purity doing some buts Adama Krishna is telling if you are sitting in one place taking the name of God that will help you that's why sometimes we say to our devotees when you are going to different places nothing wrong is good but at the same time your penetration your concentration is becoming weak so in one place if you are coming and sitting and just going on praying praying and praying to God you will get everything up on ottoman upon ethic oh gee Onuaku category and it was afternoon ceramic Ishta was telling the devotees about his experiences during his god intoxicated state and he saved what a time how we will know every young boy came I think yesterday and he was asking its seventh standard seventh grade and he was asking how I will know that I have got the blessings of God suppose I am going on praying to God but how I will know this is a wonderful question and then I told that if you are blessed by God all your wishes will be fulfilled and if you are blessed by God then there will be no hindrance all things will be in that way all people will be in such a way all your wishes will be fulfilled that is exactly what the ceramic isne is mentioning either I want something to eat he is to say after the meditation he felt that the blessings of God just to testify this is true or not used to say I like to eat this and that type of food is to come and I will conclude today's our discourse by quoting from the life of our Raja Maharaj his name pre monastic name was recalled Rakhal means the cowherd boy because Saddam Oh Krishna saw him in his manner that is the meditation that he was the companion of Shri Krishna that the cowherd boy and then afterwards he saved though apparently you see he is so calm and quiet and don't talk but he had the capacity to rule escaped he can could become a king from then onwards Shami become used to call him as raja raja means the king so when they raja maharaj so they still call him he was meditating practicing austerity by the side of the Jamuna somewhere so they made a little aha that tachat room wish to leave in that and hold a long wish to see it and take the name of God and meditating and reading all the books one day he was thinking for a long time I didn't eat the Lucci you know the Bengal is they're very fond of duty and some aloha the Mater is a kind of a sweet so if somebody could bring the heart Lucchese and halwa that would be very nice it simply thought like that again he went into that meditation deep meditation and suddenly he heard somebody's calling him Babaji open your eyes had brought your food and he saw that lucci and halwa and he told how come that he you brought this no no no my god Ramachandra ji he showed me in dream Raja Mara's thought immediately the God in the form of Rama Chandra because that person he was the devotee of sri ramachandra so the Rama Chandra appeared in the dream and told my son is sitting over there he is hungry take these two type of food he likes it go and give it to him Sri Ramakrishna is Rama that proves and then Raja Morris told how do you know that is me Rama told there's my son is a mom sitting over there no no no he showed you over there first time I did ignore
