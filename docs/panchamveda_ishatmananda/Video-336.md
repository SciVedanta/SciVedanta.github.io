[337. “Harmful Ego.” - Panchama Veda (337)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDk-isxfvSk)

namaskar dear devotees and Friends let us begin the study of the Pancham Veda Gospel of sirama Krishna with this stotra jivanam angalam srimadatam movie the last of Wednesday we were studying the bhagavan cinema Krishna is mentioning about the birth and death and he said that it is like a magic now somebody is born and then after a few days is it dead it goes on for us the ordinary human being the 75 years or 80 years that that is a big time long time but according to the nature the time if I say it is nothing so he is mentioning it is just like the magic the he was mentioning in gospel the page number 788 birth and death are like magic you see the magic for a second and then it disappears God Alone is real and all else unreal friends this is really at this moment when you are living in this 21st century when all things are constantly consumerism and these things are going on is very difficult because in our school we never hear this type of things and then in the society also nothing like this we only live for this today and you have to grab these you have to have that like this and that no one says that there is God and some of the they call it faithfuls they will go to the churches or the synagogue or the temple and they will be praying that two praying mostly majority praying for their own wealth their own health their own protection their own enjoyment give me these give me these give me this for that they will go and suppose they don't get that they will stop that visiting that Temple they will go somewhere else where they will get the worldly things but why because they think most of us we think that if we get this type of things in the world then we will be very happy but we experience complete unhappiness because after achieving that having that it is so temporary that we lose that and there is only excitement and there is nothing joy we are imagining joy happiness suppose a rich man is going through the street he is thinking I am rich but the all people around they don't know him so they are not caring about him then his people will be coming and go away he's the rich man is going and the very famous person the newspaper they will publish about him then people will say oh he is that that much but only for that we are spenting our whole life then one day suddenly the death comes and we go away this satisfied and again to satisfy our desire we are taking birth and we do not know that this is a very very difficult because we do not know where we will take birth again so it goes on like that some people say don't believe in this but whether believe or not it goes on in this way that is the law of the nature Karma fala you cannot go beyond that so this going goes on in this way bhagavan's ramakrishna is mentioning is the page number 788 birth and death are like magic we have read that God is like an ocean and living beings are its baubles so unique example that he is giving so we also having all the properties of God this is the meaning the bubble and the water the bubble is also made of water and it is floating on water and thinking that it is separate from water anyway that thinking is the problem so that is called ego bhagwan sirama will mention that so this ego is separating us and when we are separated from God we suffer why we separate ourselves because we think that we are separate we have our own personalities we have our own the wishes and all that the moment we are separate we suffer because the source of joy is God so this way we have to understand God is like an ocean it's not just ordinary it's a huge huge water body that means God is all pervading and we the the beings particularly human being the best creation of the nature because of the thinking capacity cognizing capacity judgment capacity so these human being is a very special creation of God or nature and if we are not utilizing the god-gifted capacities of understanding things properly judging thing properly did we suffer we are utilizing that capacity for development of material things we know when the wind is blowing in this way the building should be constructed in such a way the wonderful way they do The Architects excellent way they will be constructing those buildings the drawing those building in such a way even the costy wind cannot disturb the buildings then the earthquake there are systems that they will protect the buildings from the all this how they're doing it utilizing the intellect that the God has given to us but we are not utilizing that capacity to understand that there is something which is permanent which is all consciousness and we are part of that our Consciousness our judgment capacity our intellect that we call it everything is nothing but the part of that pure consciousness the moment we understand that that we become very happy we will be living like this but we won't be carried away sweet we by all as you call happiness or appreciation or acceptance or dejection rejection sorrow nothing like that so this is the way only bhagavan's ramakrishna is mentioning God Alone is real make an effort to cultivate love for him and find out the means to realize him find out the means to realize him and that is called religion different type of means are there processes at their paths or their systems are their religion that you should see to facing this way and then you should do these you should do that so they develop like that but it is all external only whether you are covering your body or not covering or looking at this side let us say it is all external thing main thing is to understand that we are very very temporary and whatever we may be a bigger or a king we are going to die whatever we are accumulating the wealth and all that we are going to leave it over here maybe in our in the bank we will have millions and billions or trillions but suddenly there may be God for wheat you leave long I pray but suddenly if something happened then what what is there who is going to utilize those the bank balance nothing so we have to understand how far we should so sudama Krishna is slowly slowly bringing this truth to us we are we should not be afraid only we should be aware the time is short everything is changing then why all this thing that we do only for our ego to prove that I am somebody in this world and my because I am having a tremendous power whenever I say go and fight thousands and thousand people will go and give their life I am a great leader only for my ego I am forcing these people to go and die and suffer but why should I so this is called proper thinking I should not be in such a way creating problem for others rather my effort should be to give happiness to each and everyone each and everyone I'm a king so this is my duty I am so doctor this is my duty a lawyer a teacher a professor each and everyone is having his duty so we are doing that much and then we say this much we can do so sudama Krishna is mentioning the I must search my own path and apart the Modern Age Swami Vivekananda introduced the karma yoga you need not to give up your karma or your duties only detach yourself from that that much so this is a understanding and practice and moment we can do that what result we get appreciation appreciation for that only we are everyone we are dying on for that people should appreciate people should remember people so some people different way they are trying to present themselves so that people should know about them what are the people how long they will remember and anyway that is but the moment we understand that I am getting the benefit of joy and happiness because I'm a free person I am not bound by the desire some people will clap and then only I will get the happiness then I am a slave slave of the clappings some people will be there to clap and then only I will be happy we have to think in this so that's why bhagavan Salama Krishna said that make an effort to cultivate love for him each Capital God and who is nothing but love unselfishness so if we too and we are also the creation of God and we are having the same property of God we are having the same quality of love and unselfishness as because of the ego where from it came again because of the God's power we call it Maya in vedanta deluded us but why that is this Divine Play We do not know but now the challenge is I have to go back to the source which is nothing but the joy because I want joy the happiness the Bliss and how I will do that sirama Krishna said find out the means to realize him as because in the present age everyone is so busy when they are not busy they are thinking the way frustrated what to do I get up and there is nothing to do for me so they are going for other things the bad things they will drink they will take the narcotics and all that it is not necessary you can engage yourself in so many good ways so many good ways so that is called karma yoga Karma means action yoga means Union mentioned like that we can think what will think me best can I go and sit in a corner of the room all quiet and meditate with drawing all my senses from the sense objects and concentrator it is your path if you feel good in that or you are reading the books and discriminating and analyzing and thinking I am not this body I am not this mind I am the Supreme self I am the consciousness like that also gyanama or going to the temple or having a shrine in my own room on my own house and cooking for the god cleaning with the god singing for the god dressing they are offering flowers burning incense sticks and constantly I am feeling the company of God that is my path or the four yogas as Swami Vivekananda as given in the ramakrishna mission and vedanta Society monks and the devotees we all follow the combination of four you have to find out some means to go over there but before that you have to have the discriminative capacity to understand what is God and God is there you have to have the faith in that then only all this comes and he is mentioning and of course I that we quoted from the the and the vedanta they always talk in this way jagrat sapna susupti see sometimes the devotees they think about God only for them God is but there is another path is also there in Hinduism that the ghanis that time they are not thinking about God but the consciousness this difference if you do not like that path to an unnecessarily criticize them all are valid paths and all these paths have been tested and successful people are there some are taking the path of devotion where God is the main they constantly see the face of their beloved God and listen to their the the God is singing or playing the flute all those things and they're so happy that is your path and don't complain to others when they are just trying to analyze it you have the emotion you have turned that emotion to devotion and then you are happy with that it is your path go forward but at the same time when someone is seating and discriminating and he's thinking that I am awake I am asleep and then there is a another stage Beyond this two why unnecessarily you should criticize them say that is not the path no no so we have to understand it that's why it's ramakrishna I am reading again and again find out the means to realize him find out you you should find out the means the best means for you and realize each soul is potentially Divine Swami Vivekananda the beautiful quotation the wonderful way he presented the goal is to manifest the Divinity by controlling nature external and internal do this either by philosophy or by devotion or by unselfish work and or meditation either one or all of them and be free that is the main thing free from what ego it is the word again and again it comes that there are some the groups of people they are practicing religion and their name is anahamkari ah means Negative they don't practice ego or the harm God is ego bad Swami bhagavan is mentioning the ego which is attaching us with this worldly things is bad but the ego which is helping us to take the decision is good so we will come to that the now in the meantime the captain about with Captain we all know those who are following this class you know the captain he was the ambassador of Nepal King and to the British India in Calcutta used to live he has come with his children to kishori the one of the devotees please show the temples to the children usually the same thing we also do because they won't understand all this philosophy and they will bore take them to show all this he began to talk to Captain aim Division and other devotees were sitting on the floor see ramakrishna was sitting on the small couch facing the north he asked Captain to sit in front of him on the same couch master I was telling the devotees about you your devotion worship and arati the the one the way the cell they worship the god in the evening yes the and the captain the he was bashfully he is mentioning what do I know of worship and aarti how insignificant I am now he was humble that's good but no that humbleness is it true now bhagavan Cinema Krishna the world teacher he was helping the people to understand each and every movement of the Mind I am enjoying the appreciation at the same time apparently I'm saying oh I am not nobody I am nobody it is good when you are saying like that but you have to be genuine satta samsuddhi a Sanskrit word that has been used in the bhagavad-gita satwa samsuddhi the purification of the Mind and bhagavan sirama Krishna in his own language he said what is the spiritual practice to whatever you are truly thinking you should speak that and whatever you are saying you should keep those promises live after that is called satta samsuddhi and sudama Krishna when he said the captain of course he was good he said in that way now sudama Krishna is explaining it's for each and everyone including captain only the ego that is attached to the last 10 gold is harmful but the ego that feels it is the servant of God does not harm to anyone anybody the ego that is attached to the last and gold the desire and to satisfy the desire we want money wealth so the last and goal the sudama Krishna again and again mentioned then that is the only problem in spiritual life all other things that we see is nothing actually because sometimes we think that or we I should not look at the money I should not touch money and this is all practices are there but money is not the problem gold is not the problem food is not the problem objects are not the problem problem is your thought how you are thinking in that way the moment the desire is there to grab that to possess that to have that then it is binding but it was just enjoying it is okay there is nothing no problem because sometimes we go and see what are the things that are happening why people are so much mad about it let me go and see what is there so this is the way if you are going in just as a cure for the Curiosity you are going and seeing a new attachment to that you are not bound by anything so sometimes we think the external behavior of course for the sannyas in the external behavior is also necessary but at the same time sannyasi there is a kind of sannyasa that they are completely free from all these and they should be and that is why when they are living in this world they are visiting the houses of the devotees visiting the hospitals visiting the the different type of places of all this they are doing but they are not at all actors to those those things is a very special type of practices one should do but the main thing is not the attachment one should not be attached to that when we are free from that then whether all those things are there or not what does it matter but it to be away from that because there is no challenges this mind is thought when you are again and again if you see if you read if you hear the Mind may go over there so it is better to avoid but some people they develop that capacity and there is nothing so this is the way we have to understand so sometimes something that has been said to some people and we think that is applicable to each and every one that is the problem religion is not like that is completely freedom is there but the main thing the goal is to develop detachment not aversion but detachment so that Detachment now I don't like to look at the because I am a male body so I am not going to look at the women and that is my tapestra and for that one type of people that some people they're doing like that is okay for them but then they should go to the solitude in the forest in the Hills not in the cities or towns when the people are there there you cannot behave like that insulting others there is a sort of insert we should not so we have to think in that way my process is completely away from all those things which are tempting my mind may go over there may like to have that and by the way my going towards God will be disturbed well you should not be in the cities for that the caves the quiet places away from the vertex of all these okay but when you are in the cities you should not behave like that there are swamis they do not put any clothings the completely just like the sky sky is not having any cover so they think in that way and they are roaming in that they are not that the developing the mind in so the Mind should not come to the body they don't care about that no clothings no proper the houses to stay and don't keep the food or anything just roaming whatever comes they will eat and by that way they are surviving but they cannot live in the cities they are not supposed to so this you have to understand choice is yours and not that that has to be imposed on each and everyone you have to understand this the modern society and the intellectual level has developed so much so obviously these are the small small thing if we can understand some of the practices somewhere because of the Veda because of the atmosphere the the thousand years before the religion that is developed that to assist that situation was completely different Society was different lifestyle was different so we are trying to impose those lifestyle that was in thousand years before now in present age both in those days our great Souls rishis this to walk so you should not be using any vehicle any type of transport you should also work is that religion if you like you can practice but you have to be away from the modern society but this we have and that is religion and should be imposed on each and every one that is also wrong religion has nothing to do with the external things it is all connected with the mind and that the mind which has understood that God is real is eternal is only existing and all that we see is nothing but the miracle of God and I should not be deluded by the miracle of God I mean enjoy but should not be deluded by that when a magician is showing the magic we enjoy he stopped that I am going to be deluded not like that we enjoy his magic but at the same time we are not deluded you know this is the magic he is showing this one moment next moment it will be completely different thing that is called knowledge and with that knowledge if we approach god with your devotion then it is Success so Guyana Mishra bhakti understanding the reality what is God God is love and to develop love I don't need to cover my body all the time if it is cold okay and if I need the okay otherwise normal grace is sufficient anywhere because it is mind so anywhere I can practice that because it is thought when we will understand this the religion has nothing to do with the social things it is completely our own and the person when he's developing he is developing love only love for each and everyone is an unique asset of the human society so that religion it makes a brilliant man man unto God Swami Vivekananda he is giving the definition of religion the mix of Bruton to man a very selfish person ignorant person who lives only for himself coming in contact with the religion slowly developing the sympathy for others love for others care for others constant for others that is religion if religion is teaching the torture and hatred that is cannot be religion it may be something else but not religion religion is constantly helping the human mind to develop develop where God one should become God is going to God going to get the blessings of God that is very clear and who is this God then all powerful all merciful all all pervading all all those things that we are saying then if it is so that those qualities also should come into us otherwise what is the used I go to a teacher to learn music now if I can't learn the music properly from the teacher then what is the use of going over there and spending years and years so you must imbibe the qualities of the teacher and the way he or she sings and I also can produce that type of music and songs then I am really loving my teacher and respecting my teacher and honoring my teacher otherwise what is the use of it it should not criticize my teacher then I will go and fight with you that doesn't do it there teacher himself or herself won't be happy with that type of students so this is religion religion to understand the truth and then practice to learn the truth imbibe the truth and what will happen transformation a complete transformation and that transformation makes a brute unto man and man unto God and God he symbolizes all love unselfishness so this bhagavan Cinema Krishna is mentioning the problem is with the ego and if we the in the bhagavata it says describe in a very very wonderful way very clearly Hindus they believe in the bhagavata it says that the creation the Supreme Being who is all pervading all consciousness certainly a thought that I should create now after the creation I should enjoy but I will create how there is nothing else but me so as if there is a pro there are different type of explanations that vedantine they will talk in different way the Dwight in a different way that the freedom is there I am talking about the bhagavata where the duality then that Supreme Being created Brahma the firstborn the Brahma the firstborn and he gave the knowledge to Brahma his creation and separated himself he out of himself that Supreme Being created Brahma and name has been given and that all the knowledge was given to him and he was given the freedom to create now he was creating different things and the beginning he created the wonderful human being and they are known as The Four Brothers Kumar and also in the Narada out of his mind he just thought and they were born and this is the way then he created the rishis because some rituals are there the system should be there the school should be there to and the society simply you cannot say oh this is this and that you have different type of people are there they are understanding acceptability so the rishis were created the some nine rishis or so they were created Etc so these rishis were also there then he found the still the creation means they should help to create the human being but nothing they are not ready because their mind was so pure if the mind is not coming to the body then you cannot think of the other things so then he created prajapati the rulers at this prajapatis he created out of his mind but he gave them ego and this ego separated them from him the Brahma the god he gave the ego and this separated and now he understood and this prajapati started creating those who have read the bhagavata listening by the discourse on bhagavata you all know the fast the Manu was created and along with the Manu satarupa the the wife of the Manu both were created from them other started the beginning of the creation and there was devahuti Deva hoti was married with another Rishi who was created by Brahma from his mind and he was also very pure he never wanted to be in that but the Lord himself said no you have to take the responsibility and marry that lady who will be coming to you and Etc etcetera all these stories goes in the bhagavata so the shatarupa came and the kardama muni married her as because the God say and then the Rishi afterwards all children started come taking birth and they are slowly slowly burying the rishis and all the stories goes now our thing is what will happen to these people who were born out of God and then the god separated them from him by giving the ego the eye sense what is going to happen to them because we know that everything that is this creation is nothing but temporary and from our own experience also we can say this is all everything is temporary the history of the human the Human Society do we find that it is nothing but temporary Kings after Kings Heroes after Heroes they came and they ruled the country he said then afterwards where they are we go to visit those ruins to see the Great Hero so in the ruins only so we have to understand the temporariness and then what will happen to us so the rishis that Creator the Brahma he gave the knowledge to the rishis karishis do the where in the world they were they were married they were having their children they are having their property but they were not attached to those rishis as an example that be in the world but not of the world that both should be on the water but water should not be in the boat inside the boat that is the technique that much is telling only the ego that is attached to last and gold is harmful but the ego that feels it is servant of God does no harm to anybody I am the servant of God I have to work for this and I should do these I should do that but servant of God it's not for me and when I am serving the god what I am trying to do making everyone happy as best as possible helping all without any discrimination or they belong to my church so I will help them and others not wrong way you cannot help anyone then you cannot get the benefit of spirituality if your mind is closed in this way we have seen the people are suffering but still there will be group of people they will help only their religious or the Clans and all that and others by the side of them they won't look at them in the life of sister nivedita the Margaret Noble the great famous the lady disciple of Swami Vivekananda she was also having this experience then she got distrusted because the church where she used to work in school they told you cannot help everyone those who are coming to us only only to them but that was the conflict and she left then afterwards came in contact with Swami Vivekananda and Vivekananda said the whole world is yours you must love each and everyone no narrowness expansion is life contraction is death SRI ramakrishna is mentioning if your ego goes out to help others and we doubt any expectation then you are free same ego but I have to go because the creation of God they are suffering the human being and nothing but the the god in different form I must go and serve them so this is the way bhagavan's ramakrishna is mentioning that ego that I should help the karma yoga based on these I am going to serve but not that I am the master and serving the Fallen people no I am the humble person and serving those gods in the form of human being are animals and birds any being the moment we utilize that ego that way that ego is not going to bind us ego is dangerous because of the ego we are separated from God and because you are separated from God we are suffering Life After Life going on in the circle of birth and death again and again because of the ego a same ego it is a power when we are utilizing that power in a wrong way it destroy us the same power whenever we are utilizing the proper way it helps us so this ego the sudama Krishna is mentioning that ego that is attaching to the worldly things is dangerous is wrong it is bad harmful but the same ego if you are turning that power that you are turning towards God I am the son of God we are the children of God we cannot make mistake we should not behave like this in each and every step I must be very careful because I am the son of God and if I make any mistake then people will criticize my father my God that ego same ego and that power is taking us towards God with this kind of ego one is able to love Ananda friends again and again we have to remember Ananda is that is the approach of the vedantin vedantin means those who are following the path of knowledge and if we go towards that takes us to God again the same vedantin those who are following the path of Duality non-duality The Duality the sachidananda it is impossible to get rid of the ego is very difficult because the God has given it the obviously it is a tremendous power therefore it should be made to feel that it is the devotee of God he is servant and the devotee of God and who is God who is pure he is love he is unselfish he is all loving so I should behave like that so in the Christianity also the Jesus is again and again mentioning in that way God Is Forgiven you isn't it then why you should not forgive your brother forgive your brother so this is the way spirituality if you are thinking from the point of view of politics or the economy no you won't get the answer but from the spirituality who is going to be spiritual those who have understood the temporariness of this world this is the first basic thing if you have understood that temporariness of this world then only your spiritual life begins but if you have not understood it at all then if you are listening to this you will be confused then what will happen to me what will happen to that no it is not that way the sachidananda the one goal of the Hindus that is called vedantic at The Path of Knowledge bhagavan is a path of the same vedantin devotion then paramatma the path of same vedanta at through yoga so this is the way it goes a goal has been given different names but it is the same thing and it says that utilize the tremendous power that God has given to you in the form of ego when I say I can do this we really we read sometimes some people they're so powerful they were having the cancer then the right hand side became paralytic but still that person thought I have to do something I must be successful and sometimes the 70 years old person he thought that I should complete at least graduation from the college and he started again in the admitting himself in the college at that age and then completing one after another all these years and come out with the scientific tremendous mental strength the people are laughing people don't know what you are going to do with the certificate now now I must complete it I was listening to a lady who promised to her father that I must complete my PhD with all the difficulties all the business all the different type of problems ultimately she completed because the her only strength was I promised to my father and I must have to keep the world tremendous strength it is not ordinary thing very very very powerful mind and that power when he's turning to God I am going to realize God all these things all around me I'm not shunning them I won't talk to anyone I want to look at this I want to in the beginning it is okay to some extent but afterwards when you know it doesn't matter anything because you are completely clear that all these things that you see all around you are temporary they're all going to go away only God is there that I have to reach over there and God is nothing but the excellent qualities in the bhagavad-gita it says in the 16th chapter again and again I feel like telling the first three verses are the 16th chapter of the bhagavad-gita those are the qualities in any religion any faith any path anywhere if the people those who are following the path of God can develop those qualities whole world this our human world will be heaven we need not to go for seeking to go to heaven heaven will be here because all good people the all caring for each other that is the heaven so is it says in this way with this kind of ego one is able to laugh shachidananda it is impossible to get rid of ego therefore it should be made to feel that it is the devotee of God the servant otherwise how can one live how intense was the love of the gopis for Sri Krishna and to Captain please tell us something about the gopis you read the bhagavata so much the bhagavati is a very famous book and and it is the very popular very famous the many of the people they read bhagavata and it gives in a beautiful story way but is a mixture of knowledge and devotion it is not only emotion it is a pure devotion but the devotion is the pure devotion can be when there is knowledge complete clear idea about the God the God can take any form God can take any time any form if this is not there the mind is not clear about it then it will be a sectarian idea again the same book as because my idea is not clear I become a sectarian but somebody is not talking about Krishna then they are not devotees they are all sinners how do you know this is the ego that speaks so when the knowledge is there anywhere any people that whatever way they are worshiping me the god the sum total of love and purity anywhere in any system in any time any place all coming to me because God is one and we only give different names the truth is one the people call in different names that is the goal that is the teaching of bhagwan's ramakrishna he is embracing each and every one in Bengal it says the embracing each and every one no one is left out no one that is religion and that sirama Krishna that's why whatever he says is so true but sometimes some people because of again the narrowness sectarian-ness and they don't read the gospel even if they read they misunderstand so we have to understand our ego should not be there when you were reading and trying to understand very clear way if I don't like this it is okay I don't like that but some people may like it said the same item and maybe the potato some people like fried some people like with the some ah the gravy and some people like the potato to eat in a different way that they are taste the same religion someone is behaving like this someone is practicing like that someone is so it is there it is their choice why should I hate so this is the reason again and again we have to understand religion is the only soulless religion is the only way we can bring peace to this world True Religion clear understanding otherwise hundreds and thousands of signing the contract understanding memorandum cannot bring peace to this world the heart should be clear thought should be clear and their idea should be each and every being are made of that Supreme Being and we are all going to back to that Supreme Being and how you know that we are going back to the Supreme Being because all of us we want stability we like to leave all of us we like to know the knowledge and all of us we like to enjoy these are the common qualities in every human being in every being and that is the quality of the Creator the god the Allah the Jehovah the bhagavan so that is the CR the Creator is that now the choices are different that is all okay but now how we will go over there utilizing our tremendous Force which has separated us from the god that is the ego and after the separation where we go we go to the gods creation and when you go to that God's creation it is all temporary then we do not become satisfied again we suffer again we try some other way then I'll ultimately we have to turn the not towards the creation but towards the Creator then when we are turning our mind again the tremendous force is necessary to reach over there and that is again ego and how we should utilize that ego I am the daughter of God I am the Son of God I am the servant of God I am the friend of God there are so many ways we can go but I belong to God the moment I see what will happen to me I will become humble it's not the ego that says oh I am going like that nothing like that it will become humble because God is all pervading whatever I see all around us is the manifestation of the same God because except God there was nothing and when I see the other people some are suffering some are cruel type some are very good the varieties of God why God created them to enjoy this play in the movie in the story what we find different type of characters then only we enjoy so that is God's creation I don't bother about that by my goal is to reach back to the Creator and on the way whoever is coming before me I am trying to serve them to love them that much so this is the way so hatred should go away discrimination is that I should not hate anyone because God is behaving in that fashion I have nothing to do like that but I will say God you are in all these different way good good you enjoy but I like to go back to you my goal is your lab I don't want anything else give the example of the small babies children sometimes they are happy with some dolls and candies but then they will go I like to go to my mother so the mother is the only goal if the aunties and the neighbors and others are also offering come I will no no no no no I like to go to mother only so like a child one pointed and the ego I like to go back to my God because God is my own except God there is nothing and I cannot live without God so that is called spiritual journey and the journey towards the origin towards the Creator and towards the peace happiness so this journey we will continue the at the bhagavan cinema Krishna is mentioning Captain words awaken the intense love for Krishna in the mind of bhagavan Sid ramakrishna what is that word when SRI Krishna lived at brindavan without any of his Royal splendor even then the gopis loved him more than their own Souls so when there is a rich man influential person we love them that is maybe because of his property and all that but when we don't know that he is a king or a prince but still we love not for his property but for himself or herself that is true love so this is the way we have to understand is therefore SRI Krishna said how shall I be able to pay off my debt to the gopis who surrendered to me they are everything the God loves those who have surrendered everything at the feet of the god so when the captain upadhya he was quoting from the bhagavata then sirama Krishna felt that the one-pointed devotion towards God go peace the Krishna 4000 years before but now when we are remembering immediately as because the mind was not attached with the worldly things immediately the moment that indication came the word came Krishna the mind went to that supreme god and that goes to and Govinda Govinda Govinda the another name of Lord Krishna did this Govinda he is uttering the name of the Govinda and slowly going into that unconscious stage he is there all around people are there he's sitting in his room but he is forgetting everything that is going into the samadhi and each and every one captain and all others they were amazed how blessed is he how blessed he is the captain was telling like that friends we will read the next passages lines afterwards if you have any question is asking how should we avoid worldly people this is very difficult to judge who are worldly people you know the mostly the people they love their own they are not only people that way so some people they love their house their job their family that is normal but when a person who is a very selfish and he when that person won't hesitate even to kill his own people his relatives and Friends cheat them for his own benefit that is called worldly people but those who are too much of attached to the worldly things and the physical thing egoistic of course it is better to avoid them how to avoid now when they come before you as bhagavan Cinema Krishna is mentioning then talk with them very politely nicely without disturbing their ego they may not do anything good to you but they may harm you so that is why the another great Saint he taught the people will be talking like that you say oh yes oh yes but you know within yourself what is true so that is the way you have to avoid them not clashing with them avoiding them keeping them in Good Humor thank you the now let me chant this Mantra and we conclude foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] Shanti is too [Music] [Music]
