please repeat after me the walkathon written dr. jay burnham kobe be rewritten Calma shop sovereign among golems 3 madam booby Gannon de bourree dodging aha now in our last tuesday class we have read and discussed the conversation at the Vagabond cinema kishna had with addition devotees today will also read again the last part where three more the master masha wonderfully described how two holy souls raghavan serum vishna the ghoul and narendra marched in spiritual realm it was about five o'clock in the afternoon sri ramakrishna left his room the devotees were walking in the garden many of them were about to leave before we have already read that they all came they sat and talked now is the back end of the day they were strolling here in the and then preparing to leave for the houses the master was conversing with Raja on the North veranda with a beautiful picture they were talking of nor English frequent visit to another the eldest son of the googas that the family ceramic business to keep watch on that particular boy Marina so where he is going whom he is meeting all these things why because he knew that one day he will become a great soul and that is the reason like the mother always conscious about the company of her son he was also ceramic issue has also tried to keep an eye on Narendra so who where he is going and what he is doing Hazara was talking I hear that another is now practicing austerity he lives on very little food and it rise once in every four days master is that so who knows one me realized God even by means of religious girl see that he is not denouncing at the same time not wholeheartedly appreciating this only practicing austerity physically hone do you have to have the holy company you have to have the thoughts and then ponder about that then leave and that that is the growth of the spirituality and is a normal growth austerity is necessary and eating layers and also all those things selamat eshton's these words and very very the finest way he is teaching us then Hazra not in the sand the other money are given is a special type of song before the goddess - God put Durga Puja the most of the devotees they usually sing inviting the mother to come here the relation is not like a god and we are afraid of him and we are respect team and great or not like that is the daughter relation of the model relation and the very close relation so in that relation most of the time they will be blaming Shiva why she was married our the daughter and the sister and taken hard so that is the way all the expressions a great love as if she is one of us own in the family let's call our how many means will coming but before that the mother will come divine power will come in the form of our daughter our mother how did he sing it master eagerly is knowing everything about this young boy if we notice it is 1884 1886 the master will leave his body before that he want to give a shape to that boy he wanted to know everything about him this is the special way to hanging the disciple whom he wants to give all his power then a little later the master was standing on the west porch since it was autumn he had put on a funnel shirt died with ochre he asked Narendra is it true that you sang the agony accompanied by Narendra and game Saran kishna to the embankment of the ganges not in the sand the harmony with the master he asked this question not in the D&C years unknown and that is master Marche also absent about that see the way the very dramatically things are presented and then master mache says the Narendra accompanied three saddam o krishna when they were standing on the embankment not interesting non-english singing tell me my Ummah how have you fear alone in the strangers house strangers house that is not your house that sir in-laws house so obvious leads in strangers hours so I am we're wondering how could you stay a real physically love and affection for the God ceramic business dude listening to the song and went into Samadhi first this is the speciality in the character of the language we don't find this in others 18 any game he's going into Samadhi and we know Samadhi it's so difficult marching with God's merging with the soul it's not so easy to go lives of the lives we pass only to achieve that and it becomes nothing for him the moment the hint is coming immediately his mind goes and merges into death this but still above the horizon this is the three more the master ma che that is his beauty the son was still above the horizon as the master stood on the embankment in the ecstatic mood on one side of him was the Ganges flowing north with the flood tide so those who have visited that particular place after reading this if you go over there you can close your eyes and you can imagine how the ramakrishna was standing and what was happening and behind him was the flower garden to his right one could see the Naha bird and the bunch uppity that means right side is the Panchavati left side the Ganga as in the front flowing towards left and at the back the flower garden that was the condition we have to imagine master wishes giving this description because of that the meditation and the mind is transported to that particular time and place in the situation and we can imagine the Sun is the light is falling on cinema Krishna and these are the things I have instilled all those things are there so if we can imagine strongly after Narinder and several other devotees are saluted the master and left for Kolkata Saddam Tichenor returned to his room he was absorbed in meditation under the mother still now and was chanting her holy name the jutsu Moloch the this neighbor house had arrived at his house next to the Kali temple the rich people they were having different pleasure houses it was garden house and Ronnie rush money was having this plot of land next to that Kali temple was Jo Dominic's garden house and he was respecting salaam additional loving ceramics I wanted to have his company but had a different type of characteristics that we will find over here Jada Malik had arrived at his garden house next to the Kali temple he sent for the master author - had arrived from Calcutta and he saluted ceramic dish now the master asked Lord to light the lantern and accompanied him to Judas garden there are two Maharaja he was there the young boy there and aim master Mercia here asking shall I come with you now this the taking the permission if you remember the first time you demonic is a very rich man master master ordinary teacher so naturally he was assitant to go to the rich people's house but now this time he has understood where Ramakrishna will be there I must be there whatever may be the place I am NOT going for the person the place I'm going for Serrano Krishna and now there is no ego why should I go to his house this that place nothing like that the ego is completely gone love for the company of ceramic Tichenor the holiest of the holy dad has done so he is asking shall I come with you master Asia do you want to come other and the others are here all right you may come will the McCarthys also come with us look at the two brothers were there come along then we can you can leave you do only quickly we can leave just one thing quickly see Ramakrishna was not very much interested to visit at the same time when the jutsu modelling requested him to visit he was green and he knew that your demonic is not very much interested to listen to all the discussion that ceramic Krishna will do the harm we should live in the society and this holy the holiest of the whole God himself and Joe demoniac will find over here there's master Masha is giving that picture very clearly the very egoistic person even then Saddam acacia is going over there and he is giving the end so that we can quickly come out if you were there that means they will also say sir we have to go on ceramic fish Nabil also we are living at a little so-called so like that he will come out so that is the plan and they are doing the master wing to Judas drawing-room but he did not get up to greet him Judah was a devotee of go wrong go go wrong the best return at his request to master sang a few songs about gauranga so he invited but he was not treating him as that look at it and we'll come to another incident in the same place it is not the rich man or the wind reckless person well-known person is the devotion to God he asked him to sing along Krishna's sang that much then he came out after the musical over the mukerjea's were about to take their lead master too was ready to go so he immediately took their opportunity but he was in an ecstatic mood on coming to the porch he went into Samadhi these songs are not just entertainment songs of the prayers it is not for Who I am singing I am pouring out my prayer through the music and words that is the songs Ram Krishna sang and he himself went into Samadhi whether you do only noticed it or not enjoyed it or not it doesn't matter so song is a beautiful way to get United with sip the God and sometimes we are reciting this chanting but we don't know the meaning of the chanting that on health so we have to understand you have to remember that the words the meaning of that along with the chanting along with the song if the head also goes out then only this type of experiences may happen ceramic is new came out here you see geothermal leak is the owner of the pure you which property is a rich man he didn't pay that much respect to see Ramakrishna now when he came out and standing on the party went to do samadhi the I used formed and then the gatekeeper of the garden house was a pious man now and then he invited the master to his house and fed him think of it the owner team right it's Ramakrishna only to show I can call anyone and they will come like this to some extent but the gatekeeper a very ordinary person he used to invite salam krishna the guard at his house and used to feed him look at this information like the Sudama Krishna and Sudama so it gets keeper and Saddam occasional stood there in Samadhi and the gatekeeper found him with a large fan rotten another person the manager of the Cardinals saluted the master Saddam o Krishna returning to the consciousness of the relative world greeted the manager and the gatekeeper saying nah I'll say this is the blessings of God Nara and Narayana Nara the human narayana the god these two very ordinary people working under that landlord they got the blessings of the god standing over there itself but the not that person so this is the ego that separates us from God then accompanied by the devotees he went back to the temple now friends will read this part also the Friday September 19 1884 it was maharaja a sacred day of the hindus and the day of the new moon master Ramakrishna is giving the talking with the devotees he is mentioning I was at captain's house in Calcutta we know the captain those who are during the gospel of Serrano kishna and the student of the biography of sri ramakrishna we know the captain he was the ambassador on behalf of them this Nepal to India because the India was under the British rule and Nepal was a separate country so he was acting they are very pious souls and show great respect to holy men Salam business telling to my Andhra McCarty and others I shall feel very happy to know look at it our devotees this is a very wonderful statement as Ramakrishna is mentioning over here asking a question to a devotee the Mahindra Mukherjee I shall feel very happy to know that you are being benefited by your visit here the people when they are coming to the temple and to an eye to logy are they really getting the benefit this is the first we go to the human being Hindu temple and then we go and see so many and then we are in that and I am the manager I am the secretary I am the president but have you benefited truly in the presence of the dead god this is the question this we must have to remember I shall feel very happy to know that you are being benefited by your visits here and to him why don't you come here I don't know much of reading and writing in the master Mercia he is telling God's power is in you that is why there is such power of Attraction there is a divine spirit that attract - that is true whenever anyone is coming maybe strays are delivered in the coming out of curiosity they are coming we those who are living over here at the gate of the God we should not say no to anyone we have to say yes please come we do not know whether they have been called by God or not so these are the points that we should learn we should know we should practice otherwise living in the astana is of no use just leaving or visiting the temples and the mosque and the churches are no use so these two lines are very very important master Saddam occasion yes this is the attraction of yogamaya the divine Shakti God performs all his Leela through the help of yogamaya then the question of that Gopi is the game then one devotee certainly asking other people they are always taking things in negatively how Salama Krishna's giving the answer a devotee said what is the significance of Shri Krishna's stealing the gopis clothes you know most of you those who have read the life of Krishna that is an incident we don't make the worldly minded people they'll be analyzing that or they will criticize but now listen to this answer to the salaam this incidents rama business dealings there are eight features that bind a person to the world the gopis were free from all but one the shame therefore Krishna freed them from that one two on attaining God one gets rid of all theatres what are the eight theaters elevators in Sanskrit is austere partial partial means the fetters that binds you know what are those first is green on hate luck job shame by the fear Jacob Shaw sensual cooler cast Jyothi creed Sheila modesty Shankar doubt so these are the faders in case of God when you are trying to realize God all this age should go away so the God realization these are the things that we should practice otherwise it is not possible the devotees frames I just talk over here maybe
