[6. Panchama Veda 06: The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yg8Ixm03SX0)

so so so uh as you always do today also uh before beginning the panchama veda the gospel of sri ramakrishna will recite from the katha method foreign in our last class we found bhagavan siram krishna he is trying to remove the doubt of sri maha about image worship and there was discussion was going on in human society there is always thesis and the moment there will be thesis there will be antithesis and when there is anticipation they finally comes synthesis and here we find in bhagavatam krishna synthesis both the thesis and their antithesis coming together in in when there was no image worship in our hinduism there was no image worship in the beginning consciousness it is covering the age and everything now this is a thesis and problem became people who are not understanding it majority of the people it is not possible for them to have that conception so that is the problem comes then slowly slowly the theory comes of dualism the god is separate and we are separate the dualism comes the conception of god in different forms in image came for the benefit of the general masses and then conflict with conflict between those who were thinking that god is without fall and those who were thinking god is weak for began and it continued for thousands of years that is the beauty of the indian philosophy nothing is suppressed or impressed on anyone you can think of your own way and there the students of philosophy they know there are six systems developed six systems of indian philosophy and everyone giving very strong argument and trying to prove that his path of thinking is right this is it was almost they say it is 4 000 years before jesus christ four thousand bc four bc i'm sorry four hundred years bc this philosophy is based on logical things logic logical realism and they are giving the logic master marshall once tried to make surround krishna understand what is logic and in conversation he was telling this glow is black that crow is black all the clothes that we see are black so we can conclude the closer black but there may be one or two white crow also so like this taco siram krishna there the after listening sometimes isn't okay he was not putting much interest you know in logic there are so many funny stories about the logic over there the one teacher was teaching logic in the class and he was telling and usually giving these fallacies then the student very naughty student got up and said sir suppose we give the fallacy in this way the that goat is having a beard this good having beard and you are also having beard the teacher was everywhere then then the teacher said then you are losing the class go out from so then just logic it goes like this now after the now there's a vishwashika it's not after or before it's just nag and then philosophy is the founder is the kanada and they also fourth century bc this philosophy believe in the plurality of reals etc and then they say all these things that we see in the outside world ultimately becomes kana that's why kanada so we are not going in details of this only i am just like to give you the so many types of philosophies are here and if you go into this my god so many ways they are explaining the this world the manifestation then the god then the goal of human life all that is there any philosophy means you have to answer three question what is who is the creator and what is his reality and what is this creation including us the human being and what are the relation between the creator and the creation these are the things that you have to so the naya darshan and vaishyashi darshan then comes sankhya a very famous philosophy darshan the founder is kapila muni it is fifth century bc the central theme of this philosophy is purusa and prakriti purusha is one and prakriti is many so there's also this these things are going on and then comes the yoga darshan in yoga darshan the founder is patanjali sheep that's also 5th century bc but they don't have any metaphysics this darshan a yoga darshan don't have the metaphysics this yoga darshan they depend on cure so whatever the shankar they have described yoga darshan support that but they are telling that through mind control you have to separate the prakriti and to find out the purusa realize the pollution the one that is the purushan prakriti is the conception of the shankars so everywhere they say yoga so it almost related actually this founder is jaime this fourth century bc again at that time people were thinking in a different way and they were giving different types of path to realize god explaining god the creator the universe like this this germany is very very interesting these six systems of indian philosophy the goal of this philosophy is moksha and but do not believe in the creator of god so that is and they say everything has come from the shaktha you know in christian philosophy they say in the beginning there was a word and there from there the christian philosophy begins our philosophy also in the beginning there was a word and word became god that's why our this jaimini this mimosa philosophy also very very famous but vedanta is very popular it became very popular so we don't find the many followers of nan or bhai shasik or yoga but these are vedanta darshan was founder that means brahman is the only truth and all this creation that we see is illusioning as we are thinking it is becoming like that and they have lot many other things also there bhagavan siram krishna some extent we can say to some people they say he is believer of advaitha and some in between now and some will be telling but he is the combination of all these three and in afterwards in different pages of the kathamrta you will see the siram krishna is explaining in this way this universe is illusion and salaam krishna is that great sentence and i know that this is truth i would have covered my birthplace with gold so like that there are so many ideologies everyone is claiming that his is the best then how to decide bhagavan siram krishna he is mentioning like this each one will look at his own watch and say this is the time everyone is following his own watch but it may be different but they believe in his own watch so like that how to get all this so many it's called like a deep forest so many scriptures are there they are telling in so many ways someone will say don't do all this puja and all this go and meditate some will say that won't do go and do puja always pray always cry someone will say what all these things unnecessary spending your time in the temple go and serve the people and some will say read read read good books and go for the argument understand these all are true but yes so sometimes people will be asking now swamiji he was telling like this and that man was telling like this this is like this everybody's correct you have to accept which appeals to you that is your path so veda veda means knowledge are different there are all the smriti they are also different now yes then what to do then they say you must follow the great personality of spirituality and that is the only way three more in the beginning of this chapter that we are going to read in the fifth chapter of the kathamrt he is telling his beginning with a wonderful sloka and aim is always giving the hint what is this in the terrible turmoil in the sea of samsara i was telling samsara means that which always changes is going on flowing flowing and blowing samsara are never gory in this type of turban he is accepting krishna as his guru because he is holding the will of the ship and in that you know i just remind of the this is a the way they are explaining but i saw the real need when i used to go from calcutta to port player in the ship huge ship there they have the helicopter also heli pack that the two three swimming pool hotel cinema hall you can understand the huge ship but again when the only that was not nothing the captain was telling this is nothing he was there with the captain on the top and he was holding that he usually other people uh they will be holding that will but this time captain himself was there and everybody was alive then i was by his side and he was telling you hold it tightly are you standing there and huge wave is coming and breaking on the ship and ship is just like the small comparing with the way that is coming then i was telling captain do you think there will be danger then he smiled and said this is nothing so only this so how is it just like that we do not know what is going to happen it is so nice so beautiful and we just sailed and everything broke down what will happen what will happen every moment that is the problem in our because we can't see we can understand what is going to happen so this time who is going to hold the will of the ship of our life guru who is a guru who removes the darkness what is that darkness that is the darkness of me and mine that attachment me and mine comes from the ankara i have understood it and that is correct this is mine etc etc how the guru acts he actually removes first he gives a thrashing to break the ego we have found that the arjuna his guru says can you imagine a personality like arjuna and guru is calling him krishna is calling as a cleaver there's so much of insert for an arjuna and breaking his ego here also master masha amy in those days mm means the great knowledge and siram krishna is telling and you think you are a gang so that way they are first crashing them their ego and then explaining the truth what is the truth we have already read when master masha is telling sir i like to think god has formless ramakrishna is giving answering very good it is enough to have faith in either aspect then i am not reading the whole thing then the important is but this is very important to remember but never for a moment don't think he's not telling like that he's telling never for a moment think that this alone is true and all else thoughts this is very important is giving a conception complete conception helping the disciple that is the guru majority of the guru we find they will always give you a very narrow channel and last move through these and you very move very fast but when you reach that is the question the person who is guiding you is it correct you know sometimes someone was telling some you know in the vehicle they are now they are fixing is that internet through internet they get the guiding and that sometimes also giving you the wrong conception and when you reach over there you are in a just opposite place so that is also for the google if they are not understanding they are not knowing so only he can be who has a clear understanding realized himself so here sri ramakrishna acting as a guru and what he is doing but never for a moment that this is alone it's true when all falls and again we find when he is asking sad one should explain to those who worship the clay image that it is not god clay image and that it is not god look at the answer of krishna he who is the lord of the universe will teach everyone look at it the faith fast he is giving the broad-mindedness to the disciple the disciple should not be a spiritual person should not be narrow-minded he should be broad-minded don't eat this don't touch that don't go to his house don't go to their temple don't take their prasad what is it and at the same time you are telling god has created this universe how can you explain it if god has created his universe he has created both then why not that's why the true guru the real group the present day guru rahuban the very first thing he says brightness never for a moment you should think that this is the only truth for you it is true very good you are following impersonal god good so that second he says the moment he says master mashipud clay image look at it the faith the believe we say god is all powerful then why we should not also think that all these things that it's the creation of god only siram krishna is reminding him in this way he who is the lord of the universe will teach everyone he alone will teach us he has created this universe has done so many things will he not show people the way to worship him he has done so many things can't you do this and thirdly ramakrishna says you were talking of worshipping the clay image look at the argument again he is giving the faith the belief in god the belief is what first is broadband business that god is there he is all powerful he has created everyone then he will guide us so you'll be humble and you try to fight and then giving the argument also what is that he is telling even if the image is made of claim there is need for that kind of worship why the lord of the universe has arranged all these to shoot different men in different stages of knowledge in different stages of knowledge it is necessary this is the unique thing when we look at the people immediately maybe a grown-up person as they call most as babies sometimes they are grown up but they behave like babies when they come to a religion and that's why so many people they'll be running up to so many things hundreds and thousands of people will go to those places where they find just by reaching over there i will get the benefit what benefit why you are going over there is not the devotion is the marketing is it devotion to god no if you have respect go there anywhere go and bow your head but when we are going to this person and that person look at our mind am i going with real devotion but the curiosity if i get anything some from there what you want that is wrong is telling so this is then he is asking in bengali do you understand me capacity of understanding the subtle truth of god makes the difference between person to person this is very difficult that is why the ancient time the rishis they prayed it's not the ordinary intellect there are so many people they understand so many things i wonder the doctors how they remember so many medicines i wondered the law maker the lawyers all the laws they are remembering then there will be international law there will be indian law there will be these there will be that so many varieties of law and so complicated language but they all remember then the chemistry then the physics anywhere you go there's so many things very very subtle so difficult to understand but this people they understand it so nicely but the moment you talk about god they do not understand do not like to understand it's not going into their game why this is the thing that's why you have to pray give me that conception that idea so that i can understand the subtle thing some people are very intelligent successful but they do not understand the spiritual world but the reply of three more if we hear in the bengali he is telling means with great humility that is the quality unless and until we are having that quality and how that quality comes when there is no ego then only that quality comes otherwise not here in bhagavad-gita is giving is a wonderful way who can understand religion who can understand humbleness with great humbleness you have to go to the second is first is with great humbleness means offering the pronoun then you have to ask question properly question correct questions otherwise you won't be able to understand and you have to go on asking questions again and again until your doubts are cleared that is the beauty of the hinduism that is the beauty of the sanatana they are giving you the opportunity to ask question and question and question and teacher loves teachers like the students who are asking question again and again because each and every teacher is happy when they see that eagerness to learn is there in that story and they are coming and asking the question said you said that but i think this is the thing is coming then you will remove it slowly slowly slowly when sister niveda came to swami vivekananda she was asking 101 questions everybody was angry why you are discussing like this with swamiji but swamiji was happy every state assistant the mediator was trying to understand this is the thing but the question does it mean all in a childlike question it will be asking is there god if there is no god so that way all these things are solved then shall i tell the truth or false if these are the questions have already been answered now you have to ask question in a different way we will hear how shri maw is asking the question this is the first day one is coming with all the egotism with the egoistic mind and he is coming and asking hey can you please explain what what is god there may be a philosophical discussion but knowledge will not be there there are so many philosophers thousands in every university there is a subject philosophy professors said their students are there every year hundreds of passing awares of philosophy students how many of they understand religion how many of them they go deep into that how many of them understand what really vedanta means so that is the thing there is one great bandit he used to come and teach our brahmacharyans and swamis and every time after teaching you know he knows how to teach sanskrit and then then afterwards he used to say i only save all these things and you people practice we brahmacharyans we are you know in comparing with the knowledge of philosophy we were nowhere to him he was a great brother who was a professor of kakarot university very respected so many books he had written on kilo zombie but he was humble he used to say swami jesus i only teach you that you practice it i don't practice so that is the thing one has to practice it that's why comes what was the prisoner the question of master marshall the spiritual seeker must ask question and proper question now master masha is humble he is devoted and eager to know the spiritual truth he is asking the question and look at the question he is asking in bengali he is asking sad how may i fix my mind from god how i will fix my mind on god is there god etc all this over now the question is how can i fix my mind is so happy look at how he is giving the answer he is answering in a very wonderful way the question is so good and answer excellent he is not telling that if you are a brahmin if you are taking only vegetarian food if you are taking deep in the ganga every time if you are applying the paste on your forehead if you are doing this nothing what they say he said repeat god's name and sing his glory and now when they visit god's devotees and holy men the mind cannot dwell on god if it is immersed day and night in worldliness in worldly duties and responsibilities it is most necessary to go into solitude now and then and think of god to fix the mind on god is very difficult in the beginning difficult in the beginning unless one practices meditation in solitude when a tree is young then immediately is giving when a tree is young it should be fans all around example every sentence every word every teaching immediately you will give an example why upoma previously used to say the kali dash was very famous in giving the this type of upma and now this is to make it so easy for everyone to understand what he's going to tell he is telling this see one should go to this because it is tender mind the beginning so now what one should do you have to give a fencing otherwise it may be destroyed by cattle now if you go to those people and mixing suddenly you are in the club and you get up and say friends i am leaving i have to go and attend the spiritual discourse over there they will say spiritual discourse you fool unnecessarily wasting your time there is no god etc etc then they will go to this thing that thing and you are confused you will sit down there so that's why you need a faint scene in your mind get convinced this is the first thing and then he is telling there are three ways of meditating now before we go to that let us let explain a little how siram krishna is telling this first is think come think of god while doing your duties so three things he is telling there are three ways of meditation afterwards we speak first is repeat god's name and sing his glory this is the thing god's name there are so many names of god it's all holy and suppose we go on repeating the name of god will do no you have to repeat the name as along with the qualities of the god otherwise it don't work and so clever people are they will be keeping the name of their children in different gods and goddesses name and they think when i am calling the son or the daughter god will understand i am calling him and you will see they all they will keep the name so that way you always will be keeping the name of god and god said no that won't do there will be some people constantly going on telling the beats and at the same time calculating they are in the market showing this left hand finger on the potato how much is caused no this is not it they are telling the name of god there are people they are really taking the name of god but they don't follow the teaching of god quality of god means what teaching of god what he has practiced so that will do that's why spiritual progress means what here is a wonderful way the tulsidasi is telling me is burning giving the light and removing the darkness it should be the threshold you are working going around but constantly within you are taking the name of the lord in a wonderful way he is telling go constantly constantly the shri ma masala money baby she is telling the why the god has given this your fingers and this you know the fingers are having four four always the four marking go all repeat the name of god constantly and every time that you are breathing in breathing out take the name of lord take the name but at the same time you have to go on thinking about the qualities of the god and the moment they say now also we are doing and bhuna ghana ghana means song as in english translation is telling repeat the god's name and sing his glory in our country you know the law is not so much you know the people can go and tell so anyone can so i am a devotee i am doing the normal but alone no i will make a microphone tied on the top of my house and from all four corners and all my neighbors they will leave the whole area because i am taking the name of god and they'll be shouting so this way 24 hours 72 hours gonna go on is going on now that also won't do so one must be very very clear why i am disturbing others the moment i am disturbing others in the name of god all my effort to get the blessings of god goes away unnecessarily i am spending time i am spending money i am spending my energy but just because i do not know what one should do that is the guru and who can be the guru sriram krishna the concern and here he is telling repeat god's name and sing his glory and he is the repeating the name of god and there is one conversation between srimad and sri ramakrishna he developed you know the uh in a fraternity friendship relation between the devotees he removed all the boundaries of the caste and also the other classes and wherever used to go he used to call others i'm going over there on that day you also come here so he is satisfied when all are sitting over there and the person's house used to go usually they are wealthy people and they used to feed the others also so that way there's a nice way he was slowly slowly developing the devotees in such a way devotees becoming so close to each other they are forgetting the other relatives and becoming a group a family here sirama krishna asking shrima a master master a teacher humble teacher in those days to come and meet him at balarama's house balaram bush was a landlord very rich people and in the landlord house and the rich people's house there will always be another guards so you they were owned now unless and until you are having the credentials the weather so master masha he was wondering and he said will they allow me to enter then srima say tell my name they will allow you so we can the devotees can understand this simple word of srila krishna is like this if you tell the name of krishna all the obstacles are removed and we have seen that in our the small life we have seen this miracle everywhere where there is no chances things are opening everything is happening there is a plot of land that was very much necessary for us because other group of people in the different religion they were coming and it's adjacent and if they come and develop their you know they have the money and all that if they committed suit it would have been so difficult for us then i applied this this this slowly slowly things started taking shape but the last person who was supposed to compete who was supposed to sign your son he was taking time month after month month after month it was 12th january i totally rang him on 11th january i told 12th to january is a very holy day for us it is the birthday of swami vivekananda and i request you to sign that paper on that day swamiji i cannot say this is the only holy day or special day for you people but not for us wait i will do it then i went in the morning and i sat in the corner of his office but he couldn't see me go out i was sitting over there and look i'm not disturbing you but only as a reminder i'll be sitting over here i sat over there went on taking the name of god without food without water or anything and constantly praying to taku today he must sign please ask him to sign ask him to ask him otherwise it will be so difficult for us and he came after lunch he said oh you are still here have you taken food and thank you for asking but i am waiting for your signature and in the afternoon when all the it was five o'clock office is back and everywhere was going on then he called his office superintendent he said bring that file i think he is sitting over here without the signature he won't go and suppose he died then it all probably will come on his job it takes time but it works with faith and we believe if we go on repeat the name of god and it could assure me for the good cause i am now anchoring for the land i have lived that land i don't know now what is happening over there i don't care also when i was there god has god gave me the responsibility i have performed that mom that is the instruction the moment the field is different now we are in a different place and that is the way without attachment with great faith if we are working at the same time taking the name of god you know that story i think somewhere i told you the name of god is so powerful even the god cannot do anything so once there's a story in the ramayana they and so many other people also came the rishis came vishwamitra also came and one king there we can say yamin god landlord he came to visit and he was paying respect to all the swamis now on 7th and 8th of november all the swamis will come they'll be sitting in a queue you have to go and go on offering suppose you are not doing one and mistaking i mean just going to other usually they are maybe that he will feel why he is not paying respect to me normally and this person was going on doing like that but he by mistake not intentionally by mistake he didn't look at the bishop he went vishwamitra became very you call rama he said drama you are my host you have invited to come over here and now that person your guest he has insulted me he has given respect he has showed respect to all others all the rishis that you are sitting except me i want you to give him punishment lama said just wait i will go and bring him he is a good man perhaps he had made a mistake he will pay respect to you i don't care now that is over i want that you have to give the punishment to him he said what punishment said go and cut the head of the man and bring the head to the mind to me and that is what you have to do with that is to show how the name of god is so powerful now you know in the story always narada is there in the purana narada was roaming around nearby he heard it and he immediately rang to that person and after returning from and i went back to his home this person crap he was taking rest another arrest even you are taking rest now you're going to die within a minute or so so how come your drama is coming to cut your head why just now i meet him these are the things now there is no way then he said okay i respect rama as my god if he's cutting i do why you should be so careless go and save your life that's the way narada gave him that this idea what to do go to the mother of one and the mothers are usually another they are very simple if you go and cry before the mother mother please save me save me somebody's coming to cut my head and anual's mother naturally she will give you the blessing no no no and if she gives the blessing then you get the protection of go and this man ran to the anjali devi anjanana and she was there naturally he also mother saved me mother naturally she was proud of sans power he said okay okay no problem who is going to hurt my son is there nobody can do anything in my house you'll be here i'll see who is coming and he was saved after some time the lady started thinking i didn't ask who is the enemy then she came and asked who is the person coming to kill you now it is rama you didn't tell it before house one can fight with rama one will never fight and how can i save him now when she was shouting like this the man was passing and he said mother what happened then the mother said see this is the thing again i gave the word that you will protect him but then now i came to know that it is rama how can you protect and he should have saved me earlier then say mom you need not to worry since you have given the word i am going to keep it you don't believe nothing is going to happen he was confident anubhav was confident how he took that man in a jungle and made his body huge and with the tail he protected him you know just in a what's called iron uh a room we can say and no place is open and then he sat on that over that he was sitting rama came out he was searching the man and narada also withdrawn and then he said to rama wrong where we were going let's see this is the thing i have to now cut the head of that man because my muni is so angry that why you are going in this hot sun you have the arrow you tell the name of the person it will go and cut the head and bring it because that arrow is there ram said yes why am i necessarily going so he took the arrow put the name on that is just ordered the name and the mantra arrow of that he shot is supposed to go cut that or kill the person and come back it came back without any blood stain or anything it came and entered into then rama thought what happened maybe i made a mistake in pronouncing the name properly so once again he did same thing once again he did same thing arrow is coming back without hurting anyone rama was astounded he turned to naruto and said you must be knowing why all these things are happening so can you please explain why all my arrow is failing then he said wrong how your arrow can touch you so that's why it is coming back rama was confused my arrow touching me what you are telling please explain then he said these are this thing this person took the refuge in the mother anuman's mother now hanuman is giving the protection and hanuman right from the beginning of the tale after the hate he is full of rama jairam sriram jairam sriram he is continuously repeating and there is not a single part of his body where you are not present so how your arrow can hit you because all over the body you are presenting and that's how hanuman is protecting you so by the name of god we are safe from the god's anger also just by repeating with devotion and with one quantity of mind we are saying so that is the power of god yandyana in bhagavad-gita says if you are repeating the name of god that is the british that you are doing if we can't help anyone at least we can do this we can go and repeat the name of god if we are going to visit a sick person we can pray to god and do the take the name of suppose somebody has invited us we go to there when i was very young the one very senior swami and myself went to a devotee's house and he paid me so much and that time you know i used to eat there like the ones here yesterday now the swamiji he took very little food and then when we were coming out at the gate he almost whispered to my ear they have fed you with so many things what you have given to them then i was taken away and i told swamiji i forgot to bring any gift for them usually we take some book or something and give them no no that is not necessary what you have given to them you have taken you must have given to them something i told that is what i forgot then he said you are not understanding come i will explain then in the astra he said you have to pray for them when the devotees are inviting us they are thinking by feeding us actually they are getting the blessings of god have you prayed to god for their welfare actually you should have said it before now so now you go and pray for them so i learned from this the senior swamis in a very simple way they teach us the real good thing so when the devotees are inviting it's not me the is of srila krishna the god when they are offering pranam to me it is not me is the god again so what i should do i should constantly pray to god they are not actually making pranam to me offering this thing to me it's all to you through me please accept it and give them blessings that is that is only two things in the life of sannyasi what a monk will do creating huge high buildings so that the people will come and purchase thicker that entered into over there just like another museum no not like that only two things dharmapalam and dharma shiksha how we can give the shiksha not only mocks devotees also you have to constantly because you are the the voters the pujaris of god if you are going to one place behaving in such a way then the people they will talk about see look he is the devotee of ramakrishna and look at his behavior through your behavior you are bringing back name to god god so that's why sargada means constantly every moment every time you have to do it constantly so that is the wonderful way he is telling now gonna the qualities so what are the qualities of god the bad guna and good also if they are bad and good both are there the weather but from the bad things came from outside some of the philosophy they are confused the god is all good then when the bad came somebody is there having two and a horn on his head and the tail so we are thinking like that when he came with the tail and the heart from god only because god is having the book they say in a beautiful way it is telling that if god is having the both then obviously it also be there that god is affected by the bad no god is not affected by the bad or good the snake is having the venom but whether the snake is affected by the venom no so similarly from god everything is coming good and bad god is not affected by good and god but he is telling so you always try to do it in such a way so that you can understand it next day we will explain a little over this now this nama and gona and what we will do good gunas good qualities that we have to achieve that's where the prayer is means god has good and bad both time i want only good oh god please be have compassion on me bless me with your good qualities that is the prayer so now gonna always every time you have to do now and second is first is repeat god's name and sing his glory what is the glory of rama look at it the glory of rama we are going on you go to any part of india they will be beating drama and they'll be singing all their these vocal cords have become so you can see from outside they're singing rama but what is the quality of ram he is embracing untouchable what is who is reign and he is an untouchable is taking the fruits from the hand of a lady who is an untouchable that is his guna he is giving the mercy the protection of the lady for whom she he had to go for 14 years in the jungle this is the all the time blessings those people who are creating problem for him having all faith on them so this way there are so many good qualities in rama shri krishna unattachment unattachment krishna if he wanted he could have been the huge in the whole of the india undivided india as we call all that india he would have been he could have been the king emperor but what he did he never touched anything he took nothing on attachment and once you have given the world you have to continue with that that is the training of sri krishna that is the training of sri rama those who we are follower of rama follower of krishna follower of buddha followers of jesus christ are you really following the qualities of jesus christ forgive because you have been forgiven by the god of evil forgive love love love that is the quality that has been shown in the life of jesus christ how many of us practicing this quality no but we are taking the name of jesus constantly we are always showing that we are the follower of jesus but swing you won't do you have to practice you have to eat by and what are the qualities wonderfully next day we will discuss about that you can also just go through in the 12th chapter of bhagavad-gita from 13 to 19 only seventh all the qualities and then sixteenth chapter only four sloka you need not to read and every time we are reading so many things we are doing but we are not practicing the qualities that the gita is teaching and who is teaching bhagavan so next class we will again explain this is nama and muna this very very important and nama and gonna guna it comes all together the moment a person is uttering your name my name what comes your personality and what is your personality that is your goodness so that way sudan krsna and second he says now and then visit god's devotees and holy men that is also very important why because the god's devotees see it's not only the holy man devotees also what is the responsibility of the devotee to live in such a way so that when the people are coming to their home they'll also get inspiration to follow the path of religion that is the responsibility so if the people are coming to your home they see god's picture everywhere all good books in the library and wonderful behavior so many things are there so this is totally different when you are talking with them in a different way for every one or two sentences you are bringing the reference of some good anecdotes from spiritual life that is the life of devotee whoever comes we keep our god in a very corner and our out out the room where all the guests are coming then nothing is there the picture of a horse jumping of the easter egg and not only there that horse only having one leg maybe it has been painted by someone very famous and we have purchased ten thousand dollars we mentioned over there and keep that see the who has painted ten thousand dollars what is there one leg of it can understand it's good the promotion of the art and all these things if you understand it but the thing is if you are really a person of religion then what you have to do keep in every place the photos of god wherever your eyes goes you remember god and maha shalom is telling this photo of krishna if you look at it you see god believe it the moment we are looking at the photos of sudama krishna we are looking at the living god god do you believe it that is the thing that is the quality of and how this quality will come if you go to a devotee if you go to your holy man and then finally go into solitude now and then and think of god going to salute you now and then we have in chicago a very good opportunity from here in every month at the end of the month there is a three days only solitude friday saturday sunday spiritual retreat this is solely to living with the holy person discussing about only the holy things living in the devotees this opportunity is there only you have to drive two and half an hour or three hours you reach over there accommodation jungle quietness holiness everything is there how many will go that is the question there are so many other things in a bengali there's a beautiful song i get time to perform all of the videos so that is the thing and now that we are the devotees of the best god the recent god the god himself you came in a very modern way and telling about everything if we only believe and follow be sure we are going to realize god in this i have life god i can show it to you but if you are following what my words and what are the things only three repeat the name of god and repeat also is qualities go now and then to devotees and holy people and go to the salute be alone and die deep within your mind this thing today we'll just offer our pronoun to bhagavan siram krishna again the next tuesday we'll meet and discuss about this veda foreign is is sean too
