[305. Panchama Veda 305](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3A0BA1QgAVI)

namaskar dear devotees and friends after two months we will be once again studying the panchama veda the 26th 22 2022 january and february these two months they passed very fast for me very quickly so apart from other things i took a long journey and started from here from chicago then to omaha the omaha to colorado boulder from boulder to salt lake city uh utah and from there to las vegas las vegas to our all these are our centers and devotees houses from las vegas to pinion hill there's a beautiful small astronaut this is all under the direct our sarvadeva nandaji uh the southern california hollywood and from pinyon hill we went to hollywood in hollywood i attended the celebration of swami brahmananda spent six days with the swamis and matajis and the devotees it was a wonderful time and from there i started coming back though one of our uh that our student he was driving and from there we came back and he wanted to see some of the places so we went to death valley from that valley to mohab from mohab we came back once again to boulder that was a terrible journey that was uh that particular two hours it was really a very terrifying concern but afterwards we enjoyed we went over there to start a vedanta study circle under the guidance of xiaomi sarvadevanthaji and i was present the devotees of colorado they started then from colorado we came straight to one of our another center is kansas city it is the sub-center of our centuries and the next morning the swami over there is a very very good host and from there we came to back to chicago so it was a long 21 22 days and i could see the whole country almost uh the and the people and the places and how things are by flight when you go we don't understand but when you're going by traveling but do it is very calm very difficult though but i enjoyed it now after that as per the schedule our classes will begin from today and with the study of the panchama veda friends i am planning that i will give the wednesday classes online because it's a weekday and our devotees most of them have become the elderly it becomes very difficult for them to come in person in this weekdays and on sunday we will give the in person will that will begin so let us begin with the stortra the mantra that we chanted beginning the panchama veda the gospel of srirama krishna tabukatham [Music] for the nectar of thy scene facing utterances bring life and hope to those scorched by misery that those who are suffering and not only that those who have understood that this suffering not suffering means the the poor people those who are not having any things they are suffering not that type of suffering it's a suffering that i am though i am successful in this life i am having everything but still i am not contented i am not satisfied that suffering that is there we have to understand not that those who are beggars who don't have anything they will get the benefit no they won't they may be but it says this was suffering means those who have understood the futility of this worldly life then only they will come to you and they will get the bliss the nectar of these your words which are just like the nectars the nectars give her eternal life eternal bliss shravana mangalam when we are hearing it that is also giving us the benefit spiritual benefit if we are understanding it sri madatam so this we let us start the we concluded in december 2021 by discussing bhagavan si ramakrishna's teaching the most important advice for spiritual seekers he said god cannot be realized unless the mind is totally free from lost and gold it was in the gospel of sirama krishna translated by swami nikhila nandaji published by the new york center page 738 the god cannot be realized so i am giving lot of money as a donation or i am a very powerful person constructing a huge temple no nothing all those things only they can help you to grow into the to proceed into the path of the religion the path of spirituality but the ultimate thing is the purity of mind again we can quote that famous quotation of lord jesus blessed are those who are pure in heart for they shall see god so what is the purity shankaracharya spoke about purity you discussed in the in the december before we concluded and that it's in uh uh we discussed over there it is available in the youtube so what is this purity lost and gold now it may be who is god we are going to realize who is god the creator the creator that each and every one we are accepting that he has created someone has created it sometimes some people they say no just out of nothing it was created it's a big bang and all those but some intelligent intelli that intellectual things were there so he created and now we are accepting the god has created these universe the god is the creator okay how he created with his maya the vidantin they always say the hindus they say with the power of god the power of god is maya this maya he deludes the mind that also we know he has created this universe with the power of maya and maya how he is it is binding us by deluding us how it deludes with the temptations of physical enjoyment and the mind the main attraction is the last the last and gold and all these desires cannot be fulfilled if we are not having the money so money is also essential necessary so these two the bhagavan sirama krishna he went to the root of the cause of bondage friends again those who are thinking this life is full of happiness they're enjoying this life but them it is not this teaching is not those who have realized though i am having everything in this life but still there is something lacking i am not fully satisfied i am not contented and i am having the joy this moment and next moment the misery now where i can find the eternal peace eternal joy eternal happiness for them these teachings so what is the teaching it says now you try to understand the god is the creator and he created with a power which is known as maya and maya it deludes the mind whose mind the crea the creations and particularly it is the human being the human being after all this it goes on coming slowly and then in the manifestation it is the human being ultimately and in the human being we find it has the capacity of judgment it can analyze it can judge and that is the way we can understand and this human only human they can go completely free from these suffering the animals the birds and all create in the creation they don't bother about this but the human being and that too not all ordinary human being those who have already understood these again and again i am telling the futility of this world though i am successful even then i am not satisfied that is the mentality that is the condition of the mind so then he is thinking where is the problem the problem is my attraction to this world and what is this world completely temporary things i am enjoying now i am i was just giving you uh that i drove from here all these days and beautiful driving i was not driving somebody else was driving so i was enjoying but what is the enjoyment after 20 days it was over and after few days i getting tired physically tired and then afterwards i started thinking almost the same thing the vast land america is a very big place the vast land and sometimes the wind is blowing hard and this is that but after 21 days all that is over it is in the memory sometimes i find it happiness sometimes oh that was a difficult time etc so from this world you cannot get all joy all better no nothing you know what happened this time when you went to this las vegas and there is a wonderful the very nice gentleman who is looking after our astroma there we have an astronaut one lady she has given a her house to the vedanta society southern california and they have started anastoma mr jeff is there very well he knows many things and he was our guide and he took us i told i'm interested to see the casino i have heard about it but what the people do over there let me go and see so i went inside and i saw all these people they are playing cards and all this gambling or trying their lucks but mostly people those who are elderly people they like to spend their time so there are some machines they're sitting before that and not that they're playing the thousands of dollars no only ten dollar maximum fifty dollars twenty dollar like that they're spending but whole day they'll be sitting over there sipping the cold rings and playing a little if it is sometimes they are getting some money back sometimes not so but the moment they are getting back they're again tempted to play and they're losing again again like this going on this is maya we are constantly tempted after this i am going to get after this angry i'm going to get like this it goes on if you can't stop it enough i don't need it then only it is possible so in this life when bhagavan sirama krishna said god cannot be realized unless the mind is totally free from lust and gold and this the kernel desire we like to go and enjoy when it is there naturally mind is not going to god the god is the creator he is out of all this he's completely free so if we have to go back to the creator go back to the source we have to give up the creation that is what bhagavan si rama krishna is teaching the effect is bondage so when we are having the enjoyment of this world that means desire effect is bonding what is this bondage the hindus they believe that again you have to take birth maybe in a different body to fulfill all your desire whether you believe it or not this is the chakra this is the circle it goes on like this so this is what the hindus they believe if you are thinking wrongly that will also affect your mind not that physically you are doing only you are thinking that also the effect will come and the effect will be the bondage and the bondage means taking rebirth rebirthing again in a different body in a different situation again you after enjoying what you where desiring then you get tired of it then you we draw the mind no i have got all this not necessary then you can from there when you are withdrawing your mind from all the worldly desires your journey is becoming beginning towards the god bhagavatam krishna said the more you go towards the east the west will be the far behind so you have to proceed towards god not that every day i have to think oh i should give this up i should not accept that not like that i am just putting my mind to god and i am proceeding towards god how can i do that the hindus they have developed the initiation process now through the initiation when you are accepting the guru and whatever the name of the lord he has given you accept that in the complete faith you are just going on taking that name and the lord's name has a great power slowly slowly because the it is all the lord only these bondages he has created then he will slowly take it out from you and ultimately the source of joy we will reach when we go back to god when you realize god what happens if we notice the whole life we are pursuing to enjoy and sometimes when the people are praising i'm finding great joy when the people are giving me some gift giving me the honor i am finding great joy so for eve each and everything the main the idea is to get the joy after becoming the king if i find nobody is liking me nobody is praising me everybody is criticizing me so that will be a miserable life even after being a king a ruler so obviously it is not the position it is not the power it is not the money it is only the joy it's the true happiness and when we get it from this worldly life it's all temporary understanding this we go for the permanent what happens after brahmagyana eternal joy they don't bother about the worldly things from the inside it is the great joy that comes how that is the problem to answer only it is a subjective knowledge only when you yourself realize then only you will feel otherwise no one can explain so a devotee then commented very correctly he commented it is in the page 739 he said if the mind is free from lost and gold then what else can stop a person the only the bliss of brahman the bliss of brahman very correctly he said we analyze those who are following the path of knowledge they analyze and after the analysis oh this is not correct this is correct this is temporary this is permanent all this they will be going on analyzing every moment then afterwards they say their goal is brahman so sometimes friends it is better to remember when the devotees are reaching towards the ultimate goal they will say it is ishwara the bhagavan so bhagavan love is a god realization but a yogi he will never say god he will say paramatma and the gyani will say brahman but when we read hinduism we find all these different types of terminologies and not understanding which is used when what saying they will say then what will happen to paramatma then if we realize brahman so that way they will ask if we realize brahman we realize that each and everything is nothing but the consciousness and when you realize paramatman param atma and atma is nothing but consciousness when you realize paramatma by practicing yoga by withdrawing the mind controlling the mind stealing the mind it's also same feeling and when you realize god the same feeling because god is the source of joy paramananda madhavam madhava the lord krishna who is he paramananda is param ananda the supreme joy the goal is the same only they give different names that much so sometimes they will go through devotion part of devotion by through concentration meditation and by sometimes analysis part of gyana knowledge but the goal is the same so here it says when you go to the brahman it is eternal bliss sirama krishna then commented it is hard to recognize an incarnation of god unless the mind is totally free from lust and gold the one is that we talk about the god realization is impossible unless the mind is completely free from in all desires now here the srama krishna he said that again he is mentioning it is very very difficult almost impossible to realize or to understand to recognize incarnation of god avatar in sanskrit they say avatar incarnation of god this is really very difficult really very difficult the jesus the son of god and we the hindus always accepting as an incarnation of god but in the christian the way they say son of god but when he was arrested they were taking him he himself was carrying his own cross the all of us we know his life and the people ordinary people ignoring people they were throwing stones and they were telling oh you are son of god you cannot save yourself why they couldn't understand the body is the composed of the five things so obviously it is going to be destroyed today or tomorrow but it is the soul that he used to talk about the jesus said the eternal life it is not the body it is the soul that he was mentioning in our scriptures also it is the soul that eternal it's not the body the krishna also passed away lord buddha also died sri ramakrishna we have the pictures that he has passed to be and then you say oh god is dying is a foolish question god is not dying it is the only the body through which it manifested that they are destroying that much so that is why the lord krsna said in the bhagavad-gita 9 chapter 11 verse 9 11. i am the supreme lord ishwara means the lord maha supreme supreme lord the beyond and above nothing is there he is the supreme or we can say it is the supreme that supreme lord just he thought and every creation came they need thought let me also manifest myself just like a human being and he took that krishna form and he was playing with the cowherd boys and everything just normal human life people could not recognize him why because their mind was attached to lost and gold only the pure mind can understand it we fought we know that the sri rama chandra he was also the avatar of the lord vishnu sri krishna about our blood vishnu so ramachandra wayne it came a few only could recognize you realize a few rishis because of their yogic eyesight they could see it is in the form of a human being it is the supreme lord so there are beautiful stories that there is the anecdotes are there the one rishi he became old he was about to die but he was waiting when the ramachandra entered into his cottage he said drama i am supposed to give my body up but now i was waiting for you i knew that he will come through this way they were yogis they could understand what is going to happen and they could understand the rama as nothing but the supreme param brahma and rama never wanted to that spread that he even told the hanuman also the great yogi he immediately recognized in the form of a human being it is that supreme lord that he is worshiping so he sat down at his feet and he was worshiping him the rama told you should not disclose it to anyone that time the rama's time no one knew the sri rama is a supreme lord that param brahma the param brahma the rama that noun we are singing the ram nam it begins with that the param brahma is the supreme brahman why because the people were not ready to understand this look at it the hinduism some of the rishis they understood it bhagavan sudama krishna said it is the twelve rishis they understood it but didn't they disclose they'd never disclosed that they said o rama we are not going to accept you do we know that you are the param brahma but we are not going to accept you as that rather we will say that you are a prince the son of a great king the shraddha and others also sri ramachandra also we will never find the ramachandra giving any advice go and meditate take the name of lord never why the people who are not ready to understand that long afterwards in the next yuga the same lord vishnu came in the form of sri krishna and sri krishna wanted to bring that knowledge at home in the minds of the ordinary people so many of them they understood that this is the lord so he said in the bhagavad-gita the deluded people cannot understand me delude it means the abujananti imam mudha what is this mura this deluded they always think oh they all everything they will judge according to the worldly benefit only profit so we are going to the astra and then we will take the food over there how many of us such a five of us so if we had spent in the for the lunch in the restaurant then it would have been hundred fifty save hundred give only fifty two thousand so this type of people so they are always calculative and they are thinking i am saving money and i am really am very intelligent now i am a rich man i have a two cards three cards i have a big house they are always thinking in that way they are murder murad they are completely deluded they do not know what is the truth nothing will go with you everything we left over here some people go on collecting money and they are cheating people they won't spend that money also they will keep that in a foreign bank account and suddenly they will die without telling that to to anyone because he was hiding now that money goes into somebody's hand and it is not properly used what is the effect suffering he is thinking that i am dying in a very costly hospital and i am very happy now next life where you are going to go so we have to understand the god he takes the human form to guide us guide us to wear to himself towards god the god is the source and how to realize that god by giving up his creation so this is the way we always understand bhagavan sirama krishna he was the god himself and they were discussing about the god realization then he commented you could not understand the incarnation of god the incarnation the god himself was sitting over there and so many people they that time couldn't understand oh suramar krishna is a very once a wonderful person he sings well he dance well he's a very simple person his company his conversation is enjoyable we always enjoy that that much but he's the god himself and you know who understood it a very young boy 20 22 years that time narendra mod himself he said do you think he is suffering nothing it is nothing it is only for us only that not under that time he realized it why remember what suramar krishna commented about him his mind is not in his body he is not attached to anything of this world that means we started with this word that it is if the mind is attached to the worldly things the lost and gold one cannot realize god now here it says the ramakrishna now this is the reason at the time of sri krishna slowly slowly we came to understand that god can manifest in the human form only to bring this knowledge for the ordinary people for their own benefit shri krishna the god at that time in that form had to perform a lot of miracles he lifted the whole hill on a finger now if that that becomes the the measuring the skill to understand that the avatar again it's a mistake sri krishna he showed lot of miracles he stopped the sun to sign he lifted the heel on his finger and he did so many things only to prove that he is all-powerful but know how he will understand a human as god his detachment his detachment when you were reading the life of sri krishna if we notice is completely detached friends we are also discussing the uddhava gita there in the in the bhagavata itself the after the composing the bhagavata the life of sri krishna their main thing the bashadeva was mentioning that is the god the supreme being has taken the human form that was first introduced first time this sri krishna's biography the life is the 10th volume of the skanda of the bhagavata and there he is describing the lord god has come he himself has manifested in that krishna in the form of krishna et cetera et cetera then he said only two person have understood it myself the vyasa and my son shuka why basha because bashar realized that truth then only he wrote why shuka shuku was completely free from his birth before his birth he was completely free from any attachment he had no body consciousness at all so these two the biasia composed it after realization after seeing the whole thing and then shook her his son when he heard from his father immediately realized it is truth but sugar was a gyani even then he understood this is not impossible for god god is all-powerful how come that he cannot take the form any time he can take any form he can do anything why all powerful in this connection friends i'd like to remind you so many of us are asking question asked questions sometimes that why the hindu gods are having so many weapons each and every one even the ganesha he is also having a weapon and why the hindu gods and goddesses having the weapons only the sharashrati and others are not having but mostly you know why it is not that they are going to kill or fight with someone it is true it is the symbol and it wants to say the god is all-powerful the combination of all gods and goddesses that was the goddess durga and that is why so many weapons uh she is holding entertain hands why is so all-powerful she is all pervading so these are all symbols symbolism if you understand then you will understand the hinduism and the vyasa after composing the life of sri krishna he understood it will be very difficult for the ordinary people to accept it at that time it was true only few could understand at that time the krishna was a supreme lord only bhishma or a few others bidura and kunti devi a few only they understood and majority of them they didn't understand the krishna was the supreme and when the sri ramakrishna when sudama krishna came the advancement the people the thinking capacity developed a lot so he need not to do perform any ritual any miracles but still people could understand why because the god means love and god means detachment with this world he never even attached so not that one who is holding lifting the hill then only we will accept that he is a avatar is a incarnation of god why is again it is a misunderstanding he did that only to bring home for the ordinary people to so that they understand is all powerful but now that the society has advanced the now our science has given us the great help the science has done a great job and we can understand different things the cause and effect why this is happening because of this and this capacity is growing and growing in human mind so obviously it is now the human being should understand there must be someone who can be called as god and how we will understand that unselfishness and love these are the two qualities and if you look at the life of bhagavan sri ramakrishna full of that we were reading the uddhava gita and sri krishna mentioned that you better go uttha you better go and have the sadhu-sanga when you have the company of a holy person you will realize god the company of holy person can help you to realize god a holy person can truly help you to realize god now the uddhava said okay but the thing is how i will understand who is a holy person you must tell me the some of the special qualities then only i will understand that this person who is having these qualities is a holy person and there he mentioned in the uddhava gita is a part of the bhagavata in the uddhava gita verses 29 30 and 31 in these three slokas the lord krishna himself gave 28 qualities and it begins with dayalu it begins with kripalu kripalu akita what is this kripalu very kind-hearted if a person is not having that hard the kind heart then he cannot be a holy person he may be some any any other he may be anyone but not a holy person the first quality of a holy person is the kripalu kripa kripa kripa the kindness that is why this in the hindu monks they were not ever in the politics or grabbing the power of ruling never they advised the kings they were the advisors but not the rulers directly why the moment they are becoming the ruler they have to take the decisions hurting others they cannot do that they say this is good and this is better this is up to you so kripa aloof the first is the kind-hearted that is the holy person other people are bad no i'm not telling that from the point of view of spirituality if you like to have the company of a holy person that company his association or her association will help you to realize god then the krishna lord krishna say to dhaba he must be and must be a kind-hearted person and second akrita dhruva not having any jealousy in his mind no jealousy at all the moment there is a jealousy oh he is very popular he is this good this is that that means you have the desire to get the to become popular to get the support of the people local in sanskrit they say loka ishana the people should come to me people should appreciate me this is all the actor actresses leaders all over the world if you look at all they are going on searching and nowadays it has become a craze in the ordinary people also doing something jumping singing and they are posting it so some people will appreciate and they are so happy and if they are not getting his friend is getting it immediately so much of jealousy we must kill him kill her and that type of horrible thoughts are also coming because of the jealousy who is a holy person no jealousy at all so this way if we can understand and his titikshu he never hurts others the people may hurt him but he will never retaliate never depending on god god is because he knows everything is done by god and some people are criticizing him maybe the god wants to go on doing like that so he become alert okay so he sticks you he never takes a heart anyone and finally satthasara and that it i should not say finally it is only in this line satya sara he constantly holds to the truth truth means that god who never changes so fast this kripalu and if that is so if a person a holy person who is having these 28 wonderful qualities can lead you to god then what is god he is the source of the kripa he is the source of the kindness so bhagavan sirama krishna he is mentioning that we have to understand in this way then we continue it is hard to recognize an incarnation of god unless the mind is totally free from lost and gold then he is giving surama krishna as his own and he is giving that example a man asked a sailor of eggplants the value of a diamond the man was then gentleman was having a diamond so costly and he went to the market and he wanted to purchase some eggplants he showed that we live please exchange this some of the eggplants in exchange of this one the eggplant said i can give nine shade of eggplants in exchange not one more because he doesn't know the value of the that jewel so naturally he said like that when the avatar the incarnation of god they are coming to us we don't know them so many of the people that's why whoever comes to me i always say first read the biography of sri ramakrishna and then you will understand how as if an ordinary person without any background of his his father was a very ordinary brahmana but very pious and he himself didn't attain any school so this type of education is not necessary i the some of the people they'll be always talking about oh that swami he's from that university these headphones that it doesn't matter anything when a swami or a sannyasi are a holy person those are not the qualities the qualities are completely different is he kind hearted is he free from jealousy is he hankering for anything so these are the things we have to understand so sudama krishna if we read the biography you will understand from there he is coming up and all the great people rich people well-established people they're all coming and buying down is their aid the bowing down to a person who was to some extent stammer used to stammer and his bengali was not that way even you only knew the bengali that was also not very chest but even then when he used to come and visit people who stood those those who are having the the pure mind they used to like it so much like the recorder of the conversation master marsha he was highly scholar and well educated he he completed his master from the calcutta university in those days and he came to suramar krishna who never attended a school even the basic school he went and then afterwards that much and this master mashay came and bowed down and used to listen used to note down everything why because his heart was pure thought was pure the sudama krishna is mentioning the otherwise you won't understand a rich man i'm not taking the name right this moment so he invited sirama krishna in one of his gathering then he told afterwards he told to another person mathur babu if you bring sirama krishna he must put on proper dress otherwise in the assembly of the gentlemen and ladies there it will be very difficult and soon krishna was very simple never cared for the dresses but he they didn't allow him to go over there and whom they stopped only for little clothings a proper clothings glored why because the delusion so this is the way if we understand the suramar krishna is mentioning the master what a subtle mind he has he was when he was talking a young boy he was enjoying that talk and suramar krishna noticed it and said what a subtle mind he has nanta also could understand things that way in a flash the meaning of the gita the bhagavata and other scripture what the gita is teaching us oh there are some people they'll be only the gita pravachana they will be they're so proud of that they'll be having some marks on their forehead and they're putting on the special type of dress then they will see it and they'll read gita as if the great thing they are doing and what is that gita it only teaches us as bhagavan siddharam krishna said give up give up give up renounce renounce renounce gita and if you just change it in a tyagi it becomes tagi ramakrishna's word tayagi means you have to give what i'm going to give up what i'm having ego whatever the ego that i am having i am thinking i am so and so that is foolishness give up that realize god that is exactly the teaching of the bhagavad-gita what is the bhagavata they are also the major portion they will be teaching the knowledge and in one part they will say that knowledge for whom you are striving you are practicing that param brahma has come in the human form that is sri krishna the subtleness you have to understand it is not the flesh it is not the blood it is not that particular form and some people when the lobster krishna says only shri krishna nobody else again problem so this is the so difficult because of the ego i have understood that i am not going to accept anything else the krishna is the only god and nobody else i am not going to accept other things again they are making the mistake god is all-powerful he can manifest in any form in the bhagavad-gita itself wherever people they are worshiping me all that is coming to me me means what the krishna that particular form and that the ends over there there is no other god krishna the lord cannot take any other form you are restricting god's power it's a sacrilege you are restricting god's power by saying god cannot take any other form because i said that are you more powerful than the lord think of it lord can take the supreme god can take any form anywhere if you like this particular form and particular teaching that is sufficient for you that's why bhagavan si ramakrishna said the one shade of milk though that is sufficient for you why you are going on thinking about so much it's not you don't need that so how many times god will come in the incarnation and what are the forms he is going to take the it's not necessary for you this is sufficient to understand the god came in this particular form and he asked me to do this and so that i can go to him i can realize the truth and i can be in the ocean of bliss that is sufficient so this is the way sadama krishna is mentioning but it is difficult to understand unless one has a very pure mind circle mind the salaam krishna appreciating that boy what a subtle mind he has nanta means tota puri ji so sadama krishna is to call him in in that particular name so he understood it so it needs a special type of intelligence to understand the subtle knowledge of the scripture whatever the scripture is mentioning this much the brahman is all pervading and then we go on explaining this way that way and we're writing on the board this is going and so many things and people are so happy but actually what is the brahman the consciousness that is all-pervading and when you accept that consciousness is every being how can you heart others that is the thing unless you practice that and when you realize that what happens to you the after realization of the brahman that brahman is these brahmana is that okay then what happens to you do you develop the love for others kindness for others that is the question the sudama krishna always insisting that you should realize that truth and then transform yourself renunciation of lost and gold from boyhood amazing indeed it falls to the lord of very few a person without such renunciation is like a mango stuck by a health stone the fruit cannot be offered to the deity and even a man hesitate to eat it so when the life is like this one should be very careful there are people who during their youth committed many sins but in old days chant the name of god well that is better than nothing chanting the name of god krishna at this moment insisting the young people young minds to don't go and get strained in this worldly life before that you save yourself and come to the god if you go to the worldly life it is very difficult to come out we have experiences this the is very very really very difficult so that's why sirama krishna is mentioning that it is possible for the young people to realize god easily i said yes they too will be saved if only they cry to god with a yearning heart and promise not to repeat their sins what will the maya chanting of hari's name accompanying accomplish one must weep sincerely so the attachment to the worldly things that we always feel that attraction and we go and commit the mistake again we come back and say it is very difficult but sirama krishna himself said this is he is mentioning for the brahmacharyans and the monks they want to dedicate their life for god realization from the young age itself be careful but for the householders he said it is nothing wrong for you but you should in a yearning heart should pray to god god you have kept me in the household and can i realize that in other places also we have read already the if they are taking the name of god repeating the name of god praying to the god and imagining the divine play of god all the time their mind also become pure and nothing wrong happens so this way the sirama krishna is explaining friends we will continue this at the ramakrishnas the wonderful teaching now today we have learned that god can be realized but to realize the god we have to renounce the creation of god so we can put it in this way the creator and the creation and if we go for the creation we cannot get the creator and if we go for the creator we have to renounce the creation that's all and how it is possible through the help of incarnation we understand their wonderful life what we see in that life they're full of love and no attachment this very special full of love for each and every one he is visiting different devotees praying for them talking and inspiring them but he is not at us to anything and he's not hankering for any name or fame those who are all the time advertising we are holy people we are holy people there is a doubt according to scripture no because why you have to go on announcing i am a holy person i am only person but necessary naturally you want the support of the people popularity money that means the attraction to the world and when you are attracted to the world of course you if you have the capacity to express different things some people they're very good in the language and they can put different the way that people they like to listen to them there's very good nothing wrong bhagavati shastra there are some people they will mesmerize the world the thousands of people with the wonderful the speaking capacity that some people they have that but that is only one capacity it is not the god realization the god realization means kripalu we have to remember at least one quality there is a very kind-hearted person and free from jealousy without any desire for his own these are the people we can go and sit at their feet and learn from them thank you very much friends do you have any questions maybe one question uh she's asking how should we practice detachment from worldly things this is a it's a practice only now think of your the the childhood days there's so many dolls who you were having maybe almost all of us we have so many so now where are those we have given those up why we have understood that it is not necessary at this age we don't play with the dolls we don't go for all this so we have given up and we were having so good friends in the school days so wonderful friends were there we were so attached to them whatever thing that we has to have i like to share with him or her now where they are so if you analyze your life you will find you are already giving up now at this time understanding that everything is temporary whether you give up or not the nature will dra take it away from you it's better to give up and what is that giving up detachment as long as i am here i should keep it neat and clean i should leave nicely happily but the day the call comes i should go by this way it is possible thank you so practice practice practice yo namaste
