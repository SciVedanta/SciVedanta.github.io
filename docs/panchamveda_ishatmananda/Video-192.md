[193: Panchama Veda 193: Gospel Of Sri Ramakrishna: To Realize God, Stick to One Path](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GmKzP-NzFuQ)

let us begin with this total debacle hum rhythm [Music] dr. jeevan KO be rewritten calmodulin Shravana Mangalam Shri Mata turn to be green and the a Buddha dodging our today our master master who recorded this gospel he's giving the description that happened in the dictionary verse around is nice to stay and it was Sunday September 7 1884 so he is mentioning that it was about 11 o'clock and master was sitting in his room at the Schnee sure and he had not yet taken his midday meal that means Serrano Krishna used to eat before 12:00 that was fixed because he used to say after 12:00 is very bad eating the lunch so we can understand that it was almost like 10:30 11:00 11:30 that is the time and discussion was going on and in that discussion he was talking about the different card today we will discuss very very very important two aspects of the religion one is the all paths leading to the same goal and how to purify the mind these are the two subjects who listen from Bhagavan serum vishna he is talking with the vowels as we discussed in the previous the bowels is a sect of Hinduism but as a mixture of Tantra and paedon that we can say but in their practices practices are completely different but their mixture of Vedanta and Tantra here Raghavan see Ramakrishna when talking with them he said according to Shakti called Shakti means those who are worshipper of Shiva and goddess Kali according to the Shakti cult realized soul is known as : say I will request it to give the attention to the final goal see different names but how things are saying the realized soul is known as : by the Shakti cart and the bowels bowels you know the the practices through songs different songs they'll be singing and they'll be dancing and that is their way of practices that don't have any houses they'll be moving from place to place and that according to the vowels the realized soul is sigh and the sufi cart is a Muslim man is also mixed with the Vedanta this bowels and the Sufis also the mixed with some shut up Hinduism Balanta in them the Sufis also say Orlick they always say the final person was realized there is a leak and the god is alak Niranjan we'll say Allegheny Ranjan this alyc means the purified one and the public guard the same condition the realization realized soul is known as issue trash-talk one who has seen God and for the barren things they called gamma Qian GU means nor the no Arab Brahman the gone means the Nora Brahman Remagen so this is the whole thing that we find the all steps Raghavan Salam Krishna sitting in one place casually going on telling this and in reality he is giving the that one pushed up thing which is very much necessary present alike we cannot survive without religion religion is a must for the human survival I said in that in our appeal that it is like the the religion and human being the relation is just a water and the fish fish cannot survive it out of the water and human being cannot survive without religion but if that water is contaminated poison the it becomes the source of death for the fishes and the same way if the religion become the narrow sectarian it becomes a cause of pain for the human society so we have to understand what actually truly religion is then now here the ceramic is nur he is mentioning that once the bowel the Arts team in a very peculiar way sometimes in the North India when the two moms are meeting each other they will greet in this way Drishti suffers vomiting are you having a clearer idea and if you say oh yeah my glasses are perfect or yes I don't have any glasses I can say no please wrong they are tel telling are you aware about your true nature that you are nothing but the Hartman the Brahman Drishti Drishti means your sight is it clear same way the bowels they always ask have you finished the task of refining the seed up see ma who they are asking the series on totally something different and refining means you know when they are boiling boiling and boiling they go on taking out the liquid birth and ultimately is a very crystal thing that remain so that is what they call refining the syrup and that means have you made your mind purified refining the seed up means purification of the mind sit up here is mine and refining means purification so salam o krishna mentioned about that the refining of the serum now what is the mind and this is a very vital question so we have a mind every one of us we know but we do not understand exactly what these mind is so I will take the help of our Adi Shankaracharya the great master Abba danta who is giving the definition of the mind and he said ganon 3 our nature Manas Joe monomer Asad what is mind mind is dead which is combined with all the senses of knowledge Gannon 3 earning or deaths of the knowledge the sense of knowledge what are the fight the eye the nose down the steam and a year so these are the five organs every human being are having they're going out collecting the information from the objects giving to the mind this we all know but it goes on in such a way not pay much heed to these we don't pay much attention it is automatically going on but the Hindus they have researched on that because they wanted to go beyond the bondage what is that bondage attachment to the world with all worldly things and how we are attached through the body no then what is the problem so going on researching they found out oh inside our body there is a mind and mind is the cause of all these bondages so then in the bridge Eterna company shut also so Shankar Acharya he gave in his own way Priya Donna Cooper Nisha instead of giving a direct definition it gives the some activities of the mind by which you can understand what is mine breeder no pony should say calm sankalpa commotion kava means desired sankalpa means decision kama means desired so the decision to fulfill the desire kama and shankel both then be tickets are doubt we have the desire we have the capacity to take the decision to fulfill the desire then we have B tickets are doubts also whether whether it will be possible for us every day in our life it is happening every day and then Shraddha Estrada positive thinking negative thinking Shraddha positive and a strata negative constantly going on in our mind 3d the Faulkner's I am going to do this I am NOT going to listen to anybody else that is also in our mind or 3t confusion they shall I do this - a line where I will do constantly is going on real the shame the sometimes we feel shame that sometimes the children if they make any mistake and they will be the lowering down there a understand is a sign of shyness that we are also having the same shame is the shyness then the wisdom this wisdom is called that we can understand the subtle thing also somebody says something and we can understand that that type of subtle capacity of the mind to understand skull theme then pre-pre is called BRE means fear and all these modifications and our mind the breathin Upanishads are giving so many almost covering everything which happens in our all the time in our mind so this is mine and Shankar Raja is telling how it is possible is the mind attached to it our all the senses of knowledge this pipe that is now we find Shankara again is telling nasty a victim Inasa a terracotta the where is the coordinate where is the problem it is in the mind and why Shankara says it is a big deal with the means ignorance new science we misunderstand things that is called our big deal in Sanskrit what is the misunderstanding we accept which is completely temporary as permanent every one of us constantly going on thinking so the older generation they are selling out the property the younger generation they are going on purchasing the property things are going on the same way and the the grandfather and the father they are withdrawing their things and the sands and the brand sounds they are jumping on those things which they are now leaving is it not to you if you just open your eyes and you see say anything is going on why because we are bound to do that you cannot control why because of a big dr the ignorance the mean science and we're from that new science topic there comes a very special power of God that is covering our mind that's called Maya in Sanskrit that is a great word Amy why a Maya and noticed that Maya nobody can define but we are all influenced by the Maya and this Maya is very peculiar and that's why one off to another side by side the same thing is happening but we do not understand the elderly people in India they are selling out all the properties in India they're coming back and eager and circling with their children a children's are purchasing property over here and then one day will come then once again they will give that on sale why things are going on it's all temporary but we always think that this is funny no problem in purchasing or sailing the problem is if we take it seriously that's why Shankara says mano he obedia Papa panda he the problem is with the mind and that is the reason the bowel they're very conscious about it so he is constantly burning the others his fellow the bowels that are you serious about refining your seed up are you serious about refining your mind and what is that refinement here comes the mind has full function the wind we called mind in English there's a completely different than the Sanskrit word mana in a in a mana usually translated as a mind but the mana has four different aspects actions what are those what is confusion the very first thing shall I delete shall I not any decision we like to take before that and they always say the elderly people think hundred times before you take the decision that's true why it is in the mind it never comes then you go to some people and ask what do you think about it or duty we take the opinions then only about our in the diseases we go for second opinion third opinion from the doctors one doctor said these I go to second doctor third doctor then only wait oh yes all are telling the same thing okay why because the confusion is always there in our mind and that confusion is because of the minor it cannot allow us to do to take the decision but again there is a part of the mind the wing that sankalpa be culpa art Mika when shall I do this or shall I nod that portion of the mind is known as mana aiming in a mana then another part of the same mind is called intellect put D it takes the decision is a good leader means you can take that understand the whole situation and can take the decision there's a good leader leader doesn't mean that is someone in the political field litter everywhere in the business world in the social lives in the private personal lives also the father is the leader of the whole household if he takes wrong decisions suffering for all the members of the family so obviously the one who is taking the decision must be very careful what intellect put D this good deed is intellect and then comes the cheetah cheetah is the storehouse the moment I you know that I went to have somebody's house the little girl - she saw me when small little girl naturally forgot the when the father was talking and introducing him to you have seen swamiji and this thing happened that thing happened we visited from G over there slowly slowly she started understanding and they showed the pictures also then she became very close to because the recognition but the elderly people the moment we see immediately it comes in the mind where from it comes that is called cheetah and of all these three functions are happening because of the power and that power is named as a home god this hunger that is the for now what is jivatma here is very important we call is called the jivatma the Jeeva means this living being Atma means this soul what is that soul it says but D that intellect part of the mind plus ungara the ego the power of the mind Plus punch again in Rio plus the last one the reflection of the pure consciousness on the intellect that this is a very vital point for the Vedanta the wind they say the God is residing in every being is deciding the vital question if the God is residing in every being that means God has become so many millions of limits small small pieces and there is no actual God now because he has been divided into millions of pieces is it possible no then how God is deciding in Sanskrit is a beautiful word - laters word called beeboo beeboo means all-pervading how it is possible consciousness and consciousness all pervading each and everyone is having that consciousness when that consciousness is absent then we are dead and what is that consciousness reflection of the pure consciousness it's not that original one is a reflection but it is so powerful that the booty our until it becomes so luminous so that is the reason we say our mind is God or the intellect is our God but in reality is the reflection so this is mean we have to remember we are going to realize God but what that we I am going to realize God what that I then we say it is my soul the jivatma in the Christians and the Muslim the system and the tradition they say they will go to heaven someday that they wait for the final call that then they go to the heaven what that day that body wrong thing body decomposed whatever may be that we are applying on the body how long it will survive and maybe that we are making the rest' stone building inside the heart and keeping that no that won't be there if you open you will find nothing sometimes even the bones are also not there in our faith there is a different thing but what actually remain that consciousness it never goes anywhere so naturally the Hindus they saved you burn the body the so many places the into the burning the body and Hindus are everywhere nowadays you know what happened you know in there some some stay country in Middle East usually they don't die Hindus they don't die over there because young people they come there what can they go back so there was no problem suddenly one accident happen and one worker he passed away he was a Hindu and he was not having sufficient money to take that dead body to the country so the groups of Hindu they went to the governor of the city and told you have to allow us to burn it then they said no it is not allowed over here there's a lot of lawsuits and this thing dead body is lying and they are now going on discussion ultimately they had to accept because the majority of the Hindus are there everywhere in the country taking care of the world doctors engineers teachers so what to do then they gave in a corner in a in a very dim place in the desert and there they took their wounds and the burn they could keep the body as they keep in the another in that problem the way the local barring their two bodies no because our tradition we have to burn so all these things happen they burn the body like so this way it goes why we Hindu burn the body because they don't pay much attention to the body why because jivatma Jeeva Atma these two words together jivatma what is the jivatma jivatma is the combination of three things what first is intellect is not the mind is the intellect body then another part of the mind monkara ego and the third thing is punch again in drill under this tree reflection of the super super consciousness supreme consciousness and that is called the jivatma and so that Apple is asking ceramic is not one can see God but to this mind through purified mind a shark attack Ajay the shooter moon should the moon should art Mobb act the pure mind and the pure soul of the God at the same now what is this purity we will go to this and this is really really very important sama Krishna told only one sentence but you see to understand that we have to explain so many ways refining the setup is very important purification of our present mind is very very important but how again Shankara says that mana sudonym karyam Priya dynamics now who will do it those who are moo moo shu what the poop show they are very curious very interested to realize God very interested to know the truth so that is called moo moo shu in one single words it but explains the whole personality of the the gentleman or the lady was trying to realize god no mock show this momusu Tao means desire to realize God desires are there so many desires hundreds of millions of desires the human being is nothing but desires only from the morning to before he go to bathe all my desires but some desires are so good what I like to seek God I like to serve God I like to feed God I have to become like at all desires those who are having their separate group they called moo moo moo moo shu they must try the seekers of liberation must ride sincerely to purify the mind third mana sadhana mana mine pseudonym purification Korean activity prayer minimum of Sunnah they must start practicing their bee suit this a teacher eaters mean when the mind is purified then shankara's telling a very very interesting word he says Mukti liberation is just like a fruit that is on your palm you can take it anytime Gaurav Calliope cara cara means the palm followed is the fruit is just like a fruit on your palm anytime you can eat and can taste is this that it's time it will take and so becomes so simple so how to realize God by purification of the mind and how to purify mind we'll come to that and the process of purification is not much only five what are the five things it says first and foremost decision form decision to realize the truth there's the first thing form decision to realize the truth that Jesus said to his disciples burn the boat at your back and follow me why he said burned the boat sometimes in English they will say those who are dedicating for the service of God after crossing the bridge burned the bridge that means you are in the household and from there you are going to take another life pursuing are trying to realize the God no question of going back burn the bridge burn the boat if it is already there in some times and go as they will come to become a mom but they could keep their bank accounts and that from the job they will take one here the vacation or six months vacation they will come and not only that they will be in this place sometime and that place sometime so they are going on testing they won't be able to become a monk the monk could means the Guru said and Swami Vivekananda said one person came Schrom eg I'd like to become your disciple why I like to realize God is it okay are you ready to listen to the words of guru yes go on climb on that tree and jump from there are you ready he's jumping from there I will die that means you don't have the faith in the world guru you can't meet him decision means decision so that's why farm decision to realize the truth no question our chocolate let us try and then go back not like that strong decision I am going to realize the truth and seeking root out the attachment to same subjects ii do not the attachment we are there working leaving utilizing everything that we were doing in this world because as long is a surviving as long as this body is there we have to take medicine we have to take food we have to sleep we have to do each and everything that this body and minds want we have to do we must do otherwise just going and committing suicide ISM no reason and we must do all those things mixing with the people going to the society but there's a big part and that is unattached everything should be from the distance we go into that but we are not there so second is root out the attachment it's not for one day it is a practice the attachment you have to go keep slowly renounce all actions the Selective confusion actions if we give up then what we will do many of the people they always if the reference they the Indians the Hindus Ramana Maharshi there's a great soul the Ramana Maharshi innovated any action any work in that way afterwards is to give some advices that's also the work and some horse romney's are also there oh those who were that that it disciples of march are the money daily for frames they will to march are the money daily and they told we don't like to work only we like to practice meditation will you please allow us mother gave them the quinoa pasta that go because if you are wearing this saffron color color cloth you will get some food wherever you go great respect is there for the moms in Indian Indian society so take this and go and practice mother never say no no you have to work never because they were ready they are very highly advanced Souls without any work 24 hours continuously practicing meditation and calling on God is not a matter otherwise will will become mad we have seen some of the people forcefully trying to do that becoming man they lost their mental balances so Swami Vivekananda he introduced these and with the four yoga's and it is so easy just become even the ordinary people can also purify their mind when you get up in the morning after the evolution coming and sitting for the prayer meditation and chanting the name of God one way you are purifying the mind how you are purified detaching your mind from the worldly thoughts and line the mind on the thought of God that is purification then you go and then you come to worship or you go and take little food and then you go for the work whatever the work has been given to you that you are doing and thinking that I am giving this work as dedicating this work to the feet of God that is also purification even those who are in the household they can also practice in this way bounds of course they can do in the ramakrishna mission if you go you will find that those who are declaring that we are following the path of knowledge or those who declaring that we a path of following the path of cup T go to them you see the same routine they are following like us saying routine in the morning they are getting up and praying or meditating and then they are going for some work either they are cooking or taking care of the cows in the cowshed or these Kowal that were selling books writing books all those words they are doing without working can no one can stay so obviously the work but even that work is dedicated every moment to God to the mind is purified so this is second then third is first prayer meditation and that this word and then knowledge constantly you are reading books are listening to the words of the Guru's discussing between the frames among the friends and that way you are keeping your mind always on an intellectual level spiritual level because also so all the four processes helping you so they say root out the attachment of saints objects renounce the action come your karma those actions which you are doing for the result that you should give away and many of the people now those who are keeping touch with our Indian the things that is happening in our country almost all those who are going for the the boat and all that going to the temples previously none of them visited but now any temple in the any locality they are all going and then giving the costly the flower all those things to the God and their pictures are also published in the newspaper and people are happy see how devoted they are they are not there going to God only because of this and afterwards when they will be elected keep notice how many times they go over there no so this is not come your karma I am going to God and doing these because the win the blessings of God elect to achieve this that is called Kamiya karma what with strong desire that we should not do and then faith in the brahmana pure consciousness because we are discussing from the point of view of the the vedanta superior consciousness that is there and I am that practice that all the time so far from decision second root out the attachment third renounce the action which we action with result and the fourth is faith in the consciousness of God and faith practice whatever the Guru has given you to do sometimes repeating the name of God and praying or some time going on repeating the Mahabharata these are the processes by which we can purify our mind so ceramic richness say only the bowel came and he said have you refined a purified finish the task of refining the seed up so see how things goes on what is that Siddha mind what is that nine part of the jivatma what is the jivatma then how to purify the mind why because that is the cause of bondage and how it rhyme because of the desire so what is the trick of purification giving up the desire and then going towards the God and the whole process the Ramakrishna put in a very simple language who can say that see Ramakrishna say turn your mind more Vidya down turn your mind towards God mind has desired mind has activities mind has the ignorant but if you turn towards God God I don't know anything but you I don't want anything but you so all this if you are turning towards God purification of the mind so how simple it is so that's why Raghavan see Ramakrishna is telling like that then the other he is telling so the bowels do not like the worship of an image that this is in India there are many many sects are there they do not worship images so the bowels do not like worship of an image the sheikhs there also with a part of the Hindus the follow the same way but now a little bit a different so they are keeping the Darwin as a symbol of the religious faith and other things are also they don't have the image what do they do they go and worship a book when they go to that that's called Gurudwara the door of the guru what is that good God and how to approach the car by worshipping a book easily talk this type of images photos they take keep the book but there is a another group in the north northern northeastern part of India they are very strong are the Krishna worshipers but without the image of Krishna they worship the book that is Baba that book they will keep in a really nice way they will come and they will worship that book and they will read from that book so they have given the name of the temple nom garden so all the approaches are different the ceramic richness Tillich they don't worship the image what they do they want a living man to worship and that is why in their some of their section called cutter table a job Carta means the master budget means worshipers they worship the master they worship the Carta that is guru and that is God you see non-si Ramakrishna sterling you see so many opinions there are about God each opinion is a bad there are innumerable opinions and innumerable paths leading to God this is very very important this advice for the present day so we are constantly fighting in the name of religion we are constantly dividing people in the name of religion so this advice of Cyrano Krishna the when they say that there are innumerable opinions and eternity new variable perhaps then one disciple of Salaam o Krishna his name is Prabhu na he asked then what should we do in so many paths so many opinions the which one we should follow look at this then see Rama Tichenor say you must stick to one path with all your strength a man can reach the roof of the house is given the example by stone stairs or a ladder or a rope ladder or a row or even a bamboo but he cannot reach the roof if he sets food now on one and now on the another he should firmly follow one path likewise in order to realize God a man must follow one path with all the strength so this is advice of ceramic ish now when you say about the all paths are coming to the same goal how it is possible sometimes some people you do not understand will come then why you didn't you become these and change the religion you need to only you should be sincere and serious about following a path frames I will take the help of another book that we have published many of you have seen the many ways to God based on this advice of the ones around Krishna and we have researched our people have wristers researched and we have published that book and in details have been given of course not we cannot see details briefly we have given six or seven religious parents and then ultimately the back of the book we have given a chart visual chart and you can see how all paths are leading to the same goal then ceramic fish not but you must regard other views as so many paths leading to God one must be sincere following one's own path and then he said you must regard other views so many paths leading to God here I brought the book and see the last page here in this way we have given a chart the book is many ways to God the small book here we have given this and to read the practices we have given religion period of origin founder primary scripture and practices I just follow the practices you see first Hinduism what are the practices ethics and morality then prayer what shield pilgrimage meditation repetition of holy name japa observance of Allah days austerities exercise to restrain one's own body and mind love and unselfishness then discrimination between the permanent the real and the temporal unreal next comes the Chinese and that is also a part of the Hinduism but practice separately and they say it takes on morality so if you go to Jane he we are joined by our not in those okay but what are the things you follow Hindus they follow ethics and morality first in ethics and morality pilgrimage meditation observance of the holidays austerities that means to exercise restraint one's body and mind unselfishness and dispassion towards the worldly objects any difference so this is the thing if we really sincerely follow in then the third comes the Buddhism the one lady told show me I am very much interested in Buddhism why not follow that and what is Buddhism but the Hinduism cannot give me the satisfaction I like to follow the Buddhism but come follow that but what is that Buddhism it says faith in the teaching of Buddha and what is that teaching right view right aspiration right speech right action right livelihood right endeavor right mindfulness and right concentration that means ethics morality control of the body and mind compassion unselfishness and development of correct understanding and it evens Britain Hindu and Muslim the James and the Buddhist in practices all the same only table we will recite maybe many of the Hindus those who know mostly they recited on the Sanskrit and these people that put this from the Pali that much some of the words are different but the same practices now then come Judaism and the Judaism the practices charity justice prayer meditation diet rest observance abilities treatment of the fellow humans every act of Jews person can become an act of worship karma yoga and you must perform in a way that abides by God's law that is Christian then Judaism then comes the Christianity righteousness purity unselfishness ethics morality faith in Jesus prayer worship plumage meditation repetition of God's name austerity to restrain one's body and mind love charity unselfishness do you think there is anything new and finally Islam they called faith fasting and pilgrimage that is Islam they do but these are the when see ramakrishna is telling all paths are leading to the same goal we see how it is possible because the Hindu temple we are having some so many images and the Christians and Islam they are not having the images that much in the Hindus also just now I quoted the bowels not having any majors even the bush novels the sector which never is not having any images there are some philosophies they're not having any images you do not even believe in the existence of God they believe only the soul so there are so many but all are leading to one thing what is that ethics and morality love and unselfishness so that's how it Shami be bacon under when he came over here and this is the main thing in the modern society when Sri Ramakrishna after practising all this religion in his own life he passed away in 1886 within a small period not even ten years eight nine years 1893 first time in the history of the human society in the sixteen thousand years of the civilization first time someone thought why not we have a congregation of all the different faiths and here in this Chicago so that is the speciality the ceramic region of the God he gave that God and it reached the heart of someone and he was thinking I am thinking John barrows they were thinking we should do but we're from the thought came and then that was the first time they actually organized the meeting and the celebration exavation only to sell their products but how come this single and then they'd never invited the Hinduism confused to whom to invite there are so many sects are there but their him the person one in the person came uninvited almost crashed the door and entered and he was the disciple of and his words touched the hearts of 7,000 presently don't you feel that truly something is coming and that is leading to this idea that we must follow our own path but not hitting others and these thought only can bring peace in the mind of the human being so if from the childhood learn this no hatred no criticism follow your own path that is the best civilized way of thinking that will help and ceramic isne in bingo we call it Jotham art Tata patha as many faiths so many paths but you must regard other views as so many paths leading to God you should not feel that your path is the only light path those who have read the lectures of Shama vivica and the delivered over here the same thing be waken on the E chord with a better language that's all and that other parts are wrong you must not fear malice towards others this is the teachings of Bhagawan Sri Ramakrishna those who come to take the initiation I always say initiation is nothing but accepting ideology and what is the ideology of Raghavan Saddam Tichenor this the pure love and unselfishness that is the ideology of Raghavan serum Krishna and following the serum Krishna's way one cannot criticize others should not do that otherwise you are not following his path and the time will come the people will know the world will know that this is the only way to save our skin all over the world and people are constantly thinking in a narrow way we can kill them and we can be happy it cannot be the moment you are generating hatred maybe that hatred that will go to others when that is solved the same thing will enter into your family you will start hating your family because that is the quality that you have developed the wrong quality bad quality and so obviously we have to understand when you are reading the pages of the gospel of ceramic dish now we should understand that the God has incarnated in the modern age to guide us why to give us peace and happiness and also liberation the liberation means free from the bondage of the circle of bartended by following all the paths that has been prescribed the yoga bhakti devotion then meditation and also garnet knowledge so these four paths when we are following we become a perfect personality and then we develop love for each and every one and that loves gives us a satisfaction a containment that is the achievement of the spiritual life thank you very much let us change this mantra need an answer [Music] popped on gumball Drita big runway ish Avatara
