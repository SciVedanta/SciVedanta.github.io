[240: Panchama Veda 240 : Oh Mother ! Make me mad with thy love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BPThfXcNwzw)

good evening friends dear devotees let us begin core weekly and Java by the discourse and as usual let us begin with this chanting Tabaka Tom rhythm topped achieve annum Kobi be rewritten Cal mashup 'him Shravan among golem 3 Madame boobie goon and ta burry dodging aha today we shall read and discuss from the page 614 that is the gospel of ceramic Asian and the English version and the Bengali the kilometer that that pages 760 published by wood Borden the frontier will be reading you know those who are following these discourses classes for a long time all the time the the Ballentine and the Hindu they say there are two types of joy one is be shy Ananda be Shia on and the joy from the object from the be Shia what is that be Shia the anything of this worldly and it may be food it may be scenery it may be the sound it may be the smell it may be the touch so all these enjoyment but this be shy Ananda is very temporary but the problem is its attraction as because it is palpable just before us we can feel it we can see it we can smell it we can test it so we mostly go for the Bergeron endure this is another on endure that is called brahmananda the spiritual joy the joy from the self joy from the art man joy from the Brahman that is the true joy that is the real enjoyment but we don't have the patience to get that the sometimes we complain that we cannot touch it we cannot discuss we cannot have the dialogue with it we cannot see it so naturally the majority of the people they go towards the be shy Ananda and that is the trap there is what the goddess made is the big trap will be reading from vagabond see Ramakrishna how nicely he has described this trap and if we go to that and then we are very happy with that we finish our journey over there we cannot go to the goal the Bhagavad see Ramakrishna he is giving the example haven't you seen the game of the hide-and-seek it is the granny will dad the game should continue the grannies will the game should continue I don't know in the modern days with that the children are playing it or not but that was a very common game in the villages still they may be playing the one will be in the center and there are others the round is there the two three rounds are there that is guarded by some people the players don't allow the opponent party to enter into that and somehow if you can make it possible one line you cross and come inside and then second line and third line then in the center you can go and touch the granny and you are passed your game is over but the granny doesn't want that everybody should be able to come and touch him the if it goes then the whole game is over so that will similarly cinema Krishna's telling if all touch hard and released then the plane comes to stop therefore it is not a will that all should touch her as if the god is the granny should sitting in the center and all these worldly enjoyments there are five of them the five circles the constantly girding and you have to cross the one after another and then you can go and touch it and it's so difficult because there will be temptation so much of temptations and physical joy and the nature in the prakruti and the that will grow in the body itself nobody has to give injected it automatic at least there the mind and the body that becomes like that and that drag you is the guardians then the Guru they constantly guide them don't talk to them don't mix with them don't look at them don't like these days days so the spiritual journey is constantly it should be guided otherwise is very difficult so guru is very very important spiritual life the guru constantly guiding you inspiring you so this is the way they go another example Raghavan Ramakrishna is giving you see in big green shop big grain stores the merchants keep rising great hips that touch the ceiling beside them there are heaps of lentils to protect the grain from the mice the merchants leap trains are popped rice and sweetened rice near it the mice like the smell and the sweet taste of these and so stay around the trees they don't find the big heaps of green similarly men are deluded by last and gold they do not know where God is the very vivid example the God is the source of joy but somehow the majority of the human being they cannot reach over there why just like the owner of the grain is keeping the tray full of puffed rice and sweetened rice the God has kept five trays and those are the sight the taste the smell the touch so like these if we go one after another not a bunch of Iran's eater Kim Shankaracharya in his Buick to Remini he said with one only they are bound a fish and a a deer and an elephant let there only one but all the five that is there in the human can imagine the struggle of the human so obviously majority of the people they are bound by that they think that they're very highly educated and they'll be declaring oh I don't believe in the existence of God and all they will say but in reality they do not have this tan the consciousness that is there within the consciousness and the intellect that has come to him where from it has come who has given it can this be accidental so these are the questions unsolved questions and people don't want to discuss about it just simply they're enjoying the life I believed my life and the same passage same way they will give it to their next generation so they will grow up they will get little education they will earn money and the wealth and they will marry they will settle for the again in the household and the one day they will pass and their juniors will cry and the life continues and continues now if you step aside and look at this flow of life you will wonder why each and every one repeating the same thing and with the same just with the same encouragement they are trying to enjoy this worldly thing they are thinking oh we will enjoy it to the extent it possible well ultimately ends up in what if you look at the drunkard people they go on drinking drinking drinking and they have so many different names of the same drink and then they will taste these they will taste that they will have they will remember so many names I mean the parties maybe they'll be telling oh you don't have these I drank that ultimate what after drinking bottles after bottles they're carried by two three people maybe the driver maybe is someone and they will they put them and and they throw them at the back of the seat and then they will drive and the next day morning they are getting up somehow opening their eyes may be very late again from the evening they're doing the same thing is this the joy so we have to remember we have to ask is this the joy truly so what is the joy exactly if we remember this example of Agra vans around Krishna just like the Mises we are going and enjoying the little thing that they have left before us the God has kept for us why should it be so for God has given us the discrimination cinema Krishna takes us to that so that be shy ananda and brahmananda now how to pray one should be discriminative we should be Chara what is that bechara what is the discrimination what is the analysis that my grandfather did do all these things my father also did the same thing and generation after generation people are doing the same thing what is the joy what is the eternal peace what is the eternal happiness when I am thinking in that way then only I can understand the words above and Ramakrishna then only I will know that truly truly this pages all these advices at the Ramakrishna is nothing but Veda nothing but the knowledge spiritual knowledge that will give me liberation enlightenment so he is telling like that the people are deluded with the lust and gold they do not know where God is now he is quoting a conversation between Rama and Narada Sri Ramachandra he was very happy with Narada and he acts narada sir ask a boon of me Anuradha now Neruda seed rama is there anything I lack what shall I ask of thee but if thou must give me a boon grant that I may have self less love for die Lotus wait so this is the word that we should mark self less love and that is spirituality that is God now sometime people will be asking again and again have you seen God and seen as if I have to see an object as I see the wall as I see the books as I see a person as I see the cheer like that I have to see the God and object God is not object God is the subject how can I see God so I am imagining because I am praying and strongly praying to the God please take it form I'd like to see you in this form so the God takes that form so that is the what is God realization then this point should be clear God realization is nothing but full of unselfish love unselfish love that means lab and the unselfishness this together is God if anyone is having that love and lab that embraces everyone everything and also naturally he cannot do that unless and until she cannot do that unless and until having the unselfishness to the love and unselfishness club together Narada is seeking the blessings of the Rama what he sees telling like this I may have selfless love for thee I may not be deluded by thy world be switching Maya Rama are said Narada as something else it's a provoking playing with the disciple and disciple should be discriminative obviously the teacher is teaching you giving you the full understanding that of this whole subject the in he will put the question before you those things you have to cross you have to answer then only teacher is happy here the Sri Ramachandra again asking and say Narada are something else not a day again replied O Rama I don't want anything else be gracious to me and see that I have pure love for thee I have pure love for thee what is this pure love but is there is no any other thing but love that is called pure love we talk of love everywhere every time and in English everywhere in America and I love you I love you I love every time but what is that just from the leap then when I am there I am concerned for you that much but the l.o.v.e wins someone asked about the Ramakrishna Swami Vivekananda he replied see Ramakrishna he's l.o.v.e personified the what is God love what type of love unselfish love selfless love the love that can embrace each and every one so what is God l.o.v.e so that is the reason sometimes some people when they're asking that this is the answer the God realization doesn't mean that I have to see the Dozen of light doesn't mean that I had to have the moleculus power to walk on the water a fly like the bird that is that may kama may not come but the main goal is to develop unselfishness and love and not other wanted that from Sri Ramachandra Raghavan see ramakrishna now giving his own example I pray to the divine mother Oh mother I don't want name and fame I don't want the eight occult powers I don't want a hundred occult powers Oh mother I have no desire for creature comforts please mother grant me the boon that I may have pure love for Dai lotus feet the cinema Krishna's prayer the other day someone questioned can I pray for the betterment of our children surely why not as a mother as a grandmother as a father grandfather and a brother sister naturally we can pray to God others to whom shall we go God is there he's merciful all-powerful so for our problem naturally we'll go to God but this is the last tape of prayer those who know the story of that nachi kita and that is the way step by step the prayer no chickie the first prayer to the god of death he asked may my father sleep well because he is in anxiety for me I have left my home I have come to you so obviously my father must be tormenting so give him the peace just personal prayer to whom shall we go when we are in that condition obviously we have to pray to Him now as a ramakrishna mission monk we have some program plan and planning I am trying my best all of you know to make an institution where we can all different religions come sit together and discuss the Parliament of religion that happened in Chicago so obviously that should follow that way we can discuss pure spiritual discussion no social movements of the political things nothing just bill political I bear spiritual thing so this spirituality we'll be discussing that is mine desire because Raghavan C Ramakrishna he leaved and showed that all paths are leading to the same goal in the long long back if we go in the vedanta-sutra tis one only different people calling the truth in different names ei comes at me prabhu who da ba don t so that is the tradition if we can once again particularly the intellectual people the modern people educated people and very well-connected people if they understand this truth all problems will be solved difficulties will be solved and the younger generation if they grow through this ideology this eye then they will become in different different countries they'll be the head of the countries and they will be friendly which each country so the tensions and the economy in the political field will be very very less because of this understanding and one understanding what is that God is one and we call him in various names that is the idea so I pray so let me give some help the monetary help and also the people educated qualified people should come and they should help they should develop otherwise how it is possible then where I will go I will go to cocoon only I am NOT asking for myself so that way I am serving my god you in the household where he will go some problem has come should naturally to guard so much Akitas fast prayer was for his father no cheeky the second prayer was for different people many people there suffering God when I heard that if they can go to heaven they can enjoy at least for some time heaven is also temporary place but at least for some time and it's a long period of time let them enjoy how do you reach over there to heaven so he was not a gator prayed and the third prayer is that is when Saddam o Krishna is speaking about these this is the last player the third player don't get confused this is the last player the third prayer of the Nikita I want to know the art man and here's the Ramakrishna said I know that you were the only and the an only being so I want my love to die 2d and nothing else that is the last prayer the cinema Krishna is telling it is written in the dirt but Ramayana that Lakshmana arcs to Rama now he immediately is taking towards now God is praying that give me only love the spiritual love so that I forget this world now if I forget this world what is this world made up he is quoting from the theatre Ramayana where the Lakshmana is asking Rahman Rama's three dimensions Rama in how many forms and moves you do exist how many forms and modes except drama there is nothing except that God there is nothing the obviously the question in how many forms and mood you exist how shall I be able to recognize you it's so confusing the where I will understand that you are there there's so many when the children they sometimes the school programs are going on and maybe twenty five little girls they'll be done seeing the parents are also eager to find out their the sweet daughter is dancing the air and daughter is also excited my parents are there sir so many people but the daughter's eyes is searching in that stadium auditorium where is my mother and my father the sound time they'll be putting a special mark so that among so many they can understand oh that is my daughter the same way all dresses and they are dancing so they do like that so Lakshmana is asking to Ramachandra you become everyone how will understand that your manifestation is more over there and Rama he stilling I exist everywhere you find the manifestation of exacting love that is for certain I am there that love makes one laugh and weave and dance and seeing the love for God and what happened he forgets the external world who are the people all around when that love surges he forgives though all around the people who look at him laugh at him talk about him what they are thinking they forget totally well the tremendous love and he'll be dancing before everyone singing crying that is a different completely different thing so it says that the lab makes one laugh and weave and dance and scene if anyone has developed such a love you may know for certain that God Himself is manifest dear then he is telling to be more specific jatin the briefs that state not all then suddenly if you are doing like that is not chaitanya mahaprabhu Jatin they hearest into that body consciousness completely gone and obviously all around oh people what they are doing that also never cares and that is the condition if you see in any human being noise for sure my manifestation in that particular being is full the devotees listened spellbound to see Ramakrishna his burning words entered their souls sparring them along the path of renunciation master mache commenting it is he only may be some people may be others also but master mache the burning the zeal to understand God to realize God in this very life he was a pure soul he came to see Ramakrishna's young Krishna chose him and ceramic esna gave all this not many years only few years that he collected his conversation and he is recording now he spoke to each on in a serious voice friends we were reading that particular chapter advised to ish on ition is a Brahmin and a higher caste and is a religious bent of mind that Asian was having but at the same time he was having many other things the God loved him he wanted to guide him direct him and that is the reason he is very seriously telling ish on don't forget yourself because of what you hear from your flatterers the flatterers gathered around the world man it should not be some people they come particularly those who are having the wealth and also some position immediately some people will come and they'll become so close very sweet tongue and the way they will talk and you'll be naturally attracted to them they will come and they will taro you do not know how good you are how successful you are like this like this like this ceramic is not making him that you must be conscious about these people who talk like this behave like this and they are not you true your real friends simply they are flattering you the worldly people have no staff in them friends the worldly people means those who love only worldly success worldly development they believe that there is only world and nothing else they believe that this is the only life so enjoy it as maximum as possible sometimes they have philosophized also the whole thing not that the ignorant people they do we are not talking about them there like the children now Buddha badum you need a Ghanim karma Sangha nam in the bhagavad-gita karma sanguine under those who feel that we should do this and we will go to heaven and if we do this then we are protected okay let them continue that is all right so organum karma sanguinem they are not that way educated they are ignorant so that is the reason the god said let them do slowly they will come they will understand so they consider them as the children but if you have some stuff in you if you have understood something there's a beautiful word used for that those people who are trying to realize God say momoke show that Mamaki means one who is having the desire to be liberated Mukti et amo moksha tah at fordham only sadhana krishna is telling and he is because he love is Shawn he is forcing him arching him like a true guru the guru will always guide like that you can do you can do don't waste time like that they will say so this is the Salam o Krishna is guiding him worldly people have no stuff in them they're like a heap of Calgon the flatterers come to them and say you are so charitable and wise you are so pious these are not mere words but pointed bamboos trusted them how foolish it it is to be surrounded day and night by a bunch of worldly Brahmin pundits and hear their flattery the one must be careful particularly in the spiritual life in the worldly life also the moment you become successful immediately you are surrounded by those people who will guide you in such a way take you to your destruction and then they'll be immediately they will fly away they are not there so you have to choose who can be my friend so that is very very difficult a person is successful if he can choose his friends properly maybe he'll be criticizing you may be that he is not coming to you maybe sometimes he is angry and then sometimes loving you very much so that person is a normal person and then you should have to understand he is not going to take anything from you sometime busting in the reflec did glory that these people that parasites the flatterers they're always bask in the reflected glory you know with my friend you know who is my relative they will be taking all the benefits one must be careful in the world and spiritual life also the more you become little advanced in spiritual life and you become people will be attracted to you they like to come immediately some people will come surround you no you cannot go to the Swami he is taking rest and there'll be no Swami you should not do this you should do this you should talk to him so that we will be all around Salameh krishna is pointing to that the one must be careful both successful in the worldly life and also spiritual life sometimes a very great person after practicing severe austerity he has achieved some spiritual power but some people will come him idiot and they'll be guiding and they'll be purchasing land and doing these doing that they are enjoying where is he or she the spiritual personality is nowhere that say one must be very very careful that is exactly and those who are trying to be successful in spiritual life for dames Ramakrishna is giving and he said worldly brahmin pundits the Brahmin means very intelligent pundits is a scholar but worldly he'll be that is there that we have seen some people I am NOT going to name them and how they are surrounded their good people were surrounded by these people you cannot reach to him a religious person should be completely free all the time anyway worldly then he said arbitration and leadership he is telling tuition mission was a to serving central leader in the society the people is to come to him he was busy in giving them some advices are be chrétien another instead of going to the code for that and particularly in those days then someone who is accepted by all so they would be coming and he will give them advise these that so that is a shot of a pride I'm doing this I'm doing that so arbitration in leadership how triple these are charity and doing good to others for the highest spiritual goal goal that is also nothing the charity whom I helping there's some people they will give little money and they'll go on telling everyone you know I have given these I am giving that and these and their data be that is foolishness whatever they have done it is a completely wastage they'll give little money to some wrongs and some the people who'll need Zell and go on telling everyone as an organization of course this is the responsibility to publish the report because the donors they like to know whether their money that they have donated for that particular purpose has been used or not obviously the organization should do this is the responsibility of the organization to give back the complete report you gave this much money and we with that money we have helped these type of people so that is accountants and this is the openness should be but an individual person he is trying to do something some help immediately will take the photograph and these that and go on sending to each and every one he knew that is worldliness this is not at all good so that ceramic is telling charity and doing good to others you have had enough of these is now he's talking seriously to the ishan those who are to devote themselves to such things belong to a different class now the time is right for you to devote your mind to the lotus feet of God now the time is right because of the age we do not know when we will die and we are thinking okay okay then we can do this we can do that time is there we can call on God no time is very short so that is the reason French slowly Bhagwan see ramakrishna is taking our mind through Ishaan he is addressing to Ishaan but those who are very serious all these advices for them if you realize God he will get everything else first God then charity doing good to others doing good to the world and redeeming people the ceramic is new the sometimes the senior people in the ramakrishna mission Ramakrishna and mission two words mission means activities what type of activities men evil in activities charitable activities so that show me Vivekananda introduced and young people they are very enthusiastic to do that and they will be engaging themselves completely into that and get tired their own seat for meditation and doing their taking the name of God or chanting nothing sometimes the senior Swami's used to say so don't put the cart before the horse Ramakrishna fast then the mission for whom you have come then these two reminders again and again Hartman amake Artem jagat he tied cha and for the betterment of the world but the ultimate thing the ultimate thought should be realization of God realization of God is the first whether I am getting some opportunity to do these that in an organization you know hierarchies are there so I like to go to that post so the people will think about me people who know about people will come to me they will have how many of you know the other Swami's only the in-charge Swami is they are known to like that but the other Swami's are also there their whole life they are dedicating and they're so happy so joyful in that whether they are popular or not or the people are going to them or not it doesn't matter did they have not come for that that should be the attitude you should not make the mistake so this what's Adama Krishna is telling to the ish on it is for those who are serious to realize God for them so he is telling like this it will be very good now he is telling it will be very good if a world renouncing sannyasi gives you some spiritual instruction friends are you not lucky that we have got vagabonds the Ramakrishna Marsh are the dominie Debbie Swami Vivekanand the world renouncing sannyasi and also the host of his disciples Shami brahmananda - Dion and the three Qunari turn and the polyp them there all their books and particularly their conversation and there in those days dish - right laters the nowadays we are just sitting over here and giving the talk and all over the world people are listening but in those days these to write later so laters are also very important letters of Shama Vivekananda Swami to the Ananda they're very important and how they used to encourage people to develop the spiritual life in this burger Bonanza Ramakrishna is telling it will be very good if the wall renouncing sannyasi gives you some spiritual instruction the advice of the worldly man will not be right be he a Brahman pundit or anyone else so that is very very important why the worldly people who is having the family and his property he may be wearing a nice clothes maybe sometimes whiter sometimes the saffron may be growing the beard may be looking really good but it doesn't matter anything mind mind and mind what he is thinking how I will know that he is a religious person a righteous man only one thing the love and unselfishness the unselfishness is the first thing that we have to check - sometime the people at how you know there's a good Chanel C are not unselfishness and the love there should not be any discrimination oh you people go to that organization well well you should not come to us and if you come to us you are not allowed to go there it's better to avoid because they are not broad-minded people they are not open so obviously we can't judge so that is why every sentence every line in the gospel of ceramic is now in the Pancham of vada is nothing but the spiritual knowledge that's why I always say Pancham Aveda is the fifth Veda the complete knowledge is there and if you can understand it properly so this way slowly slowly he is instructing us advice of the worldly man will not be right then he said be be he a brahmin pundit and it will scholar maybe will be quoting from different scripture maybe you'll be observing fasting may be walking barefoot all this may be but the worldly means pride ego I say these and you must follow majority of the people and the Western world won't understand but the ego of a Brahmin oh my god and he thinks that he is the purest of the pure he thinks God only can come to him but the poor person forgave the ego is the dirtiest thing how God can approach him and he is putting the ego and the front of his mind how the God can enter the most dirty thing and that is the ego which separate an individual from the God are otherwise it is only God hears only God in different form and a soy sauce Bhagavan ceramic is to always say a humble one will get the blessings but egoistic person no he cannot so this is what he said then he comes to a very wonderful place he said it be mad and repeating be mad be mad with love of God let people know that he Shan has gone mad and cannot perform worldly duties anymore then people will no longer come to you for leadership and arbitration threw aside all these cushy cushy all the things that you were using for puja threw aside love is sufficient and every evening they'll be sitting and they'll be sipping the water and doing these or performances all the external thing it is enough is enough now go deep and constantly think that God is sitting within you when you look you see God when you talk you see God when you sing when you sleep when you eat when you go around only God God and God those who know the songs of the ramp Rashad and he is also beautifully in through the songs when you are going around the city think that you are going around the goddess mother she is standing in the center you are going around when you were hearing something think that you are hearing the mantras that means constantly every time then people who think what has happened to this man he is constantly looking back end and then smiling has he gone mad they think like that that's why people at one point of time this to the seed of ceramic Isha has become mad because they don't know they don't understand the joy of God within and when he personally seeing God feeling the joy the same like the Mira boy the create personality the Mira boy she was a queen and in those days you can imagine a queen she's dancing on the street never carrying anyone what the society is looking at and talking about because of the love of God so that sinneth chaitanya mahaprabhu he was a great scholar never cared about it so dancing and singing because of the joy that is but just to get the attention of the people if someone is doing it oh that is useless but when it is genuine love that is up surging that he cannot control there is a completely different thing so that is the way see Rama Krishna is telling tuition that be mad mad for God the nation is quoting from the bengali song all mother make me mad with thy love a my diva par Volker Oh mother make me mad with I love weed I love friends those who are following the Ashtabula Samhita that a subject that I am now giving the classes to the Hindu a temple of name our nearby but they're come very close to us so dear we are studying the austere baptism Mehta and nowadays of course I give class from here if you are following the last class I was discussing from the sixteenth chapter of the Ostrava class Amita in the cost Ibaka through inspiring through eleven verses in that sixteenth chapter encouraging his disciple the great Janaka to completely forget the manifestation all around him as exactly what Saddam o krishna is telling be mad be mad forget about all around you and the Ramprasad a few hundred years before sri ramakrishna he was also a great we can say the lover of Goddess Kali a tantric but his practice was completely different through songs only because the English book translation of the Bengali songs it is in our bookstore available so he's wrote so many songs the songs only that was his spiritual practice and here austere bakra he is also in the sixteenth chapter very clearly again and again asking almost the same thing forget the whole world and merged in that eternal joy our chakras renew batata naina Asrani Anika sha na na siya Stronach an Inca sure tetapi not of our system sarah bhishma an authority 16 chapter the first verse he says the central point or disturb occurs teaching is that the self alone exists and all else is false unreal so therefore one should not think of anything but that particular so friends once again let me remind this is the last prayer here we are forgetting the whole world and completely after forgetting that when the stage is that whether it is duality better it is monism don't bother about that with only the God of the self and I visualize that margit that our thought and our everything within one must be conscious of the self alone and should perceive everything else as nothing but the self itself many of you know the bhagavad-gita the eleventh chapter this Chiluba darshan Arjuna actually wanted to see that to know that God alone exists again and again the Hindus they will go on repeating God alone exists but it is so difficult to practice if the God alone exists how can I cheat a person how can I do wrong thing with a person punish a person so naturally if we can truly become a religious person it will be only love and love and nothing else nothing else in the bhagavad-gita 11 chapter the vishwaroopa darshan there's each and everything the human being and each and nothing is going and marching into that God there's a wonderful wonderful expression of oneness it was only one even if we try to forget this world we find it very difficult why though it is one again and again it has been taught to us but the reality is we cannot forget it when you were discussing it is alright and the moment we close this again there duality comes multiplicity comes again I become attached to the worldly things why you know that there are two great great friends with a joke and one one friends mother passed away so the he invited his next-door neighbor is a young boy he was also his brain so they went to the to attain last the funeral things last right usually among the Hindus what they do after 13 days of 15 days they invite those people and feed them and well he invited many other people came and he forgot to invite this particular frame who was next door he was waiting the invitation will come and and then if because he forgot and these boy became very angry and when you were angry you forget actually what you are doing at saying so he was shouting so that his friend in the next da house can hear can listen he said well well you have not invited me this time when your mother has passed away and in her final rites don't forget I too have a mother and she will also die and see he forgot what he actually because he was so angry with the frame that you were staying at that time I will not invite you but by that way he was mmm this is not correct he was thinking his mother also should die anyway so this is the way we go so much why here again I will conclude with this ashtavakra he gave the same answer here body attack tobot samsara be tapa ankara spree RGB yeah but be near bechara Dasha ass padam as long as desire continues which is the root of the state of in discrimination there will surely be the attachment and aversion which is samsara be tapa Ankara some sorrow be tapa on Korra the branch and shoot of the tree of the phenomenal world what desire so that is why the MA mother must or the money Devi said if you are free from desire you get peace you realize God this very moment so this what we have learned today that we have to be very very careful about the worldly people who are coming around us and world people who are constantly praising us are they truly good we have to be careful trust second there are three steps of prayer as we have learned from the cutoff aisha-tachi kata the first prayer we can always have for our near and dear ones second for all around people like now the Kavita 90s are going on and people are suffering all over the world so naturally the religious people in their own way a always praying oh god please help us late all human being be free from this suffering and the third one the highest one is to get complete freedom from desire so this is exactly what the Ramakrishna said and he asked be mad mad in love of God is there any question Oh probably and every team this is exactly what do we we have discussed poverty means attachment to the world enjoyments and it demeans detachment from that that's all so profit today profit inhibited a Sangha rocky in a song with Ramakrishna mention so just remember brah is towards the world nee is against that towards God so probability love for the worldly object never T love for God from Kemal Chaudhary thank you for your lecture I have a question how do we reconcile the practice of divine unselfish love that you talked about and they don't mix up though both will take you to their and the same goal as chaitanya mahaprabhu said as Raghavan C Ramakrishna said very clearly whom you call Brahman I call ma so they are only some words and the processes in the Manduca carica and the Manduca they always say the Gower the world is not existing and here the ceramic is new is asking be mad in love of God what does it mean that you go to that supreme Godhead or that Brahman the consciousness and you must forget this world but only path and the process is little different and nothing else so that is the way we should go if your temperament
