[247: Panchama Veda 247 : Is God Compassionate?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-iVS3-koz7Y)

good evening dear devotees the wednesday and we'll be reading the gospel of sirama krishna panchama veda and you can chant along with me this mantra before beginning [Music] i don't explain this meaning every day because majority of you uh who are listening regularly you know the meaning of it so this is the way that one should try to understand religion what is religion religion is anything that is about god for god and here when you are listening about god reading about god explaining about god meditating on god then all things are completely taking you out from the god's creation these are the two things the hindus they believe that there was only one and that was the supreme being and then slowly from it all this manifestation came sometimes they say that first god created the water it was the home the water was the home of god so the narayana the home of god is the water and narayana this narayana from that and different type of quality started coming satya rajatama and then the mixture of all those permutation combination and different varieties of thing it started coming in the beginning the god created only one that was the brahma chatushpa the brahma and chatushpadha means four different parts and some say there is four different vedas rick shamiyah you and atharva so this gyana knowledge so he started creating in the beginning he created the rishis monus all these rishis the 12 rishis then the four the human but with high sattva qualities sun brothers sanaka sananda sanatana sanat kumar then came the prajapati then all different beings came now this is from one to many what we are doing now from meaning we like to go back to one that's now the back calculation so from the one many has come and now from many we should go back to one and that is the process called religion and how it is possible by listening by hearing by having the company of the holy person and the holy person is bhagavan sirama krishna the god himself and he advented the god himself came in the form of a human being and then he taught us how to go back so this conversation is going on the people are asking question to him he is giving the answer and we know the beautiful question very interesting question they were asking particularly when he was visiting the siti brahma samaj then the very educated people the then educated people they came and they were asking the questions so the when they were asking the questions and surama krishna giving the answer that is exactly the way we learn what is the way to dry up the craving for worldly pleasure you may remember the last time we discussed about it one person is asking the trilokia is a very famous person he is asking this question how to dry up the desire the desires where from it came from from the ego the ego is there i and me that is there so i started desiring asking and demanding all this i want these i want that and what is these that objects so one is the ego that is individual ego individual person and then there is an object an object is a rupa russia there are five things and the five also our senses it goes over there and in between works my ego and the ego works through desire i want that so the moment that is absent then i am free from all these bondages the action the in the action and all the karma follow and when the karma is there result is coming so i am free from that how to dry up that that is the question and what is the answer pray to the divine mother with a longing heart why this answer because everything is coming from the power of god divine mother means the power of god the god is there and the same god when he's exerting his power is called divine mother then again the way it is shakti the divine mother is the shakthi the shakti if we go back to her and say please withdraw all this thing from me then i am free so this is the easiest way but only thing i have to have the faith in god god and his power the god is shiva and his power is shakti the god is vishnu and his power the any way we think that god is there his consciousness but inactive and the same thing when it is active is the power so we go to the power and we ask please don't give me all this problem so how to stop the desire the moment i can stop the desire i can control my ego and i can become free from the bondages of these worldly things all around and then what will remain my own self my original self and that is nothing but god or we can say atman we can say paramatman so this is the easiest way to understand the problem is i am attached to the worldly things now how to go back i am going my mind is going to many i am withdrawing the mind and going back to the one sramakrishna's advice is pray pray to the divine mother and how with a longing heart then he is telling her vision dries up all craving for the world and completely destroy all attachment to the worldly things the last and gold it happens instantly if you think of her as your own mother the last time we were reading so if we feel that is my own mother then what will happen if i think or is a goddess so my behavior will be from the distance from i will not go close to her i do not know how she will behave etc but for the own mother there is no restriction immediately i can go and i can talk to her i can go and try to pursue her is telling that it is your own mother the she is by no means god madasi sinama krishna is introducing that our relation with the god should be like the mother and the children and in between the mother and the children there is no mannerism oh no you should not go to now i am when i am going to a lady she is the queen of this country the queen victoria she is also mother but not my mother so now i when i am going to her how i will behave i will be careful that i have to take carry some gift for her so all these things are there for for the own mother nothing like that that is exactly ramakrishna's teaching so we have to remember that the most easiest way to get god realization is to think god as my own mother and you have to feel like that slowly this idea ramakrishna will develop the child holds the skirt of his mother and bake for the painting and ultimately mother is compelled to give that painting because the child and the child won't give up going on crying demanding and before hard frames the child never minds whether the friends are there relatives are there what may be the time now you have to give and give now so this is the very simple very easy a relation between god and us you too must force your demand on divine mother demand on divine mother force your demand whatever you want suppose i want the worldly success worldly prosperity name fame that also we can go to the mother so i sometimes say ma kali those who have seen the picture of the image of god is kali the right hand side the mother is so benign and in one hand she's showing like this that you are my children you need not to be afraid i am here and another hand she's showing like this that whatever you want i am ready to give it to you the benign mother right portion two hands of the goddess kali and the right side at the left side two hands two hands at the left completely different in one she is holding on the upper hand she is holding a sword and the another hand she is holding a sabred head that is hanging why so different because in the left side if you go then if you are praying to the mother in the left side and that means you're going for mukti you're going for liberation right side you go for all of the things that is available in the world mother give me beauty give me the name fame prosperity success right hand side but the bama kali left side then the mother is completely different and you have to be very careful give me devotion give me liberation give me discrimination and all that biblic all in the left and why this the why this uh of the sold the sword means that you have to cut the bondage you have to cut the bondage you have to cut the desires then only it is possible so sudama krishna is telling that you too must force your demand on the divine mother she will come to you without fail i once said to the same thing to the sheiks when they visited the temple of dakshinashir we were conversing in front of the kali temple they said god is compassionate here is very interesting and our today's topic is is god compassionate we are discussing on that particular point is god compassionate they said god is compassionate why compassionate i asked the sheikhs they came to visit sirama krishna and when they said that god is compassionate then sudama krishna is asking why you are saying that the god is compassionate and then they replied sheiks and the many of you don't know there is a group of people they are the followers of the guru nanak and their god is their book is called guru granth sahib and they have the 10th gurus the summer guru so 10 gurus whatever their teachings that is recorded in the book and they worship that book and that is a different uh from the hindus and almost the same way they worship but it's the special way so they are called sheikhs the shakes means the shisha the disciple so that is a very dedicated people so they follow the guru nanak they visited sirama krishna and sudama krishna is conversing with them why revered said he constantly looks after us gives us righteousness and wealth and provides us with our food when the sikhs are telling that god is compassionate and why compassionate because he is helping now sirama krishna giving the reply suppose i said a man has children who will look after them and provide them with food their own father or from another village the suramar krishna he wants to bring home this idea god has created us now it is his responsibility to give us food shelter and all those who else will give so why should i have to tell my father oh he is so compassionate when we love my father our mother we don't go for all this type of the external way of expression that oh we love you we respect you we're so compassionate how many children will tell their parents that you are so compassionate it is obviously they will do it and like that the relation is so easy so sudama krishna wants to say that even an educated person like the sub-judge he couldn't understand and he's asking this question is not god then compassionate sir so this is and sudama krishna is giving the answer why should you think that why should you think that those people they were telling god is compassionate because god is giving us food shelter and all that now suramar krishna told them god is your father god is your mother and you can demand all these things from your father and mother they're so close soon on my own so why i have to tell and get thank them like that don't make god so dis distant separate someone whom i don't know not like that that is the idea even the subjects couldn't understand the cerama question is telling why should you think that i just made a remark what i mean to say is that god is our very own we can exert force on him with one's own people one can even go so far as to say you rascal won't you give it to me so if you have a very good relation then you can say like that that there are ram prashad songs and kamala kantha songs are there and they are telling like this so i am going to die by taking the name of durga durgadur jodhi mori if i die repeating the name of durga i challenge that you are bound to come and save me take me to your own heaven otherwise people will say oh there is no power in the name of durga see this man he died but still durga couldn't save so he's challenging the mother divine mother you must have to save me why because at the time of my death i repeated i remembered you and repeated the name of durga and it is said that if you repeat the name of durga three times the lord shiva will protect you so obviously on the that that is the faith faith in the existence of god and that is the wonderful relation god is my father my mother and so close now any problem the first thing i will go to my god only why should i have to go to this man and that man i'll go to god i will talk to god i will cry before god i will pray before god i will fight with god this is the beautiful idea that the relation between god and the devotee is like the parents and the children so that is telling the god is compassionate friends he was just going through the shankaracharya when he is explaining the bhagavad-gita why the god had to take the human form avatar compassion sri shankara said i am not quoting the whole words why the god ajo eva he is unborn and he is not having any desire he is not having any karma fella even then he is taking the form and the moment you take the human form there will be so many challenges sometimes happiness sometimes miseries so many sometimes success sometimes failure all through that is the life and why unnecessarily he is take putting on that because eva because he is compassionate and so he wants to live with us and to guide us to liberation shankara he made saw prayujana above he was not having any anything to get from these is all his creation what he needs nothing even then he came bhutanu because the created being particularly the human being whom he has given the mind the wonderful qualities of discrimination bichara shakti so that is the that is why the god has come in this form and he lived with us and then slowly guided us that is why the god has taken the human form shankaracharya is mentioning ramanujacharya another teacher ramanuja he's in between the advaita vedanta and dwitavirantha in between vishista dweta he is adventing his coming down he is manifesting over here in the human form why bhubhaara about tarana pradeshina to remove the miseries of this world the god is coming because he's compassionate another acharya is there those who know the indian philosophy these are shankaracharya is the profounder of the vedanta vedanta advaita vedanta then ramanuja he is in between advaita and dwaita and madra charya he is purely dwaythene he is the dualist so he said dharma gyanadara moksha bhabhit kripalu is very clear because he's dwitin he's the dualist he believe god is separate and i am separate so that is the reason he's telling the why god he has calmed down to help us because he is compassionate he is having great compassion for us so when the question of compassion came i am quoting these three from the great acharyas shankaracharya ramanujacharya and madhvacharya all of them they are logarithm they don't accept the explanation one will own except the other but even then all are going to the same about god the god is compassionate god is kripalu so this kripa he is having that is not the question we should not make that mistake but sirama krishna wants to teach us here that we should develop the relation with god as if god is my own mother own father even with the father children a little afraid but with the mother constantly growing up on the lap of the mother they are so free and they can go and then express their the anger and then they will cry and they will pray they will demand all to the mother mother is soft mother is kind mother is compassionate mother is always cooperative so apparently she will show but all the time we can feel the children can feel the mother is more close to the children than the father father also loves but this is the way so here we understand god is compassionate like our parents and we should develop the relation with god in that and that is the easiest way the best way the simplest way to realize god then why should you think in that he said then to the subject let me ask you one thing are vanity and egoism the result of knowledge or of ignorance now he is asking the subjudge the vanity and egoism the egotism and the vanity that show off from ignorance what is that ignorance that i am so and so and this i is constantly related with this particular body but the body is changing whom i am calling i mind mind is also changing whom i am calling i so obviously we have to understand that the egotism is of the nature of tamas now sudama krishna is giving the example because in the hinduism it says there are three qualities are there sattva raja and tama and what is the tama it is begotten by ignorance on account of the barrier of ego one does not see god that is the tama again you will say afterwards all troubles come to an end when ego dies ami mole gucci be janjal in his own language he said all trouble ends when the ego dies because the i associated with this body and mind it is keeping me separated from god that is the problem just that much otherwise i am god we are gods we are otherwise there is nothing else just there is in ignorance that is called maya again and i am thinking that i am not but it is actually i so the here the god is not separate god is me but not this body and mind complex so suramar krishna is telling this is the problem it is futile to be egotistic neither body nor wealth will last then he is giving an example you know in the hindu tradition it is durga puja is coming i don't know this time maybe the it is a great festival for the hindus all over the world wherever the hindu people are there they worship the navaratri they worship the chandi they worship durga in different names different form this is the shakti the power of god and she is having different ten different forms or hands sometimes seeks so fighting with the ashura that is the ignorance so all the stories are there but hindus are very dedicated to that and they enjoy it has become a great festival also but this year because the kawaii 19 it may not be like that but still suramar krishna is telling when they make that image of goddess durga is a very costly image beautiful looking and sometimes if they are very big and they will be worshipping for four or five days then one drunkard came he was looking at the image of the durga at the side of her decorations he said well mother however you may fix yourself up after two or three days they will drag you you out they drag you out and throw you into the ganges usually they go for the immersion and they will throw because we believe that the god has no form but without the form the hindu mind their things without the form we cannot concentrate because our attractions are so many varieties of things are there in the world and mind goes into that i cannot concentrate so we develop some images of god imaginary images is it not that we don't say that this is god but what happens when we make that at that time we are taught to believe that that is goddess and we forget to think that it is only made of stone or earth or wood or something else no it is the goddess it is the god so what happens mind automatically go to one object than many others so mind become one pointed then we say slowly the high moralities the goddess is compassionate she loves us she protects us etc so you should also do like that you should also develop those qualities and like slowly slowly then ultimately we say i am he i am that i and my father in heaven are one so like these only it goes it is a raising from many going back to the one so goes back to god that is the way it says and this drunkard he failed oh mother durga doesn't know she is happy so many people are giving so many things to her so he is going a drunkard man he is going to tell the mother in that image that after three four days they will put you in the water that means all temporary everything is temporary so i say to you all you may be a judge or anybody else but it is all for two days only therefore you should give up vanity and pride this is the straight and very strong advice of the bhagavan sri ramakrishna the vanity and pride you know those people who are studying the scripture and they are in the scripture they can quote from the scripture and they get lot of respect in the society and their vanity and pride crept into them they become very egoistic i know all this i can explain like this who can debate with me that is another way of the bondage that's why shankaracharya in his vibe churamani he has worn because we we are lost in the forest as if so many words are there varieties of ideas are there we enter into that and slowly slowly we lose our goal where to go we are lost in the forest like that the shabtas these words these teachings they're just like the great the forest and we lose our path one should be very very careful so ego is just like that ego we are meditating then people started whispering look at that man he is meditating for so many hours he is taking the name of god for so many hours and those i start listening hearing people are also showing their respect to me ego is coming within me i can meditate i can take the name of god i can explain things i can read these and that nobody can do that that is again wealth name fame in the worldly things and at the same time when we are coming for the spiritual life giving up all those again here the same because it is god's maya everywhere he has put up that net if you put the leg immediately you are bound by that so if we remove the ego and then to go towards god then only god remains and nothing else so again and against ramakrishna is telling that you should forget that and he is telling that a characteristics of the people the characteristics of swattwa raja and tamas are very different egotism sleep and gluttony lust anger and the like are the traits of the people with thomas this thomasic people they love to eat and then go on eating because their whole concentration on the body so like to eat all these food and they'll be and they like to sleep naturally and also they have lost and anger so these are the traits so we should be careful we should go and stand before a meter and judge ourselves we need to go and tell anyone we should stand before a mirror and judge ourselves in which a group i belong to these are the traits of the tamashika friends you know in the bhagavad-gita 18th chapter from 20th words onwards the sri krishna again and again talking about the three different types of are the people swatika rajasika and tamusika the three different type of joy three different type of the charity three different type of the other things all again again again and again one should go and read those verses to understand and then again as i am telling stand before a media all alone and check in which group i do belong parmasika rajashika swattika i have to go to the sattika wherever i am now no problem now when i'm aware about the disease about aware about my weaknesses so obviously i can take measure i can take steps on that so it is this way such a man has clue then it is telling about the rajashika men with rajas entangle themselves in many activities such a man has clothes all speaking span his house is immaculately clean a portrait of the queen hangs on a wall in his drawing room when he worship god he wears a silk cloth he has a string of rudraksha beads around his neck and in between the beads he puts up a few gold ones look at the observation of krishna the most of the time he used to go to the rich people's house and they are those people they will show that they are also spiritual religious people and the moment you show like that the other people they start respecting origin religious man so this is the way those who are truly not religious they become hypocrite and they like to behave like this so the swatiga people rajusika people and tamasika they'll be behaving completely different way sirama krishna when someone comes to visit the worship hall in his house he himself acts as guide after showing the hall he says to the visitor please come this way sir there are other things too the floor of white marble and the nat mandir which is exquisite carvings so we'll be showing that and oh you know who did it like this it i wanted i went to visit a temple and one person they're just a volunteer associated with that temple he was going on telling show me you see this carving it is made of one stone and the stone came from that country and the people from the italy they came and they did it and this floor that thing they went on telling about the stones then ultimately i had to ask him is it all stones over here in the whole temple there is no god i like to see god then who yes he has come then he took me to the that so these people always they want to show that how much they have spent on the construction these are all rajashika so this suramar krishna also observed the rajashika people so for them it is this when he gives his in charity he makes a show of it but a man endured with sattva is quiet and peaceful he will never show his knowledge he will never entered into the argument rather so far as dress is concerned anything will do very simple but neat and clean not dirty clean but at the same time simple he earns only enough money to give his stomach a simple of food he never flatters men to get money so that way sirama krishna is giving the example his worship charity meditation all are done in secret people do not know about them at all shatter is the last tape of the stairs the three qualities and two power what is that qualities satya raja and tama and two power one is covering another is superimposing and these five things belongs to the power of god which is known as maya and from the maya everything has come so naturally these has been distributed among the in the creation among the people also the superimposing the original thing and covering and then superimposing something on the original so that is called the act of the maya the power of the maya only these five we all know about it the rishis discovered it we have to understand this and we have to practice this thing that's all and obviously we'll be free from the bondages first three qualities satya rajatama bhagavan sirama krishna in brief he has given the hint about the tamasika rajasika and sattika and in details bhagavan sri krishna in the bhagavad-gita 18th chapter from 20th verse onwards it is there now those who are interested to develop the spiritual quality spiritual life if they're eager to realize god what they should do we should read those and then compare where is my stand at this moment then these are the things i have to curve i have to stop and these are the thing i have to develop i have to practice that is called sadhana that is called spiritual practices we always think the spiritual practice means something different nothing only acquiring these wonderful qualities that has already been listed over there so now krishna is giving very clear statement swattwa is the last step so what we should do right this moment we should try to imbibe the satik qualities all the gunas all the qualities of the sattva that is the last step he says swatu is the last step of the stairs next is the roof that means god realization as soon as shakta is acquired there is no further delay in attaining god see what is god realization this so this we have to understand the one step forward and god is realized he's telling to the sub judge didn't you say that all men are equal now he is pointing to the subjudge and rectifying him giving and giving him that he is understanding should be very clear now you see there are so many varieties of human nature there are still other classes and kinds of people for instance there are those who are eternally free now he is talking about those who are free from all these bondages those who have attained liberation those struggling for liberation and those entangled in the world the three mukta in sanskrit but the entangled mukta completely liberated and in between mumuksu he's trying to he understood that he is bound he understood that my desire for the worldly things is binding me he understood that his ego the concept about his body and mind that is the main bondage so he understood all this is trying to go beyond trying to get the liberation from these and from there he is struggling so that is called the mumuksu surama krishna is telling now he's telling so many varieties of men sages like narada sukadeva eternally free they are not at all bound salam krishna said it about swami vivekananda also it's completely free he came only to help people the people do not understand him they think oh there he is also like us no and not at all he has no bondage no attachment at all but that compassion is god compassionate of course and that is why god came in the form of swami vivekananda and he was showing us the path and what was his main mission to bring back the satya dharma the sanatana dharma the true religion which was discovered by the rishis that is the vedantic dharma but it was lost because the people where this dharma was the religion was the philosophy was the idea was they were under the subjugation of the britishers the swami vivekananda gave bim give them back their self-confidence how by reminding them of their past and he said your future is bright only thing you have to have self-confidence not ego self-confidence so that is the way he rejuvenated india and it is not only the political power because political power is necessary freedom is political freedom is necessary economical freedom is necessary social freedom is necessary but at the same time it should develop the real characteristics of india and that is dharma again and again he said the the subtle thing the best part of india is the dharma is the life it is in dharma it is in religion and what is that dharma vedanta and this vedanta give removes all the bondages all the barriers and we can understand we can see that the same god which is residing within me is reciting every heart so that is the way swami vivekananda world it's not possible for any ordinary person even after practicing meditation and japa and spiritual practices one cannot reach into that height they are eternally free people but out of their compassion they come and take form and they live with us and we think that i believe they belong to us they belong to our level no it's all wrong so like a stream ship so many varieties of people like sages like narada and sukadeva are equally free they are like a stream ship which not only crosses the ocean but can carry big animals even an elephant they are the gurus they are the avataras they are the tremendous power they are taking the whole nation with him one young man of 29 years and he shook the whole india can you imagine the huge country with varieties of the traditions varieties of languages and he unified them all together and shook them from the slumber and they woke up it is not possible for any person is a god only further the soul that is eternally free is like the superintendent of and state after bringing one part of the state under control he goes to another those struggling for the liberation strive earth and soul to free themselves from the nate of the world one or two of them may get out of the net they are called the liberated the souls that are externally sorry the souls that are eternally free are like clever fish they are never caught in the net so friends the sudama krishna he is giving us the account of this first he said in general the masses are of three different types why because of the three different qualities the one is swathika rajasika tamashita and he gave the example and described what are the qualities in tama and raja and sattva then he said that sattva is the ultimate state and after the sattva there only god remains and god when one realizes god he becomes god himself so that is the way we have to go back to one as i started that from one many has come and our struggle those who are spiritual those who want to realize god our struggle to go back to that one and why it is a struggle because in between there are so many hurdles what are the hurdles my ego my desire so these desires comes from the ego i understand these from where from the guru who is the guru bhagavan sram krishna himself so this scripture this panchama veda the gospel of sudama krishna the teachings of sirama krishna given at different time before different people from there we get this idea that there are also people in this world who are living with us they are eternally free they are not bound but they have come to help us they are our best friends and they are not bound why because they know this world is completely illusory it is not there is a completion complete illusion but we are not understanding this we are like the children we are thinking all my dolls all my the games they're all true and i'm bound to that and slowly slowly as i grow and growing age growing experience i understand these things are all so temporary so temporary nothing remains tremendous attachment and attraction between a man and a woman that also vanishes a time calm age calm when you don't feel that even that also vanishes only because of that people are killing each other or committing suicide the young people so that is called ignorance we have to understand this and we have to have this knowledge all these things passes and where i'm going to get the joy complete joy in liberation and what is that liberation the bondage from desire so that is the ultimate teaching today that we learned from bhagavan sri ramakrishna and he is telling that three types of people are there one those who are free we bow down to them and those who are struggling that is we because every week we see it and we read and win we think oh what is my position what i am going to do we are momo shoes we are trying to go beyond these now we have to very careful we have to note down all those qualities that is there in the sattva and we have to imbibe those good qualities because that is the last step and it is sure that very few tamashii qualities are there within us because we have already developed ourselves from tamo to raja and in the raja qualities though we have little bit ego but we have a desire to be liberated so analyzing ourselves i have a desire to be liberated but this i am not having very clear idea then sudama krishna says make a wonderful relation between god and you it is your god and it is your father it is your mother you have every right to go and demand and god is compassionate just like the parents and he concerned about us and we have to say give us liberation and remove our desire remove our ego and if we can do that then the ultimate thing will come i will merge with the god and who is nothing but joy is nothing but eternity nothing but the pleas and that is exactly the point one where we try to reach thank you and in the next again wednesday we will discuss about it so we have many questions the first question is from bradley budding exactly is asking if god according to krishna is course and he tried to write it in quotes brilliance of the brilliant then isn't god compassion himself himself the god brilliant of the brilliant so if god according to krishna is the compassion itself it is bradley yes bradley i don't know from where you are quoted but the god the compassionate for himself is the embodiment of compassion so the compassion means the love the joy and and the concern naturally so obviously god is the embodiment of that so from where you have quoted i don't know but of course god is the embodiment of love he is the source of love source of compassion and source of all these good qualities thank you bradley he is asking one other question so then are all of god to spread his compassion of course of course see can you imagine that we consider though we are hindu we consider jesus is an avatar of god and the christian tradition they say the son of god okay how we can understand that he is the son of god or avatar of god the god incarnated at jesus himself the last word that he said he prayed for those who were killing him alive they were nailing and in that excruciating pain he was praying for those can you imagine can anyone do that if someone is putting his finger before us we are so angry all through life we don't forget and jesus is forgetting forgiving them praying to the god so so much of compassion so much of love so that is called the god's love god's compassion and that is the manifestation of the god in human form the next question is from kamal chaudhary was asking how can one know whether his or her ego has completely gone yeah good question and about the moment there is no ego what will remain only divinity only divine form and when the divinity comes all the divine qualities will manifest no one has to come to tell you oh you have realized god you automatically you will know that bhagavan srama krishna he has given the example one person he was going to meet the king he was from a village poor man he came and he saw the wonderful dress a man is guarding he thought oh my god he's so wonderful dress so he said are you the king he said no i am just guarding the door king is inside so like that he went in in after crossing the more he went inside the more he saw the the expression and the uh the uh the all the what's called the jewelries and there's so many different type of beautiful things all around after he crossed the seventh door he saw a man is sitting on the throne and all others are standing before him and he needed no one to introduce the king he understood he is the king by telling this the sudama krishna wants to say the moment you see god your ego goes and god appears and when you realize god you need no one to introduce this is god directly is asking me many questions i have put your email address in the chat right good to like you sure then the next question is from as soon as one calls him why does it take life times before realization hey why lifetime life after life because that is the game it goes on you know that is one thing we must keep in mind even a small iota has been a drop of ego as long as it is there within us bhagavan sram krishna said over here that when their ego is there desire is there and the desire is there no god is there as the it always say where desire is there there is no god and when god is there there won't be any desire so friend i have we have to try to understand that these are the desires binding us and we cannot realize god go and pray and pray and pray as bhagavan is teaching us as we go to our mother when we are children for everything we used to go to our mother let us go to the god as mother and pray remove my ego completely i like to see you and one day the blessed moment will surely come the last question is from how does a man become god when he is entangled in family and world oh no that is as long as we are entangled in the family friend if i can understand your question if if you are a householder you have the responsibility to look after your family children and all if you do your swadharma perfectly as the bhagavad-gita sri krishna is telling bhagavan srama krishna is also advising that swa dharma suppose you are a householder you have to earn money in an honest way you have to look after your children your wife not only that you have to think that after you how your wife will survive so you have to put some money also in in the bank so all those things when you are doing but without attachment i am doing it because this is my swadharma see as a swadharma of a sannyasi dharmapalan dharma shiksha i should practice the religious righteousness and i should give that to the society that is my shadarma if i don't do that then i am not performing the sannyasi dharma and of course the nazis have some other promises like i am not going to criticize others to harm others and i am not going to hanker for the name fame money beauty nothing but there's a world that the person in the world you can always pray to god give me some opportunity so that i can earn money in a righteous way and keep my family happy and whatever the responsibility i am having in the society i can perform know it for sure if the gita is a religious book scripture the god is telling you will be free by doing that so thank you friends thank you for wonderful questions let us pray over here we concluded is namaste you
