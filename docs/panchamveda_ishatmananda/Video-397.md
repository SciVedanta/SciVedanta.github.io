[398. Panchama Veda - “If a man gathers his whole mind on me, he achieves everything.”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IztcOR4o_Qc)

and namaskar dear devotees and Friends let us begin studying the panjuma Veda with this stotra jivanam angalam srimata now last Wednesday we were discussing whether the Incarnation is having desire or not so one devotee was asking whether the incarnations are having desire or not the sirama Krishna he not directly because this is a question where where you know that those who are not very accustomed or advanced in spiritual life they ask like that they do not know who are these incarnations and all that so that's why they are asking this question and siram Krishna also replied oh well I am having some desires so like that like that so we read in the last week but the incarnations cannot have any desire we discussed why because the incarnations of God themselves the God is manifesting in a human form that is called incarnation they may try their best and with the great effort and with the great spiritual practices they may get liberation but they cannot become incarnation Incarnation only God can and last week last Wednesday we discussed how the God is working with three power and they are ladini sandhini sambit like that now ladini is the power that is blissful power and with that only they are working sambit is the knowledge the Eternal knowledge that is also the power he is using and sandini there is the eternity there is the existence Eternal reckon now this our vedanta that advaita vedant will say existence knowledge and Bliss the Dwight vedanta will say the sandhini sambit ladini and it just same thing for the individual Jiva so how they are working they are working Karma Shakti gyanashakti and icha Shakti that is the action then thought and desire so this is the waste so afterwards they developed Karma Yoga gyana Yoga and bhakti yoga because these are the three power that you always use Karma Yoga Yoga bhakti Yoga what about the dhyana yoga it is already there in everything Diana means concentration so they are not mentioning over here the concentration is necessary in everything so the all these we discussed the last week and today we are going to discuss about very wonderful thing when sirama Krishna was discussing to aim well people renounce a grain by grain but what he moved these youngsters are in it is Page 798 in English book Gospel of sirama Krishna by nikhilananda ji translation that this is 798 sudama Krishna is mentioning well people renounce grain by grain but what he moved these youngsters are in I am giving a discourse a series of discourse in our home of Harmony organization of gods about the ramakrishna mission the organization this is the I think we have completed the third it will be next the fourth so there in details we are trying to understand when this monastic system started we find that the Lord Buddha when he was he saw the four things and then he decided to renounce the last was the sannyasi now the question is sannyasa this concept was there for a long long period of time but the chotur asrama brahmacharya goddess sannyas the majority of these they used to follow that even in the upanishad the great Rishi John gabalka do we know that Jacob might read that sambad they are having the the discussion so there the young he wanted to give up and to become a sannyasi so they were the householders first they are acquiring knowledge brahmacharya then the married life goddessa then retired life banaprastha then he decided now it is time for me to withdraw from everything and become a sannyasi so sannyas the sannyasa concept was there from the beginning and this after going through the three stages of Life three asthma's only one could get become the sannyas Lord Buddha saw that someone is a nyasi and he wanted to become like him so he left the Hearth and Home he took the initiation and he practiced to sannyas and then after the Buddha we find that all the sravanas the sannyasins they are following Lord Buddha married or Bachelor or what that is not very clear the anyone wanted to renounce could go from shankaracharya onward it became a system and they wanted the sannyas if you like to become and little slowly slowly this system came even in the shankara also we find sureshara acharya he was a married person and then afterwards he he was defeated by shankara then he accepted the sannyasa because that was the condition if the shankara can defeat him then he will become the sannyasi he became the sureshara acharya now the married people could become the sannyasi in the ramakrishna mission also when bhagavan sirama Krishna is giving the sannyasa he was also having some people who were married then afterwards and in the ramakrishna mission not all others the the married people also can become sannyasen still it is open but only in the ramakrishna mission the restriction has come so this is very that from the brahmacharya you have to take sannyasa so these conception sannyasa conception was already there then here we find the bhagavan sirama Krishna he is mentioning about the youngsters who have not passed through that traditionally it was but sudama Krishna is insisting appreciating and encouraging that right from your brahmacharya go to sannyasa and that is the great thing why because the mind is not scattered those who are working outside and the married life and the social life their mind is all scattered in many different ways and naturally it is become very difficult to withdraw that mind but if you directly go from the students life to the sannyas alive in between ah you can avoid so sudama Krishna is appreciating that well people renounce grain by grain that means the householders life goddess the two banaprastha so grain by grain but what he moved these youngsters are in binod said that he said the what is State DJ is passing through in my presence he only sways his body and fix his glance on me is that a drifling thing sirama Krishna now is giving a statement which is very rare when we study his biography and many where he never mentioned about himself but here very clearly he is mentioning if a man gathers his whole mind and fix it on me then indeed he achieves everything so that is a great statement now he is disclosing his divinity he the God himself he mentioned this word use this word there are many incarnations the gods are there but the manifestation of power that is maximum in bhagavan sirama Krishna and here we find the full manifestation among the incarnations incarnations and nothing but God himself but the God is also expressing utilizing using his power in different places different time in a limited way but now is the full why it's not that we are the followers of ramakrishna naturally we will be saying like that any the other person's followers they will say and it is nothing like that it's not from the narrow sense we are not talking we are talking from the highest plane why because as again Swami vivekan declared to why we are quoting vivekan the Vivekananda again is a disciple of sudama Krishna he is supposed to say all these good words positive words about his Guru no he was very very critical analytical and then only he used to accept vivekananda's character those who know those who have studied he is a completely different type of person so when he says it is great value the Swami Vivekananda said immediately after the birth of bhagavan siddama Krishna Satya Yuga have started we know that the yugas the whole kalpada the universe and time it has been divided into four Satya dwapper Koli and in Satya of course the rishis were they are the they were discovering Brahma was creating they all these things were there most of the people they were dedicated to the higher shot of life even the women also they were asked to concentrate their mind dedicate their whole life to discover the spiritual truths and other teachings so much majority of the people population was also less and then afterwards at the time of Sri ramachandra we find the little more people are settled Ordinary People are also there the washer men are also there and the Carpenters are there like this so many different type of Trades and people so there the life was different and SRI ramachandra came he too was the Avatar of God but his manifestation was limited why it was not necessary there almost we can say sixty forty sixty percent people were good or seventy percent people were good if we are taking in that we are looking at that that way the majority of the people who are good and little some people they were confused they were not understanding what to do and the nature that has given us the rajaguna and tamaguna that was also manifesting so that is the way ah and then see ramachandra came the Lord Vishnu himself came and with all his brothers they were also having the same power but little manifestation so all of them they did it what the how people should live in the society that was the main thing then Lord Krishna came and it was the time very challenging why because the rajaguna and tamaguda was trying to suppress the satwaguna then rajaguna it was the Kings they were not listening to the rishis so that is the if we notice that the Krishna he was trying to once again establish Dharma by that way there was no other dharmas there is no other faiths only in the Indian Peninsular there was the sanatana Dharma always in politically they were separated small small kingdoms all over the India but they all used to follow the sanatana Dharma or same type of practices but the main thing that they should control their emotions and their desires their lust with the help of the satwa and which the rishis or their gurus or the brahmanas should teach them they were trying to avoid that and some or they were there they were completely refusing to accept this is the time when the Lord again the Vishnu again came as SRI Krishna and if we notice that he was chastising and he was making the Kings particularly to behave properly now came the modern time when different type of religions manifested in different places the all these major religions that we see that they started practicing and the Christianity came Islam came Judaism was already there Buddhism was already there Jainism was already there and shikhism was already there so all this and then the challenges because the Christianity was trying to overpower the sum of the people they wanted to protect themselves so they also started different type of philosophies and the different schools to protect themselves from this onslaught of the Christianity so the samaja started coming then the prarthana samaj then Brahma samaj and all these different type of samaj and they were trying to save them so there is a thorough confusion in the general masses it is not the Kings so we have to understand the gravity of the problem now it was the Tama the SAT that is Satya Yuga Yuga dapar Yuga was over after the Krishna then the terrible time came that is the thorough confusion about the religion and utilizing religion people were grabbing power we have noticed it in the Buddhism in the Christianity in Islam they were utilizing the Dharma to grab the power all these things were going on forceful conversion torture killing destruction all these were going on it was absent at the time of Krishna at the time of Rama notice it it is in the time of the sriram of Krishna the same God same Vishnu those who have studied the biography of bhagavansi ramakrishna they know the Vishnu bhagavan again he wanted to come as a son that whole thing same way repeated I am coming as your son he said and to that that brahmana very austere and very faithful and that all is sticking to the truth foreign so he the became the Lord became his son he manifested as the ramakrishna so there is nothing like belittling Rama SRI ramachandra R3 Krishna no the same God they came for a particular period of time but a particular purpose they completed their mission and then this time the same God manifested as bhagavad's ramakrishna analyzed like this then there will be no confusion oh they are followers of ramakrishna there no it is nothing like that we should not think in that way the God is manifesting and it the challenge was really really very difficult why the ego it became each and every one at the time of Sri ramachandra if you only rabana and Bali and that the Krishna some Kings but at this time of Sri ramakrishna even the ordinary people were so egoistic so egoistic and sudama Krishna it was only two hundred years before and if you read the social condition of the country particularly India whereas ramakrishna was born you will understand what was the condition why is bashami Vivekananda after traveling the length and breadth of the India why he was crying and he was telling low the descendants of the rishis have become next door neighbor to brutes why he had to say that so that was a terrible condition and Lord the God he needed to manifest more power why because to introduce Satya yoga Kali the end and the Satya Yuga begin obviously God manifested his more power and he wanted to show that because the people used to boast that I have studied these and he could quote the some people they could quote from this writer from that writer and they used to write and this to feel very proud then I am quoting from so and so and like this and that still today it goes on the one person will be quoting another the another will quoting the same person they are crashing each other's back like this it goes what is the originality see ramakrishna gave that originality and these originality what is that you need not to go to any University to get a certificate that you are a spiritual person what is the spirituality completely free from ego an attachment to the worldly objects that is called spirituality and that we find in the life of bhagavan Si ramakrishna hundred percent more than 100 percent no attachment to the worldly objects though he was having tremendous influence because he is the God himself as we find as a definition of God in one of the the vaishnava scripture they say yes these are the sixth power if someone is having he is a God and see ramakrishna was having the same thing the Dominion the power to control the nature the authority was in Sri ramakrishna he could change the mind of people he could read the minds of people any time people are coming he could see their past he could announce their future and it really happened it really happened once the young Narendra came to him and he said see that there is no the God cannot manifest in that way God is formless because the tremendous influence of the Christianity and to counter that the Brahma samaj and kishap Chandra Shane and all those they started telling no there is no forms the formless God because they were confused how the God so big and vast can manifest inside image or a photo or a tree or a stone so they started Living those things the God is all pervading God has no form because that was the main argument of the Christianity and deal also started following that only taking that formless aspect of God bhagavan's question says why he is all powerful he is all pervading of course but he is all powerful too and since he is all powerful he can do anything if he likes who were you to say that he cannot manifest in this form or in that form why you are limiting him are you more powerful than the god that was the argument of sudama Krishna and the whole modern society was taken about that's true then he was telling giving this example like if there is a cool breeze the water which is the symbol of formlessness takes the form of eyes and the same water melts that ice melts become water again when there is sun he gave the example when a man is discriminating analyzing judging and following the path of gyana for him it is formless God the water a man again who is with devotion he wants to see his own God he wants to cook for his God he wants to decorate his God his love he wants to give that form of that the same water again formless God takes the form it is easy for God to take any time any form why not a people started accepting it understanding it it became clear to them so this is the great contribution of bhagavan Si ramakrishna then instead of telling that my path is the only path he said all parts are leading to the same goal but if you have a genuine if you are sincere what is the sincerity God is only existing and not this world so you have to withdraw your mind and you have to put it to God and the same God who manifested in the form of bhagavan's ramakrishna very humble he never could say this is I he always said these when he said if a man gathers his whole mind and fix it on me then indeed he achieves everything what does this mean the God himself he looks so simple so ordinary so when the people look at him oh neh how can he be God he is not having Four Hands the gods are supposed to have four hands or ten hands or six hands may we should be sitting either on tiger or and lion or at least minimum an elephant the at least on a boat like the this is all nonsense the god means the tremendous power that manifested what is that power unselfishness what is that power complete detachment what is that power tremendous love for each and every one without discrimination though he is powerful still he never wanted to take anything so that those are the qualities Garcia he was having complete power biryan he was having that might the power to change everything he touched the Young naren immediately nor end was completely transformed there was a wrestler very powerful man and someone hired him engaged him to the hackles bhagavan sidama Krishna he came and he was oh Cinema Krishna the frail body but the Lord came sudama Krishna came touched his chest with the finger and then he left that man the powerful man the egoistic man he became completely changed these are also history these are not mythological stories still those people their descendants are leaving their houses are there how can you deny it so this is the power of bhagavan Cinema Krishna the great person intellectual person didn't the India was having only one person who was so wonderfully educated and accepted by the all the quarters of people and the life and he was keshav Chandra Shane it is said that he was invited that Queen Victoria invited him to dine with her can you imagine now sudama Krishna from the village he is coming having no education and no the money also no social status the moment sirama Krishna went and talked with keshav keshav with folded hands started listening to him following him so of course keshav was having that the Purity that no ego was there that's why he could immediately receive the grace of God this is the power of God this is the power of God so can't we say that sudama Krishna is God so he is telling if you put the whole mind why I am telling because ramakrishna now he is the east devata of millions and millions of people and there should not be any doubt in the mind of anyone that if we meditate on sirama Krishna are you going to get the best result God realization of course for sure because sirama Krishna is the god the one who was contradicting him again and again judging him analyzing him and he was so ruthless and Elijah this Narendra Nath when the sirama Krishna was in his Deathbed he was having the problem in the throat he couldn't talk even he couldn't eat emaciated body apparently he was nothing looking at him the Narendra was thinking thinking he didn't express it through words he was thinking if now this man can say that he is God I will believe the moment his thought crossed his mind immediately bhagavan sirama Krishna looked at him and said Noreen he who was SRI Rama he who was SRI Krishna now in this body as ramakrishna even then at this stage also he never forgot to complete the sentence by saying but it is not from your ADV point of view because do not accept the manifestation of God and incarnations foreign can't we say that he is God so he could really understand everyone's mind when someone was walking on the he used to feel sometimes that he is everything the ones he was sitting and suddenly saw the some people are walking on the on the field that grasses were there and that very moment he was one with everything she cried out and asked asked them not to do that as if they are walking on my chest this is a Feeling and a person noticed that a red mark as if somebody has slapped on his back it was very prominent he came and saw what happened to you who is between you like this he said no one bitten me but look at those two boat men they are fighting over there on the boat boat in the Ganga so far from that Shore and he looked at them he saw them and one person bit another and that Mark came on his body if he is not all pervading then how it is possible the god Supreme and from him once again this Satya Yuga has started and this Satya Yuga he is ushering us taking us and that's why he said what is the indication of Satya Yuga truthfulness sincerity on attachment and love unselfishness these are the traits of the satta Yuga that he all he is asking us to do each and every one not only the Kings not only educated people for each and everyone God realization is the goal of human being it's not the only Hindus or the Muslims or the these or that is for each and everyone once you are human form then you must understand how much a human can enjoy physically and how much so then you must try to understand you want enjoyment you want joy the realization of God is million times better than any joy in this world now one young boy DJ he was so lucky so fortunate he understood it and that is why he used to look at bhagavan's Rama Krishna and he used to gaze at him and his body used to move as if he is receiving the the electric shocks you see ramakrishna noticed it and he was very happy and there he mentioned and he will achieve everything he didn't say the mukti he didn't say that he will achieve the spiritual goal no everything as a God he can give anything and everything whatever you want from him you will get it if you want the wealth name power position Fame everything God will give because it is all he is and at the same time if you want the Liberation from the bondage of birth and death that also he will give when the Lord Krishna is telling giving that in the bhagavad-gita he said is that supreme god is not only that this Krishna form is that supreme god sarabeth means all different duties and responsibilities it is not the different religious paths practices no because at the time of Lord Krishna there is no other religion but the sanatana Dharma we do not know whether it was there or not maybe some primitive religions but SRI Krishna when he said it is this and bhagavan sirama Krishna say from any path you go you come to me only yes same thing the Lord Krishna say in whatever way you worship me whatever way why he said whatever we because some of the people they used to think came as the all-pervading formless god Psalm is to think that is with form like the vishma he's to worship Vishnu but he meditated on the Lord Krishna because he knew the Krishna is done then Vishnu himself the bhishma he at the back end of his life he declared it in the in the bhagavata we find so wonderfully is going on describing so that when you find all these in the scriptures in Mahabharata in bhagavata that the Lord Krishna is none other than the Vishnu himself at the time of Sri ramachandra a few the Moon is they realize that but they said oh Lord we know that you are all purpose of Brahman Parable that is Sri ramachandra but SRI ramachandra as a son of dasharata the Rishi said now we should accept you as that why because the ordinary people are not ready to understand ready to accept the God can manifest as a human form so this development now at the time the Modern Age and anyone accepting him as that God we drawing the Mind from the sense objects and concentrating on him will get anything and everything that they want but what am I now he is telling this body you think it is not actually what am I it is all he h capital it is all he he means that God manifesting through that form when Swami Vivekananda came in in America and he very rarely he mentioned about bhagwan's ramakrishna because people don't understand him they will misunderstand even today many of the people are there of course they are all educated people but religiously they are not that way developed so they came and told why you are worshiping a human why not the god or God is like Kali Durga as SRI ramachandra SRI Krishna I told we likes ramakrishna so we are keeping it so still they are not understanding the God doesn't mean that you have to show some miraculous power see ramachandra majority of the people if you talk about SRI ramachandra he will say in the name of Rama I don't know where from the god this uh all these they were writing SRI Rama on the stones and Stones were floating they believe SRI Rama as God because just by writing his name on a stone and stone was floating on the water so he is God suppose that miracle was not there then they would have doubted about SRI ramachandra as God but they don't see the tiaga of Sri ramachandra he could become a king but he gave up that he accepted the life of a recluse he went inside the jungle for 14 long years he faced all those challenges tough life why to keep the promises we don't understand that we love SRI ramachandra we worship SRI ramachandra but we don't follow SRI ramachandra and that is why no progress in our spiritual life and we are still thinking by writing the name SRI Rama if we throw the stone to the water it will float it can flow if that Lord wills it is possible for him but not for you so that is the way we have to understand bhagavan sidama Krishna he said only name on do you have to understand the qualities also Nam Guna kirtana the Nama the name of the Lord name of the god but his qualities and that you have to go on memorizing repeating and constantly remembering then only those qualities will manifest within you and it is possible in that way it is all he I am the machine and he is the operator Swami Vivekananda didn't take the name of Sri ramakrishna sometimes even his brother disciples to comment why you have not taken the name of our Guru he said do you think the sudama Krishna means that much he is everything whatever is good whatever spirituality is because he is the God himself when someone is praying and calling for Allah it is Cinema Krishna in Calcutta it happened on a broad daylight SRI ramakrishna got down from the carriage and ran to that person a Muslim who was praying on the pavement of Calcutta why because he was genuinely calling on God so the God as a brahmana in the form of srirama Krishna heard it and some of the ladies the who were the inductive actresses the people is to shun them because they were not that way just ladies it is God himself going see ramakrishna himself going with all the devotees to introduce them it is not the work that they are doing the the dresses that they are wearing are the places that they are leaving it is their mind what they are thinking is their mind and they are constantly praying to God we are living in the hell God please help us please help us though they are physically they were in a different situation difficult situation nasty situation but their mind was pure they were constantly remembering God and calling on him so the god in the form of ramakrishna he himself went over there touched their forehead and blessed them so this is the god no discrimination other people they are judging if I go what the society will say if I do like these they're all calculative the God has nothing like that so here we find though he is telling I am the machine and he is the operator we understand we should follow that why because whatever the success comes to us it is because of the God God is giving us that intellect to understand God is giving her the opportunity to utilize that knowledge and we are becoming successful people are appreciating Society is appreciating we should be more and more humble oh God through me you are working Please Don't Leave Me I like to be like this in your hand perhaps if I am not mistaken he mentioned Bina means the musical instrument giving the Beautiful music playing beautiful music melodious music then the the poet is praying to God make me that instrument in your hand I will go on giving the beautiful sound people will be the world will be happy but you should play so that is the way that is called karma yoga Karma Yoga means completely dedicating in the hand of God whatever best quality whatever the best way I can do I should do concentrate my mind on that but at the same time I know it is not me it is you and it is God alone who exists in these in these means in this body he was pointing to his body it is God alone who exist in these that is why so many people are feeling more and more attracted to it a mere touch is enough to awaken their spirituality this attraction this pool is the attraction of God and none else attraction of God and none else unless the manifestation of God is there within people will never feel attracted there's Sometimes some any power that is manifesting is the power of God the some Cinema actors or actresses are very popular the power is manifesting through them they become if unfortunate egoistic what is because of me they won't talk to the people they'll be misbehaving people and slowly they will lose that power and they will go in Oblivion people will forgave them so the power of God when manifest maybe in the past life there was a desire I like to become like this the God has given you that opportunity you became a great personality maybe a philosopher maybe a singer maybe a dancer maybe an actor or actresses maybe a political leader maybe a hero all this power that is manifesting in this world is the manifestation of the God's power otherwise among thousands and millions how come that you have become successful what is the specialty in you you are just like an ordinary person but this moment God has blessed you as because you did something good in your past life you are enjoying this life now one should be aware now one should be humble one should be prayerful the God you have given me so much I am so happy but at the same time I am afraid that the ego should not creep Within Me so please hold my hand then you are saved otherwise again the temp Temptation will catch you and drag you down to the worldly life again the suffering of hell here the hell means you've whatever you wanted you won't get so the suffering will be there so that is the reason bhagavan sudama Krishna mentioned the God is living within me a mere touch a mere look a glance the people are becoming spiritually awakened because God is living within me Devi said if you are looking at the picture of sudama Krishna you are looking at the god itself Chaya and Kaya Kaya means the form Chaya means the shadow the shadow means that picture is the form of God and she told the modern the society people are so intelligent so clever they have taken that particular form of God in syrama Krishna in picture in photo krishna's picture is very very holy holier than anything else so one must be careful keeping those pictures properly so sometimes some people will be printing in on any paper and then throw it one should not do that it is the God himself as we are keeping other holy relics ramakrishna's photo once you glance at that you are looking at God so one should keep all the time majority of our swamis they always follow that always keep the photo of bhagwan's ramakrishna Masha Radha and swamiji in their pockets so whenever they are getting the opportunity taking out and looking at it you are worshiping God so the God you are remembering all the time while traveling while sitting alone constantly you're remembering God and when you are remembering God your mind is becoming purified the moment the Mind becomes purified purification means absent or detached from the worldly objects you are free this is the only thing the majority of the people they do not understand they like to enjoy after life after the death also they like to enjoy as they are enjoying this life after the death also they want the same family their wife children grandfather grandmother so also they will get that but the temporary they will be there again and after some time again you have to come back and again you have to go through to those who are clever they understand it clearly the who are these and our relatives I am not connected with them we are all the reflections of the same God we are all small small tumblers the water pots and on our water the reflection of the same sun is coming and we are becoming father mother wife children we are thinking we are all attached and without them we cannot survive how come it is all reflection coming from the same now sometimes the chandelier that we see in the sundelia there are so many lights will be there lamps will be there and they are in the same and that that light the chandelier hundreds maybe and beautiful light they are giving together if they start thinking we are a family and we should live together it is like that all separate and all currents are electricity is also coming separately all the lamps are burning separately together it is giving life it is ok and making a beautiful Chandelier but they are all separate so Detachment Detachment detachment living with all and behaving that I am your own but knowing the truth I am all alone with God I am the reflection of God any time this body may break and the reflection that is within here should go back to the original nowhere else the life circle again if the desire is there then it will go again come back Hindus and Buddhists they strongly believe in the next birth again there is no chance if you have desired you have to come back you have to take the form and you have to enjoy the same thing that you are Desiring so be very very careful in this Desiring so that is the way we have to think we have to purify weaknesses are there different type of provocations are there but analysis that is the reason we should study panchamma Veda and very simple way bhagavan Cinema Krishna is teaching us I clearly noticed that a flame like thing came out of this this means his own body and followed him the God is with us if we are praying to God is also following with her so this is the incident that we are reading this this moment belguria Tarak he used to love bhagavan siddama Krishna pray to him then when he is going from the god the power is following him as a frame why he is mentioning this giving the indication God will be with you if you are praying to God if you are dedicating to God all responsibility God Will Take God will be always with the devotee a few days later Taro came back to dakshinesia in a state of samadhi he who dwells in this body placed his foot on tarak's chest so that is the blessings of the god well are there more youngsters like this so they were discussing that this is the thing that we must understand and and today we will conclude over here and because some of the maybe questions are there so we will conclude over here and when that person acts that whether the Incarnation of God having the desire the syrama Krishna mentioned smilingly I find that I have not got rid of all my desires there is a in a funny way he was mentioning but sirama Krishna was not having any any desire his only desire as the Incarnation of God was to help us the human being to go towards God at the very end of his life you know the human birth means there will be the diseases there's sometimes when there is a disease we say why we have worshiped God we have offered so much of food to him so much of donation we have given why this will come to me that is useless one should not talk like that because the body we are going to die the body is going to be destroyed we are not going to die our Consciousness that is always there so that is mentioned again that way in a funny way I have some desire as if he is trying to say the well you may consider that I am not an avatar I am not an incarnation friends we must be very very sincere and devoted at the feet of the bhagavan sirama Krishna those who have taken the initiation in his name and this time in the modern time this is the most purified name most powerful God all others are there but even as bhagavan Cinema Krishna indicated very correctly the money that was used by the Kings now it cannot be utilized maybe it is a golden the thing but you cannot use it as a exchange money the modern day things should be taken and the in this time those who are going towards the satta Yuga must follow bhagavan Krishna because he is the god who is taking us again back to Satya yoga thank you friends now let us see any question she has two two part question first is how to explain that is a our tiram Krishna himself the Lord himself has given a beautiful example a devotee he wants to see God in a form sometimes Krishna sometimes Rama so the that Supreme Lord who is all pervading but connect with it every mind received the message and if it is a genuine prayer he takes that particular form only to satisfy that devotee so that is why shakar Shakara means with form is for sha with the wheat form he manifests and sometimes someone says no I am the god him myself so that time it is a completely different there is no form so it is not that someone has to see the form to prove that he is a religious person no it is nothing like that sirama Krishna gave the example accepting the water as a formless god when a cool breeze making that water ice it is taking the form and again the Sun Ray is melting that eyes becoming water sun is the representative Sun raised is a representation of the knowledge analysis and Cool Breeze is the representation of devotion bhaktanam anukampuna in one of our scripture it says bhaktanam for the devotees to graze them to satisfy their desire brahmana the one which is all pervading with our form Rupa form kalpana it is kalpana means imagination it is not true that is why the Hindus they never fight with the forms the same Hindu will be worshiping goddess Durga with six hands and same Hindu will be worshiping Durga with 10 hands no problem so they don't fight why I like to see him goddess Durga with 10 hands I like to see God is Durga sitting on a tiger not on Lion the bengalis they worship durgaon a lion they say and ten hands but other northern part it is on the tiger no why I want to see this my imagination thank you so she's asking again part two second question to understand nirgun Brahman and I am also Brahman we say then to understand that all shakar forms can I say come of course see very nicely you have put it so that the in the bhagavan SRI Krishna in the bhagavad-gita it says one who sees me the supreme god sarvatra everywhere in the trees in the branches and human being and animals in Birds everything again all in me except God there is nothing except the Brahman the Consciousness there is nothing so when we think other things there is also the manifestation of the same thing you are very correct many becomes one and that is the ultimate goal thank you first is asking how can I love SRI ramakrishna more and more every day how can I make him the center of this life very good question so this way you have to study the biography of sirama Krishna and also the gospel of sirama Krishna and slowly slowly when the more and more and more you are studying you will see that first time when when you are reading one type of meaning is coming to you second time third time different more deeper and very clear manifestation will come as bhagavan Cinema Krishna here in the page 798 he mentioned if a man gathers his old mind and fixes it on me then indeed he achieves everything we discussed today this me the God is all pervading but when you look at the picture he's so humble so to love him we have to understand he is the god Supreme eager to help us eager to be with us we have only to understand this and pray to him pray O Lord make my mind purified so that I can understand you and oh Lord please hold my hand as my father as my mother so I should not go deviating from you so pray like that by his grace you will develop love for him thank you okay friends thank you for attending this class let us recite this Mantra and we conclude by [Music] ishavataram paramese [Music] to [Music]
