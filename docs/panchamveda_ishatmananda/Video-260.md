[261: Panchama Veda 261 : God Is The Only Giver](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGUlYp9QsKk)

good evening dear devotees and friends so this wednesday evening we'll be reading the the gospel of sirama krishna and then we'll analyze you know and let us begin with this wonderful stortra tabok [Applause] [Applause] the last class we were discussing about the self and god we were quoting from different upanishads and also the uh the about the god the definition of patanjali now the self is used the word self is used sometimes for supreme self paramatma and again for individual self jibatma then paramatma and jivatma both time the word english word self is used the jibatma is the reflection of the paramatma the moment one understand this truth one become free from the sufferings and enter into the realm of bliss so this is called the whole thing the religion only this much only to understand this that jivatma is the reflection of paramatma and this jivatma and paramatma the paramatma is the sum total and this is the complete and that is reflecting on the individual to this thing how to know this if we know then we are free but how to know this one is self-effort that is called sadhana tapasya spiritual practice another is god's grace that's called kripa now god can be realized only through faith bhagavan sirama krishna said and we studied that in the last week then he is talking with ishaan [Music] god can be realized only through faith and ishan said yes sir master suramar krishna continuing he said you practice religious rights japan fasting and the like that is very good if a man feels sincerely drawn to god then god makes him practice all these disciplines so this is a very good point to understand i want to do japan i won't be able to do unless the god wills that is the main thing even i cannot take the name of god if the god is not willing oh i will take the name of god and i will be purified purifying myself and it is not so easy the god's name also because it's a holy name even to take that name i have to pray to god that someone was telling i always pray to god please give me the strength and the mental condition so that i can repeat your name this many thousand times please help me to take your name that is the prayer otherwise this pure name of god is not so easy sometimes we think it is nothing we can just sit and take the name of god try it will be so difficult you won't be able to do it and so many other thoughts will come we can go on thinking about so many things except god so that is the we can say taking the name of god and then forgetting the other thoughts of the world here's a great miracle that is mentioning and everything as a very simple way he says this is very good that you are practicing japa and and the fasting and all that if a man feels sincerely drawn to god sincerely that is the word drawn to god then god makes him practice all these disciplines the devotee will certainly realize god if he practice them without desiring their results this is another thing to understand i am thinking that i am repeating the name of god for so many thousands of times and i surely realize god there's no chance so i should not even expect that god will reveal himself to me i am happy that i can take the name of god that's all there that is you have to give completely surrender to god and give complete freedom to god oh god i am taking your name so you should come and reveal thyself before me no condition like that no condition the one shannasi he wrote to maha saradamani devi the mother i am taking the name of god for so many times but still i don't see the god then the mother wrote to her you are a monk and you are supposed to take the name of god what else he will do whether the god will reveal himself or not that is up to god your duty is to go on repeating the name of god so two things i cannot repeat the name of god i cannot do the japan if the god is not willing if the god is not blessing me if the god is not helping me to do that this is one thing second when i am doing that i should be happy that i am taking the name of god i am able to take the name of god i should be happy for that not that the god will come and be for me i don't have i don't know any i don't have any conception about god how do no only i'm imagining god will be like this god will be like that we do not know the god will come in the form of sri rama or sri krishna or ganesha or these or that that is my imagination god may god may not that is up to him but am i getting joy after taking the name of god repeating the name of god i should feel that first i should feel myself blessed that i can do these and surely the god has blessed me and given me this power so that i can repeat the name of god and that will be my joy and afterwards god will surely reveal the devotee will certainly realize god that is the word of krishna the god himself he is telling the devotee will surely realize god if he practice practices the them without desiring their results then he is telling there are two types of devotion one is another is raga bhakti bhaidi come to become a monk or a nun we ask them to take the name of god and practice these practice that and we sometimes ask them are you doing that practicing that we observe them because this is a short of our training he or she may not be liking but as because they have come and then he is listening or she is listening and then following so that is called badi bhakti not from love not from out of on his own joy but as the system is there that this is the routine so i have to follow i am following devotion but because of the rules and then comes raga bhakti the raga bhakti is out of love he cannot stop taking the name of god thinking of god meditating on god because that is the joy so that is called raga there is complete satisfaction into that the swami vivekananda when the new young people they started joining the ramakrishna mission bellurmart in the and that this is on the other side of the ganga but near calcutta that the new people are coming and to make them to train them swamiji told you have to get up at four o'clock you have to go to the temple you must meditate for this time and this is for everyone senior junior everyone should go and meditate the most of the time the seniors they meditate into their rooms on their bed or in in their own arrangement but the juniors are supposed to go and sit in the temple so that the other others they can observe that every junior they have come in the morning time so now what happened the bhagavan sri ramakrishna's direct disciples they were there and there was latu maharaja and the rule was very strict swamiji was very hot tux master and he said if you fail to attain that if you can't come in the morning then you are not getting food from the asthma you have to go out for begging so that was the rule then one day latu maharaj swami advocate he protested and told naren it is not possible for me to meditate when you give the bell and immediately have to go and see it and meditate it is not possible for me swamiji then told that this is only for the juniors because unless and until they are following the discipline they won't be able to train their mind not for you but as because we all are here if we are not also doing the same thing the juniors will think oh it is only for us and they are sleeping so that is the reason so one is bhaiti bhakti another is raga bhakti but with great assurance in these two sentences he said that if one practices this then surely realize god now we will read the accounts of the november 9 1884 suramar krishna was in his room seated on the small couch and facing the east the devotees were sitting on the floor it was about midday when aim arrived and took a seat after saluting the master gradually other devotees began to gather and bijay krishna gosvami was there with several brahmo devotees the priest ran chakravarti was present also mahima charan narayan and kishari arrived a few minutes later master mashay used to go and see it and immediately used to take notes and who are the people see how surama krishna is sitting facing which side that also he has mentioned and then who are the devotees they are coming and gathering so this is the way he is giving all names for the authenticity the people afterwards this is only hundred years so afterwards maybe after 500 800 thousand years after people may doubt whether there is ramakrishna or is an imagination is there that is the reason he is giving every details and the names of those people so these are giving the authenticity it was the beginning of winter sri ramakrishna had felt the need of some shorts this is november so naturally it was cold not as cold as in chicago but it's cold over the air in calcutta and in those days because it was very open the the weather was different and had asked aim to bring them krishna is to take all those things from master mache besides two broad cloth shirts eem had brought another of a heavy material for which salaam krishna had not asked sirama krishna asked two shirts aim brought them and also another heavy one like a little coat so thinking that if the ramakrishna is wearing it you'll feel uh the comfortable the master is now talking to him master marshall salama krishna you had better take that one back with you you can use it yourself there is nothing wrong in that tell me what kind of shirt did i ask you to bring now krishna won't take anything extra so he told him to bring so he brought that was sufficient but sudama krishna is not ready to take the anything extra aim said sir you told me to get you plain ones you didn't ask me to buy the heavier one than salama krishna then please take that one back now salama krishna turned towards bijay and the others and said you see give me a shawl the maruari devotees also brought one for me i could not accept friends this is really master mashua was so blessed the sudama krishna he is asking himself sometimes the people they like to give it to god but god knows their mind sometimes some people they donate that they give things and from their own ego i am giving say like that the god will never accept that so given from the ego the god cannot accept or sometimes with some desire the i will give these things to the holy people so i will be free from my sin from this thing from that thing so all desires are also there so when you are giving one should give it love and also with respect swami said give or should kneel down with humbleness with love with respect then only the giving the charity that brings back the blessings of god otherwise the god himself is telling i cannot take i he couldn't take they came but i couldn't accept bijay interrupted the masters ramakrishna was continuing i couldn't accept he said immediately bijay said that is right sir if a man needs a thing he must accept it and there must be a man to give it who what a man will give now bijay made a mistake over here who what a man will give bijay meant that a person needs so he is accepting from another person that is necessary that is also a simple master took it in a completely si ramakrishna he said the giver is the lord himself this is the point when you are reading the gospel of sirama krishna the kathamrita so why i again and again i said this to myself this is really really like veda the giving the spiritual knowledge almost in every sentences suramar krishna immediately reminded bijay krishna gosvami was one of the spiritual leader of the brahma-samaj but here he made the mistake he is thinking a person will give to another person the person who needs it to naturally accept it but surama krishna is very clear everything is given by god the god is the only giver the giver is the lord himself then he said once a fakir went to the emperor akbar to ask for money the emperor was saying his prayers he prayed oh lord give me money give me wealth the fakie started to leave the palace but the emperor motioned to him to wait after finishing his prayer akbar came to the holy man and said why were you going away the phokie replied you yourself were begging for money and wealth so i thought that if i must beg i would beg of god and not of a beggar can you imagine that this is the way we should not take from those people so god is the giver and that is the reason sometimes some people even they like to give that is not coming to the right purpose many people are donating they are giving in charity but we don't know how that money is being used that is also very very difficult if that you're given money your donation maybe that you are giving in a right good faith that this money is going over here for these and that but you do not know how that money is being spent it should be spain for a good purpose then only the benefit otherwise the the charity that's a great thing in the spiritual life those who can donate they are donating after earning and that money they are giving so obviously they have naturally their ego and their hankering for something has been lessened they minimized so that they can give it that is the good thing but if that person you have chosen to give is not utilizing it properly not using it for the good thing that result won't come again so this is very subtle thing very difficult to decide so it is one should be very very careful even to choose a holy man even to choose up the place or the person to donate so that is what sadama krishna said but one who is receiving he should think that god is giving to me so sometimes the rich people they give and and the receiver began become almost like a beggar they become humble when they come and immediately they'll say oh please sir can't do this that nothing like that you have given so you are blessed that's all so these two things we have to in the behavior those who are accepting the monks and the nuns and the holy people the church and the holy organizations when they are receiving they should think god is giving us if you are not receiving we are not getting god is not willing that's all and those who are giving they should also think we are blessed that the god has accepted my the donation my charity this krishna he said bijay is now telling i saw a shadow at guya he did not take the initiative in anything one day he wanted to feed some devotees suddenly he found that all the the butter the fruits and other foodstuff had arrived from no one knew where this really happens this really happens because so many times this type of we can say the miracles happens in the life of the holy people the one that is the incident wonderful incident is there uh swami brahmanandaji and swami trianandaji they were meditating and practicing austerity in ayodhya on the bank of the river and that time that poverty was everywhere people themselves were not getting proper food so how they can feed the monks and others they were not getting proper food so somehow the one day turian ji maharaj went and got some like a potato type of things but not real potato so they brought it and then boiled and ate only that and that was terrible they could not eat and they could not digest they were feeling that itching inside their throat they were suffering then swami brahmananda prayed to bhagavan sirama krishna you and he was a son of a very rich man he was complaining to his god oh god you have taken me out of that house and now you cannot give me a little food how can i survive so when you love god you can talk to god in this manner it is not the god is far away and he is the punisher not like that god is my mother god is my father is so close to me i can naturally talk to god those who love god they can talk to god like this he was telling like that and then he said well i will accept you if you can give me some good food the luchi kichuri the kid they used to love to take food the kichuri and the next morning and the next morning they went to vade in the river the moment they came up from the river immediately one gentleman came and told the sir can you please come to my astrama he was also a monk and i'd like to feed you with the prasad that i have offered to my god sriram chandra they told ok so they went with then he gave the kitchen the both of them they were okay so they ate and they were very happy and afterwards they were asking can you please tell me tell us why you went to us and then you offered this food to us only then the person in a great devotion he said i am here for so so many years and my god is read chandra i'm meditating on sri ramachandra and praying to sri ramachandra to reveal that god before me only yesterday god came when i was sleeping not only that he woke me up i failed his touch then i woke up and he was standing and he told me my two devotees are there on such and such place and tomorrow you should cook the kichuri and offer to me and then you should go and bring them over here they the lord gave all details about you so there was no difficulty for me to recognize you two when they were coming back then the rajya maharaja the swami brahmanandaji disclosed the secret to swami turiyanandaji brother yesterday i prayed to sudama krishna and told him that he should feed me this so that i should believe him so this is the way the god always gives us the example that he is so near to us so close to us all the time he is with us so these are the miraculous way he is telling uh giving us that so the sadhu get everything the moment you have a good desire and you are wishing that this should reach out to each and every one and for the betterment of the people you get all the help so that is the way we should think then sudama krishna he is telling there are so there are three classes of sadhus good mediocre and bad the good sadhu makes no effort to get his food that means for himself he is not begging so sometimes in the organization we are requesting the devotees to donate but this is not for my personal purpose that we should have to understand a shady for his own thing should not be if the people are giving devotees are giving if he needs it is okay if not he should say the note is not necessary but he's not demanding or babing that is the begging for himself no and begging for god and for the work of god that is permissible and he's telling the good sadhu he is never begging he said the good and mediocre and bad the good shadow makes no effort to get his food and then medukar sadhu will knock the door of your house and say no mo narayana and that is the way salutation to god usually the monk when they go for begging and please give me some albums they don't say they say oh no the bhagavati means o goddess please give me some food so all the time the monks are begging are accepting from god or goddess so bhagavati viksam they he or the bad shadow starts core if he doesn't get his alms so naturally it is the good mediocre and the bad one they react accordingly the sadhu we have come here to become a monk become a sadhu the sadhu means as the ramakrishna give the definition whose whole body mind and soul has been dedicated to god only that is the position we are trying to reach there may be some shortfalls at the humanly weaknesses but it doesn't mean that every monks are bad this type of comments that is not good the people are trying to be good so that is the great thing and god can be realized through faith the last time that bhagavan said and what is that faith the god is there we have to believe that god is there and then how to believe why should we believe after the proof what are the proof there can be three one is direct understanding direct experience is called protection another is inference i see a very good person he's always loving others trying to do help others he's not having his the ego or a selfishness nothing is there so i can infer if the person meditating on god dedicated for god can become like this the god must be millions and millions time better than this person so we can infer in that way and can have faith in god another is so so direct experience it is not possible as because the god cannot be realized through our senses and second is after seeing the holy personalities and i can infer and third is the words of these holy people and called up the after means those who have realized and they have given this like bhagavatama krishna he said god is the only giver don't think that you are giving or somebody is else is giving so like that we when we read and we listen and we ponder we think and slowly slowly the faith comes there must be something that is the power the god and what is that god it is the active power of the supreme active power and that how to propitiate the power by japan and by reading the holy books and also doing all spiritual work like helping others thinking the praying for others like that so these are the things now it comes the sadhu the sadhu is also trying to do this but the standard some are very good advanced type they could control their senses and like that so they are good believing having the faith in the existence of god and now they are behaving like this second class they are also believing but they want something that they can't wait that the god will bring food for them so they go and beg in the name of god and from god um so like that a third one he could not transform himself so this is the third stealing some of the devotees thought that in that case they should not take any initiative either so the good wrongs not taking any initiative so devotees started thinking that we should not take any initiative master understood immediately as some of the devotees it is master marsha himself master masha himself is thinking that then in that case i am not going to take an initiative surely god will take care of me salama krishna could read the thoughts the sudama krishna immediately is telling but those who think that an effort is needed must make the effort so this is a very practical advice sometimes some people the thing that we will resign from the job and we will completely dedicate ourselves for the good work or to realize god no it is one should be very very careful before doing that those who are having the responsibilities must perform those things must fast fulfill all the duties that are the responsibilities that they are supposed to perform they must and the time will come it is not necessary that the moment you are free from all work that whole mind 24 hours you can think about god it is not possible and the frustration will come now i have resigned from the job i thought i can meditate for 24 hours now i cannot do and slowly slowly that effort will win down then what will happen the frustration will come so that is the reasons ramakrishna is telling as long as we are thinking the me and mine and i have some responsibility i have the duty i should be very practical and as possible i should take the name of god worship god and try to make the a fraud there is a nice story that is in the is a story there's a book where they talk about the devotee and tell it to us salama krishna said the bijay said please tell us yourself so you said now the salama krishna is telling no you tell it i don't remember it very well then he's telling one should hear these things at the beginning that is why i listened to them years ago you know the before the sadhana the this type of things that will increase the devotion one should listen and afterwards these are not necessary so that's ramakrishna is telling one should hear these things at the beginning beginning of the sadhana to inspire himself or herself and also to get the inspiration from the things that happened before like this that is why i listened to them years ago but now i no longer in that mood hanuman said i don't know the position of the stars or the faith of the moon i only think of rama the more and more one is developing in the spiritual life the whole heart the whole thought the whole being should be only about god only in god i cannot hurt others because god is dwelling in everyone so that is the that condition of the mind in the beginning sometimes they talk roughly with the people sometimes some monks they're otherwise they're good but as because the maturity into the spiritual life has not come they sometimes behave very roughly with people and they think that we are not attached to this so we can say like this that is not true the truth is one should be very very careful about choosing the word when we are talking with people one should not say anything that may hurt him or her those people the listener so what this is the mind very sensitive mind one should have those things then only he has made the progress at that time he doesn't need the inspiration from other stories he himself becomes the inspiration of others so that is the sign of spiritual growth the sudama krishna is telling this the chathaka bird craves only rain water even when it is dying of thirst it turns it back brick upward and wants only water from the sky the ganges and the jamunas and the seven oceans are filled to the brim but still it will not touch the water of the earth he is giving an example those who are depending on the god they only depend on god maybe the other things are there but they won't touch it they won't take it even though they are suffering but they'll only wait for the gods call rama and lakshmana visited pampa lake lakshmana saw a crow very eager for water again and again it went to the age of the water but would not drink lakshmi asks rama about it rama said brother this crow is a great devotee of god day and night it repeats the name of rama its throat is parts to be thirst but still it won't drink for the fear of missing a repetition of rama's name so that is the devotion one is going on taking the name of god unceasingly so we have read and it is recorded in the history of the ramakrishna mission after the passing away of the masters ramakrishna his direct disciples those who wanted to become monks and under the guidance of then also very young narendra not swami vivekananda because srirama krishna wrote and he told narendra that you must be the leader you should guide these young boys they should not go back to the samsara and to the family life and that that is the way siram krishna taught the naren and wrote naren will be the leader naren shikha debate etc now these young people where they will go they don't earn anything that some of the devotees they hire they rented a house that was a haunted house so they got it in a cheaper price in eight rupee or something eight rupee was not very the small amount in those days but anyway they were there now these young boys they used to compete among themselves about the meditation and the reputation of the name of god the one swami he was the young boy he was going on repeating the name of god and he stopped eating and drinking like this story that we read then what will happen another swami was there he was like the mother ramakrishna nandaji he used to cook for them is to offer that food to suramar krishna and then bring it too far and he will forcefully feed them that this swami told no i won't because when i'm eating i won't be able to take the name of god then somehow the he told if swami and our shivananda comes and touch me because shivananda is going on repeating the name of god he is always very pure then i will feel i am also repeating the name of god that type of sadhana that type of dedication and that type of faith in the words of the god so that is sadama krishna's disciple the practice here suramar krishna is quoting from the ramayana and the stories and he is telling on a full moon night i said to haladhari brother is it the night of the new moon all laughed full moon night naturally how could you say that and sadama krishna smiling yes it is true once i was told that the characteristics of a man of perfect knowledge is that he cannot distinguish between the full moon and the new moon but how could one convince alidadi of that then haladhari that the person you all know that he is to read the the old books of upanishads and all those books and used to feel that he is a man of knowledge you won't believe all this he said this is certainly the dark kali yuga he cannot distinguish the full moon and the new moon the people respect him he told sirama krishna that people should not respect you because even you cannot see the full moon so you couldn't understand that he was thinking that he has been gone crazy but it is not like that when a person in the deep mood he can't see he can't think other thing he's that's why suramar krishna he used to say that he will go and meet someone eat something some desire so that his mind comes back sometimes many of us we can feel that the day if make a very good meditation and after getting up from the seat you don't feel like talking with anyone or hearing any other things but suddenly someone will appear he doesn't know that you are coming from meditation hey how are you and what then you won't talk to him properly or sometimes you don't look at their face they may misunderstand it happens to the ordinary people like us but his mind was completely absorbed in the thought of god then he couldn't see the full moon and that is the sign of a perfect knowledge a man of perfect knowledge entered the room krishna respectfully kameen kameen said please take a seat to the bijay and other devotees in the static state of mind i cannot remember a date the other day there was a religious festival at bini paul's garden i forgot the date i can no longer remember the last day of the month when it is very auspicious to repeat the name of god he is telling these things to the devotees why to give that example that when your mind is completely absorbed and this type of behavioral pattern will come into you ordinary people may not understand these they may think like the haladay thought oh he is behaving very peculiarly he can't even when looking at the sky can't see the full moon in the full moon night so that is the type of people but sirama krishna wants to test the devotees also whether they believe his words are not so suramar krishna is telling to the bijay and others sidha krishna and then he said i can no longer remember the last day of the month then his ramakrishna remained thoughtful a few minutes then he said but i remember if a man makes an engagement to visit me so if people should not think that oh he has lost his mind so he cannot remember sometimes people at the when they become elderly salaam krishna was not very very old in the comparing with two days and he he passed away in 50 only 49 50. so you can understand when he is talking and it is uh the year it is only 1884. so naturally his age was almost 47 46 47 comparing is a very young man but when he is telling these he is telling because of these that people should not misunderstand those who have the complete faith and they have developed the spiritual experiences so they can understand sirama krishna it happens but others they may not so sadama krishna immediately i remember if a man makes an engagement to visit me a man attains this state when his mind is 100 percent absorbed in god his own condition that he is mentioning he is telling and he is telling that this is possible when one's mind is 100 percent observed in god when hanumana returned from siloam rama said to him you have seen sita tell me how did you find her hanumana said o rama i saw that only the body of sita lay there it held neither her mind nor her soul she has indeed concentrated her mind and soul to your lotus feet therefore i saw only her body in siloam so that is what the complete surrender to god sudama krishna giving the example of the mother sita his body is there our body is there but the whole mind their consciousness absorbed in the thought of sri ramachandra if you meditate on an idea you will acquire its nature if you think of god day and night you will acquire the nature of god a salt doll went into the ocean to measure its depth it became one with the ocean when is the what is the goal of book and the scriptures suramar krishna he is giving again this example and he gave the wonderful example of a salt dog we went to measure the depth of the ocean the made of that so when we are meditating on god we go and merge in god because we are from god we are the creation of god in reality this body and mind all these things vanishes and the only pure self that consciousness the feeling of tremendous joy because the source is the ananda source is the joy source is the bliss so when you go back to that we are so much immersed into that we don't like to come back even if when you are coming back our whole mind and our thinking are that only and that is exactly what suramar krishna is giving telling us giving so many examples hanuman example maasita example and now the salt doll melted into that ocean what is the goal of the books and the scriptures the attainment of god a man opened a book belonging to a sadhu and he saw the word rama written on every page there was nothing else so that when we read the book and sometimes we think that we must have to read this book that book and only to show and nothing else all books are having the same thing but that is necessary it is also gives us after we read all those and then from different angle we can understand oh this is the all books all scriptures are telling about the same truth that is the all-pervading consciousness and the power that we feel that god it is like this ramakrishna's example a bird was sitting on the mast of a ship and she was sailing the bard thought i will fly afterwards maybe it was sleeping over there and afterwards when the bird became aware that it has to go back to its nest it saw that it is only ocean water water everywhere it flew to the east to the west to the north to the south and came back every time not finding the earth then it sat on that and with a peace of mind now this ship will one day reach to a shore and then i will fly so that is the way sirama krishna again and again telling us there is god have faith in the existence of god and faith how can you develop just now as we were they're studying that we can develop the faith by seeing the holy people now here we were reading how sudama krishna is behaving he was he was giving the example from his own life the first sometimes some inspirational books some stories that inspire us to proceed in the spiritual life that we should read and in the beginning only and after that the effort should be only practice practice and practice that is surama krishna told that type of stories the books i already read and now it is not possible for me and why because i cannot even understand anything except god this world and this creation i forget i forget everything that is the condition then he gave the example of the hanumana hanumana forgot everything and he was only thought that hanumana was thinking his sri ramachandra he gave the example of mahasita she is there under the captivation of the rabana but her soul our mind are all at the feet of the sri ramachandra only the body was like a dead body she was there completely constantly thinking of sri rama chandra then he gave the example of the salt doll that that is also the same way sirama krishna is giving us this what the book learning the scripture after these the faith and we should meditate and constantly go towards that if a man loves god even the slightest thing tingles spiritual feeling in him sirama krishna said that chaitan nadev was passing a village he heard that drums were made from the earth of that place at once he was overharmed with ecstasy because the drums are used in kirtan so that is the the example extreme example caitanya mahaprabhu when he was passing a heart that earth is used up to make the one type of drum that's called coal and they play that they bid that when they are doing the kirtana the moment he heard that the earth is used for that particular musical instrument his mind went to the kirtana and what is that kirtana sri krishna the song is based on sri krishna his mind went to the krishna and whole mind from the earth used for the that particular musical instrument it takes the mind to krishna that is the very dry condition of the mind the moment there is this little spark immediately there will be the fire that is exactly what salama krishna is telling the friends we learned today that we must read book we must practice but the first thing we must pray to god to give us the desire to take his name to repeat his name bless us oh god so that i can meditate on you i can take your holy name repeat your holy name we have to pray to god and when we get that opportunity when we feel joy in taking the name we must utilize that constantly taking the name but if we have some responsibility that also we should perform and at the time same time repeating the name of god time will come when god will help us and the time when that condition will come when we will forget the whole thing including my body and the circumstances merging into the realm of that love of god that blizzard time when it comes that is the blessings of god and it will come because only taking the name of god and practicing the spiritual the discipline the god can be realized that is what suramar krishna said thank you friends thank you for today this evening so the first question is from srima vishwas she's asking when good and bad times come in our life is it also given by god see this is actually not given by god is the karma of allah as a hindu we always believe that the good and the bad work that we have done in our previous lives not in one life and so many lives we have lost and naturally those things are now we have to either enjoy or suffer now in the bhagavad-gita is telling no i don't give all the special the gift to anyone blessings or i don't curse anyone also i don't give any trouble it is your own karma fallout so there is karma paula the next question is from viman he is asking how spiritual thinking can enhance the mind of students uh you know that is the lives that are in them nowadays i don't know whether they are they have those books are not studying in the schools in every grade in every classes there are some moral teachings were there the beautiful stories the students when they are reading those stories and slowly imbibing the morality the how to stick to the truth how to behave with others how one should go forward to help others like these and that and slowly slowly the character is built because the thoughts and the thoughts transform into action and that makes the character so the spirituality means this is the way we can teach our students and can help them to grow as a human being thank you friends let us read this sloka and then we conclude is namaste
