[326. Panchama Veda (326) - “Why doesn’t man’s mind dwell on God?”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTpUVZo8Mv4)

namaskar dear devotees and friends this wednesday evening we'll be starting the panchama veda the gospel of krishna english page 777 and bengali the complete bengali the published by udbodhan got hamrita is 832. let us begin [Music] galam the if anyone is listening these words his mind will be purified the mangala what is that mangala that is the benefit of the spiritual benefit that we get our mind becomes purified how the mind becomes purified because at that time when you are listening the gospel of sudama krishna and we are naturally our mind is also thinking all those the worldly things that is associated with our selfishness cannot come into the thought by that way our mind becomes purified adi shankaracharya says that the purification of mind is essential for spiritual growth the mana shuddhi karanam that is a very important thing but how to purify the mind by withdrawing the mind from the same subjects and the easiest process to withdraw the mind from the saints objects listening or reading the gospel of krishna it is of so fascinating so enchanting and so attractive way it has given us the spiritual teaching now we were reading at the house of the balarama and girish bhagavan sirama krishna is sitting with some of the devotees and they are discussing and not only that only srama krishna is speaking they themselves among them also they were discussing and sudama krishna is listening and then sometimes rectifying them correcting them in a very special wonderful way not hearting them and the very modern psychological teacher psychology teacher as they do it similarly is rectifying their defense and helping them to understand the thing correctly because spiritual thought is completely different when we always think we think uh with the five things only and the chakshu karunanashi kajuba tag the eye the nose the tongue and all with that only whatever we can perceive we think in that way our thoughts are that expressions are also there so we cannot go beyond these five but these five is under the limitation of the maya we will come to the discussions of the maya and master is saying in this way a devotee one reflected sun but there certainly exists a real sun the master to girish what remain when that pot is broken that we we heard in the in our previous reading that we heard that suramar krishna was giving the example of the jibatma and the paramatma the paramatma is like the sun and jibatma is the reflected sun reflecting on the water that has been kept in the containers maybe the ardhan containers but suramar krishna was telling suppose the one the 100 earthen pots are there full of water and each and every earthen part is having the reflection of the sun now if you break one what happens nothing so actu this is all reflected so this is the way it goes goes and goes then he is telling suppose nine reflected sons but the certain certainly exists the real sun a devotee is giving them master all right suppose you break nine parts how many suns do you see now the devotee one reflected sun but there certainly exists the real sun then the master to girish what remains when the last part is broken then giri says the real son said when he says like that the master immediately no what remains cannot be described now the we are telling the real sun real sun reals on what is the real sun it is just giving that example that of course the sun and reflection we can say when all the reflections are broken the parts are broken no reflection there then the real sun one real sun but here the real son means sudama krishna wanted to say that is the atman the brahman that's why he says what remains cannot be described what is remains how will you know there is a real sun unless there is a reflected sun i consciousness is destroyed in samadhi so this is a very subtle point in virantha vedanta it takes us to the oneness and what did that oneness if we have a conception that there is one big light and i as a jivatma the individual soul the small light going and merging into that one light and one light remain that is also we think that in the conception of time space and causation that is also not there what remains it remains swami vivekananda he said in one of his poem that realization it is there usti that feeling is there that much so see how perfect he is he and he never read all this in sanskrit all the scriptures no punisher no vedanta nothing is his own realization and the tallies with all the punishers upon issues that was composed the revelations of the truth in the minds of the rishis which was 4 000 years before 3 000 years before which they recorded afterwards same thing without reading without having any idea of that when it is coming in in the truth that is in the mind of the bhagavatama krishna that proves that those truth discovered by the rishis thousands of years ago are true the surama krishna is the pramana purusa so that he is proving the truth improving the scripture so here we find in this way a man climbing down from the samadhi to the lower plane cannot describe what he has seen there it was late in the evening and lambs were burning in the drawing hall the ramakrishna was in a spiritual mood the devotee sat around him the master in the ecstatic mood there is no one else here so i i am telling you this he's telling the truth about himself and he was so conscious because the people suddenly they have come don't have the background of spirituality if they hear it they will misunderstand in a different way so that is the why that's why he is telling the i am telling you this because other people are not there he who from the depth of his soul seeks to know god will certainly realize him he is telling it with the all conviction to whom the people those who are sitting over there almost all of them they believed that there is god and that's why bhagavan si ramakrishna is telling them he who from the depth of his soul seeks to know god will suddenly realize him he must to look at it when sometimes we doubt whether there is god whether we will be able to realize god or not sudama krishna is giving us the complete assurance there is god one can realize god but he has to be sincere and not only that a sincere seeker of god will really surely realize he must he said he must he alone who is restless for god and seeks nothing but him will certainly realize him now what is that realization those who are going towards the god it depends on their conception also some people they like to see god in this way they have to god in that way they realize that because he is the repository of everything so that is there but one thing is very common he is pure purity and what is that purity it is love the love is the purity full of love and when there is love there is unselfishness so that is the reason swami vivekananda said unselfishness is god in whatever aspect we go to god maybe from the dualistic aspect the god is like this as a krishna as a rama as a ganesha as a kali so whatever may be the aspect but when you reach over there the feeling that comes oh my god is mother kali but she's full of love she's full of unselfishness my god is krishna full of love and unselfishness so love and unselfishness these two great qualities will surely be there when one realizes god realize him those who belong to this place that is bhagavan in the inner circle of the master have already come the bhagavatam krishna when he is mentioning these or they have already come the inner circle and that is nine nine eighteen eighty five or so ah he is mentioning in this way and eighty six is left his body so obviously all those inner people they have already come it was 1885 april the ramakrishna's mentioning and 1886 he left his body so obviously those who were very close to him through through them he wanted to spread this wonderful message they already come so he said those who belong to this place this place is not telling me have already come those who will come from now on are outsiders such people will come now and then the divine mother will tell them do this call on god in this way so this is the way now that we are coming to him and one of the very senior swami the direct disciple of bhagavan sirama krishna he mentioned the sea we saw him we were with him the god in that human form so we were attracted to god it is not much but you people you have not seen him you have not spent days with him but still you love him you like him you like to realize god you are blessed the god has given you that the very pure mind the attraction of this world you are not now leaving and trying to to go towards god it is so difficult so that is why they say those who came afterwards there are more fortunate because they came only by hearing the name of that lord by reading about him by knowing about him so this love attraction is more pure more powerful but surama krishna is telling inner circle means the message that he wanted to give he first lived and proved then gave those message to those people who were able to carry those messages the 16 direct disciples of bhagavan srirama krishna each and every one of them they were pure souls sometimes some people they like to know which book we should read the life of the direct disciples of siddha krishna apart from the life of biography of siddha krishna mashaladha shami bibay kananda another 15 direct disciples the unique life the wonderful the they are coming in contact with this ramakrishna and how slowly they are transforming that inspires so he is telling the inner circle now he is mentioning why doesn't man's mind dwell on god why doesn't man's mind dwell on god and he is giving the reply you see more powerful than god so he is telling why doesn't man's mind dwells on god you see more powerful than god is his muhammad the more powerful than god as if he's trying to give the so if we take this in this way oh the god's power is more powerful than the god no that will be uh it's a wrong way of understanding he's trying to give the the empress upon our mind that the power of god is so powerful as if god is also bound by that he is telling in this way the muhammaya and he is telling his power of illusion muhammad rama said to narada i am very much pleased with your prayer ask a boon of me narada replied o rama may i have pure devotion to your lotus feet and may i not be deluded by your world be switching maya rama said be it so ask for something else narada replied no rama i do not want any other bone this is the challenge the god always naturally everywhere when you are trying to recruit someone they all to give someone something some certificate so obviously there will be some process of judgment examination very carefully they will judge you examine you then only they will give you now we are going to realize god or the brahman or the atma gyana as they say in sanskrit the knowledge of the atman the knowledge of the oneness and we are going to go beyond the circle of birth and death all the six changes we are going beyond that the birth and the growing and the decaying and the death and all this the changes circle we are going to go beyond that and naturally there will be a terrible a very difficult examinations and who is doing it god himself and what is that trying to allure you with all these worldly things the what do you want to have the one young man went to the yama and he was telling can you please tell me that whether truly there is atman people are confused they are debating on that that there is something which is constant there is atman and some people say no see we are just the birth and the dead that is the only truth we know and why you think about other so all these debates are going on and you the yama the the god of death you're standing on the threshold of both the life and death you must be knowing what is true you are the best teacher oh lord can you please tell me and you know those who have read that great upanishad katopanisha the yama at the first three bones he offered and first two he gave immediately but the third one the moment he asked give me the knowledge of brahman the atman the eternal immediately he started telling hey what you are going to do with that rather you take all this look at this wonderful thing enjoy it i will give you a long life but these young men refuse to accept that so when we are trying to develop our spiritual life then the god will give us many other things the rich people will come and they will be your disciples they'll be touching your feet they'll be offering lot of money and many other things and many people will be clapping and following you and slowly slowly you'll be deluded and that is the last huddle if one can restrain then only the last hurdle he can jump it can cross it can scale otherwise it's very difficult again go back to the square one the terrible thing so this maya bhagavan sirama krishna is mentioning this powerful maya what is that maya delusion what is the delusion clappings of the people appreciations of the people and all they will come and say you are the best you are the good and that makes that person mad and look at this world you can see they behave very peculiarly they think they are the only person is it millions and trillions of people are there they got only one opportunity what special quality there but this because the all people around him they started telling you are the best they also start thinking i am the best and this ego is the act of maya so friends the it is very difficult to explain maya but shankaracharya in his great work that the pba kuchuramani he mentioned and 108 one zero eight words of the bible kachoramani the sloka there he is mentioning is trying to give the definition of first word is using object unmanifested and how you will explain about thing which has not manifested yet so object nominee the power of the supreme lord anadi-avidya and what is this power avidya nissan's ignorance abhidja in the yoga satsra they say these are the five caller means ignorance asmita the ego raga attachment dwisha abortion vinnie vaisha and the fear of death so all these five these are called avidya and this anadi it is beginningless means beginning is beginningless as a supreme trigona 3 guna you know that those who are the students of vedanta and in hinduism you always say they will be talking about the three gunas sattva raja and tama and satya is the best good tama is the lowest raja in between mixture of these two the satya raja and tama these are the three qualities mixing these three qualities permutation and combination the whole universe these three only not that many variety only three and then he is having another two power what is that it has the power to cover the original the truth and superimposing some unnecessary untruth falls on that truth this to power abharana and bikshepa avarana the sanskrit word means covering abharan covering and big shaper is throwing something imposing something on that these two power comes from the maha maya is a very bad person but i start liking that person loving that person i know all these things that he is doing are bad but still something happened in me i start developing friendship with him and his company ultimately i suffer because of that company because of whom by mistake i thought is a friend and even the ideologies we follow some of the ideologies some people are coming and talking see we are suppressed we are oppressed we have to go and fight and kill and this way that way god wants us to go and kill god has created everything so that one the person whom i am going to kill also the creator of god if i have something so i can against him then that is separate but why in the name of god why in the name of religion but still thousands of people are motivated by that if you ask them comments please see it over here and meditate how many will come very few but if you give the call oh my friends see our religion is in difficulty please come and let us go and fight with them you'll find find so many followers why because of the ignorance knee science and that is maya so how the maya is proved he says karjanumi it is inferred from the effect what is that effect all bad things that we do wrongly thinking that is the very good thing i am doing that is the problem if you know that i am doing something bad and you do the bad for your own purpose that is a different thing knowing that as the best thing that i am doing thinking in that way you are doing the wrong thing so that is the act of the maya karjanum karja anumiya anumiya means inference how through the karya through the effect great people intelligent people educated people they also make this great mistake so why they are deluded why can't they understand this answer is maya so this is karayanumiya sudhi o eva the sudhi means those who have realized it understood it they are called sudhi the realized souls and after understanding it realizing it they are telling this from where this jagat servam everything that you see is from where it has come so what is this universe the creation of maya is a fully illusive illusion but for us those who are under the spell of the maya is very much correct very much true very much real very much adorable but the go and see the pages of the history that proves again and again that it has all gone but still we don't like to understand that one after another whoever gets the chance to rule the country he thinks that i am the king and i can do anything i like wrong because that is the time he should be humble the thoughtful very composed because this is an opportunity that i have got the let me do best as possible for been beneficial for each and every one and by that way when i am doing it i should be humble because i got the opportunity anyone could do it not that i have been elected as the king that i am the only person no but we almost kneel almost nailed very very few microscopic personality we can say they will be able to understand why they are not idiots they are very intelligent people courageous people very successful people why then they cannot understand it maya there's a very peculiar power of god that deludes people so 108 words of the biblic churmani and also ninth one i am not quoting that there's the shankara will mention so what is the cause of creation maya so vedantin they use the word maya to explain this creation this is the most difficult question the who has created this universe and how he has created how it is sustaining what is the goal of this creation what is going to happen at the end of this creation these are the very very difficult questions and eternally it has been asked and eternally the philosophers tried to answer in a different way that's why so many different paths the philosophy of so many different philosophies why there are so many varieties a different way they are thinking to get the answer some people say don't ask question because the god has created this and from the monday to saturday he worked and sunday he took the rest another group came and told no no no he worked completely different way he worked from sunday to friday sunday monday and like that up to friday saturday he took rest third group white saturday he took rest on friday so from saturday he started working from saturday to thursday friday is the rest time so some people they will close everything and they'll say this is the rest day on the friday some people will say saturday and some people will say sunday but when the god was creating whether he was tired by creating that is the main question because he just think and every creation comes there is no light and the god said let there be light there was light that is the way it is created just he thought but the question is why he thought no no one can ask this question that is absurd no one can ask this question why he thought in the vedanta also he says i am alone i like to be many a thought came and where there was equilibrium tranquility no changes and suddenly the changes started coming where sattva these three qualities it got activated then immediately as if the white color started spreading then the red color also started spreading then the black color started pre spreading so like that sattva is represented by white color raja by red color tama by black color so as if the three colors started and that started spreading then they came and they started mixing and in the vedanta they will say panchi karanam the panchi karanam means they will be mixing the original one will be the one half and the others will be the other one eight so by that way it will be a full so these these these this first was the thought it is all subtle when you think the subtle thing just thinking then slowly it come out as a word and when the word comes from there the actual the things started stuller stuller means the gross the gross thing started coming up so first is the cause what is the cause and then the cause is turning into the second effect the sukshma the subtle then the third is only the gross i thought that i will construct a house thought but where the thought came in the first in my mind and immediately i started collecting fond and then the engineer the drawing the permission and slowly slowly first it was the thought then finally it came as a manifestation so this is the three way it works but three the good mixture of good and bad and bad these three qualities also started coming so all this the details are there those who are interested you can read the how the vedantin they explain the different religion different philosophy in different way they are trying to tell about the creation because that is still it is no one could say this is but the vedanta says the most accurate answer is maya why if the god has created this universe how he has created the material is necessary what was that material if it is a gross material that was already existing along with the god god when the god was created eternal you cannot ask when the god was created it is eternal so does it mean the matter material out of which this world has been created was also it that way same way they like the god it was eternal then the two existences are there that cannot be one is god another the matter no that cannot be so how it is possible in this way when we are thinking we will understand the vedanti are telling in a very most almost accurate way why they say it was the thought only and the thought started taking form because god's power god's shakti the power started manifesting so it says me unmanifested manifested we can always go and see anything that is manifested we know we can go and touch we can explain about it we can taste it and we can give the name nothing is there completely unmanifested and this is the power of the god and when it came it is with the god because of the power of the god if the god is eternal his power is also eternal the moment the god was there the power was also there when god was there eternally this power is also eternal anadi na aadhi anadi but this is obedia why if this is truth bidda and abit there these are the two two different words they always say bidda means knowledge the moment you know that god is only existing then there will be no creation the moment you know that you are dreaming then there will be no dream so that is the way when i am dreaming i don't think that i am dreaming when the thought comes that i am dreaming then dream breaks so i am completely under the spell of the dream and that is the time i go on thinking and very genuine way actual way these are all things are happening when when all that is over when i get up when the dream is broken then only i can oh judge ah that was not true unnecessary i was afraid of a tiger there was no tiger it was only imagination but i was afraid how i will know that i was afraid because i perspired when i was sleeping even then as if i was running speedily so whole body was sweating so much of sweat that is proof that i was really afraid of a tiger in my sleep my sweat is the proof that is that's why you say karjanumiya karya means the effect that has come had i not been in that situation why unnecessarily when i am sleeping and in an air-conditioned room no question of sweating but as because the sweating was there that means i was really afraid of so i thought oh i was seeing the dream and it's true i'm sweating all over still my heartbeat and so it has increased still i am afraid i think somebody should be there in my room so all these effect shows proves there so karjanumiya the maya is just like that how i will know the maya was there the courier the effect so and these maya is also known as the beginning it's called karna sharida so again i will just mention though we were reading the gospel of sirama krishna but this braghavan srama krishna's word is always connected with the different scriptures and if we have some basic idea of the pedantic the values and the vedantic terminologies and the way of explanation it will be easy to understand bhagavan sirama krishna he mentioned that those who be this he who from the depth of isn't here why does doesn't man man's mind dwell on god that was the question why doesn't man's mind dwell on god then he said it is because of the power more powerful than the god as if muhammad so why our mind is not on god because of the maya what is the mind that we are discussing and we have come to another state that is called the three bodies are there stulla sharida shukshma the students of vedanta they all know these terminologies stula means close body and we know what is this the bone the marrow the blood and all those things are called stool shadida and that is exactly what the doctors are checking examining and giving the medicine about this we all know then most of us are also aware about the shuk-shma sharira what is the shukshma inside the gross body there a subtle body is also there and mainly in the subtle body is the prana is there it says sukshma or linga sharida though that is a vedantic terminology and vedantic way of karma these are the total is called sukshma and when we die we believe the hindus they believe when we die this subtle body it goes away taking all the impressions so that it can carry on the effect of the karma the work that we have done in the next life so if this is also possible now if don't like to believe don't believe but this is what the hindus they say otherwise you cannot answer many other questions but whatever the shareer the gross body about which you all know then the sukshma sharira that is inside us and that is also subtle and in that subtle body we are aware about the mind if not other things we are all aware about the mind and now it is because of the tremendous pressure for different type of pressure because the competition is so much so obviously people they go to the psychologists to the doctors who are handling the mind so we are aware about the mind the maid that maybe the children are not but the grown up all they understand the mind the mind is the cause of our suffering and mind is the cause of our joy then when we are happy where it comes in the mind the thought and we think we are happy body only react accordingly body don't understand the suffering or joy or happiness nothing it is in the mind body only goes along with that it effect comes on the body the sukshma and stuller the gross body and the subtle body which we can say in one word the mind the sukshma the subtle body the mind okay up to this then what is the cause the causal body the hindus they go very deep up to the root they say sukshma sharidad is the gross body and before that it was a subtle body it was taking the form and then it must be a cause is there a reason is there otherwise why at this causal body it says muhammad the maya is the cause that's why in the shatter shatter upanishad also not only shankara in his that book it is so that is the reason from that what is that maya prakritim biddhi what is that prakriti satya raja tamaguna and the abharana bikshepa all this is called prakriti but the word prakriti that has been used by the sam kapilazapi and the prakriti of the maya prakriti or maya of the vedanta it is little different because the they say the though inert but that prakriti is separate from the the actual the consciousness but the vedanta say no it is the power of the god that's why it says the it is associated with the maheshwara mayam to prakriti my name to mahesh who is the master of that power maya is a power which is the master of that power maheshwara means the god the supreme god and the supreme god has no form always they when they say maheshwara though the shiva is known as maheshwara but in reality maha ishara is not having any form it is that consciousness it has all power and from that everything has come to baptism it's all this jagged this manifested universe that you see because of that and that's why it says karana sharida that is the causal body the sukshma sharira or the linga linga means that we can say a symbol so thula these are the three the body and because of the karuna sharira the maya because in the maya all this power came and with that power it took that subtle form i should do i should work and then the work is this universe this world now bhagavan sram krishna when he is talking with his devotees he mentioned about these so why doesn't man's mind dwell on god you see more powerful than god is is maha maya and his power of illusion everyone under the spell of this world beswitching maya when god assumes a human body he too comes under this pill rama wondered about weeping for sita and that is the again and again that we find then the bhavanath he will be asking some question before that we can conclude this the why our mind is not dwelling on god the god is the source of joy god is the source of eternity god is the source of knowledge and these are the three things that we need we like to survive we like to know we like to enjoy and if we go to god we get this three but we why we can't because the power of god now the question is who can control the power of god god himself so that is the reason why we are worshiping god meditating on god praying to god what is the reason because we want god to help us to control his power the master of the dogs they are very ferocious dogs are there but the moment the master give the whistle immediately they are calm quiet you can just pass even you can pat the dogs they won't do anything because the control of the master so the god is the master of this terrible power which is binding each and every one of us and then throwing us into the circle of birth and death again and again and when we are old then we understand how much suffering in this life when we were young obviously no one could understand but when we are old we become the body is not cooperating mind is not cooperating all around people whom we thought our relatives and friends and so close we used to love them they all go away slowly slowly no one comes to me we all understand these again and again on the death bed we are all alone that we know very much even those people who whom we love so much will they accompany me along with my death no that is not possible so that again and again when we are understanding that when the birth and the death in that circle so many sufferings are there and for the little joy we are thinking that we will be able to understand we are wasting our time now why we have understood today that it is because of the maha maya the power of god and who can control the muhamaya god himself now the surama krishna just one line before he said anyone can realize god anyone it is not the language or the family or anything the place of birth nothing no time nothing anyone anytime anywhere they can realize god if they are sincere and how the sincerity will come they will give away all the creation of god which is constantly learning earth luring us attracting us alluring us from god we have to say like the nachiketa no enough is enough oh lord keep all your things with you i only want you i only want to know you immediately the god will blow the whistle and the terrible maya which was pouncing on us will stop and we will realize god now the bhagavan abram the guard of a railway train shorts himself of his own will in a carriage but he can get out whenever he wants to the bhabha that young young man after listening this he gave an example because he heard it from sirama krishna because he is coming and he is hearing say he gave that an example is the avatar the sri rama or sri krishna sri ramakrishna now at our time they themselves came they are gods they came in the human form as if that the mast as the bhavanath is telling the guard of the rail so he can put it put him in in any any place and close the door and see it but anytime he can come out the master ishwara koti's divine incarnation for instance can liberate themselves whenever they want to it will be better the bhavanatha was talking about that the guard of the railway rather we can say in the jail and if you go to the jail you will find the superintendent of the jail he is the master of that any time he can go in any time he can come out and white superintendent only other guards also because they are going of their own and when the duty is over they are coming out no one is going to stop them but the inmates but the prisoners those who are there they cannot come out unless and until all things are over they won't be able to come out we are also like that we come in a body but we cannot go out of this creation unless and until we understand the creator and then we merge with the creator so that is the whole process of religion the bhagavad-gita says in these not only the abatharas but also ishwara courtes they are also not the abhothara the avataras are the power of god god himself taking that human form ishara cotis a very pure soul but they come to help the avataras in their spiritual work that this ishara kotis the divine incarnations for instance can liberate themselves whenever they want to but the jebucities cannot what is the jibakati the jebucis are we jiva the individual self because of our desire we like to see this we like to see that you like to have this have that all these desire these are for the worldly life and when these worldly things whatever little thing that you want we are bound the jivas are imprisoned but by the last and gold that is the problem when the doors and windows of the room are fastened with screws how can a man get out baba not smiling ordinary men are like the third class passengers on a railway train i don't know maybe this babunath was traveling in a train so all the constantly he is thinking about that so he in those days in the third class passengers the the railway the girl will come and close it when the doors of the compartments are locked they have no way to get out you know this is you know 19th century beginning at that time the very new introduction of the railways those systems were there perhaps that you cannot open the door and like that the girish is mentioning if a man is so strongly tired hand and foot then what is his way master is telling he has nothing to fear if god himself as the guru cut the chain of maya cut the chain of maya who can do it god as guru the guru means a guide a person who is traveling or has already travelled that path now he has learned and obviously he is now passing that powerful mantra the initiation through initiation to other people and this is very simple only the repetition of the god's name thinking about god and slowly purifying the mind and becoming completely detached from the worldly attachments things will be there all around us since we are have taken birth till death all things will be there around us people will be there and property will be there everything that we see which is necessary for a human being but we are not attached to that we will we can say well it is enough i like to go back this is that will be sufficient so that is possible through the guru and guru is that god it's not the human guru always we think that human guru no the human guru is giving the power of the divine guru which is god himself because the power of god is maya again and again we have discussed that the god and his power that is the cause of creation we are the part of creation the god has given us the one gift that we can think we can understand and then we heard that if you are not going back to the source the god the owner then you have to go on suffering this much we have now we apply our intellect which has been given by the god himself the sastra the scripture has taught us intellect has been given by the god to discriminate to understand that to analyze that after the analysis we decided it is enough that we should go back and then where we will go to god only through whom through human gurus but if we take the human guru by mistake that particular person as god then there is a mistake the guru is god and all our hundred percent dedication should be to god by that way we can realize god thank you friends and is there any question bob is asking when christians when christians go to heaven they are united with family that has gone before in hinduism do we ever get to see family again there is a conception bob there is a conception that the some people those who like to go to their ancestors to their family that they can go over there that's called pitri loka in sanskrit they call pitri means ancestors the pitri loka loka means where they all are there so that is the conception they may go but you know according to this is all like the waves of the mind so the what is the family the same wave so naturally they go and they they meet over there that is one type of course in hinduism also it is there they go over there they can meet mr keshe is asking is it possible to choose between vidya maya and avidyamaya rishikesh this is of course most of us almost all of us it is no we have chosen by mistake wrong choice the abita maya the abhidya it is also maya the now we are trying to go back to bitter with those binds but it is better and then from there we can go beyond the both that is the process of spirituality dave john is asking what might be the cause that god thinks about creation of this universe devjani this is a very difficult question that you are asking and swami vivekananda also replied that we are bold enough to say we do not know because when the god thought and why he thought no no one can think in that way the only they say as if a wave came and he comes that i am the only ones existing and i'd like to be maini there are many other quotations are also there i like to be mainly and through his power that is the wave the thought came and then through the power of maya satya rajatam as we all discussed over here all this creation came the next question is akshay is asking can a jiva koti become ishwar koti it's very difficult because in other places also bhagavan sirama krishna said the jeebuckety cannot become ishwara karti ishwarakati means it is the god you know in different forms it comes but it all depends on god only the suppose the gibberity is going and merging with that of course we cannot say in this way suppose a drop of water falling in the ocean it is becoming the ocean now again from that ocean to the vaporization it goes back to the sky as a cloud and then come back as a droppable then whether that drop a big drawbam that is the ishara koti if we think if it is the same water we do not know but bhagavan sirama krishna said jiva karti because they are very small container they cannot think in that way they cannot become isharakot it is a god's chosen ah a very few very pure souls but of course anything is possible for god thank you sonu is asking would like to know the difference between bhairav and sannyas oh sano actually bahiragi you know the samyak the word samyak means complete total nyasa means giving up the samyak nyasa completely giving up is called sannyasa what completely giving up ego it's not the body it is not the clothing it is not these are that is the ego when one can give up the complete ego then he's a sannyasi and badagia is the process slowly giving up that is the i don't want the name fame money physical comfort i want god that is that process called extreme that is called sannyasa thank you thank you friends let us conclude with this [Music] [Music] is [Music] [Music] namaste
